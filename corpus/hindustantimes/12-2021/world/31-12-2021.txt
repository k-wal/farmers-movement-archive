The speed with which the Taliban captured Kabul on August 15 caught the US administration by surprise.SUU KYI IN HOUSE ARRESTMyanmar was plunged into crisis when the military staged a coup and overthrew civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her government on February 1, triggering daily protests in towns and cities and fighting in borderlands between the military and ethnic minority insurgents. More than 1,300 people have been killed by security forces so far, according to a local monitoring group. The military arrested the Nobel Peace Prize laureate on multiple charges of corruption, violations of a state secrets act, and a telecom law, as well as incitement and for violating Covid-19 rules. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for at least 15 years in the past two decades.FIRST NFT-BASED ART WORK AUCTIONEDOn March 11, Christie’s auctioned a JPG file for $69 million ( ₹513 crore), catapulting its creator — digital artist Mike Winkelmann, who goes by the name of Beeple — to instant worldwide fame. The digital artwork, titled Everydays —The First 5000 Days, comprises all the works of art that he has made over the course of 13 years.

Ingenuity rose to a height of 10 feet (3m) and then touched down after 39.1 seconds. For the second flight, which lasted 51.9 seconds, Ingenuity climbed to 16 feet (4.8m), hovered briefly, tilted and then accelerated sideways for seven feet.CAPITOL CHALLENGEDHundreds of supporters of former United States president Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol, the seat of the Congress (legislative branch of the federal government), on January 6 in a stunning bid to overturn his election defeat. The mob battled police in the hallways and delayed the certification of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory for hours. Five people died and more than 700 people were charged in the attack. The siege came after Trump’s relentless efforts to negate the results of the democratic polling process, and led to a further divide within the Republic party itself.ICARUS MOMENT AS PROBE PIERCES CORONAA Nasa spacecraft officially “touched” the sun for the first time, plunging through the unexplored solar atmosphere known as the corona. The Parker Solar Probe actually flew through the corona in April during the spacecraft’s eighth close approach to the sun. Launched in 2018, Parker was 13 million kilometres from the centre of the sun when it first crossed the jagged, uneven boundary between the solar atmosphere and outgoing solar wind. The spacecraft dipped in and out of the corona at least three times, each a smooth transition, according to scientists.STUCK SHIP THROWS TRADE OFF COURSEOn March 23, the Ever Given, one of the world’s largest container ships, became wedged across a southern section of Egypt’s Suez Canal for nearly a week, blocking one of the world’s busiest trade routes. The canal links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. About 12% of all global trade goes through it. The blockage lasted till March 29 causing oil prices to soar. The reverberations were felt even months later as delays in supply chains continued.COP OUT AT COP-26 AS WORLD LEADERS DITHERUnited Nations climate talks, which took place in November in Glasgow, Scotland, ended with a global agreement that aimed at least to keep alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, and so maintain some chance of saving the world from catastrophic climate change. After two weeks of often fraught talks, delegates agreed to reduce the use of coal, end “inefficient” fossil-fuel subsidies and boost their climate targets sooner. Measured against its own objectives, COP26 did not deliver and left environmentalists disappointed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/important-2021-events-internationally-101640959153836.html
31-12-2021||World||Biden, Putin exchange warnings in phone call over Ukraine||US President Joe Biden and his Russian Vladimir Putin on Thursday exchanged warnings in a call about Ukraine, which was described by officials as “serious” and “substantive” by officials.In the 50-minute call, which was requested by Putin, Biden warned the Russian leader of “serious costs and consequences” if there is an invasion of Ukraine, while, Putin warned Biden of a “complete rupture” in ties if the US imposed sanctions on Russia.“President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a readout of the call.A senior Biden administration officials told reporters in a background call that the American leader essentially laid out two paths for the Putin. A path of diplomacy in which Russia would use existing channels of diplomacy to resolve its issues with Ukraine.“The other is a path that’s more focused on deterrence, including serious costs and consequences should Russia choose to proceed with a further invasion of Ukraine,” the official said, adding, “And those costs include economic costs, include adjustments and augmentations of Nato force posture in Allied countries, and include additional assistance to Ukraine to enable it to further defend itself and its territory, as we’ve laid out previously.”The American leader also made clear on the call that all his actions on this issue will be taken in consultation with allies and partners on the principle of “nothing about you without you”.  “No conversations about issues that are of ultimate concern to our partners and allies without the full consultation and participation of our partners and allies,” the official said.This was the second call between the two leaders in a month and came amid rising tensions between the two countries over Russian military buildup along the border with Ukraine, which has raised the spectre of another invasion, similar to the amassing of troops that preceded the 2014 annexation of Crimea.Even as the two leaders exchanged warnings, they expressed hope and willingness to continue diplomacy between the two countries. President Biden also expressed support for diplomacy, starting early next year with the bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue, at Nato through the Nato-Russia Council, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,” Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-exchange-warnings-in-phone-call-over-ukraine-101640956487439.html

However, it warned that “given Omicron is more transmissible, we expect an increase in hospitalizations”.That result was based on comparison of 6,314 cases caused by Omicron against those caused by the Delta variant. According to the study “Omicron appears to be the first dominant variant to demonstrate a decline in disease severity,” as per the newswire Canadian Press.Those hopeful findings came as Canada was trying to cope with an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. The country reported 39,818 new infections on Thursday, according to CTV News.In attempting to deal with the spike, Canada’s worst hit province Quebec announced reimposition of an overnight curfew that will come into place on New Year’s Eve, thereby barring any celebratory gatherings.As Quebec officials forecast even higher numbers going ahead, it also closed down dining in restaurants.At the same time, noting that Omicron posed a lower risk, Ontario relaxed isolation norms for those infected. Those infected but previously vaccinated or children under 12 will be required to isolate for just five days from the onset of symptoms, according to a release from the provincial Government. This decision, it noted, was “based on growing evidence that generally healthy people with Covid-19 are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop”/However, unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or immunocompromised individuals will be required to isolate for 10 days.In a statement released on Thursday, Canada’s chief public health pfficer Dr Theresa Tam said that during the latest seven-day period from December 23 to 29, an average of 25,332 new cases were reported daily across Canada, an increase of 141% compared to the previous week. As of December 29, 2021, there have been over 34,000 cases of the Omicron variant reported in 12 provinces and territories; however, Tam added, “these cases likely represent just the tip of the iceberg”.

And whatever the challenges that fate continues to throw in our way and whatever the anxieties we may have about the weeks and months ahead, particularly about Omicron and the growing numbers in hospitals… we can say one thing with certainty – our position this December the 31st is incomparably better than last year,” said Johnson.“And as I speak tonight on New Year’s Eve, we’ve met our target, we’ve doubled the speed of the booster roll out. And it’s precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all,” he said, urging caution with New Year’s Eve celebrations.Addressing the minority who are opposed to vaccines, he said people who think the disease can’t hurt them should look at those going into hospital now, “that could be you”.“So, make it your New Year’s resolution – far easier than losing weight or keeping a diary – find a walk-in centre or make an online appointment. Get that jab and do something that will make 2022 a happy New Year for us all,” he added.On November 30, the British government announced plans to offer all adults the chance to get their top-up booster jab by the end of January 2022. This target was brought forward earlier this month through the "Get Boosted Now" campaign, aiming to offer all adults a top-up booster by the New Year in response to the surging Omicron variant.Since then, the National Health Service (NHS) in England said it has broken record after record – including the highest number of vaccinations ever recorded in a single day: 830,000 top-ups reported on December 18.This was also the day the UK hit over 1 million vaccinations in total, including first, second, third and booster doses – jumping from 928,000 the previous day.“Our world-leading vaccination programme has meant tens of millions of people have been able to see their loved ones this Christmas knowing they have the protection of the booster,” said UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid.“I am delighted to confirm we have hit our target of offering a COVID-19 booster to all adults by the New Year. I am incredibly proud of the work the NHS has done to accelerate the programme and offer my thanks to the frontline staff, volunteers, Armed Forces and British public who have made it possible for us to meet this commitment,” he said.The dose interval between the second dose and booster dose was reduced from six months to three months on the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – with bookings made available one month in advance.“I am hugely grateful for the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff and volunteers this year, who have gone above and beyond to roll out the NHS vaccination programme and who, in just over 12 months, have administered more than 110 million life-saving COVID-19 jabs,” said Dr Emily Lawson, the head of the NHS COVID-19 vaccination programme.The NHS notes the UK’s booster programme is one of the fastest in the world, as the second country in Europe after Iceland and third in the world for the number of boosters per 100 people in the total population. In all, 33.5 million top-up jabs have been administered in the UK, as well as 51.7 million first and 47.4 million second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-lauds-uk-s-booster-vaccine-triumph-in-new-year-s-message-101640953523504.html
31-12-2021||World||Chinese reliance on Middle East oil increases: Report||China's reliance on Middle East oil increases despite its efforts to get to an "ecological civilization" that relies less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy.As the world's largest oil importer seeks to become greener and more self-reliant, one might expect a shift in its attention and capital. The reality, however, is not that simple, according to Asia Times.Since China became a net importer of oil in 1993, the Middle East has emerged as an increasingly important source of this critical commodity. By the time China surpassed the US as the largest importer of crude oil in 2017, almost half its supply originated from the conflict-ridden Middle-East region.Despite, China's years-long efforts to ramp up local production and diversify its acquisition, its dependency on the Middle East for crude oil remains intact. In 2020, China imported crude oil that totalled roughly USD 176 billion. Almost half (47 per cent) of these official imports came from Middle Eastern countries, according to Asia Times.Further, Saudi Arabia emerged as China's largest crude oil supplier and was still maintaining its leading position as of October 2021. The USD 28.1 billion worth of oil exported from the Kingdom to China in 2020 accounted for 15.9 per cent of China's total crude oil imports.Iraq found itself in third place, shipping USD 19.2 billion (10.9 per cent) worth to the mainland over 2020. Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were also among China's top 10 suppliers, exporting USD 12,8 billion (7.3 per cent), USD 9.7 billion (5.5 per cent), and USD 9 billion (5.1 per cent), respectively.Considering China's dependence on foreign suppliers for oil remains in excess of 70 per cent, Chinese fears of such disruptions to the energy supply chain will only grow.By 2060, China will need to protect the sea lines of communication to ensure the integrity of its oil and gas supply chains. This reality increases the possibility that Beijing will seek to establish more military outposts to enhance its naval power projection capabilities, according to Asia Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-reliance-on-middle-east-oil-increases-report-101640951076257.html

But about an hour and a half into the flight, Fotieo started to feel a sore throat."The wheels started turning in my brain and I thought, 'OK, I'm going to just go take a test.' It was going to make me feel better," Fotieo said. "Immediately, it came back positive."Fotieo is fully vaccinated and has received the booster. She tests consistently since she works with an unvaccinated population. When she got her results in the aeroplane bathroom, over the Atlantic Ocean, she said she started to panic."The first flight attendant I ran into was Rocky. I was hysterical, I was crying," Fotieo said. "I was nervous for my family who I just had dinner with. I was nervous for the other people on the plane. I was nervous for myself."The flight attendant Fotieo ran into helped calm her down, the report added. "Of course, it's a stress factor when something like this comes up, but that's part of our job," the flight attendant told CNN.The flight attendant said she did what she could to try to rearrange seats so Fotieo could be seated in a spot alone, but the flight was full."When she came back and told me she couldn't find enough seating, I opted to stay in the bathroom because I did not want to be around others on the flight," Fotieo said.A note was then put on the bathroom door saying it was out of service, and that was Fotieo's new seat for the remainder of the flight.CNN contacted Icelandair on Thursday for comment but has yet to hear back. Policies vary among airlines as to how to handle a Covid-positive passenger. This comes just weeks after the US and other countries have made travel restrictions amid the spread of the Omicron variant.Once the plane touched down in Iceland, Fotieo and her family were the last ones off the flight.Since her brother and father didn't have any symptoms, they were free to take their connecting flight to Switzerland. Fotieo was given both a rapid and PCR test at the airport, both of which were positive, she said.She was then shuttled to a hotel where she began her 10 days of quarantine, the report added.Doctors checked in on her three times a day, she was given meals and medication was readily available. "Honestly it has been an easy experience," Fotieo said. "It's partially due to the flight attendant and the breed of Icelandic people. Everyone here is so kind."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/testing-positive-for-covid-19-mid-flight-us-woman-is-isolated-for-5-hours-101640936567734.html
31-12-2021||World||South Korea's discredited ex-president Park freed after about 5 years in prison||Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was released from prison on Friday nearly five years after being convicted of corruption, fuelling debate over whether she would play any role ahead of a March presidential election.Park, 69, was the country's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also led to the imprisonment of the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung and Lotte.South Korea's top court in January upheld a 20-year prison sentence imposed after Park was found guilty of colluding with a friend, who is also in jail, to receive tens of billions of won from the companies, mostly to fund her friend's family and non-profit foundations.President Moon Jae-in granted a special pardon to Park last week, citing her deteriorating health and expressing hope to "overcome unfortunate past history and promote national unity".Broadcasters showed Park leaving a Seoul hospital, where she had stayed since last month for medical treatment after correction officials delivered a letter of pardon at midnight.She did not comment but her lawyer has said Park, the daughter of a former military ruler, had offered an apology for causing public concern and thanked Moon for making a "tough decision".Park's release comes as her old party, the main opposition conservative People Power Party, and Moon's Democratic Party are in a tight presidential race.Her imprisonment divided the country, with right-wing, pro-Park groups staging weekly rallies to denounce Moon and his policies and call for Park's release, until COVID-19 distancing rules stifled the rallies last year.Hundreds of Park's supporters braved freezing temperatures to flock to the hospital where she was staying late on Thursday to celebrate her release, with more than 1,000 bouquets of flowers arriving.About 200 people held a protest in downtown Seoul against her release, the Yonhap news agency reported.It was not clear if Park would resume any political activity but she said in a memoir released on Thursday that her conviction was politically motivated and she expressed hopes to "meet the people again one day".People Power's presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who investigated the Park scandal as prosecutor-general, said on Friday he had done his job as a public servant, adding he would like to visit Park when her health improved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-discredited-ex-president-park-freed-after-about-5-years-in-prison-101640935047345.html

While the case load pales in comparison with many outbreaks overseas, China has insisted on stamping out infections quickly, especially ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February."With the arrival of the New Year and the Lunar New Year, the number of people returning home from abroad will increase and the movement of people within China will rise," He Qinghua, an official at the National Health Commission, said on Wednesday."Coupled with the emergence of new variants such as Omicron, these scenarios will increase the risk of the epidemic spreading," He said.The popular Happy Valley amusement park in Beijing has cancelled an event to ring in the new year, while the Happy Valley park in the eastern city of Nanjing has dropped a drone show and fireworks from its line-up of celebrations for New Year's Eve.In the financial hub Shanghai, the Great World amusement park said it will not organise special events such as stage performances, while no count-down will take place in core districts along Huangpu river.The central city of Wuhan, where COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, will not hold any large-scale gatherings during New Year's Eve at certain public venues, including at Guanggu, one of the world's longest pedestrian shopping streets.Several Buddhist bell-ringing ceremonies in the eastern cities of Nanjing, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang to celebrate the new year have also been scrapped.The northern province of Hebei, which will host some events for the Winter Olympics, said it urges residents not to travel unnecessarily during the New Year and Lunar New Year period.Shanxi province, also in the north, advised residents not to head to other provinces for tourism, while the northwestern region of Ningxia said people have been encouraged not to leave the region unnecessarily.As of Dec. 30, mainland China had 102,083 confirmed symptomatic cases, including both local and imported ones, with the death toll at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-cities-go-on-covid-alert-as-new-year-holiday-looms-101640931077877.html

He said 82 were missing and 1,147 injured.More than 530,000 houses were damaged, a third of which were totally wrecked, while damage to infrastructure and agriculture was estimated at 23.4 billion pesos ($459 million), Jalad said.The typhoon affected nearly 4.5 million people, including about 500,000 sheltering in evacuation centres, government data showed. It made landfall as a category 5 typhoon on Dec. 16, and left a trail of destruction in the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, and Surigao del Norte, including the holiday island of Siargao, and the Dinagat Islands.In central Philippine provinces, disaster and government officials have been grappling with inadequate relief supplies for thousands of residents still without power and water."It caused massive destruction and it was like a bomb was dropped in northern Bohol," Anthony Damalerio, chief of Bohol province's disaster agency, told Reuters.A popular dive spot, Bohol reported 109 deaths and is seeking shelter kits, food and water, Damalerio said."Our problem is shelter, those who lost roofs, especially now that this is rainy season in the province," Surigao del Norte Governor Francisco Matugas told ANC news channel.Rai's swath of destruction revived memories of typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, which killed 6,300 people in the Philippines in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-over-400-people-dead-thousands-injured-82-missing-says-philippines-disaster-agency-101640928177369.html

Kwon says the omicron variant also continues to spread throughout South Korea and that it's difficult to prevent it from becoming the dominant strain in South Korea.On Friday, South Korea added 4,875 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the national tally to 630,838. Health authorities said they've also confirmed 269 new cases of the omicron variant, taking the country's total to 894.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-extends-social-distancing-rules-amid-omicron-threat-101640927608007.html
31-12-2021||World||UK meets vaccine booster target as Covid-19 cases rise||Boris Johnson’s government said every adult in England has had the chance to receive a Covid-19 vaccine booster, the critical part of its strategy for tackling the fast-spreading omicron variant.More than 28.1 million people in England have now had their top-up doses, the Department of Health said in a statement Friday, or about seven of 10 eligible adults. The UK’s other devolved nations make their own health policy.Johnson has repeatedly pointed to the vaccine rollout as the rationale for not imposing tougher pandemic restrictions to slow the tide of omicron cases.“It’s precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all,” Johnson said in his New Year’s message. But his strategy to get through the latest virus wave with an accelerated inoculation program combined with home testing is coming under growing pressure, amid a widespread shortage of testing kits and as the soaring caseload starts to test the resilience of the health service.A total of 11,452 people were in the hospital in England with Covid-19 as of Thursday, according to the latest NHS England figures, far short of the peak of more than 34,000 in January. Still, daily admissions are also rising with 2,082 on Dec. 28 -- the most since Feb. 3.‘War Footing’The National Health Service is “on a war footing,” Stephen Powis, its national medical director, said in a statement Thursday announcing the construction of temporary structures at eight hospitals to care for more patients.The move, described as precautionary, is reminiscent of the so-called Nightingale hospitals set up during the first Covid-19 wave in 2020 that were later closed because they were little-used.There is growing evidence that omicron is causing less serious disease than earlier coronavirus variants including the previously dominant delta. Yet some scientists are worried that the sheer number of Covid-19 cases could strain the NHS, even if the proportion of people needing treatment is smaller.Johnson has said about 90% of people hospitalized with Covid-19 haven’t had vaccine boosters, and on Friday he urged holdouts to come forward. Booster Drive“I want to speak directly to all those who have yet to get fully vaccinated,” he said. “The people who think the disease can’t hurt them -- look at the people going into hospital now, that could be you.”The UK recorded 189,213 confirmed Covid cases on Thursday, breaking the record for a second day, fueled by the spread of omicron. A further 332 more deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also recorded, the highest daily total since March, though NHS England said that includes a “backlog” of fatalities not reported over the holiday period.That is also piling pressure on the other plank of Johnson’s Covid strategy: encouraging people to use home testing kits to avoid spreading the virus. With demand surging, they have been repeatedly unavailable to order on the NHS website while pharmacies have complained of “inconsistent” supplies.Under new pandemic rules in England, people can use the tests to end their self-isolation, increasing demand. Businesses have started to voice concern about the impact on supply chains due to staff absences, which are also increasingly serious in the health service.On Thursday, Southern Railway announced it is suspending services to the busy London Victoria station until Jan. 10 because so many employees are isolating due to coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-meets-vaccine-booster-target-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101640919796589.html
31-12-2021||World||Pediatric hospitalisations in US on record high due to Omicron variant||New pediatric Covid hospitalizations have hit a record-high in the United States, as children are increasingly swept up in Omicron's lightning spread.While experts are concerned, and stress the need to step up vaccination among kids, early indications suggest that the new variant's rate of severe disease could in fact be lower, and its extreme contagiousness is behind the rapid rise.The raw data might also be muddied by coincidental infections that aren't the main cause of a hospital admission.Numbers spikingAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, almost 199,000 children were reported infected with Covid-19 in the week ending December 23, the last week for which data is currently available, and a 50 percent rise on figures earlier in the month.The seven-day-average of Covid hospital admissions for people aged 0-17 was 378 in the week ending December 28, a 66.1 percent increase on the prior week and the highest ever figure, surpassing the previous peak seen during the Delta wave on September 1, per official data.The only other age group where hospitalizations have hit a new peak are 18-29 year olds.The rates of severe illness remain however much lower in absolute terms compared to older age groups.There have been 803 deaths of people aged 0-18 from Covid in the US, out of more than 820,000, since the pandemic began.Early research out of Hong Kong based on lab testing of tissue samples has shown Omicron replicates up to 70 times faster in the bronchi, the airways leading into the lungs, compared to Delta, which may help explain its extreme spread throughout the population."I think at this point, it's a numbers game," Jim Versalovic, a pathologist and immunologist at Texas Children's Hospital, the largest children's hospital in the United States, told AFP."Based on what we've gathered today, Omicron is not causing more severe infections, but is infecting many more children. And hence we are seeing more children hospitalized with Covid," he added.If anything, there appears to be a greater proportion of mild pediatric cases linked to Omicron -- which is similar to what has been seen in adults, he added.Its relative mildness could be explained by the same Hong Kong study that showed Omicron replicated 10 times slower in the lungs compared to Delta, and a hamster study from the University of Tokyo has borne this out.But "even if you have a small percentage of kids that would have severe disease, a small percentage of a large number is a large number," Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Northwell Health hospital system in New York told AFP.As to why the rate of cases, and thus hospitalizations, are rising faster in younger age groups compared to older, there are several potential factors at play.President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci told reporters this week that "many children are hospitalized with Covid as opposed to because of Covid."In other words, since hospitals are routinely Covid testing everyone admitted, they are picking up coincidental coronavirus infections.The vaccination rate is also lowest among children aged 5-11, who were the last group to become eligible, in November.According to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 15 percent of this group is fully vaccinated, compared to 84 percent of people aged 12 and over.Vaccination strongly recommendedThe take home message for parents, according to Versalovic, is "there's no time to waste in getting a vaccine" -- and that goes for the whole family, including adults, who could spread to their kids, added Bernstein.In fact, the hospitalized adolescents Versalovic's hospital has seen are "almost exclusively unvaccinated."The case for vaccinating young children was strengthened by a new CDC report out Thursday that found serious side effects were exceedingly rare in 5-11 year olds. Feared cases of heart inflammation occurred even less frequently than in males aged 12-29.Only infants aged 0-5 remain ineligible for vaccines, with expectations for authorization in the coming months.Versalovic added there was also cause for hope that the spike might recede very quickly in the coming weeks, as was seen in southern Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pediatric-hospitalisations-in-us-on-record-high-due-to-omicron-variant-101640916193393.html
31-12-2021||World||Decision to flee Kabul made in 'minutes': Ex-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani||Former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani on Thursday described fleeing the Taliban's victory march on Kabul, saying the decision had been taken in "minutes" and that he did not know he was leaving the country until he was taking off.Ghani told BBC's Radio 4 "Today" programme that on the morning of August 15, 2021, the day the Islamists took control of the capital and his own government fell apart, he had "no inkling" that it would be his last day in Afghanistan.But by that afternoon security at the presidential palace had "collapsed," he said."If I take a stand they will all be killed, and they were not capable of defending me," Ghani said in the interview, conducted by former UK chief of defence staff, General Nick Carter.His national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, was "literally terrified," Ghani said. "He did not give me more than two minutes."He said his instructions had originally been to fly by helicopter to southeastern Khost city.But Khost had fallen in the Islamists' lightning offensive which saw provincial capitals topple around the country in the days ahead of the withdrawal of international forces, set for the end of August.The eastern city of Jalalabad, on the border with Pakistan, had also fallen, he said."I did not know where we will go," Ghani said."Only when we took off did it become clear that we were leaving."Ghani has been in the United Arab Emirates ever since.He has been highly criticised in Afghanistan for leaving, with Afghans now trapped under the Taliban's harsh rule accusing him of abandoning them -- and of taking millions of dollars in cash, a claim he "categorically" denied again on Thursday.The former World Bank official has released several previous statements on his departure, admitting that he owed the Afghan people an explanation. Thursday was his first interview.He said again that his first concern had been to prevent brutal street fighting in the capital, already packed with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence elsewhere in the country.And he said his decision to leave was "the hardest thing"."I had to sacrifice myself in order to save Kabul and to expose the situation for what it is: a violent coup, not a political agreement."But even if he'd stayed, he said, he could not have changed the outcome, which has seen the Taliban establish their new regime as the country faces one of the worst humanitarian crises in history."Unfortunately I was painted in total black," he said. "It became an American issue. Not an Afghan issue.""My life work has been destroyed, my values have been trampled on and I've been made a scapegoat," he said.Afghans had "rightly" blamed him, he said. "I completely understand that anger, because I share that anger."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decision-to-flee-kabul-made-in-minutes-ex-afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-101640917906198.html

There's a potential of 210 homes lost in Old Town Superior," Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle told a news conference."I'd like to emphasize that due to the magnitude and intensity of this fire and its presence in such a heavily populated area, we would not be surprised if there are injuries or fatalities."Thousands of people have been told to flee the fast-moving fire, which is thought to have begun when powerlines were toppled by gusting winds.The 20,000-strong town of Louisville, along with the 13,000 residents of Superior, have been told to get out, with the National Weather Service describing the situation as "life-threatening."Wind gusts of over 100 miles (160 kilometres) an hour have been reported in some places, fanning the flames and complicating firefighting efforts."Prayers for thousands of families evacuating from the fires in Superior and Boulder County," Colorado Governor Jared Polis tweeted."Fast winds are spreading flames quickly and all aircraft are grounded."Like much of the American West, Colorado is in the grip of a years-long drought that has left the area parched and vulnerable to wildfire.Although fires are a natural part of the climate cycle, and help to clear dead brush and reduce disease in vegetation, their scale and intensity is increasing.Scientists say a warming climate, chiefly caused by human activities like the unchecked burning of fossil fuels, is altering weather patterns.This prolongs droughts in some areas and provokes unseasonally large storms in other places, phenomena that are expected to get worse as worldwide average temperatures continue to climb.Daniel Swain, a meteorolgist at the University of California, tweeted that it was "hard to believe" these fires were taking hold in December, usually a quieter time for blazes."But take a record warm & dry fall, only 1 inch of snow so far this season, & add an extreme (100mph ) downslope windstorm...and extremely fast moving/dangerous fires are the result."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-wildfires-thousands-evacuated-as-officials-fear-several-houses-lost-101640916054311.html
31-12-2021||World||South Africa lifts night-time curfew as it says Covid-19 4th wave peaks||South Africa has lifted a midnight to 4 a.m. curfew on people's movement with immediate effect, believing the country has passed the peak of its fourth Covid-19 wave driven by the Omicron variant, a government statement said on Thursday.The country made the changes based on the trajectory of the pandemic, levels of vaccination in the country and available capacity in the health sector, according to a press release issued by Mondli Gungubele, a minister in the presidency.South Africa is currently at the lowest of its five-stage Covid-19 alert levels."All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level," a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said.Data from the Department of Health showed a 29.7% decrease in the number of new cases detected in the week ending Dec. 25 compared to the number of cases found in the previous week, at 127,753, the government said.South Africa, with close to 3.5 million infections and 91,000 deaths, has been the worst-hit country in Africa during the pandemic on both counts.Besides lifting the restrictions on public movement, the government said gatherings will be restricted to no more than 1,000 people indoors, and no more than 2,000 people outdoors.It also ruled that alcohol shops with licenses to operate beyond 11 p.m. (2100GMT) may revert back to full license conditions, a welcome boon for traders and businesses hard hit by the pandemic and looking to recover during the festive season."While the Omicron variant is highly transmissible, there has been lower rates of hospitalisation than in previous waves," cabinet said, adding that the wearing of masks in public places remained mandatory. Failure to wear a mask in South Africa when required remains a criminal offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-lifts-night-time-curfew-as-it-says-covid-19-4th-wave-peaks-101640915265091.html
31-12-2021||World||Amid Omicron surge, Israel approves fourth Covid-19 booster jab||Israel on Thursday approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable people, becoming one of the first countries to do so, amid a surge in Covid in cases driven by the Omicron variant.The approval came as another anti-Covid weapon arrived in the country: the first shipment of Pfizer's anti-Covid pills."Today I approved giving the fourth vaccine for immunocompromised people," health ministry director-general Nachman Ash told reporters."I did this in light of studies that show the benefit of the vaccine, including the fourth vaccine, to this population, and in light of the fear they are more vulnerable in this outbreak of Omicron."Health authorities reported on Thursday more than 4,000 new cases, a high not seen since September.Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said Israel was in "a fifth wave", with most cases probably related to the Omicron variant.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel, which was among the first countries in the world to offer a third shot to the general public, would be a trailblazer for the fourth jab."Israel will lead the way in administering a fourth vaccine to the Israeli people," he said.Some 4.2 million people out of a population of 9.4 Israelis have gotten three shots of coronavirus vaccine.Also on Thursday, an Israeli El Al flight from Belgium landed in Tel Aviv carrying a shipment of Pfizer's anti-Covid pill, Paxlovid.Bennett hailed this as an "important addition to the arsenal in the war against the pandemic"."Thanks to our rapid action, the drugs have arrived in Israel quickly and will assist us in getting past the peak of the coming Omicron wave," he said.- 'Reduce risk' - Ran Balicer, chairman of Israel's national expert panel on Covid-19, said the Pfizer drugs could "dramatically reduce risk of severe illness, potentially thus also reducing the overall hospital burden".He said the medications were critical, "in addition to vaccines and masks".The US Food and Drug Administration last week authorised Pfizer's Paxlovid pill for high-risk people aged 12 and up.In trials, the treatment has been shown to reduce Covid hospitalisations and deaths by 88 percent among at-risk people.The oral treatments block the virus' ability to replicate and should withstand variants, experts say.Until now, the main treatments for Covid have been synthetic antibodies or Gilead's antiviral remdesivir, which are administered by infusion.The United States has paid $5.3 billion for 10 million courses of Pfizer's new treatment, as well as $2.2 billion for treatment from rival Merck, whose pill appears to be less effective.The European Union's drug regulator has also allowed member states to use Pfizer's Covid medications ahead of formal approval as an emergency measure.Ash approved the booster after Israel's Sheba Medical Centre launched a clinical trial Monday, giving 150 staff members a fourth jab to test the benefit of a wider national rollout of additional doses.He also announced new health regulations, requiring people to wear masks at outdoor gatherings of more than 50 people.Israeli health authorities have shied away from sweeping social distancing guidelines and lockdowns seen in the earlier days of the pandemic.The government has also not blocked large gatherings for New Year's Eve.Horowitz said, however on Thursday, "every person must take personal responsibility"."We will not station an inspector and we won't send a police officer to every person."Last week Chile announced it would offer a fourth shot to at-risk people beginning in February. Health authorities in the United Kingdom and Germany have also said they are considering fourth doses.dac/hkbPFIZERGILEAD SCIENCES||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-omicron-surge-israel-approves-fourth-covid-19-booster-jab-101640915532436.html

From Greece to Mexico, from Barcelona to Bali and across swathes of Europe, authorities have cancelled or curtailed public gatherings.In France, wearing masks outdoors will be compulsory while walking the streets of Paris from Friday for everyone over the age of 11. Nightclubs have been closed until well into January.In Spain, public festivities have been cancelled across most regions and in the biggest cities except Madrid, where a stripped-down gathering is scheduled with the crowd limited to 7,000 people compared to 18,000 in 2019.On Thursday, Britain’s National Health Service announced that it would start opening temporary field hospitals to contain a possible overspill of inpatients. The number of patients occupying beds in English hospitals rose to 11,452, official data from NHS England showed on Thursday, up by 990 from a day earlier.Indonesia, which has reported more than 4.2 million confirmed cases, warned that foreign travellers may be deported from the resort island of Bali if they are caught violating Covid rules.Bali has barred carnivals, fireworks and gatherings of more than 50 people over the Christmas and New Year period.Mexico City has also cancelled its massive New Year’s Eve celebrations as a preventative measure after a rise in Covid cases.In Saudi Arabia, authorities reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, after recording the highest number of infections in months.“I am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Russia is bracing itself for another Covid-19 wave early next year, three sources in political circles told Reuters. “There is the expectation of a new wave in January-February,” said a source close to the Kremlin, adding that daily infections of more than 50,000 were possible.J&J booster effectiveA booster dose of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid vaccine was 84% effective at preventing hospitalisation in South African health care workers who became infected as the Omicron variant spread, researchers said on Thursday. The real-world study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was based on a second dose of the J&J vaccine administered to 69,092 workers between November 15 and December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-braces-for-virus-surge-in-new-year-101640903968129.html
