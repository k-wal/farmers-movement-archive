But the expert panel was divided over whether there is enough scientific data yet to justify fourth shots. Final approval by Health Ministry director-general Nachman Ash is still pending, and Israeli media say he may limit fourth shots to over 70s."The biggest question is, how significant is Omicron? It's clear to all that it is very contagious. But whether it causes very severe illness - that's the most significant question," said Gili Regev-Yochay, who is running the Sheba trial.The Sheba study of 150 participants "will zero in on efficacy of the vaccine in producing antibodies, and safety, in order to ascertain if a fourth vaccine is needed in general", the hospital spokesperson said.Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist, said more data is needed to gauge whether there has been a drop in protection against severe disease and death provided by the three shots offered so far."We can't blindly assume that another shot will solve it all, because it won't," said Levine, who heads Israel's Association of Public Health Physicians.Some 63% of Israel's 9.4 million population have received the first two vaccine doses, according to ministry data. Almost 45% have taken a booster shot, they make up a little more than half those eligible for it. Close to 2,000 confirmed or suspected Omicron cases have been logged and infections have risen sharply over the past week.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been in self-isolation at home since Sunday after his 14-year-old daughter tested positive for COVID-19, with what his office says is probably the Omicron variant. He subsequently tested negative, and his office said on Monday he would continue to work from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-hospital-launches-first-test-of-second-covid-19-booster-101640625400014.html
27-12-2021||World||UAE issues first civil marriage license for non-Muslim couple||The UAE issued its first civil marriage license for a non-Muslim couple, state media reported Monday, as the Gulf country seeks to keep its edge over regional competitors.The United Arab Emirates -- where foreigners make up 90 percent of the approximately 10-million population -- has been amending its laws to present itself as a modernising force in a largely conservative region.The official WAM news agency said a Canadian couple were the first to marry under a new law on the personal status of non-Muslims in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi.The move "contributes to the consolidation of Abu Dhabi's position as a world leading destination for skills and expertise from around the world," WAM said.Civil marriage in the Middle East, the birthplace of Islam, Christianity and Judaism, is uncommon and usually conducted under a religious authority of one of the three monotheistic beliefs.Civil marriages are allowed in Tunisia and Algeria.While some countries in the region allow civil unions based on certain conditions, some only recognise civil marriages conducted abroad and others not at all.Late last year, the UAE revamped an array of laws in a social liberalisation drive designed to burnish its progressive brand.These included lifting a ban on unmarried couples living together, loosening restrictions on alcohol and offering long-term residencies.Earlier this month, the UAE announced it will move to a Western-style Saturday-Sunday weekend.Starting on January 1, 2022, the Emirates will become the only Gulf country not to observe weekends from Friday, the Muslim day of prayer, to Saturday.Competition is hotting up as neighbouring Saudi Arabia, seeking to diversify its oil-reliant economy, aims to turn its capital Riyadh into an international hub.Saudi Arabia has lifted a ban on women drivers and eased its strict Islamic dress code.Last year, Riyadh said it would not sign contracts with companies that have their regional headquarters outside the kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-issues-first-civil-marriage-license-for-non-muslim-couple-101640625164701.html
27-12-2021||World||Scotland Yard probes video showing Sikh man declaring to assassinate Queen to avenge Jallianwala Bagh massacre||A video has surfaced on social media in which a fully masked man with a crossbow, identifying himself as an Indian Sikh, is seen declaring to "assassinate" Queen Elizabeth II to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, prompting Scotland Yard to launch a probe, days after an intruder armed with a crossbow was arrested at the monarch’s Windsor Castle.The video, shared on Snapshot, is that of a fully masked man who identifies himself as Indian Sikh Jaswant Singh Chail and declares that he wants to "assassinate" the monarch in revenge for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, according to The Sun newspaper which obtained the video.Meanwhile, the 19-year-old intruder, who has not yet been named by the Metropolitan Police, is now being held over mental health issues.Scotland Yard officers were investigating the video reportedly linked to the intruder armed with a crossbow arrested at Windsor Castle on Christmas Day.The Metropolitan Police said that the arrested suspect has been sectioned under the UK’s Mental Health Act after a mental health assessment and remains “in the care of medical professionals”.“I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done and what I will do. I will attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, Queen of the Royal Family,” the masked man is seen saying in the video.“This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race. I’m an Indian Sikh, a Sikh. My name was Jaswant Singh Chail, my name is Darth Jones,” he says.The massacre took place at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar during the Baisakhi festival in April 1919 when the British Indian Army under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer opened fire at a crowd staging a pro-independence demonstration, leaving scores dead.In the video clip posted on The Sun website, the 'Star Wars' film-like masked figure holds a shiny black weapon and speaks in a distorted voice.It was reportedly sent to followers of the man's Snapchat account 24 minutes before armed security officers arrested him near the 95-year-old Queen’s private apartments.In a message sent on Snapchat alongside the video, the teenager wrote: “I’m sorry to all of those who I have wronged or lied to. If you have received this then my death is near. Please share this with whoever and if possible, get it to the news if they’re interested.”Police are also carrying out searches at a housing estate in Southampton, where the suspect reportedly lived with his family.“A 19-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon,” Met Police said in a statement.“Following a search of the man, a crossbow was recovered. The man was taken into custody and has undergone a mental health assessment – he has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals.“Enquiries into the full circumstances of this incident are being progressed by Metropolitan Police Specialist Operations,” the statement added.The police spokesman declined to comment on the identity of the person in the video.Buckingham Palace has also declined to comment, the BBC reported.Prince Charles and wife Camilla are spending Christmas with the monarch at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, south-east England, after she took the decision to call off her traditional Christmas at Sandringham estate in Norfolk amidst a surge in COVID-19 cases.Officers from Thames Valley and the Metropolitan Police said they responded to the breach on Saturday morning and arrested the man from Southampton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotland-yard-probes-video-showing-sikh-man-declaring-to-assassinate-queen-101640623386223.html
27-12-2021||World||More parties in Maldives oppose ‘India Out’ campaign led by Abdulla Yameen||NEW DELHI: More political parties in the Maldives have opposed an “India Out” campaign led by former president Abdulla Yameen following his release from house arrest, saying the leader is recklessly inciting hatred among the people towards India. The Indian Ocean archipelago has witnessed the “India Out” slogan on social media several times over the past three years, but the movement has been expanded since the Supreme Court of the Maldives overturned Yameen’s conviction in a money-laundering and embezzlement case last month. The development allowed him to make a return to politics. Ties between India and the Maldives had hit a low during the tenure of Yameen, who was close to China. Yameen’s half-brother, former president and Maldives Reform Movement party leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, is among those who have opposed the campaign. The “India Out” campaign is mostly centred round unsubstantiated allegations that India is seeking to establish a military presence in the Maldives through ongoing security cooperation. Yameen has contended that the campaign is aimed at ensuring the independence of the Maldives. The Maldives government, in a statement issued on December 19, said it was “profoundly concerned” by attempts by a “small group of individuals and a few political personalities” to spread “misguided and unsubstantiated information to propagate hatred towards India, one of the closest bilateral partners” of the country. Gayoom said in an interview with Voice this week that no one should campaign against any neighbouring country. “In my opinion, one should not campaign against any neighbouring [or] friendly nation, not just India. Be it Pakistan, Bangladesh or Egypt, one should not run a campaign belittling any country,” he said. Also Read: Vikram Misri is new deputy NSANo one should do anything that affects the Maldives’ friendly relations with all countries, he said. “We want to work closely with all countries of the world. The Maldives is a country with very small resources [and it] can continue to develop only by maintaining a peaceful and secure relationship with the rest of the world,” he added. The Adhaalath Party, a coalition partner of President Ibrahim Solih, condemned efforts to “incite hatred in the people’s hearts towards neighbouring and global partners”. In a statement, it expressed concern at the “reckless act led by former President Abdullah Yameen to incite hatred towards neighbouring India amongst the civilians”. The diplomatic policy of the Maldives plays a major role in development, defence and security and the Adhaalath Party believes the “highest priority of the diplomatic policy should focus on ensuring [the] nation’s security and upholding national and public interests”, the statement said. In a globally connected world, bilateral ties need to be strengthened, especially when the country needs to cooperate with neighbouring and friendly states, the Adhaalath Party said. Strategic cooperation between India and the Maldives is the result of a long-standing relationship and ongoing projects were implemented during Yameen’s administration, the Adhaalath Party said, adding that his politically motivated campaign to “manipulate the public mindset is a stunt”. The Jumhooree Party, another coalition partner of Solih, said in a statement that it doesn’t support any activities which compromise the independence and sovereignty of the Maldives. The Constitution states the government cannot allow the establishment of foreign military presence in the Maldives, and the Jumhooree Party does not believe “there is any legal ground to decide the existence of Indian military presence” in the country. “It is beneficial for both countries... to station military personnel on official duties for specific duration of time; under bilateral agreements; on training purposes, talent and capacity building, crisis prevention and preparation exercises...and for other continuous training purposes,” the Jumhooree Party said.
27-12-2021||World||China's Xi'an imposes 'strictest' controls to halt Covid-19 outbreak||The locked-down Chinese city of Xi'an on Monday tightened Covid-19 controls to the "strictest" level, banning residents from driving cars around town in an effort to control the country's worst outbreak in 21 months.China has stuck to a "zero-Covid" strategy of tight border restrictions, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns as Beijing prepares to welcome thousands of overseas visitors for February's Winter Olympics.But historic Xi'an -- where 13 million residents are facing their fifth day of home confinement -- is at the centre of a flare-up that has pushed nationwide daily infections to their highest numbers since March last year.Restrictions tightened further on Monday as Xi'an announced it would impose the "strictest social control measures", according to a city government social media account.The northern city -- home to the world-famous Terracotta Warriors -- recorded 150 new cases on Monday, bringing the total to around 650 since December 9.No vehicles are allowed on the roads unless they are assisting with disease control work, the latest announcement said.Police and health officials will "strictly inspect" cars, and those who break the rules could face 10 days' detention and a fine of 500 yuan ($78).Two other cities in Shaanxi province also reported a case linked to Xi'an, as authorities urged migrant workers from the city not to travel home in the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.The outbreak of the fast-spreading Delta variant has caused severe symptoms in four patients including a one-year-old child, the state-run Global Times tabloid reported.Since locking down the city last week, authorities have launched several rounds of mass testing and placed nearly 30,000 people in hotel quarantine.All non-essential businesses have been shuttered, while each household can only send out one person to buy necessities every three days.The Xi'an government has come under fire for its perceived poor handling of the outbreak, with China's disciplinary body saying last week that 26 local officials had been punished for lapses in virus prevention.Authorities have strictly limited movement into and out of the city, with footage from state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday showing trucks waiting in line at road checkpoints as workers in hazmat suits checked health codes on drivers' mobile phones.Since the coronavirus first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, China has largely kept the pandemic at bay.The country has officially recorded only two deaths in over a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-an-imposes-strictest-controls-to-halt-covid-19-outbreak-101640598162354.html
27-12-2021||World||China starts to disinfect city of 13 million people after Delta outbreak||The western Chinese city of Xi’an has begun widespread disinfection measures since late Sunday to counter a jump in Covid infections that forced the lockdown of 13 million residents.Authorities are spraying disinfectants across the city and asking residents to close windows and avoid touching architectural surfaces and vegetation on streets. Private cars are not allowed on roads. The move came as daily infections spike to around 150 on Sunday and Monday, as health authorities seek to uncover more cases with a fourth round of mass testing.The 2022 Winter Olympics are set to kick off in Beijing Feb. 4. China on Monday reported a total of 162 domestic Covid infections, with 150 of those from Xi’an, the highest daily caseload since Jan. 22. A surge of that scale is rarely seen in China, which is the only major country in the world still aggressively trying to eliminate the virus via closed borders and stringent domestic curbs under what’s called a Zero Covid strategy. The Xi’an outbreak, which has seen more than 600 cases in less than three weeks and is being blamed on the delta variant, underscores the difficulty China faces in returning domestic infections to nil as the virus mutates to forms more capable of escaping through stringent containment measures. The nation has also found a handful of omicron infections among travelers from other countries but hasn’t seen the even more infectious and immunity-evading variant spreading into the community.Authorities locked down Xi’an last week on concerns that the virus had been spreading under the radar with many of the transmission routes unknown. Even so, local media quoted Zhang Boli, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government on Covid, as saying it is still possible to get the outbreak under control by the end of January, before the Olympics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-starts-to-disinfect-city-of-13-million-people-after-delta-outbreak-101640594907407.html
27-12-2021||World||China's local Covid-19 cases edge higher as Xian remains in lockdown||The Chinese city of Xian remained under lockdown for a fifth day on Monday as authorities reported 150 new local symptomatic coronavirus cases for Sunday, a slight decrease from the previous day.Case numbers in Xian, home to 13 million people, remain tiny compared with many clusters overseas, but authorities have imposed tough curbs on travel within and leaving the city under Beijing's drive to immediately contain outbreaks.Authorities have not announced any infection caused by the Omicron variant in Xian, where there have been 635 confirmed coronavirus cases during the Dec. 9-26 period. The 150 local symptomatic cases on Sunday compared with 155 a day earlier, and accounted for most of the 162 new domestic infections in China.Chine reported a total of 158 domestically transmitted symptomatic cases for Sunday.Nationwide, China has detected a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in South China.The new case number for Sunday marks the highest nationwide count of local symptomatic infections since the daily bulletin provided by the National Health Commission started to classify asymptomatic carriers separately from end-March 2020.In Xian, residents cannot leave the city without approval from employers or local authorities.Since Dec 23, households have been allowed to send only one person to shop for necessities every two days. Other family members may not leave home unless they have essential jobs or urgent matters to attend to, approved by employers or communities.On Monday, Xian authorities urged residents to stay home except for having their sample collected in a new round of citywide testing.Xian has also launched a city-wide disinfection campaign, with workers spraying pathogen-killing solutions onto roads and buildings, and residents were advised not to touch plants or building surfaces.Dongyan Jin, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said the mass disinfection of outdoor air and surfaces seemed unnecessary given the low risk of people catching Covid-19 from outdoor surfaces or air with so few people outside."This is shooting mosquitoes with cannon," said Jin, although he believes disinfection of indoor surfaces, especially in places visit by infected people, is necessary.The cities of Xianyang and Weinan, like Xian in Shaanxi province, each reported one local symptomatic case for Sunday. Local infections were also found in the Guangxi region and the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong and Sichuan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-local-covid-19-cases-edge-higher-as-xian-remains-in-lockdown-101640587211490.html
27-12-2021||World||Delta flight to Shanghai turned back because of Covid rules||Delta Air Lines said Monday that new pandemic-related cleaning requirements at a Shanghai airport were behind the turning back of a recent flight from Seattle in midair, a move that had prompted a protest from the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco.An emailed statement said the new mandates at Shanghai Pudong International Airport “require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable for Delta.”It wasn't clear what the rules are and what prompted the change, but it comes as China tightens its already strict Covid-19 travel restrictions in the face of a growing outbreak in the city of Xi'an and ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in six weeks.Xi'an, which is about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Beijing, reported more than 300 new cases over the weekend, a sharp rise from previous days. The city of 13 million people has been locked down, with only one person per household allowed out every two days to shop for necessities.The Delta flight that turned back to Seattle last week left passengers with expired Covid-19 test results and U.S. visas, according to Chinese media reports.The consulate in San Francisco did not name Delta but said in a short statement Sunday that many flights from the U.S. to China had been delayed or canceled in recent days including a flight that turned back more than halfway to its destination.The consulate “had made a stern representation to the airline,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-flight-to-shanghai-turned-back-because-of-covid-rules-101640594655413.html
27-12-2021||World||Myanmar court postpones verdicts in second case against Suu Kyi||A court in military-ruled Myanmar postponed its verdicts Monday on two charges against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi in which she is accused of importing and possessing walkie-talkies without following official procedures, a legal official familiar with the case said.The case in the court in the capital, Naypyitaw, is among many brought against the 76-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate since the army seized power on Feb. 1, ousting her elected government and arresting top members of her National League for Democracy party.The court gave no reason for delaying the verdicts until Jan. 10, according to the legal official, who insisted on anonymity for fear of being punished by the authorities, who have restricted the release of information about Suu Kyi's trials.Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory in last year's general election, but the military said there was widespread electoral fraud, an assertion that independent poll watchers doubt.Suu Kyi's supporters and independent analysts say all the charges against her are politically motivated and an attempt to discredit her and legitimize the military's seizure of power while keeping her from returning to politics. If found guilty of all the charges she faces, she could be sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.Suu Kyi was convicted on Dec. 6 on two other charges — incitement and breaching COVID-19 restrictions — and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Hours after the sentence was issued, the head of the military-installed government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, reduced it by half. She is being held by the military at an unknown location and state television reported that she would serve her sentence there.Suu Kyi has been attending court hearings in prison clothes — a white top and a brown longyi skirt provided by the authorities. The hearings are closed to the media and spectators and the prosecutors do not comment. Her lawyers, who had been a source of information on the proceedings, were served with gag orders in October.A charge under the Export-Import Law of having improperly imported the walkies-talkies was the first filed against Suu Kyi and served as the initial justification for her continued detention. A second charge of illegally possessing the radios was filed the following month.The radios were seized from the gate of her residence and the barracks of her bodyguards during a search on Feb. 1, the day she was arrested.Suu Kyi's lawyers argued that the radios were not in her personal possession and were legitimately used to help provide for her security, but the court declined to dismiss the charges.The court on Monday also heard video testimony from the vice chairman of Suu Kyi's party, Zaw Myint Maung, in another case against her involving alleged violation of COVID-19 restrictions during last year's election campaign, the legal official said.Zaw Myint Maung, who had been unable to appear in court earlier for health reasons, testified that people had gathered to see her when she visited Shwe Kyar Pin Ward during the campaign because they respect her, and it wasn't a violation of virus restrictions, the official said.The offense falls under the Natural Disaster Management Law and the maximum penalty is three years in prison and a fine.She is also being tried in the same court on five counts of corruption. The maximum penalty for each count is 15 years in prison and a fine. A sixth corruption charge, in which Suu Kyi and ousted President Win Myint are accused of granting permits to rent and buy a helicopter, has not yet gone to trial.In separate proceedings, she is accused of violating the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum term of 14 years.Additional charges were also added by Myanmar's election commission against Suu Kyi and 15 other politicians in November for alleged fraud in last year's election. The charges by the military-controlled Union Election Commission could result in Suu Kyi's party being dissolved and unable to participate in a new election the military has promised will take place within two years of its takeover.The military's seizure of power was met by nonviolent nationwide demonstrations, which security forces quashed with deadly force, killing nearly 1,400 civilians, according to a detailed list compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.Peaceful protests have continued, but amid the severe crackdown, an armed resistance has also grown, to the point that U.N. experts have warned the country could be sliding into civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-postpones-verdicts-in-second-case-against-suu-kyi-101640589306158.html

There were 524 people in hospitals, including 55 in intensive care.New measures came into force in New South Wales on Monday, including limits of one person per 2 square metres (22 square feet) in bars and restaurants and required "check-ins" with QR codes in hospitality venues.Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state government is considering lifting the requirement for health workers to isolate themselves after being exposed to Covid-19 because of staff shortages.Victoria state reported 1,999 new cases on Monday with three deaths.State Covid-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar said Victoria has moved to random genome testing for the Omicron variant to better understand its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-south-wales-australia-s-most-populous-state-reports-first-omicron-death-101640571820208.html
27-12-2021||World||Weather disasters cost $170 billion in damages this year, $20 bn more than last||The ten most expensive weather disasters this year caused more than $170 billion (150 billion euros) in damage, $20 billion more than in 2020, a British aid group said Monday.Each year, UK charity Christian Aid calculates the cost of weather incidents like flooding, fires, and heat waves according to insurance claims and reports the results.In 2020, it found the world's ten costliest weather disasters caused $150 billion in damage, making this year's total an increase of 13 percent.Christian Aid said the upward trend reflects the effects of man-made climate change and added that the ten disasters in question also killed at least 1,075 people and displaced 1.3 million.The most expensive disaster in 2021 was hurricane Ida, which lashed the eastern United States and caused around $65 billion in damages. After crashing into Louisiana at the end of August, it made its way northward and caused extensive flooding in New York City and the surrounding area.Spectacular and deadly flooding in Germany and Belgium in July was next on the list at $43 billion in losses.A cold snap and winter storm in Texas that took out the vast state's power grid cost $23 billion, followed by flooding in China's Henan province in July that cost an estimated $17.6 billion.Other disasters costing several billion dollars include flooding in Canada, a late spring freeze in France that damaged vineyards, and a cyclone in India and Bangladesh in May.The report acknowledged its evaluation mainly covers disasters in rich countries where infrastructure is better insured and that the financial toll of disasters on poor countries is often incalculable.It gave the example of South Sudan where flooding affected around 800,000 people."Some of the most devastating extreme weather events in 2021 hit poorer nations, which have contributed little to causing climate change," the report's press release noted.In mid-December, the world's biggest reinsurer, Swiss Re, estimated natural catastrophes and extreme weather events caused around $250 billion in damage this year.It said the total represented a 24 percent increase over last year and that the cost to the insurance industry alone was the fourth highest since 1970.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weather-disasters-cost-170-billion-in-damages-this-year-20-bn-more-than-last-101640566242274.html
27-12-2021||World||Omicron in US: New York sees 'four fold increase' in hospitalised children||With Omicron cases on the rise, New York health officials have reported an increase in hospitalized children, as the White House promised Sunday to quickly resolve the United States' Covid-19 test shortage.The New York State Department of Health warned "of an upward trend in pediatric hospitalizations associated with Covid-19," in a statement Friday.In New York City, it "identified four-fold increases in Covid-19 hospital admissions for children 18 and under beginning the week of December 5 through the current week," it said.Approximately half of the admissions are younger than five, an age group that is vaccine ineligible, the department added.The number of Covid-19 cases in the United States is on the rise, with an average of nearly 190,000 new infections daily over the past seven days, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.The arrival of the new Omicron variant, compounded by holiday celebrations that typically include travel and family reunions, have caused a rush on tests in the United States, where it is difficult to get one in many locations.Top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci on Sunday acknowledged a Covid "testing problem" and vowed to make more tests available to Americans next month."One of the problems is that that's not going to be totally available to everyone until we get to January and there are still some issues now of people having trouble getting tested," Fauci told ABC News."But we're addressing the testing problem," he added, saying it should be corrected "very soon."On Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced a raft of new measures as the United States battles its latest Covid surge, including shipping half a billion free home tests in the wake of the Christmastime testing crunch.However, the White House, whose strategy has for weeks been mainly focused on vaccinations, has faced strong criticism over the fact that many tests won't be available until January.'Extraordinarily contagious'Fauci on Sunday emphasized that the administration was ramping up to tackle the spike and stressed that Omicron was "extraordinarily contagious."Apart from overwhelming hospitals and Covid testing sites, the Covid variant has forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights in the United States, as crews called in sick or had to quarantine after exposure to the virus.Recent studies in South Africa and Britain indicate that Omicron was less likely to lead to hospitalization than the previous strains of the virus and that the duration of hospital stays and oxygen needs for patients were lower, Fauci noted.But he also warned that Omicron's apparent lower severity is likely to be neutralized by how fast it is spreading."The issue that we don't want to get complacent about... is that when you have such a high volume of new infections, it might override a real diminution in severity," Fauci said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-in-us-new-york-sees-four-fold-increase-in-hospitalised-children-101640564334838.html
27-12-2021||World||Israel approves plan to double settlers in occupied Golan Heights||Israel’s government on Sunday approved a $317 million plan to double the Jewish settler population in the Golan Heights, 40 years after it annexed the territory captured from Syria.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s cabinet voted in favour of the plan that aims to build 7,300 settler homes in the region over a five-year period, during a meeting held at the Mevo Hama community in the Golan.It calls for 1 billion Israeli shekels to be spent on housing, infrastructure and other projects with the goal of attracting roughly 23,000 new Jewish settlers to the area, seized during the 1967 Six Day War.“Our goal today is to double the population of the Golan Heights,” the right-wing Bennett said ahead of the meeting.Bennett said the recognition by the Trump administration of Israeli sovereignty over the swath of land, and the Biden administration’s indication that it will not at this point walk that decision back, prompted the new investment in the region.Entrenching Israeli control over the territory would complicate any future attempt to forge peace with Syria, which claims the Golan Heights.Israel occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed the territory, promoting settlement and agriculture there as well as creating a thriving local tourism industry.The US was the first country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan, which the rest of the international community regards as Israeli-occupied.“The Golan Heights are Israeli. This is self-evident,” Bennett said.Israel has long argued that the strategically important area has, for all practical purposes, been fully integrated into Israel since it was captured from Syria and that control of the strategic plateau is needed as protection from Iran and its allies in Syria.Tens of thousands of Israelis live in the Golan Heights, which is also home to a number of formerly Syrian Druze villages, some of which oppose Israeli control.Palestinians, Israeli forces clash in West BankIsraeli forces clashed with Palestinians in the West Bank in an area that has seen a recent uptick in friction, the Israeli military and Palestinian medics said.The clashes on Saturday were part of days of tension in the area surrounding a West Bank settlement outpost and a spike in violence elsewhere in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.During the clashes, the military said, hundreds of Palestinians threw rocks and burned tires and shots were fired in the area. The military said forces responded with live fire and “riot dispersal means,” typically tear gas and stun grenades.The military also said shots were fired from a passing vehicle toward a military post near the West Bank city of Nablus, which is south of Homesh. It was not clear if the shooting was related to the clashes.The Palestinian Red Crescent said 10 people were wounded by live fire. The Palestinian Health Ministry said one of them, a 17-year-old, was seriously wounded. Dozens of others were wounded by rubber bullets.A soldier was lightly wounded, the military said.Homesh, in the northern West Bank, was dismantled as part of Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005.But in recent years, Israeli settlers have returned to pray and established an unauthorised outpost at the site.Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the territories are now home to over 700,000 Israel settlers.Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements illegal obstacles to peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-approves-plan-to-double-settlers-in-occupied-golan-heights-101640560452851.html
27-12-2021||World||At least five killed in suicide bombing||Authorities in Congo urged churches, restaurants and hotels to step up security on Sunday, fearing more violence after a suicide bomber killed five people in eastern Congo in the first attack of its kind.Beni Mayor Narcisse Muteba, a police colonel, warned owners of popular venues in the town of Beni that they needed to add security guards with metal detectors because “terrorists” could strike again.“We are asking people to be vigilant and to avoid public places during this festive period,” Muteba told The Associated Press on Sunday.Officials initially said the death toll was six plus the suicide bomber, but Muteba revised that figure a day later to five victims. Thirteen others remained hospitalised after the blast at the entrance to the Inbox restaurant on Christmas Day.Shortly after the attack, an AFP correspondent saw the remains of three bodies at the site of the blast, the Inbox restaurant. The remains of tables, chairs, bottles and glasses were scattered across the blast site.One city hall source told AFP that two children were among the dead, as well as two local officials. More than thirty people were celebrating Christmas there when the bomb went off, two witnesses told AFP.“I was sitting there,” local radio presenter Nicolas Ekila told AFP. “There was a motorbike parked there. Suddenly the motorbike took off, then there was a deafening noise.”Rachel Magali, who had been at the restaurant with her sister-in-law and several others, described hearing a loud noise and then people starting to cry.“We rushed to the exit where I saw people lying down,” she told the AP. “There were green plastic chairs scattered everywhere and I also saw heads and arms no longer attached. It was really horrible.”A police vehicle took the wounded to a nearby medical centre, which was immediately sealed off.Saturday’s bloodshed dramatically deepened fears that Islamic extremism has taken hold in Beni, which already has suffered years of attacks by rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces, or ADF.Muteba blamed the latest attack on those rebels, whose exact links to international extremist groups have been murky. The Islamic State’s Central Africa Province has claimed responsibility for attacks blamed on ADF, but it is unknown what role exactly the larger organisation may have played in organising and financing the attacks.There have been worrying signs that religious extremism was escalating around Beni: Two local imams were killed earlier this year within weeks of each other, one of whom had spoken out against the ADF.Then in June, the Islamic State group’s Central Africa Province claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber who blew himself up near a bar in Beni without harming others. Another explosion that same day at a Catholic church wounded two people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-five-killed-in-suicide-bombing-101640560114608.html
27-12-2021||World||Putin to mull options if West refuses guarantees||Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine.Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.Putin has urged the West to move quickly to meet the demands, warning that Moscow will have to take “adequate military-technical measures” if the West continues its “aggressive” course “on the threshold of our home.”Asked to specify what such Moscow’s response could be, he said in comments aired by Russian state TV on Sunday that “it could be diverse,” adding without elaboration that “it will depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me”.In remarks broadcast on Sunday, Putin said that Russia submitted the demands in the hope of a constructive answer from the West.“We didn’t do it just to see it blocked ... but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents,” Putin said. He reaffirmed that Nato membership for Ukraine or the deployment of alliance weapons there is a red line for Moscow that it wouldn’t allow the West to cross.Separately, Russia has received a Nato proposal to commence talks on Moscow’s security concerns on Jan. 12 and is considering it, TASS news agency reported on Sunday.“We have already received this (Nato) offer, and we are considering it,” TASS quoted the foreign ministry as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-to-mull-options-if-west-refuses-guarantees-101640559902925.html
27-12-2021||World||Virus fears hit Christmas travel as flights cancelled||More than 7,000 flights have been cancelled worldwide over the Christmas weekend and thousands more delayed, a tracking website reported on Sunday, as the highly infectious Omicron variant brings holiday hurt to millions.According to Flightaware.com, more than 2,000 flights were cancelled on Sunday - including more than 570 originating from, or headed to, US airports. More than 4,000 delays were reported. Aircrew and ground staff have fallen sick or gone into quarantine after exposure to Covid, forcing Lufthansa, Delta, United Airlines, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines and other carriers to cancel flights during a peak travel period.More than 2,800 flights were scrubbed around the globe on Saturday, including more than 990 originating from or headed to US airports, with over 8,500 delays. On Friday, there were around 2,400 cancellations and 11,000 delays.Flightaware data showed United cancelled around 200 flights on Friday and nearly 250 Saturday - about 10% of those that were scheduled. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,” United said in a statement on Friday.Delta scrapped 310 flights Saturday and over 100 more Sunday, saying it has “exhausted all options and resources”.The cancellations added to the frustration for many people eager to reunite with their families over the holidays after last year’s Christmas was severely curtailed.Chinese airlines accounted for the highest number of cancellations, with China Eastern scrapping more than 1,000 flights, over 20 percent of its flight plan, on Friday and Saturday - and Air China grounding about 20 percent of its scheduled departures over the period.Infections spikeFrance recorded more than 100,000 virus infections in a single day for the first time since the pandemic struck, and Covid-19 hospitalisations have doubled over the past month as the fast-spreading omicron variant complicates the government’s efforts to stave off a new lockdown.More than 1 person in 100 in the Paris region has tested positive in the past week, according to the regional health service. Most new infections are linked to the Omicron variant, which government experts predict will be dominant in France in the coming days.The Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday it had identified the first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the Gaza Strip. The carrier is a Gaza resident who was infected within the coastal territory, ministry official Majdi Dhair told a news conference.New daily US cases from the Omicron variant have now surpassed Delta’s peak, CNN reported. Hospitalisations remain lower than the peaks earlier this year, it said. More than 69,000 people were hospitalised on Friday, CNN said, citing department of health and human services data.Americans should stay vigilant against the Omicron variant despite evidence its symptoms may be less severe because the volume of cases can still overwhelm hospitals, President Biden’s top medical adviser said on Sunday.“The issue that we don’t want to get complacent about... is that when you have such a high volume of new infections, it might override a real diminution in severity,” Anthony Fauci told the ABC talk show This Week.Israeli PM’s daughter test positive for CovidIsraeli PM Naftali Bennett went into isolation at home on Sunday and will await the results of a Covid-19 PCR test after his 14-year-old daughter tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said.The premier’s daughter had been vaccinated against Covid-19, his office said. It did not disclose whether she had been infected by Omicron or the Delta variant also prevalent in Israel.China outbreak widensThe Chinese city of Xi’an, where 13 million residents are currently confined to their homes, announced tightened restrictions on Sunday as the country recorded its biggest Covid-19 infection numbers in 21 months.China has so far stuck to a zero-Covid strategy. Still on Sunday the country reported 206 new Covid infections - the highest daily number since March 2020. Xian reported 155 new Covid patients on Sunday. Its residents have already been tested several times, authorities said, and a “total” disinfection was to begin Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-fears-hit-christmas-travel-as-flights-cancelled-101640559658645.html
27-12-2021||World||Anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu dead||South African anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, described as the country’s moral compass, died on Sunday aged 90, sparking an outpouring of tributes for the outspoken Nobel Peace Prize winner.Tutu, who had largely faded from public life in recent years, was remembered for his easy humour and characteristic smile — and above all his tireless fight against injustices of all colours. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and in recent years was hospitalised on several occasions.South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa, announcing the archbishop’s death on Sunday, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. “The passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” he said, weeks after the death of FW de Klerk, the country’s last white president.Expressing condolences, the Vatican in a statement said that Pope Francis was saddened by Tutu’s death. “Mindful of his service to the gospel through the promotion of racial equality and reconciliation in his native South Africa, his holiness commends his soul to the loving mercy of almighty God.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiapartheid-icon-archbishop-desmond-tutu-dead-101640552442143.html
27-12-2021||World||UN 'horrified' by reports of civilians massacred in Myanmar, calls for 'thorough, transparent' investigation||A UN official said Sunday he was "horrified" by credible reports that at least 35 civilians were killed and their bodies burned in Myanmar, and demanded the government launch an investigation.Two workers for non-profit group Save the Children remain missing after their vehicle was among several that were attacked and burned in the incident in eastern Kaya state.A monitoring group and local media have blamed the attack on junta troops."I condemn this grievous incident and all attacks against civilians throughout the country," United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths said in a statement.He called for "a thorough and transparent investigation".Myanmar has been in chaos since a February coup, with more than 1,300 people killed in a crackdown by security forces, according to a local monitoring group."People's Defence Forces" (PDF) have sprung up across the country to fight the junta, and have drawn the military into a bloody stalemate of clashes and reprisals.On Saturday, photos appeared on social media purporting to show two burned-out trucks and a car on a highway in Hpruso township in Kayah state, with the charred remains of bodies inside.A member of a local PDF group said its fighters had found the vehicles Saturday morning after hearing the military had stopped several vehicles in Hpruso after clashes with its fighters nearby on Friday."When we went to check in the area this morning, we found dead bodies burnt in two trucks. We found 27 dead bodies," he told AFP on condition of anonymity Saturday."We found 27 skulls," said another witness who did not want to be named, and who said there were other dead bodies that could not be counted.Save the Children said later Saturday that two of its Myanmar staff had been "caught up" in the incident and were missing.The two had been travelling home after carrying out humanitarian work in the region, the charity said in a statement, adding it had since suspended its work in several regions.Myanmar's junta previously said its troops had been attacked in Hpruso on Friday after attempting to stop seven cars driving in a "suspicious way".Troops had killed a number of people in the following clash, spokesman Zaw Min Tun told AFP, without giving details.The Myanmar Witness monitor said it had confirmed local media reports and witness accounts from local fighters "that 35 people including children and women were burnt and killed by the military on 24th December Hpruso township".Satellite data also showed a fire had occurred around 1:00 pm (0630 GMT) on Friday in Hpruso, it added.AFP was unable to confirm the reports surrounding the clash, but AFP digital verification reporters said the images purporting to show the incident had not appeared online before Friday evening.PDF groups have surprised the army with their effectiveness, analysts have said, as the military struggles to break resistance to its rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-horrified-by-reports-of-civilians-massacred-in-myanmar-calls-for-thorough-transparent-investigation-101640547122624.html
