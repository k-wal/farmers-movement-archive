The increases are due almost entirely to the delta variant, though the omicron mutation has been detected in about 20 states and is sure to spread even more.Deaths are running close to 1,600 a day on average, back up to where they were in October. And the overall U.S. death toll less than two years into the crisis could hit another heartbreaking milestone, 800,000, in a matter of days.The situation is not as dire as last year's surge, before the public had any access to COVID-19 vaccines, but the roughly 60% of the U.S. population that is fully vaccinated is not enough to prevent hot spots.The cold weather, Thanksgiving gatherings and a big rebound in holiday travel are all believed to be playing a role, along with public weariness with pandemic restrictions.Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, likened the virus to a wildfire.“You can clear a forest of the shrubbery. But if you leave some shrubs and trees standing, the fire will find them,” Gostin said. “The virus will find you. It is searching for hosts that are not immune. The fact that you live in New England or New York doesn't insulate you.”Demand for the vaccine — with recent approval of boosters for all adults and shots for elementary school children — has been high amid the surge and the emergence of the omicron variant, whose dangers are still not fully understood. On Wednesday, Pfizer said that the initial two shots of its vaccine appear significantly less effective against omicron but that a booster dose may offer important protection.Nearly 48 million people have received a booster, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. White House officials noted the U.S. administered 12.5 million shots last week, the highest weekly total since May.“And that's critical progress as we head into the winter and confront the new omicron variant,” White House coronavirus adviser Jeffrey Zients said.At the same time, some states, notably in highly vaccinated New England, but also in the Midwest, are grappling with some of the worst surges since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals are filling up and some are reacting by canceling non-urgent surgeries and taking other crisis measures, while states are trying to get ahead of the spike by promoting boosters.Despite one of the highest vaccination levels in the country — over 74% of the population fully vaccinated — Vermont is coping with its biggest surge yet. In the last week, new cases per day are up 54%, and the number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 has climbed 18%.The virus is preying on those who haven't gotten their shots: As of Tuesday, 90% of the COVID-19 patients in intensive care were unvaccinated.“Obviously, it's not where we want to be,” Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday, calling the situation “extremely frustrating.”More than 400 people were in the hospital with COVID-19 in New Hampshire at the start of the week, breaking the record set last winter.New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu directed hospitals to set up COVID-19 “surge centers” using space normally reserved for such things as outpatient care.“Every day for the next several weeks, we're likely to see a new high in COVID hospitalizations in New Hampshire,” said Steve Ahnen, president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association. “With over 1,000 new cases a day, that number's not going to do anything but continue to go up.”Maine likewise is struggling with record-breaking COVID-19 hospitalizations.“The vast majority of patients in our hospitals are unvaccinated. That's especially true of critical care patients,” said Andy Mueller, CEO of MainHealth, the state's biggest health network. “It requires a tremendous amount of our resources to provide care.”Rhode Island's largest hospital system, Lifespan, said staffing shortages are at never-before-seen crisis levels, while Kent Hospital said it is near capacity and is considering delaying non-urgent procedures.Dr. Paari Gopalakrishnan, Kent's interim president and chief operating officer, said the spike is probably due to “people letting their guards down” during the holidays, and flu season could complicate things further.New Hampshire plans to hold a “booster blitz” on Saturday at 15 locations. Most appointments were booked.In Berlin, Vermont, Mike Labounty got his booster Tuesday."I have friends that are in their 20s that are getting sick and friends that are 60 that are getting sick,” he said. “The thing you see on Facebook and stuff like that is, I just want this to be over. I'm very sick,' so I'm just trying to avoid that."Elsewhere around the country, Indiana has seen COVID-19 hospital admissions double in the last month and is approaching levels not seen since this time a year ago, before vaccines were widely available.The number of people in intensive care in Minnesota has reached the highest level yet during the pandemic, with 98% of ICU beds occupied. Teams of military medics have been sent into Michigan and New Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-in-us-spiral-up-even-as-vaccinations-reach-200-million-milestone-101638986145582.html
08-12-2021||World||UK PM Johnson orders Christmas party probe as aide Allegra Stratton quits||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised and his adviser resigned on Wednesday after a video emerged of senior aides joking about a Christmas party at Downing Street last year when social events were banned under Covid-19 rules.The leaked footage appears to contradict more than a week of denials by Johnson and his ministers that a party took place, following newspaper reports that dozens of staff had attended an evening-long gathering on December 18, 2020.The embattled leader, facing calls for his resignation from some opposition politicians during a raucous parliamentary questions session, vowed "disciplinary action" would be taken if the investigation found rules had been broken."I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures," he said."I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused... and I apologise for the impression that it gives."Johnson added he had been "repeatedly assured" that there was no party inside his Number 10 Downing Street office and that no rules were broken.Johnson's adviser Allegra Stratton, a former political journalist who was serving as his press secretary at the time the footage was recorded, swiftly tendered her resignation.The footage showed her referring jokingly to a "fictional party" while preparing for a press conference.In a tearful statement, Stratton acknowledged her comments "seemed to make light of the rules" and said she would "regret those remarks for the rest of my days"."I understand the anger and frustration that people feel", she said, while not specifying whether a party took place.Labour party leader Keir Starmer told the prime minister that his account strained credulity."They knew there was a party, they knew it was against the rules, they knew they couldn't admit it, and they thought it was funny," he told MPs."Does the prime minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules?" he asked.The country's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, will lead the newly announced probe.Case "has been asked to establish the facts on any events on (December) 18, and that's what he will start work on," Johnson's spokesman told reporters. The team will "rightly" set its timeframe, "but obviously we want it (a report) as soon as possible."'Total incredulity'The alleged party is the latest instance of apparent government hypocrisy over restrictions after several previous scandals, including health secretary Matt Hancock resigning in June for breaking coronavirus curbs during an affair with an aide.The incendiary footage shows Stratton fielding questions from advisor Ed Oldfied and other staff during a rehearsal press conference on December 22 with no media present.The group laugh and trade jokes over a "fictional party" four days earlier, which reportedly involved food, drink, games and "secret Santa" gift-giving."This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced," Stratton laughs over joking exchanges about "cheese and wine" and whether the prime minister would "condone" such an event.At the time, London was under strict restrictions and indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned, while office parties were specifically outlawed.The video, which was leaked to broadcaster ITV News late Tuesday, has led main news bulletins, drawn millions of views online and sparked condemnation from across the political spectrum."The prime minister is responsible for losing the trust of the people. He can no longer lead on the most pressing issue facing these islands," leader of the Scottish National Party Ian Blackford said.Conservative lawmakers have also been among those demanding answers."This isn't a laughing matter," Tory MP Roger Gale told the BBC after he watched the footage with "total incredulity".The scandal has echoes of an infamous incident earlier in the pandemic involving Johnson's then-chief aide Dominic Cummings, who drove hundreds of kilometres to stay away from his London home during a lockdown.It triggered outrage over perceived double standards by the government, and is widely seen as leading to a drop in compliance with restrictions in its aftermath.With the Omicron variant spreading fast in Britain, some Conservative lawmakers said the latest scandal would make reintroducing curbs "much more difficult"."The events of the last 24 hours make it probably almost impossible now," influential backbench MP Charles Walker told Times Radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-orders-christmas-party-probe-as-aide-allegra-stratton-quits-101638983791360.html
08-12-2021||World||France says mistaken identity, man arrested not suspect in Khashoggi's murder||French authorities announced Wednesday that a man arrested at Paris-Charles De Gaulle Airport for allegedly being linked to the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was misidentified.The Paris General Prosecutor's office issued a short statement Wednesday after over 24 hours of checks, saying that the man arrested Tuesday was not the Khalid Aedh al-Otaibi who is wanted under a 2019 Turkish arrest warrant.“The (arrest) warrant does not apply to him,” the statement said, without elaborating.French media reported that the mix-up was related to the fact that the detained man had an identical name to al-Otaibi.A judicial official told The Associated Press that the suspect can be held until Thursday morning at the latest, but he will likely be released before.The Saudi Embassy in Paris always maintained that it was a case of mistaken identity, saying the arrested man “had nothing to do with the case in question.”A person named Khalid Aedh Al-Otaibi was one of over a dozen Saudi officials sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2018 over Khashoggi’s killing. He was also mentioned in the declassified U.S. intelligence report that said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had “approved” the operation that killed Khashoggi. The report used an alternate English transliteration of his last name.Khashoggi was killed after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee, who was waiting outside. Turkish officials allege Khashoggi, who had written critically about Saudi Arabia’s crown prince for The Washington Post, was killed by a team of Saudi agents and then dismembered with a bone saw.The Saudi government admitted to the murder under intense international pressure, and held a closed-door trial, though never released the names of the accused.The short-lived arrest came at a particularly sensitive political moment for all involved.French President Emmanuel Macron had just made a point to visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his recent tour through the Middle East.For Prince Mohammed, he’s still on his first major tour of all the Gulf Arab states since Khashoggi’s slaying, heading later Wednesday to Qatar.And for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who just left Qatar, he hopes to bury a long-running feud with the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates over his country offering a haven for Islamists in the Mideast. Erdogan hopes that will encourage Arab investment into Turkey as its lira currency craters amid an economic crisis there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-mistaken-identity-man-arrested-not-suspect-in-khashoggi-s-murder-101638982989363.html

Germany exports over $100 billion worth of products - from vehicles to machinery to pharmaceutical products - to China each year,” the Global Times reported recently.More than 7,000 German enterprises in China and more than 2,000 Chinese companies in Germany currently operate.Interestingly, Xi Jinping had met Olaf Scholz in 2017 when the latter was the mayor of Hamburg during that year’s G20 summit in the German city.During their interaction, Xi had praised Hamburg as “one of the cities with the most Chinese-funded enterprises in Germany and even in Europe. The city enjoys the unique geographical advantage in promoting connectivity between Asia and Europe and participating in the “Belt and Road” construction.”“It is not only an important port linking the China-EU Maritime Silk Road, but also becomes an important terminal for China-EU freight trains,” Xi had then told Scholz, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.“Hamburg supports the ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, and is willing to actively participate in relevant cooperation and believes that the connectivity construction will build a brighter world,” Olaf Scholz had told Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-calls-for-new-level-of-ties-with-germany-under-olaf-scholz-101638974241516.html
08-12-2021||World||Taliban deploy dozens of officials at Afghan embassy, consulates in Pakistan||The Taliban have posted four senior officials and dozens of junior operatives at the Afghan embassy and consulates in Pakistan in recent weeks, reflecting Islamabad’s close ties with the setup in Kabul.One of the senior Taliban officials was deployed at Afghanistan’s embassy in Islamabad and the others at consulates in Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta, people familiar with the matter said.“This has happened even though there is no formal recognition of the Taliban’s interim government in Kabul by any country, not even Pakistan. It is a de facto recognition of the Taliban administration,” said one of the people cited above.Dozens of junior Taliban operatives have been sent to the four missions to take over operations and to keep an eye on diplomats posted during the term of the former Ashraf Ghani government, which collapsed when the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15.An Afghan diplomat appointed by the Ghani government in Bangladesh switched over to the Taliban side and was also sent to Pakistan recently, the people said.The Taliban have sought to play down the posting of officials to Pakistan, with spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid contending that they are not official envoys. The Taliban have said these officials were meant to help Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and to facilitate the travel of people who wish to visit Afghanistan.Muhammad Shokaib, who has used the aliases Mosa Farhad and Qari Yousaf Ahmadi and served as a Taliban spokesman, is the de facto ambassador in Islamabad. The Taliban’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, known to be close to the Pakistani establishment, issued official letters regarding the appointment of the officials in Pakistan.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad had been without a head since July, when the Ghani government recalled ambassador Najibullah Alikhil and other staff to protest the kidnapping and assault of the envoy’s daughter by unidentified men. She was abducted from a commercial district in the heart of Islamabad and held for several hours. Pakistan denied she was kidnapped, taking ties to a low at the time.The Taliban have also been making efforts for several months to woo diplomats appointed by the Ghani government in key countries, including West Asian states and India, to work for the setup in Kabul but have been unable to make much headway. In some cases, Muttaqi himself has been involved in these efforts, the people said.Some 70 Afghan missions around the world are still using Afghanistan’s tricolour flag and issuing a limited number of visas, mainly for humanitarian workers. However, they are grappling with a funds crunch that has resulted in cutting down the number of local staff and some functions.Diplomats appointed by the former government have also been enthused by the UN General Assembly’s move on Monday to defer a decision on who will represent Afghanistan at the world body. This effectively allows the Ghani government’s representative, Ghulam Mohammad Ishaqzai, to remain as the envoy.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said that in the absence of recognition from the world community, the Taliban is trying “out of the box solutions to gain some sort of de facto legitimacy”.He added, “Obviously, the fact that Pakistan has allowed the mission in Islamabad to be run by the Taliban has given them the confidence that they can try something similar in other countries. There will be some push back from the previous regime’s diplomats but this opposition will be difficult in the absence of financial support.”

08-12-2021||World||9 Indo-Canadian gangsters held as major drug trafficking ring busted in Canada||Nine alleged gangsters of Indian origin were among those arrested and charged by law enforcement in two Western provinces in Canada, in coordination with federal agencies, as they busted a major drug trafficking ring.The investigations that were part of the joint operation lasted 18 months and targeted a “violent drug trafficking network operating in Calgary and throughout Western Canada”, according to a statement issued by the Calgary Police Service (CPS).The CPS operation in Alberta resulted in the arrest of nine individuals while that undertaken by police in the province of Saskatchewan led to the apprehension of six more persons.Multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the operations including CPS units, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Saskatoon Police Service, Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, Canada Border Services Agency, and Alberta Sheriffs.Investigators in Calgary alleged that the network “had been engaged in conflict with a rival drug trafficking network in the city, and that combined, the two groups were responsible for more than 20 violent events in Calgary that spanned just over a year, including a double homicide that occurred in April 2019”.The alleged gang members are mainly Indo-Canadians. Those arrested in Calgary were identified as Amandeep Saggu, 31, Ravneet Gill, 25, Prabhjyot Bhatti, 22, Jarmanjit Datewas, 23, Jaskaran Sidhu, 22, and Jasman Dhaliwal, 19. Also arrested in Calgary were Steven Whyte, 27, Safwan Riaz, 22 and Irkham Farooq, 23.Those arrested in Saskatoon included 26-year-old Japjee Minhas, 28-year-old Rajandeep Singh and 21-year-old Gurkeert Hehar. Also arrested were Ali Sarfraz, 26, Andrew Karamat, 23, and Rachel Kidd, 28.“From start to finish, this investigation required an incredible amount of coordination and patience from our investigators, who worked tirelessly to hold these individuals accountable. Though our work is not over, these charges are significant, and a major step towards protecting Calgarians put at risk by drug trafficking and the related violence that follows,” Staff Sergeant Greg Cooper of the CPS Guns & Gangs Unit, said.Among the material recovered by CPS were six firearms, over 55,000 Canadian dollars worth of drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl pills and patches, crack cocaine, marijuana, phenacetin, benzodiazepine, and prescription pills, and over 300,000 in Canadian currency.Seizures in Saskatoon included 226,600 Canadian dollars, 4177.96 grams of cocaine, 166.99 grams of fentanyl, 67.06 grams of methamphetamine, 568.92 grams of marijuana and six vehicles.While Indo-Canadian gangs have a history going back decades of operating in the province of British Columbia, the results of the operation announced on Tuesday are the latest evidence of their area extending further into other provinces of Canada. Multiple arrests linked to drugs and violent gang activity were also reported in Ontario this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-indo-canadian-gangsters-held-as-major-drug-trafficking-ring-busted-in-canada-101638969321464.html

Whether they come or not nobody cares,” he said. “It exposes fully that the Australian government has been so blindly following certain country’s steps that it doesn’t tell right from wrong, and has no bottom line,” Wang said without directly referring to the US decision on diplomatic boycott.“China deplores and rejects this and has lodged stern representations with Australia,” he said.A Chinese official media report quoted Wang as saying that China had “lodged strong representations” to Australia on the decision. “Australia’s move to connect the Winter Olympics with the so-called human rights issue in Xinjiang is a serious violation of the principle of political neutrality of sports enshrined in the Olympic Charter and also against the Olympic Motto of ‘together’,” Wang was quoted as saying.China on Tuesday accused the US of violating the Olympic spirit by announcing a diplomatic boycott of February’s Beijing Winter Games, warning Washington that it will “pay for its practices”, in a new diplomatic feud that’s certain to further strain ties already at the lowest point in decades.On Monday, the White House said government officials would boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of China’s human rights “atrocities”, although American athletes are free to compete at the Games, scheduled to begin on February 4.The White House had called China’s human rights record “egregious”.“US diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC’s egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang, and we simply can’t do that,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a daily press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-joins-us-in-diplomatic-boycott-of-winter-olympics-angers-china-101638963740554.html
08-12-2021||World||China is world's largest prison for journalists: RSF report||At least 127 journalists are currently detained in China, the “world’s biggest captor of journalists”, where President Xi Jinping has created a “nightmare” of media oppression worthy of the Mao Zedong-era, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a leading journalism advocacy group, has said in a report.The report quoted RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire as saying that China was a country in the midst of a “frantic race backwards” as Chinese citizens continue to lose press freedom.Titled “The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China,”, the Paris-based RSF said the report reveals the “…extent of the regime’s campaign of repression against the right to information”.The report indicates how Beijing views journalism - not as a tool to provide information to the public to make informed decisions but as an instrument of state propaganda. It also focuses on the deterioration of press freedom in Hong Kong, which was once a model of press freedom but now has an increasing number of journalists arrested in the name of national security.The 42-page report listed how Chinese authorities used the fight against terrorism as a pretext to detain Uighur journalists reporting on Xinjiang where at least million from minority communities have been detained in high-security camps, said to be “vocational training institutes” by the government.The RSF report says at least 71 Uighur journalists - more than half of those detained in China - are currently in detention.“The number of taboo topics keeps rising. Not only those typically deemed “sensitive” - such as Tibet, Taiwan or corruption - are subject to censorship, but also natural disasters, the #MeToo movement or even recognition of health professionals during the Covid-19 crisis,” the report said.At least ten journalists and online commentators were arrested in 2020 for their reporting on the Covid-19 crisis in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged in late 2019.“To this date, two of them, Zhang Zhan and Fang Bin, are still detained”.For Chinese journalists, the situation is worse.The report also described a ruling introduced in October 2019 that all Chinese journalists must use a smartphone app called “Study Xi, Strengthen the Country”, which could enable collection of personal data.“To receive and renew their press cards, journalists will soon have to undergo a 90-hour annual training partly focusing on Xi Jinping’s ‘Thought’. Journalists are already required to download the ‘Study Xi, Strengthen the Country’ propaganda application that can collect their personal data,” the report said.Foreign journalists too are facing trouble.“China’s intimidation of foreign reporters, based on surveillance and visa blackmail, forced 18 of them to leave the country in 2020. Gui Minhai, Yang Hengjun and Cheng Lei, three foreign journalists of Chinese descent, are now being detained on espionage charges,” RSF said.Chinese diplomatic missions are also a source of pressure against information freedom in democracies, the RSF said.Referring to the partial opening up under the previous government, Deloire writes: “President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has put a brutal end to this partial opening and restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime”.Democracies, he said, should identify all “…appropriate strategies to dissuade the Beijing regime from pursuing its repressive policies and to support all Chinese citizens who love their country and want to defend the right to information”.RSF ranks China 177th out of 180 in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index, just two places above North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-largest-prison-for-journalists-rsf-report-101638961160212.html

08-12-2021||World||New lineage of Omicron variant found: What does this mean?||A new lineage of the Omicron variant has been found in several samples in Australia's Queensland, as scientists across the world are engaged in decoding more about the new variant, which appears to be more transmissible than Delta. According to reports from Australia's Queensland, this new lineage has been found in a traveller who arrived from South Africa. This lineage has about half the gene variations of the original Omicron.Here is what we know about this new lineage and what does this mean1. The two lineages are now known as BA. 1 and BA. 2, the original Omicron known as BA.1.2. Some mutations are common for both variants. Based on the mutations present in these two lineages, some reports claimed the new lineage is difficult to be detected in a typical screening. Scientists allayed fears by saying that this does not mean that if a person gets infected by this lineage of Omicron, they will not test positive. In RT-PCR tests, they will test positive in both lineages. 🦠The B.1.1.529 #Omicron lineage is now split to BA.1 and BA.2 . BA.1 will now have the original lineage and BA.2 will encomapss the new outlier with around 24 mutations. 🔴 PS: This is for better epidemiological surveillance & nothing to be scared yet. https://t.co/4y1RVf5Ej83. Senior scientist at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Vinod Scaria, said there is nothing to be scared of about the new lineage. This is for better epidemiological surveillance.4. A new lineage is not a new variant, scientists have clarified. It is a subset5. A new lineage may or may not have any impact on the spread of the infection. Delta too had many lineages, including Delta Plus, which did not have more transmissibility than Delta.Omicron, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, has triggered fresh apprehension across the world as the variant is believed to be spreading faster than Delta. However, the variant has not led to severe illness and scientists are of the view that Omicron might indicate that the pandemic is now gradually moving to the endemic stage where the infection will come every year. Omicron has not caused shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell in any of the cases across the world. Omicron patients, with mild symptoms like tiredness, sore throat, are mostly recovering from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-lineage-of-omicron-variant-found-what-does-this-mean-101638949817178.html
08-12-2021||World||New video embarrasses Boris Johnson on alleged illegal party||Pressure mounted on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson after a video emerged showing key aides joking about a party in Downing Street last Christmas at a time when such gatherings were banned.The video, obtained by ITV News and which ITV said was recorded four days after the alleged event, shows Johnson’s then press secretary, Allegra Stratton, rehearsing for a TV media briefing and saying there was “definitely no social distancing” when asked about a party. A backlash has been growing over whether Johnson’s own officials held a party in Downing Street last year in breach of the government’s own coronavirus rules, and the episode has cast further doubt over the integrity of Johnson’s administration after a rocky period.The saga has echoes of the Barnard Castle controversy of 2020, when Johnson’s then chief aide, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules and triggered weeks of negative media coverage and cries of hypocrisy, fueling the perception that it was one rule for the government and another for the governed.“There was no Christmas party,” 10 Downing Street said in a statement late Tuesday. “Covid rules have been followed at all times.”This latest furore over the Christmas party, following soon after Johnson’s botched handling of an ethics probe into a Conservative MP and a chaotic business conference speech, threatens to further damage his standing in the polls. Johnson’s popularity has steadily declined through 2021, hitting its lowest level during his premiership in November, according to a survey by Savanta ComRes.The incident may also undermine the UK’s response to the pandemic: Though Johnson’s administration has resisted introducing stricter social restrictions to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, it may wish to do so in the coming weeks. Public compliance with rules may deteriorate amid another uproar over the government not following the rules.Johnson refused to deny a party took place, while maintaining that the rules in place at the time were obeyed.“I have satisfied myself that the guidelines were followed at all times,” Johnson told broadcasters earlier Tuesday when asked about the alleged party.Pandemic rules in place at the time stated: “Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity.”The Daily Mirror newspaper reported last month that Johnson’s team held a party Dec. 18 with about 40 to 50 people “cheek by jowl,” citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t identify.It wasn’t clear from the footage whether the aides were discussing an actual party, or a fictional one for the purposes of the rehearsal.‘Cheese and Wine’In the video obtained by ITV, Downing Street aide Ed Oldfield is heard to ask: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognize those reports?”Stratton visibly struggles to respond, before saying: “What’s the answer?”One aide is heard to say: “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine.” Stratton says: “Is cheese and wine alright?”Through laughter, she finally says: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.”10 Downing Street, Stratton and Oldfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Bloomberg News.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said the government’s actions were “shameful” at a time when the rules separated people from their families.“The Prime Minister now needs to come clean, and apologize,” he said. “It cannot be one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone else.”Johnson is also already facing criticism from his own backbenches about the affair. Conservative MP Roger Gale said the incident “has all the hallmarks of another ‘Barnard Castle’ moment.”“No. 10 clearly has some serious questions to answer,” Gale said on Twitter. “Fast.”Separately, the Daily Mirror reported late Tuesday that former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson also held an illegal Christmas party last year in his government ministry, another blow for Johnson’s administration.The new footage about the Downing Street Christmas party coincided with a separate row about whether Johnson and his team had told the truth over a controversy during the Afghanistan evacuation. Evidence from a Foreign Office whistleblower published Tuesday said Johnson personally intervened to save staff and animals at a rescue charity, a decision which came at the expense of helping Afghans who had assisted British forces. Johnson’s office strongly denied the claim, yet LBC News later obtained a letter from Johnson’s parliamentary aide to the head of the charity, which showed the aide giving the authorization for the evacuation, heavily suggesting Johnson’s involvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-video-embarrasses-boris-johnson-on-alleged-illegal-party-101638942815037.html

Over half of those polled, 53%, also supported the Justin Trudeau government emulating the Joe Biden administration in “taking the same measure as the US, denying any diplomatic presence in Beijing,” according to a release from ARI.Of the respondents, 40% were for Canadian athletes to remain away from the Olympics, while a similar number, 37%, favoured a boycott by Canadian fans.Meanwhile, ARI also found that “the vast majority continue to view the country unfavourably”. That translates to 84% of those surveyed.The decision in these regard from Ottawa is still pending and could have an adverse impact on ties with China if it is along the lines of that announced by Washington. Ottawa is also expected to soon announce its decision on keeping the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei away from Canada’s 5G infrastructure.China has also issued warnings to Canada over taking such action, which has already been taken by countries like the United States and Australia. Speaking to the Waterloo, the Ontario-based Centre for International Governance Innovation on Tuesday, China’s Ambassador to Ottawa Cong Peiwu said in the context of a potential denial of access, “That will be sending out a very wrong signal to the Chinese companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/78-of-canadians-favour-diplomatic-boycott-of-winter-olympics-in-beijing-poll-101638942738376.html

Canberra's decision comes amid "disagreement" with China over a slew of issues that have plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), however, has clarified that their government's decision to join the US diplomatic boycott of next year's Beijing Olympics will have no impact on athletes' preparations for the Winter Games.Acknowledging the AOC president's remarks on the participation of Australian athletes, the Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “We wish the Australian athletes excellent performance at the Winter Olympics and believe they will also witness a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympics in China.”Taking quick note of the bilateral ties between the two nations, the Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “As we all know, the blame for the current predicament of China-Australia relations lies squarely on the Australian side.”“According to Olympic rules, dignitaries are invited by their respective National Olympic Committee (NOC) to attend the Olympic Games,” the embassy statement said. “It is up to the NOC to decide whether to extend invitations or not. Mountains can not stop the river from flowing into the sea. Australia’s success at the Beijing Winter Olympics depends on the performance of Australian athletes, not on the attendance of Australian officials, and the political posturing by some Australian politicians.”Urging the Australian side to take practical measures to create favorable conditions for improving bilateral relations, the Chinese official said, “The Australian side's statement that it will not send officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics runs counter to its publicly pronounced expectation to improve China-Australia relations.”Also Read | US will ‘pay’ for diplomatic boycott of Olympics: ChinaThe AOC had earlier said in a statement that it respected how “diplomatic options” were a matter for governments and maintained that politics and sport should be separated.Meanwhile, Australian PM Scott Morrison insists that the strained relations with Beijing had left Australia unable to discuss China's moves to slow and block imports of Australian goods as well as alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the reason behind the US boycott.“Australia will not step back from the strong position we've had standing up for Australia's interests and obviously it is of no surprise that we wouldn't be sending Australian officials to those Games,” Morrison said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mountains-can-t-stop-the-river-china-responds-to-australia-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics-101638931916334.html

Between January and October this year, sales totaled $6.78 billion, up 5.5%, as logistics problems subsided, Chamber data showed.China's push to boost its own food inventories during the pandemic also diverted some of Brazil's trade with the Arabs, leading countries such as Saudi Arabia to step up the promotion of domestic food production while seeking alternative suppliers."It's a turning point. The Saudis are still big buyers, but they are also net re-exporters of food," the Chamber said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-unseats-brazil-to-become-top-food-supplier-to-arab-nations-after-15-years-101638933783320.html

The Danish health ministry said Magnus Heunicke had taken a test early in the day, before his planned meeting with his 26 European Union counterparts.Omicron cases in nine African countriesOmicron cases have now been confirmed in at least nine African countries, with some officials reporting that initial cases appear to be mild. These include Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe.South Africa remains the epicentre of the outbreak, with experts saying that the overwhelming majority of its thousands of new cases per day are of the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jab-mandates-absolute-last-resort-who-101638925644609.html

In lab experiments conducted at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, it was observed that Omicron resulted in about a 40-fold reduction in levels of neutralising antibodies produced by people who had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech SE shot, compared with the strain detected in China almost two years ago.Also Read | Omicron versus Delta: Fauci breaks down what is known and what's unknownAlex Sigal, the head of research at the laboratory, said that the loss of immune protection is “robust, but not complete” and that further efficacy studies are needed to appropriately take on board the exact extent of the vaccine's impact in mitigating the disease caused by this new strain.Speaking at an online presentation of the first reported experiments gauging the efficacy of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine against Omicron, Sigal said there will be “more breakthrough” of vaccine-induced immunity as he pushed the idea of getting booster shots to protect oneself against the new variant.“A good booster probably would decrease your chance of infection, especially severe infection leading to more severe disease,” the Bloomberg news agency quoted the researcher as saying. “People who haven’t had a booster should get one, and people who have been previously infected should be vaccinated.”Although these are early studies into the efficacy of existing vaccines against Omicron, the preliminary results have raised concerns that immune protection from vaccination or a previous bout of Covid-19 may be insufficient to stop reinfections or stem a fresh wave of cases and hospitalisations.Also Read | Omicron variant: What we know so far on cases in India and vaccine efficacyA top WHO official, however, said on Tuesday that there is no reason to assume that Omicron is more severe than the variants which came before, or that existing vaccines will fail against it. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation's emergencies director, told AFP in an interview that there currently is no indication to suggest existing vaccines would fail to protect people who contract Omicron against the worst outcomes of the disease.A similar assurance was echoed on Tuesday by US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, who said that Omicron is certainly not worse than the previous strains, including Delta.However, both the experts agreed that more epidemiological data from around the world is needed to affirm scientific consensus on this. Since South Africa announced the discovery of Omicron on November 25, about 450 researchers globally have been working to isolate the variant from patient specimens, grow it in labs, verify its genomic sequence, and establish methods to test it in blood plasma samples, according to WHO.Sigal’s laboratory was the first to isolate the Beta variant, a strain of the coronavirus that was identified in South Africa late last year. The latest research in his lab involved testing 14 blood plasma samples collected from a dozen people who had been given a second Pfizer-BioNTech shot about a month earlier to gauge the concentration of antibodies needed to neutralise or block the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-provides-less-immunity-to-omicron-than-to-other-strains-early-study-101638923992898.html
08-12-2021||World||Biden, Putin hold key summit on Ukraine||US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin held two hours of virtual talks on Ukraine and other disputes on Tuesday, Russian state TV reported, amid Western fears that Moscow is poised to invade its southern neighbour.Russian TV footage showed Biden and Putin greeting each other in a friendly manner at the start of what was expected to be a tense exchange. Biden told Putin he hoped their next meeting would be in person.The Kremlin has said it hopes the two leaders can hold an in-person summit to discuss what it has described as the lamentable state of US-Russia relations, which have sunk to their lowest since the end of the Cold War.US officials said before the video conference that Biden would tell Putin that Russia and its banks could be hit with the toughest economic sanctions yet if it attacks Ukraine.They said the sanctions, which one source said could target Russia’s biggest banks and Moscow’s ability to convert roubles into dollars and other currencies, were designed to dissuade Putin from using tens of thousands of troops massed near the Ukrainian border to attack its southern neighbour.The Kremlin, which said before Tuesday’s meeting it did not expect any breakthroughs, has denied harbouring any intention to attack Ukraine and has said its troop posture is defensive.But Moscow has voiced rising vexation over Western military aid to Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic that has tilted towards the West since a popular revolt toppled a pro-Russian president in 2014, and what it calls creeping Nato expansion.Moscow has likewise questioned Ukrainian intentions and said it wants guarantees that Kiev will not use force to try to retake territory lost in 2014 to Russia-backed separatists, a scenario Ukraine has ruled out.“We’re looking for good, predictable relations with the US. Russia has never intended to attack anyone, but we have our concerns and we have our red lines,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.The United States has shared intelligence about Russian military movements along the border with allies, a senior Biden administration official confirmed to reporters while previewing the call.The official did not go into details but said “we have seen the movement of additional capabilities and forces to the vicinity of Ukraine in multiple different areas. And these movements are consistent with the planning that we see underway for a military escalation in Ukraine”.The United States and allies have discussed crippling financial sanctions as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We have had intensive discussions with our European partners about what we would do collectively in the event of a major Russian military escalation in Ukraine. And we believe that we have a path forward that would involve substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the US that would impose significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed”.Asked if the US could consider deploying troops to defend Ukraine, the official refused to discuss “the particular sensitive challenges” that Biden will lay out for Putin but said, “the US not seeking to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force, as opposed to a combination of support for the Ukrainian military, strong economic countermeasures, and the substantial increase in support and capability to our Nato allies to ensure that they remain safe”.(With inputs from Yashwant Raj)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-hold-key-summit-on-ukraine-101638925018646.html

Robert E Lee that drew violent protests to Charlottesville, Virginia, will be melted down and turned into a new piece of public art by an African American heritage center.The city council decided how to dispose of the now-removed statue at the center of the Unite the Right rally in 2017 during a meeting that stretched into Tuesday morning, The Daily Progress reported.The Lee statue and another of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson were removed on the same day in July. The city received six proposals from entities interested in taking one of both of them, according to the newspaper.Council members voted to donate the Lee statue to the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center, whose “Swords Into Plowshares” proposal received almost 30 letters of support from organizations and individuals, including the Descendants of Enslaved Communities at the University of Virginia and descendants of Monticello's enslaved community.“Our hope with Swords into Plowshares' is to create something that transforms what was once toxic in our public space into something beautiful that can be more reflective of our entire community's social values,” said the center's executive director, Andrea Douglas.“We're giving people opportunities to engage with our own narratives and our own histories. This project offers a road map for other communities to do the same.”The Black-led heritage center's news release also said that a “community engagement process” will inform the public art project, for which $590,000 has already been raised.The council voted only on the disposition of the Lee statue Tuesday morning, the newspaper reported. Its removal this summer came more than five years after racial justice activists renewed a push to take down it down, drawing opposition from racist groups that culminated in the deadly 2017 rally.Virginia's highest court ruled the city could remove the Lee and Jackson statues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lee-statue-in-charlottesville-to-be-melted-down-for-new-art-101638922034856.html
08-12-2021||World||France arrested wrong man over Khashoggi murder: Saudi Arabia||French police on Tuesday arrested a man suspected of involvement in the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but Saudi officials claimed that they were holding the wrong man.Investigators were seeking to confirm that the man carrying a passport in the name of Khalid Alotaibi was indeed the suspect by the same name sought by Turkey and sanctioned by the US over the gruesome killing of Khashoggi that unleashed a wave of global anger.The Saudi embassy in Paris issued a statement late Tuesday saying the man arrested "has nothing to do with the case in question" and demanded his immediate release.A security source in Saudi Arabia added that "Khaled Alotaibi" was a very common name in the kingdom, and that the Alotaibi the French thought they were holding was actually serving time in prison in Saudi Arabia along with "all the defendants in the case".The man was detained by border police on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by Turkey as he was about to board a flight to Riyadh from Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport, judicial and airport sources told AFP, asking not to be named.A man named Khalid Alotaibi is one of 26 Saudis charged in absentia by Turkey over the killing in a trial that got underway in October 2020. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment.Two of the 26 being tried in absentia in Turkey are former aides to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. No Saudi official has ever faced justice in person in Turkey for the killing.Alotaibi is also one of 17 people that the US Treasury designated for sanctions in 2018 over their role in the murder.Identity being confirmedA source close to the case said that the Interpol Red Notice issued at Turkey's request came up as the traveller was passing through passport control.Checks were still underway on Tuesday evening to ensure his identity is correct and that the arrest warrant applies to him, another source close to the case added, noting that his detention can last up to 48 hours.If confirmed as the suspected assassination team member, he will appear before French prosecutors.He would have the right to challenge extradition to Turkey. If he does, the French judiciary must decide whether to keep him in detention pending a formal Turkish extradition request, or to free him on condition that he does not leave France.It can typically take several weeks for a court to rule on whether to hand him over to Turkey against his will.In September 2020, a Saudi court overturned five death sentences issued after a closed-door trial in Saudi Arabia, sentencing the accused to 20 years in prison instead.Khashoggi -- a prominent Saudi who lived in self-exile in the United States and wrote for The Washington Post -- entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 to file paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee.According to US and Turkish officials, a waiting Saudi hit squad strangled him and dismembered his body, which has never been retrieved.The gruesome murder sparked international outrage that continues to reverberate, with Western intelligence agencies accusing Prince Mohammed bin Salman of authorising the killing.Not 'forgotten'Tuesday's arrest comes only days after French President Emmanuel Macron defended his decision to include Saudi Arabia in a tour of Gulf states, saying the visit did not mean that he had "forgotten" about the Khashoggi case.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the order to murder Khashoggi came from "the highest levels" of the Saudi government.But Erdogan has never directly blamed Prince Mohammed and there have in recent months been signs of the thaw between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.Crucially there have also been signs after many years of tensions in the wake of the 2016 failed coup bid of a thaw between Turkey and Saudi Arabia's top ally the United Arab Emirates, with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed visiting Turkey last month.On the third anniversary of the killing, Khashoggi's widow Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate while the murder took place, accused the US of failing to hold Saudi Arabia accountable.Media rights body Reporters Without Borders called Tuesday's arrest "excellent news" and said it had filed a legal complaint against Alotaibi for murder, torture and enforced disappearance in October 2019.RSF said it had maintained "complete confidentiality" about the complaint in order to improve the chances of his arrest during a visit to France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-arrested-wrong-man-over-khashoggi-murder-saudi-arabia-101638922936883.html

A top WHO official told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that there is no reason to assume that Omicron is more severe than the variants which came before, or that existing vaccines will fail against it.Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation's emergencies director, told AFP in an interview that there currently is no indication to suggest that Omicron, although highly infectious, causes a more severe disease than previous Covid-19 variants such as Delta. The existing vaccines should protect people who contract Omicron against the worst outcomes of the disease, he said.Also Read | Omicron can lead to stagflation in US, says top economist“We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation, and there's no reason to expect that it wouldn't be so [for Omicron],” the WHO official was quoted as saying.Ryan, however, said that more research was needed into studying the Omicron variant to appropriately take on board exactly how threatening it is poised to be. A similar assurance was echoed on Tuesday by US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, who said that Omicron is certainly not worse than the previous strains, including Delta.According to the chief medical advisor to the US president, Omicron is “clearly highly transmissible” but might actually be less severe than Delta, as indicated by the ratio between the number of infections and the number of hospitalisations in South Africa.Also Read | What we know about OmicronFauci, too, said that more epidemiological data from around the world is needed to affirm scientific consensus on this. The results from lab experiments that tested the potency of antibodies from current vaccines against Omicron should come in the next few days to a week, he added.Meanwhile, researchers in South Africa have found that Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine actually provides less immunity to the Omicron variant than to other major versions of the virus. The loss of immune protection is “robust, but not complete,” Alex Sigal, head of research at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, said in an online presentation of the first reported experiments gauging the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-not-more-severe-than-delta-existing-vaccines-will-work-who-101638921979376.html
08-12-2021||World||Omicron versus Delta: Fauci breaks down what is known and what's unknown||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday said the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which has again shut the borders of many countries in fresh apprehension, is certainly not worse than the previous variants, including Delta. Speaking to AFP, Fauci reiterated that a complete picture of the new variant might take some time. However, some areas have become quite clear.Here is what Fauci said:Transmissibility: Omicron is "clearly highly transmissible", and very likely more than Delta, Fauci said.Immune evasion: Is Omicron better at evading immunity from vaccination or previous infection? According to Fauci, the answer is yes. Evidence is epidemiological data from around the world, he said. Results from lab experiments that tested the potency of antibodies from current vaccines against Omicron should come in the next few days to a week, Dr Fauci said.On the question of severity, he said Omicron is certainly not more severe than Delta.Pfizer shot gives less immunity to Omicron than to other strains: Early study"There is some suggestion that it might even be less severe because when you look at some of the cohorts that are being followed in South Africa, the ratio between the number of infections and the number of hospitalizations seems to be less than with Delta," he said.A more transmissible virus that doesn't cause more severe illness and doesn't lead to a surge of hospitalisations and deaths is the "best-case scenario", while the worst would be if the highly transmissible variant also causes severe disease. "I don't think that worst-case scenario is going to come about, but you never know," Fauci said.First reported from South Africa, the variant has now been detected in at least 38 countries with the potent of the existing vaccines being questioned against this new variant. The variant, however, has not been linked to any deaths. The variant has over 50 mutations and does not trigger the usual symptoms like loss of taste or smell, breathing difficulties etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-versus-delta-fauci-breaks-down-what-is-known-and-what-s-unknown-101638921832741.html

08-12-2021||World||Ahead of nuclear talks, US hits Iran with new sanctions for human rights abuses||The United States slapped fresh sanctions on a dozen Iranian officials and entities for "serious" human rights abuses Tuesday, ahead of the expected resumption of nuclear talks with Tehran after they halted last week without any concrete progress.The sanctions announced by the Treasury and State Department targeted government officials and organizations involved in the repression of protesters and political activists and prisons where activists have been held in brutal conditions.The Treasury also placed several Syrian officials on its sanctions blacklist for their roles in political repression and chemical gas attacks, and Uganda's military intelligence chief was hit with sanctions for extreme abuse of people arrested for their nationality or political beliefs.The announcement came ahead of the Washington-hosted Summit for Democracy later this week, billed as a push to promote more free and open societies."The United States is committed to promoting democracy and accountability for those who abuse human rights around the world," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement."The United States will utilize its full range of tools to highlight and disrupt these abuses of human rights," he said.The Iranian sanctions singled out officials and entities involved in brutal crackdowns on protests in 2009 and 2019, including Hassan Karami, the commander of the LEF Special Units, which are focused on crowd control and protest suppression, the Treasury said.Also named was Gholamreza Soleimani, who commands the Basij, the country's Islamic militia also involved in the deadly 2009 and 2019 crackdowns.The Syrians blacklisted included two air force major generals, Tawfiq Muhammad Khadour and Muhammad Youssef Al-Hasouri, who the Treasury said was responsible for chemical gas attacks that killed numerous civilians in 2017 and 2018.Security officials considered responsible for other harsh attacks on opponents of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were also named."These senior officials and the organizations they are associated with have imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Syrians who peacefully called for change. Moreover, at least 14,000 prisoners in Syria have allegedly died as a result of torture," the Treasury said.The Ugandan hit with sanctions was the commander of the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence, Major General Abel Kandiho.People arrested by Kandiho's bureau "were subjected to horrific beatings and other egregious acts by (military intelligence) officials, including sexual abuse and electrocutions, often resulting in significant long-term injury and even death," the Treasury said.The US Treasury "will continue to defend against authoritarianism, promoting accountability for the violent repression of people seeking to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms," said Andrea Gacki, head of the Treasury's sanctions office.The expansion of the broad US sanctions on Tehran came after the first direct negotiations on limiting Iran's nuclear program in five months failed to make headway, with both sides blaming the other for unwillingness to give ground.But talks are to resume on Thursday, Tehran's main negotiator said during a visit to Moscow."I deemed it necessary at this stage to consult the Russian authorities in order to continue the talks in a constructive atmosphere," Ali Bagheri, Tehran's chief nuclear negotiator, said on Tuesday according to Iranian state television's Iribnews website.A US official was cautious about the next round.“We are much less concerned about the when, and much more concerned about... whether Iran comes back to Vienna prepared to engage in good faith, prepared to engage sincerely, and steadfastly as we are,” the official told reporters on grounds of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-nuclear-talks-us-hits-iran-with-new-sanctions-for-human-rights-abuses-101638920441022.html
08-12-2021||World||Don’t invade Ukraine, Joe Biden warns Vladimir Putin||President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned President Vladimir Putin that the United States and its allies will respond with “strong economic and other measures” if he invaded neighbouring Ukraine, which has seemed imminent because of the amassing of Russian troops along the border.In a video call with the Russian leader, Biden also reiterated US support of his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy, according to a readout issued by the White House.The two leaders also discussed the US-Russia dialogue on Strategic Stability, a separate dialogue on ransomware, as well as joint work on regional issues such as Iran.The United States and allies have watched with concern as Russia has deployed close to 100,000 troops to the border with Ukraine and fear a repeat of 2014 when Russia had snatched Crimea from Ukraine after a similar military build-up.A senior Biden administration official told reporters on Monday that the US president will “raise these concerns” and he will also make clear that there “will be very real costs should Russia choose to proceed”.The United States and allies have discussed crippling financial sanctions as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We have had intensive discussions with our European partners about what we would do collectively in the event of a major Russian military escalation in Ukraine. And we believe that we have a path forward that would involve substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the United States that would impose significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed”.Joe Biden held discussions with counterparts from France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom ahead of the call with Vladimir Putin to present a joint front. The leaders underscored their support for the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine and called upon Putin to de-escalate tensions and pursue diplomacy, according to a White House readout of the discussions.The United States has shared intelligence about Russian military movements along the border with allies, a senior Biden administration official confirmed to reporters while previewing the call.The official did not go into details but said “we have seen the movement of additional capabilities and forces to the vicinity of Ukraine in multiple different areas.

08-12-2021||World||India expresses concern over Aung San Suu Kyi’s conviction||India on Tuesday expressed concern at Myanmar’s deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi being convicted in what was described as a “sham trial”, and called on all stakeholders in the neighbouring country to settle their differences through dialogue.On Monday, Suu Kyi was found guilty by a court in military-ruled Myanmar of charges of incitement and breaching Covid-19 restrictions. The conviction drew global condemnation. State-run TV reported she will serve two years in detention after the sentence was reduced from four years because of a partial pardon from Myanmar’s military chief.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi referred to the proceedings against 76-year-old Suu Kyi and others in Myanmar and said, “We are disturbed at the recent verdicts. As a neighbouring democracy, India has been consistently supportive of the democratic transition in Myanmar.”India believes that “the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld”, he said.“Any development that undermines these processes and accentuates differences is a matter of deep concern. It is our sincere hope that keeping their nation’s future in mind, efforts would be made by all sides to advance the path of dialogue,” Bagchi said.Also Read: Myanmar junta halves Aung San Suu Kyi’s jail termIndia has attempted to maintain a delicate balance between Myanmar’s military junta and democratic forces since the February 1 coup in the Southeast Asian country, mainly because of security concerns associated with the northeastern states.It has called for the restoration of the democratic process, but stopped short of strongly criticising Myanmar’s military rulers due to fears that it could push the country closer to China.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup against the democratically elected government led to protests and sparked global concern about the end of political reforms following decades of military rule.Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi has been detained since the coup along with most leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. She faces a dozen cases, including corruption charges and violations of a state secrets act, a telecommunications law and Covid-19 regulations, and has denied the charges.Suu Kyi’s supporters say the cases are baseless and designed to end her political career.The trial in the capital Naypyitaw was closed to the media and Suu Kyi’s lawyers were barred from communicating with the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expresses-concern-over-aung-san-suu-kyi-s-conviction-101638873068289.html
