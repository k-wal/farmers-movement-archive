The latest statement was made by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and former National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq about possible return of Sharif.The minister also offered to issue a visa to 71-year-old Sharif, though being a citizen of Pakistan he would not need a visa. “If Nawaz Sharif is returning, I offer him a ticket out of my own pocket,” he said.Rashid also said that the PML-N’s current President and younger brother of Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif, and the Pakistan People’s Party leader and former president Asif Ali Zardari “are the most corrupt people of this country”.He stressed that Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government will complete its tenure until 2023.Earlier, Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz last week said that Sharif would soon come back but refused to share any time line for his return.Sharif was in prison serving his term after conviction by an accountability court when the Lahore High Court allowed him to go to London for medical treatment for four weeks but he never came back at the end of the deadline.His party has maintained that Sharif would be back when allowed by the doctors.Responding to reports about his return, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gill said that the PML-N was making ground for his return as Sharif's request for visa extension is likely to be turned down.“Unnecessary announcement: Nawaz Sharif’s visa extension in the UK has been rejected. He is currently on appeal, but he knows his visa will be rejected, and he will be deported,” Gill tweeted.“Expulsion of Nawaz Sharif from London is being made up as a decision from him to return to Pakistan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-says-he-will-buy-air-ticket-for-sharif-if-he-is-returning-101640533414684.html

The fighting has left at least 2,000 people dead and 1.4 million displaced.Here’s a list of some of the deadliest attacks that rocked the nation in 2021.June: An estimated 132 lives were lost in northern Burkina Faso on June 5, 2021, when assailants targeted gold mines before attacking civic volunteers. Armed men killed women, children and men, indiscriminately and buried the bodies in three mass graves.Hundreds of houses were burnt down as thousands fled for their lives.September: A mining convoy attack in eastern Burkina Faso killed six persons and injured another seven. The convoy was returning from a gold mine and was on a stretch of road between the Sakoani and Matiacoali villages.November: In November 2021, 56 military police and civilians were found dead in a fatal assault on the country's security forces.December: The latest atrocity in Burkina Faso occurred when suspected jihadists killed 41 people. The ambush targeted a convoy of traders escorted by VDP near Ouahigouya, a town not far from the Mali border.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/burkina-faso-how-armed-conflict-cost-lives-in-troubled-african-nation-in-2021-101640531704415.html
26-12-2021||World||Swiss to permit simple legal gender transition from Jan. 1||People in Switzerland will be able to legally change gender by a visit to the civil registry office from Jan. 1, putting the country at the forefront of Europe's gender self-identification movement.Switzerland joins Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Norway as one of the few countries on the continent that allow a person to legally change gender without hormone therapy, medical diagnosis or further evaluation or bureaucratic steps.Under the new rules written into Switzerland's civil code, anyone aged 16 and above who is not under legal guardianship will be able to adjust their gender and legal name by self-declaration at the civil registry office. Younger people and those under adult protection will require guardian consent.This marks a change from the current set of regionally prescribed standards in Switzerland, which often require a certificate from a medical professional confirming an individual's transgender identity.Some cantons - semi-autonomous regions in federal Switzerland - also require a person to undergo hormone treatment or anatomical transition in order to legally change gender, while, for a name change, proof could be required that the new name has already been unofficially in use for several years.Switzerland, long known as socially conservative in the main, voted in September to legalise civil marriage and the right to adopt children for same-sex couples, one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so.With the new gender change rules, Switzerland joins just two dozen countries worldwide aiming to decouple gender choice from medical procedures.While some other European nations including Denmark, Greece and France have removed the requirement of medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or psychiatric evaluation, their rules require further steps or conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-to-permit-simple-legal-gender-transition-from-jan-1-101640529820177.html
26-12-2021||World||No trips for Afghan women unless escorted by male relative:Taliban||Afghanistan's Taliban authorities said Sunday that women seeking to travel anything other than short distances should not be offered transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative.The guidance, issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also called on all vehicle owners to offer rides only to those women wearing Islamic hijabs."Women travelling for more than 45 miles (72 kilometres) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member," ministry spokesman Sadeq Akif Muhajir told AFP on Sunday, specifying that it must be a close male relative.The guidance, circulated on social media networks, comes weeks after the ministry asked Afghanistan's television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors.The ministry had also called on women TV journalists to wear hijabs while presenting.Muhajir said Sunday that the hijab would also be required for women seeking transport. The ministry's directive also asked people to stop playing music in their vehicles.The Taliban's interpretation of the hijab -- which can range from a hair covering to a face veil or full-body covering -- is unclear, and the majority of Afghan women already wear headscarves.Since taking power in August, the Taliban have imposed various restrictions on women and girls, despite pledging a softer rule compared with their first stint in power in the 1990s.In several provinces, local Taliban authorities have been persuaded to reopen schools -- but many girls still remain cut off from secondary education.Early this month, the Islamist group issued a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing the government to enforce women's rights.The decree did not mention girls' access to education.Activists hope that the Taliban's battle to gain international recognition and get aid flowing back into one of the poorest countries in the world will lead to them making concessions to women.Respect for women's rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid.Women's rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban's previous stint in power.They were then forced to wear the all-covering burqa, only allowed to leave home with a male chaperone and banned from work and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-trips-for-afghan-women-unless-escorted-by-male-relativetaliban-101640519310340.html

The president decrees national mourning of 48 hours," said a government statement issued on Saturday evening.The government said the dead included members of an official self-defence force known as the Volunteers for the Defence of the Motherland (VDP), set up to support the army.Volunteers receive 14 days of training and are then sent out on patrols and surveillance missions, equipped with light arms.Among the victims of Thursday's attack was Ladji Yoro, considered a leader of the VDP in Burkina Faso, the statement said."The identification of the victims is still underway," said the government statement.According to local media, the ambush targeted a convoy of traders escorted by VDP near Ouahigouya, a town not far from the Mali border.The attack was the deadliest since mid-November when 57 people, including 53 gendarmes, were killed.Like its neighbours Mali and Niger, Burkina Faso has been caught up in a spiral of violence since 2015, attributed to armed jihadist groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State militant group.The fighting has left at least 2,000 people dead and 1.4 million displaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-jihadists-kill-41-in-burkina-faso-101640513640055.html
26-12-2021||World||How does coronavirus reach brain? What causes long Covid? Scientists find answer||Coronavirus can spread to many organs in the body starting from the airways, which is primarily the reason why people experience long Covid, a new study by the scientists at the US National Institutes of Health has revealed, Bloomberg reported. The findings have been described as the most comprehensive so far about the persistence of the virus in the body and brain.According to the study, it takes time in getting rid of the virus completely and, in the meantime, the virus travels from one organ to another and that is why long Covid sufferers complain of symptoms affecting organs beyond the respiratory system.In the study, researchers found persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in multiple parts of the body, including regions throughout the brain, for as long as 230 days after Covid symptoms were initially found.For this study, the tissues taken during autopsies on 44 patients who died after contracting the coronavirus during the first year of the pandemic in the US have been widely studied. Patients with long Covid symptoms were not studied in the study though the findings shed light on why some Covid patients reported symptoms in organs that are not generally affected by Covid."For a long time now, we have been scratching our heads and asking why long Covid seems to affect so many organ systems. This paper sheds some light, and may help explain why long Covid can occur even in people who had a mild or asymptomatic acute disease," said Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the clinical epidemiology centre at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who has led separate studies into the long-term effects of Covid-19.The findings have been released online in a manuscript under review for publication in the journal Nature.So which are the organs where the virus can travel? The highest burden of the virus is in the airways and the lungs. But it can infect cells throughout the entire body, including the brain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-does-coronavirus-reach-brain-what-causes-long-covid-scientists-find-answer-101640514502655.html

26-12-2021||World||Desmond Tutu, anti-apartheid icon who won the Nobel Prize, dies at 90||Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to racial discrimination in South Africa, has died. He was 90.Tutu died on Sunday in Cape Town, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent surgery. Tutu was subsequently hospitalized several times to undergo treatment for infections and other ailments.As South Africa’s first Black Anglican archbishop, Tutu used his international profile to lobby for sanctions against the White-minority government. From 1996 to 1998, he led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, aimed at exposing the injustices of the past.“Desmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead,” Ramaphosa said.Tutu’s brand of activism was shaped by his religious conviction, a mischievous sense of humor, and physical bravery that once led him to rush into a mob to save the life of a young woman about to be lynched on suspicion of being a police informer.‘Moral Universe’“This is a moral universe; God is in charge of this world,” was a favorite saying of the man who, as archbishop of Cape Town, liked to wear a T-shirt emblazoned: “Just Call Me Arch.”Born on Oct. 7, 1931, in Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, Tutu worked as a teacher before entering a theological seminary. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1961, obtained a master’s degree in theology at King’s College, University of London, and in 1975 was appointed Dean of Johannesburg, the first Black person to hold the post.With many of South Africa’s Black leaders in jail, including Nelson Mandela, and others in exile, Tutu emerged as a leading voice of Black defiance against apartheid.He became general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, an organization at the forefront of the struggle against White-minority rule, in 1978. He called for economic sanctions against the apartheid regime, in defiance of a law that made it illegal to advocate such actions. The government responded by withdrawing his passport.Nobel PrizeIn 1984, the Nobel Committee awarded Tutu its annual Peace Prize, citing his “role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa.”Tutu was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, the titular head of the Anglican Church in southern Africa, in 1986 and held the post until 1995 when he was named to lead the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Tutu openly wept while listening to victims of South Africa’s pre-1994 system of institutionalized racial discrimination, yet opposed Nuremberg-style trials for those responsible for the atrocities.Even after apartheid’s demise in 1994, Tutu never lost his outrage at injustice or his capacity for protest. Soon after South Africa’s first democratic vote, won by Mandela’s African National Congress, he criticized the new government for “stopping the gravy train just long enough to get on.”Mbeki CriticHe also accused former President Thabo Mbeki of not doing enough to combat poverty and the spread of AIDS, and for remaining silent about human-rights abuses in neighboring Zimbabwe.Tutu also clashed with Jacob Zuma, Mbeki’s successor as head of the ANC, saying he should have faced trial on charges of taking bribes from arms dealers. The case against Zuma was dropped in April 2009, just weeks before he was elected president, but was subsequently reinstated and is currently before the courts.Tutu officially retired from public life in 2010, yet continued to do charity work through his Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.When the Zuma administration denied an entry visa to the Dalai Lama in 2014, Tutu accused it of “kowtowing” to China and said he was “ashamed to call this lickspittle bunch my government.”In 2017, he joined tens of thousands of people who took to the streets to demand Zuma’s ouster, after the president’s firing of his respected finance minister caused the rand to crash. The ANC forced Zuma to quit the following year. Tutu made a public appearance in Cape Town in May 2021 to get his coronavirus vaccine and encouraged others to follow suit. Tutu is survived by his wife, Leah, and four children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/desmond-tutu-anti-apartheid-icon-who-won-the-nobel-prize-dies-at-90-101640503936927.html
26-12-2021||World||Huge spike in Covid cases as China scrambles to contain outbreak||China on Sunday reported 206 new Covid-19 cases, including 158 locally transmitted infections for December 25, the highest numbers in several months as central health authorities scramble to contain the current outbreak ahead of the February 2022 Winter Olympics.As many as 157 Covid-19 cases among the locally transmitted ones were reported from the northwestern historic city of Xian, capital of Shaanxi province, where 13 million residents are under a lockdown since Thursday.The province has recorded 500 local cases since December 9 when the current outbreak started.The numbers are low compared internationally, but the significant jump in the number of local cases will be a worry for the Chinese government which is following the principle of “zero Covid” policy, or “dynamic-zero” policy, as it tries to stamp out cases.The number of local infections more than doubled from a day earlier when the national health commission (NHC) had reported 87 domestic infections.Xian, the capital of northwest China’s Shaanxi province, has deployed tens of thousands of government workers to join frontline anti-epidemic workers who have spread out in the residential quarters of the city in a bid to contain the outbreak.The city imposed closed-off management for communities and villages on Thursday, in an effort to contain the latest Covid-19 resurgence, which has been linked to a passenger on a flight to the city from Pakistan.“Residents have also been asked not to leave the city unless absolutely necessary,” state news agency Xinhua reported.Chinese vice-premier Sun Chunlan has urged swift virus containment measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Xian during a recent inspection in the city.“To aid the fight against Covid-19, the Xian municipal committee of the Communist Party of China has sent more than 33,000 government workers to the frontline to help address staffing shortages. They have joined in the closed-off management of communities, nucleic acid testing and environmental disinfection,” the Xinhua report said.The central commission for discipline inspection on Friday said in a statement that 26 people in Xian were being held accountable for “not doing a good job” in their Covid-19 prevention and control effort, but did not specify their punishment.China reported 48 imported cases for Saturday including 18 cases in Shanghai; eight cases in Tianjin; and one in Beijing.China also reported 29 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, up from 24 a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 101,077 confirmed cases as of December 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-spike-in-covid-cases-as-china-scrambles-to-contain-outbreak-101640504195726.html

He "confessed to killing" Swati during police interrogation, reported Geo News.The sources said that Swati came to Pakistan from England on October 16 to resolve property issues with her ex-husband.The US woman was murdered the same day she arrived in Rawalpindi, they added.A case relating to her abduction was registered at Morgah Police Station in Rawalpindi on the complaint of her son.According to the sources, Habib said that he had killed Swati on October 16 and buried her body in Hangu.On December 23, the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench's Justice Raja Shahid Mehmood Abbasi ordered the city police officer (CPO) to recover Swati soon otherwise the court will summon the Inspector General of Police. The court had ordered the police to present her in court after recovering her, reported Geo News.City Police Officer Rawalpindi Sajid Kiani, addressing a press conference, said that the case is under investigation and the police will not divulge too many details at this point, reported Geo News.Kiyani did reveal some aspects that came to light during investigations, such as Swati arriving in Pakistan on October 16 and being received by her former husband, Rizwan Habib.He went on to say that three people -- Habib, his father and one other suspect -- have been arrested in connection with the case, reported Geo News.The CPO said that Wajiha's body was found from Lakki Marwat's Pizu area and that it is being brought to Islamabad.He said that further investigations are underway and further arrests are expected.The case bear's eerie resemblance with the Noor Mukadam murder case, the daughter of former Pakistani diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, who was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad on July 20.A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested from the site of the murder, under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the victim's father.The murder and its gruesome nature sparked strong condemnation and public outrage in Pakistan, and numerous calls to bring the perpetrator to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-of-kidnapped-pakistani-american-woman-found-ex-husband-confesses-killing-101640500886655.html

The people were in seven vehicles and did not stop for the military, it said.The Myanmar military could not immediately be reached for comment.Photos shared by the human rights group and local media showed the charred remains of bodies on burnt-out truckbeds.The Karenni National Defence Force, one of the largest of several civilian militias opposing the junta that led a Feb. 1 coup, said the dead were not their members but civilians seeking refuge from the conflict."We were so shocked at seeing that all the dead bodies were different sizes, including children, women and old people," a commander from the group told Reuters, asking not to be named.A villager who asked not to be named for security reasons said he was aware of the fire on Friday night but could not go to the scene as there was a shooting."I went to see this morning. I saw dead bodies that had been burnt, and also the clothes of children and women spread around," he told Reuters by phone.Meanwhile fighting in another part of the country, near the Thai border where the Myanmar military continues to clash with a rebel group, resulted in a wayward rocket-propelled grenade damaging a house on the Thailand side of the border with no deaths or injuries, Thai authorities said on Saturday.The Myanmar military carried out airstrikes https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-airstrikes-displace-more-people-along-thai-myanmar-border-2021-12-24 a day earlier on an area controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU) near the border in an escalation of fighting that flared up last week and has since sent thousands fleeing into Thailand.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi almost 11 months ago, claiming fraud in a November election that her party had won. International observers have said the ballot was fair.Civilians enraged by the coup and subsequent crackdown on protesters have been taking up arms. Many local resistance forces have sprung up across the country.The military has outlawed many opponents, labelling them traitors or terrorists, including a self-proclaimed National Unity Government that seeks to lobby the international community and prevent the junta from consolidating power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-30-including-women-and-children-killed-bodies-burnt-in-myanmar-101640493166533.html
26-12-2021||World||Omicron looms large over Christmas weekend, more than 6,000 flights cancelled||More than 6,000 flights have been cancelled worldwide over the long Christmas weekend and thousands more were delayed, a tracking website reported Saturday, as the highly infectious Omicron variant brings holiday hurt to millions.Compounding the travel chaos in the United States, severe weather in the country's west is due to wreak havoc on roadways and other routes there although it may well bring a white Christmas weekend to northwest cities Seattle and Portland.According to Flightaware.com, nearly 2,800 flights were scrubbed around the globe on Saturday, including more than 970 originating from or headed to US airports, with over 8,000 delays as of 0130 GMT.On Friday, there were around 2,400 cancellations and 11,000 delays, while Sunday cancellations have already surpassed 1,100.Pilots, flight attendants, and other employees have been calling in sick or having to quarantine after exposure to Covid, forcing Lufthansa, Delta, United Airlines, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, and many other short-staffed carriers to cancel flights during one of the year's peak travel periods.“Help @united flight cancelled again. I want to get home for Christmas,” one exasperated traveler from the US state of Vermont tweeted to the airline early Saturday.Flightaware data showed United cancelled around 200 flights on Friday and nearly 250 Saturday -- about 10 percent of those that were scheduled.A scramble to reroute pilots and planes and reassign employees was underway, but Omicron's surge has upended business."The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation," United said in a statement Friday."As a result, we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport," the airline said.Similarly, Delta scrapped 310 flights Saturday and was already cancelling several dozen more Sunday, saying it has "exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying.""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans," the company said.The cancellations added to the pandemic frustration for many people eager to reunite with their families over the holidays after last year's Christmas was severely curtailed.Chinese airlines accounted for the highest number of cancellations, with China Eastern scrapping more than 1,000 flights, over 20 percent of its flight plan, on Friday and Saturday, and Air China also grounding about 20 percent of its scheduled departures over the period.‘Treacherous’ snow conditionsAccording to estimates from the American Automobile Association, more than 109 million Americans were scheduled to travel by plane, train or automobile between December 23 and January 2, a 34 percent increase over last year.But most of those plans were made before the outbreak of Omicron, which has become the dominant strain in the United States, overwhelming some hospitals and healthcare workers.The state of New York announced Friday that it recorded 44,431 new daily positive Covid tests, a record, while new cases surged nationwide as well.On the weather front, while unseasonably warm temperatures were bathing eastern states, the National Weather Service announced winter storm warnings including a deep freeze for significant parts of the west."Anomalously cold conditions and a barrage of Pacific moisture results in prolonged periods of mountain snow and coastal/valley rain, some of which may fall heavy at times," the NWS said in an advisory.An eye-popping two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) of snow was forecast to fall this weekend, with higher accumulation in some spots, in the northern and central Sierra mountains of California and Oregon.Travel will be "treacherous to at times impossible" from the Sierras to the central Rocky Mountains at the weekend due to whiteout snow conditions, the NWS added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-looms-large-over-christmas-weekend-more-than-6-000-flights-cancelled-101640485882014.html

26-12-2021||World||Joe Biden commends Americans' ‘resilience, resolve’ in Christmas message||US President Joe Biden on Saturday commended Americans for their strength and resilience in the face of the raging Covid-19 pandemic, urging “hope and renewal” during the holiday season.In his first Christmas address as president, Biden praised “the enormous courage, character, resilience, and resolve in all of you who heal, comfort, teach, and protect and serve in ways big and small.”“You show there is much to gain in appreciation and gratitude for the gift of time and goodwill we share as we look out for one another,” Biden said in a statement with First Lady Jill Biden.“Again and again, you show how our differences are precious and our similarities infinite.”Biden, a devout Catholic, went on, saying that "for the nation, we pray for the promise found in Scripture -- of finding light in the darkness, which is also perhaps the most American of things to do."Later Saturday, the Bidens spoke to service members stationed domestically and at US bases overseas. Also present at the event was the newest addition to the first family, a German shepherd puppy named Commander.“As your commander in chief, I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you, thank you, thank you,” Biden told soldiers based in Qatar, Bahrain, Romania and the US state of Colorado.“You are the solid steel spine of the nation,” he said, recalling that his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, had served in Iraq.“Jill and I know how hard it is for you” to spend a season of togetherness away from loved ones, he added.“It's a poor substitute for what you are missing,” Biden said of his presidential message.Jill Biden, meanwhile, spoke about her father who served in the US Navy during World War II.With Americans battered by the deadly pandemic and economic hardship exacerbated by record-high inflation, the presidential couple have focused on end-of-year traditions -- pardoning a turkey on Thanksgiving and decorating the White House for Christmas -- to send messages of hope and joy.But with the country rocked by deep political divisions, even a Christmas Eve greeting turned sour for Biden Friday, when a man to whom he was wishing a merry Christmas during a video call from the White House, launched at him with an insult that is popular among supporters of Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-commends-americans-resilience-resolve-in-christmas-message-101640470310351.html

26-12-2021||World||Nasa’s James Webb telescope heads for 1.5mn-km voyage||The world’s most powerful space telescope on Saturday blasted off into orbit, headed to an outpost 1.5mn-km (930,000 miles) from Earth, after several delays caused by technical hitches.The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), some three decades and billions of dollars in the making, left Earth enclosed in its Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana.After a 27-minute, hypersonic ride into space, the 14,000-pound (6,350kg) instrument was released from the upper stage of the French-built rocket about 1,392km above the Earth, and should gradually unfurl to nearly the size of a tennis court over the next 13 days as it sails onward on its own.It is expected to take a month to reach its remote destination.It is expected to beam back new clues that will help scientists understand more about the origins of the universe and Earth-like planets beyond our solar system.Named after a former Nasa director, Webb follows in the footsteps of the legendary Hubble - but intends to show humans what the universe looked like even closer to its birth nearly 14 billion years ago.Speaking on social media, Webb project co-founder John Mather described the telescope’s unprecedented sensitivity. “#JWST can see the heat signature of a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon,” he said.All that power is needed to detect the weak glow emitted billions of years ago by the very first galaxies to exist and the first stars being formed.The telescope is unequalled in size and complexity.Its mirror measures 6.5m in diameter - three times the size of the Hubble’s mirror - and is made of 18 hexagonal sections.It is so large that it had to be folded to fit into the rocket.That manoeuvre was laser-guided with Nasa imposing strict isolation measures to limit any contact with the telescope’s mirrors from particles or even human breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-james-webb-telescope-heads-for-1-5mn-km-voyage-101640467121827.html

The number of deaths fell to 141 from 168 on Thursday.Omicron has become the dominant strain in Portugal where over 12,000 daily cases were registered on Friday, the national health agency said.“The Omicron variant is already dominant in Portugal,” the General Directorate of Health said on Saturday, “accounting for 61.5% of cases on December 22”.On Friday, Portugal recorded 11 deaths and 12,943 cases - a record since January 29.Singapore on Saturday confirmed a new cluster of Covid-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant, warning that it expects to see the highly-transmissible strain spread in the community.The primary case in the confirmed cluster at The Vinyl Bar in the city was a passenger who flew in using Singapore’s quarantine-free vaccinated travel lane on December 14. He tested negative upon arrival but received a positive result in a further government-mandated test four days later. Nine more people are linked to the cluster.At least 5,700 flights have been cancelled worldwide over the long Christmas weekend and thousands more were delayed, a tracking website reported on Saturday, as the highly infectious Omicron variant brings holiday travel headaches to millions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-china-battles-to-tackle-outbreaks-101640466485241.html
