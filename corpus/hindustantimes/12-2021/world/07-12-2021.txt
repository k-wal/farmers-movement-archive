We must tackle Covid-19 and HIV in parallel," WHO Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti said.Covid has also slowed HIV screening rates because of restrictions of movements.UNAIDS last week warned that HIV infection rates were not decreasing fast enough to reach the goal of eradicating AIDS by 2030.According to data released at the annual International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (ICASA) currently being held in South Africa's port city of Durban, only nine African countries are on track to meet the target in the next four years.The countries are Botswana, Cape Verde, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe."This scorecard is a wake-up call for African governments to stay focused on ending AIDS," Moeti said.South Africa, the country with the world's highest HIV prevalence at 20.4 percent, is hosting the week-long annual meeting bringing together scientists, politicians and activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiv-infections-drop-in-africa-but-covid-hampers-fight-who-101638901136089.html

07-12-2021||World||Google sues 2 Russians, 15 others for alleged organized crime scheme||Alphabet Inc.’s Google is suing two Russian nationals it claims are part of a criminal enterprise that has silently infiltrated more than a million computers and devices around the world, creating “a modern technological and borderless incarnation of organized crime.”In a complaint being unsealed Tuesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Google names two defendants, Dmitry Starovikov and Alexander Filippov, as well as 15 unnamed individuals. Google claims the defendants have created a “botnet” known as Glupteba, to use for illicit purposes, including the theft and unauthorized use of Google users’ login and account information.A botnet is a network of internet-connected devices that have been infected with malware. When summoned together, they can do the bidding of a hacker, often with the devices’ owners not realizing their machines have been hijacked. A swarm of devices can jam traffic at websites, run malware to steal login credentials, sell fraudulent credit cards online and grant unauthorized access to other cyber criminals.The Glupteba botnet stands out from others because of its “technical sophistication,” using blockchain technology to protect itself from disruption, Google said in the complaint. At any moment, the power of the Glupteba botnet could be used in a powerful ransomware attack or distributed denial of service attack, Google said.It’s the first time that Google is going after a botnet, a spokesperson for the Mountain View, California-based company said in an email. “We are taking this action to further protect internet users and to send a message to cyber criminals that we will not tolerate this type of activity.” The spokesperson said the company worked with the US Department of Justice on the investigation. The Department of Justice declined to comment. Starovikov and Filippov couldn’t immediately be located for comment.The tech giant brought the action to court to “create a legal liability for the cyber criminals,” the spokesperson said. To bring “to light their identities and the infrastructure they are using.” Google said Starovikov and Filippov were connected to Glupteba by the servers used to set up their Gmail addresses. “Glupteba is notorious for stealing users’ credentials and data, mining cryptocurrencies on infected hosts, and setting up proxies to funnel other people’s internet traffic through infected machines and routers,” Google’s General Counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado and Google Vice President of Engineering Royal Hansen wrote in a blog post. In June 2020, security firm Sophos published a report on the Glupteba malware, noting it “was able to continuously thwart efforts at removing it from an infected machine,” researcher Luca Nagy wrote at the time. “Glupteba also takes a variety of approaches to lay low and avoid being noticed.”Google said it was bringing the action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, as well as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act and others, to disrupt the botnet, prevent it from causing further harm, and to recover damages.Some of the most notorious cybercriminal gangs have ties to Russia, which has been accused of providing them with safe haven. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied responsibility for any hacking attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-sues-2-russians-15-others-for-alleged-organized-crime-scheme-101638891427146.html
07-12-2021||World||China gives doles to motivate couples to have 3 children||Chinese provinces have started announcing a slew of supportive measures, including childbearing subsidies and tax cuts, to motivate couples to have three children to prevent a steep decline in the birth rates in the world's most populous country.China’s national legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC), had formally endorsed the three-child policy in August, in a major policy shift to address the deepening demographic crisis in the country.It passed a revised Population and Family Planning Law, which allows Chinese couples to have three children, in an apparent attempt to address the reluctance of the Chinese couples to have more kids due to mounting costs.More than 20 provincial-level regions of China have completed modifications to their local childbirth regulations since the country passed an amendment to its Population and Family Planning Law in August.Localities including Beijing, Sichuan and Jiangxi have rolled out supportive measures highlighting increased leave for couples, such as offering parental leave, extending maternity leave and marriage leave, and increasing paternity leave, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Monday."Government should play a leading role in sharing the cost of childbearing," National Health Commission official Yang Wenzhuang said, calling for more supportive measures in nursery services, childbearing subsidies and tax cuts.The amendment to the Population and Family Planning Law allows couples to have three children and stipulates supportive measures. It also cancels relevant restrictive measures, including fines for couples who violate the law to have more children than they are permitted.China permitted all couples to have two children in 2016, scrapping the draconian decades-old one-child policy which policymakers blame for the demographic crisis in the country.The decision to permit the third child came after the once-in-a-decade census showed that China’s population grew at the slowest pace to 1.412 billion amid official projections that the decline may begin as early as next year.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population above 60 years grew to 264 million, up by 18.7 per cent last year.Adding to the crisis was the decline of marriages in the country. The number of marriage registrations in China has fallen for seven consecutive years and hit a 17-year low last year, figures from the recently released China Statistical Yearbook 2021 showed.A total of 5.87 million couples got married in China in the first three quarters of 2021, down slightly from the same period of last year, according to data released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.It is expected that the number of marriage registrations in China will continue to decline in 2021, according to recent official media reports.Outlining the reasons for the falling marriage registrations, He Yafu, a demographic expert, identified decline in the number of young people in China as one of the reasons.The population of the post-80s, post-90s and post-2000s in China has been on the decline, he said.Also, the desire of young people to get married has generally fallen due to reasons such as the high work pressure and the great improvement of women's education level and economic independence, he told state-run China Daily earlier.Another major reason is the unbalanced ratio of male and female population. In China, men outnumber women by 34.9 million as per the seventh National Census.Among them, there are 17.52 million more men in their 20s than women of marriageable age.In addition, the high cost of living, including soaring housing prices, is also a big obstacle to young people wanting to get married and have children, he said.In China, marriage and childbirth are closely linked, and the proportion of children born out of wedlock is low, He said. So the decline in marriage registration is bound to have a negative impact on the birth rate, he said.

07-12-2021||World||Facebook sued for $150 billion by Rohingya refugees over Myanmar violence||Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are suing Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook, for $150 billion over allegations that the social media company did not take action against anti-Rohingya hate speech that contributed to violence.Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are suing Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook, for $150 billion over allegations that the social media company did not take action against anti-Rohingya hate speech that contributed to violence.|#+|A US class-action complaint, filed in California on Monday by law firms Edelson PC and Fields PLLC, argues that the company's failures to police content and its platform's design contributed to real-world violence faced by the Rohingya community.In a coordinated action, British lawyers also submitted a letter of notice to Facebook's London office.Facebook did not respond to a Reuters request for comment about the lawsuit. The company has said it was "too slow to prevent misinformation and hate" in Myanmar and has said it has since taken steps to crack down on platform abuses in the region, including banning the military from Facebook and Instagram after the Feb. 1 coup.A Myanmar junta spokesman did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on the legal action against Facebook.In 2018, UN human rights investigators said the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fueled the violence.A Reuters investigation that year, cited in the U.S. complaint, found more than 1,000 examples of posts, comments and images attacking the Rohingya and other Muslims on Facebook. Almost all were in the main local language, Burmese.The invective included posts calling the Rohingya or other Muslims dogs, maggots and rapists, suggested they be fed to pigs, and urged they be shot or exterminated.The posts were tolerated in spite of Facebook rules that specifically prohibit attacking ethnic groups with "violent or dehumanising speech" or comparing them to animals.Facebook has said it is protected from liability over content posted by users by a US internet law known as Section 230, which holds that online platforms are not liable for content posted by third parties. The complaint says it seeks to apply Myanmar law to the claims if Section 230 is raised as a defense.Although U.S. courts can apply foreign law to cases where the alleged harms and activity by companies took place in other countries, two legal experts interviewed by Reuters said they did not know of a successful precedent for foreign law being invoked in lawsuits against social media companies where Section 230 protections could apply.Anupam Chander, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said that invoking Myanmar law wasn't "inappropriate." But he predicted that "it's unlikely to be successful," saying that "it would be odd for Congress to have foreclosed actions under US law but permitted them to proceed under foreign law."More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar's Rakhine state in August 2017 after a military crackdown that refugees said included mass killings and rape. Rights groups documented killings of civilians and burning of villages.Myanmar authorities say they were battling an insurgency and deny carrying out systematic atrocities.The International Criminal Court has opened a case into the accusations of crimes in the region. In September, a US federal judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down.The new class-action lawsuit references claims by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who leaked a cache of internal documents this year, that the company does not police abusive content in countries where such speech is likely to cause the most harm.The complaint also cites recent media reports, including a Reuters report last month, that Myanmar's military was using fake social media accounts to engage in what is widely referred to in the military as "information combat."Mohammed Taher, a refugee living in the camps in Bangladesh that are home to more than a million Rohingya, said Facebook had been widely used to spread anti-Rohingya propaganda."We welcome the move," he said by phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-sued-for-150-billion-by-rohingya-refugees-over-myanmar-violence-101638885163757.html

07-12-2021||World||US will ‘pay’ for diplomatic boycott of Olympics: China||China on Tuesday accused the US of violating the Olympic spirit by announcing a diplomatic boycott of February’s Beijing Winter Games, warning Washington that it will “pay for its practices”, in a new diplomatic feud that’s certain to further strain ties already at the lowest point in decades.The White House on Monday said government officials would boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of China’s human rights “atrocities”, although American athletes are free to compete at the Games, which are to begin on February 4.Reacting strongly to the boycott, the Chinese foreign ministry said Washington is attempting to interfere with the Winter Olympics “out of ideological prejudice and based on lies and rumours”.China opposes the boycott and would take “resolute countermeasures”, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday without offering details.“The US will pay a price for its practices. You may stay tuned for follow-ups,” Zhao said.The boycott “seriously violates the principle of political neutrality of sports established by the Olympic Charter and runs counter to the Olympic motto ‘more united,’” Zhao said.Zhao urged the US to stop bringing politics into sports, adding that the boycott went against Olympic principles.According to Reuters, China’s embassy in Washington called the boycott “political manipulation” that would have no impact on the Games as no invitations had been extended to US politicians.The White House had called China’s human rights record “egregious” on Monday.“US diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC’s egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang, and we simply can’t do that,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a daily press briefing.“The athletes on Team USA have our full support,” Psaki added.“We will be behind them 100% as we cheer them on from home,” Psaki was quoted as saying by Reuters.The US diplomatic boycott comes less than a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Joe Biden talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges like climate change as the two leaders met for more than 200 minutes via video link in November, the first such meeting since Biden became president in January.Ties between the countries in recent years have been deeply acrimonious over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown on the democracy protests in Hong Kong and Washington’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters, and trade.Meanwhile, countries like Canada, Australia and Japan were still discussing internally their positions on the Games.New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson said his country would not send government officials but that decision was based largely on Covid-19 concerns and preceded the US boycott, according to agency reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-pay-for-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-china-101638875228621.html

Shaped like a coffin, the euthanasia device allows its occupant to bring the oxygen level inside the glass capsule down to a critical level with just the blink of an eye, according to an Independent report citing the machine's creators.Also Read | Save a life! Read these signs for suicide preventionAs per the publication, the entire process takes less than a minute and allows the person to die “relatively peacefully and painlessly”. It is the latest example of advances in euthanasia machines, which are devices specifically engineered to allow an individual to die quickly with minimal pain in countries where voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide is legal.Although there is an ongoing debate about the ethics of euthanasia and the use of such devices, there are countries that have legalised voluntary death keeping in mind terminally ill patients who may be recommended for the same by either a physician or the person wishing to die. In Switzerland, for example, assisted suicide is legal and approximately 1,300 people were reported to have used the services of euthanasia organisations, such as Dignitas and Exit, last year. However, both of these organisations use ingestible liquid barbiturate drugs to induce a deep coma followed by death.Also Read | How to help a friend deal with depression and suicidal thoughtsThe Sarco ‘suicide machine’ was invented by Dr Philip Nitschke, dubbed ‘Dr Death’, and is short for “sarcophagus”. True to its name, the device literally serves as a tomb for its occupant, as the biodegradable capsule can detach itself from the base of the machine in order to serve as a coffin.The device has expectedly faced heavy criticism, specifically due to its nature wherein nitrogen flows into the capsule, displacing oxygen, leading to death. While some have drawn comparisons with a “gas chamber”, others have lambasted its futuristic design – noting that it “glorifies” suicide.However, with the Sarco machine passing legal scrutiny in Switzerland, its creators are likely to put it up and ready for operation in the country from next year, according to reports.--India suicide hotlines:Lifeline Foundation (Kolkata)+91 33 2474 4704+91 33 2474 58862474 5255AASRA (Navi Mumbai)+91 22 2754 6669ROSHNI (Secunderabad)+91 40 7904646Saath (Ahmedabad)+91 79 2630 5544+91 79 2630 0222SNEHA (Chennai)+91 (0) 44 2464 0050The Samaritans Sahara (Mumbai)+91-22-2307 3451Sumaitri (New Delhi)2338 9090||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-approves-euthanasia-device-for-painless-death-101638861581650.html
07-12-2021||World||Anil Menon, son of Indian immigrant, among 10 new Nasa astronaut trainees||NASA announced Monday its 10 latest trainee astronauts, who include a firefighter turned Harvard professor, a former member of the national cycle team, and a pilot who led the first-ever all-woman F-22 formation in combat.The 2021 class was whittled down from a field of more than 12,000 applicants and will now report for duty in January at the Johnson Space Center in Texas, where they will undergo two years of training."We're going back to the Moon, and we're continuing on to Mars -- and so today we welcome 10 new explorers," NASA administrator Bill Nelson said at an event to welcome the recruits."Alone, each candidate has 'the right stuff,' but together they represent the creed of our country: E pluribus unum - out of many, one," he added.The 10 candidates, who range in age from 32 to 45, will learn how to operate and maintain the International Space Station, train for spacewalks, develop robotics skills, safely operate a T-38 training jet, and learn Russian to communicate with their counterparts.After they graduate, they could be assigned to missions aboard the ISS or deeper into space, including NASA's planned return to the Moon later this decade under the Artemis mission, which will include the first woman and person of color to set foot on lunar soil.The field was open to US citizens who hold a master's degree in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) field -- the first time such a requirement was added -- and passed an online test. The master's degree requirement could also be met by a medical degree or completion of a test pilot program.Childhood dreams"I first became interested in becoming an astronaut at a very, very early age," said Jessica Wittner, 38, a lieutenant commander in the US Navy who is a test pilot and aerospace engineer."I was that little girl in school who would play with rockets in the park by the house and loved science class."Others include fighter pilot Nichole Ayers who has more than 200 combat hours and is one of a few women currently flying the F-22 jet. In 2019 Ayers led the first all-woman formation of the aircraft in combat.Christopher Williams, 38, is an assistant professor of medical physics at Harvard University."I was splitting my time between helping to research better ways we can target radiation therapy for cancer, and then actually working as part of a multidisciplinary team to treat patients," said Williams, who holds a doctorate in astrophysics from MIT and has served as a volunteer emergency medical technician and firefighter.Anil Menon, 45, is a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force who was previously SpaceX's first flight surgeon before an earlier stint at NASA.A physician born to parents from India and Ukraine, he was a first responder during the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, 2015 earthquake in Nepal, and the 2011 Reno Air Show accident.Christina Birch, 35, holds degrees in mathematics and biochemistry and molecular biophysics, as well as a doctorate in biological engineering from MIT.She left a career in academia to race as a track cyclist on the US team, qualifying for the Olympics and winning World Cup medals in the team pursuit and Madison race.NASA's last class graduated in 2017. Two of its members, Raja Chari and Kayla Barron, are currently serving aboard the ISS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anil-menon-son-of-indian-immigrant-among-10-new-nasa-astronaut-trainees-101638860567474.html
07-12-2021||World||Biden, Putin to get on high-stakes video call today with eye on Ukraine||US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, are expected to get on a high-stakes video call on Tuesday, where the leaders are expected to address diplomatic ties over the escalating conflict in Ukraine. According to news agencies, Biden intends to warn Putin that if he orders the Russian forces placed on the border to attack Ukraine, the United States and its European allies may move to cut his country off from the international financial system, called SWIFT, and sanction top Russian banks and many of the president's closest associates.The Biden-Putin phone call today is, in many ways, significant for both the future of US-Russia relations as well as for international geopolitics shaping up power relations between two of the most powerful and influential nations in the world.It is not yet clear exactly how detailed the conversation will be, but people familiar with the matter told the Bloomberg news agency under the condition of anonymity that the consequences of the video meeting today are likely to spill over to the markets and the economy, as the US is already weighing Russia's ability to convert rubles for dollars and that of investors to buy Russian debt on the secondary market. The most drastic option, of course, would be to bar Russia’s access to the SWIFT financial payments system, but that is likely to wreak havoc on the lives of ordinary citizens.The Biden-Putin call comes amid high tensions over Russia's bid to invade Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops, according to the US intelligence, in the coming year. Although Russia has denied plans to go to war, its president has made it quite clear that he's willing to invade Ukraine – his forces did so in 2014 – to protect what he sees as “vital national security interests”.The US, however, does not want to commit its troops to Ukraine just yet, a senior Biden administration official confirmed, adding that attempts are on instead to help Ukraine and send more forces and capabilities to NATO allies bordering Russia.Biden’s Tuesday call with Putin, which will be the two leaders' fourth conversation and quite possibly the US president's highest-stakes leader-to-leader conversation since he took office in January, may now set the course for Ukraine’s ability to remain a fully independent nation. It is also expected to address other issues that the US may have with Russia, including the threat of cyberattacks and continuing disputes over Russia’s provision of energy to Europe.For Putin, though, the goal is partly the meeting itself: He gains legitimacy and international sway the more he interacts with Biden, demonstrating Russia’s continued prowess on the global stage. It’s a strategy that has worked for him, evidenced by the four conversations he’s had with Biden since January, more than most world leaders.A key challenge for Biden is one of force posture -- he will have to persuade Putin that stepped up economic pressure would bring the sort of pain that previous sanctions regimes haven’t, while essentially conceding that the use of US forces isn’t really on the table.According to a foreign diplomacy expert cited by the Bloomberg agency, the Putin-Biden video call today is akin to a “Russian roulette, Putin-style” – solely a matter of who blinks first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-to-get-on-high-stakes-video-call-today-with-eye-on-ukraine-101638843959245.html
07-12-2021||World||Nations on high alert as Covid variant spreads||Russia has confirmed the first two cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the country in travellers who returned from South Africa, health officials said on Monday.Russia restricted entry for all foreigners travelling from countries in southern Africa and required all Russian nationals returning from South Africa or neighbouring countries as of Thursday to quarantine for 14 days because of the new variant.Namibia has detected the Omicron variant in 18 of 19 samples sequenced between November 11-26, its health ministry said on Monday.Although the southern African country has sequenced relatively few samples, the finding suggests the variant first flagged by neighbouring South Africa and Botswana late last month, and since labelled “of concern” by the World Health Organization, is also highly prevalent in Namibia.Separately, Pakistan on Monday banned travel from 15 countries, including The Netherlands and South Africa, except under certain conditions, and tightened up travel restrictions on 13 other countries in wake of the threat of the new variant.Croatia confirmed on Monday its first two cases of Omicron, the state health institute said.“We are not sure about the source of the infection as neither of those two people had travelled abroad. We believe they got infected at a business meeting at which both participated,” said Bernard Kaic, an epidemiologist at the state health institute.Japan confirmed on Monday its third case of the new omicron variant as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida vowed to take strict measures based on a worst-case scenario of a possible resurgence of infections.Chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that the third confirmed case is a man in his 30s who tested positive upon arrival from Italy at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on December 1 and has since been isolated.However, initial data from South Africa, the epicentre of the outbreak of the Omicron variant, don’t show a resulting surge of hospitalisations. “Thus far, it doesn’t look like there’s a great degree of severity to it,” Anthony Fauci, US President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on Sunday, while cautioning it’s too early to be certain.Meanwhile, Italy tightened curbs on Monday on people still not vaccinated against Covid-19, limiting their access to an array of places and services.Under the new rules, only people who have been vaccinated or have recently recovered from Covid-19 can access indoor seating at bars and restaurants, visit museums, go to cinemas and clubs and attend sporting events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-on-high-alert-as-covid-variant-spreads-101638840708715.html
07-12-2021||World||Omicron vs Delta: Battle of coronavirus mutants is critical||As the Omicron coronavirus variant spreads in southern Africa and pops up in countries all around the world, scientists are anxiously watching a battle play out that could determine the future of the pandemic. Can the latest competitor to the world-dominating Delta overthrow it?Some scientists, poring over data from South Africa and the United Kingdom, suggest Omicron could emerge the victor.“It’s still early days, but increasingly, data is starting to trickle in, suggesting that Omicron is likely to outcompete Delta in many, if not all, places,” said Dr. Jacob Lemieux, who monitors variants for a research collaboration led by Harvard Medical School.But others said Monday it’s too soon to know how likely it is that Omicron will spread more efficiently than Delta, or, if it does, how fast it might take over.“Especially here in the US, where we’re seeing significant surges in Delta, whether Omicron’s going to replace it I think we’ll know in about two weeks,” said Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.Many critical questions about Omicron remain unanswered, including whether the virus causes milder or more severe illness and how much it might evade immunity from past Covid-19 illnesses or vaccines.On the issue of spread, scientists point to what’s happening in South Africa, where Omicron was first detected. Omicron’s speed in infecting people and achieving near dominance in South Africa has health experts worried that the country is at the start of a new wave that may come to overwhelm hospitals.The new variant rapidly moved South Africa from a period of low transmission, averaging less than 200 new cases per day in mid-November, to more than 16,000 per day over the weekend. Omicron accounts for more than 90% of the new cases in Gauteng province, the epicenter of the new wave, according to experts. The new variant is rapidly spreading and achieving dominance in South Africa’s eight other provinces.“The virus is spreading extraordinarily fast,” said Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute. “If you look at the slopes of this wave that we’re in at the moment, it’s a much steeper slope than the first three waves that South Africa experienced. This indicates that it’s spreading fast and it may therefore be a very transmissible virus.”But Hanekom, who is also co-chair of the South African Covid-19 variants Research Consortium, said South Africa had such low numbers of Delta cases when Omicron emerged, “I don’t think we can say” it out-competed Delta.Scientists say it’s unclear whether Omicron will behave the same way in other countries as it has in South Africa. Lemieux said there are already some hints about how it may behave; in places like the United Kingdom, which does a lot of genomic sequencing, he said, “we’re seeing what appears to be a signal of the exponential increase of omicron over Delta.”In the United States, as in the rest of the world, “there’s still a lot of uncertainty,” he said. “But when you put the early data together, you start to see a consistent picture emerge: that Omicron is already here, and based on what we’ve observed in South Africa, it’s likely to become the dominant strain in the coming weeks and months and will likely cause a surge in case numbers.”What that could mean for public health remains to be seen. Hanekom said early data from South Africa shows that reinfection rates are much higher with Omicron than previous variants, suggesting the virus is escaping immunity somewhat. It also shows the virus seems to be infecting younger people, mostly those who are unvaccinated, and most cases in hospitals have been relatively mild.But Binnicker said things could play out differently in other parts of the world or in different groups of patients. “It’ll be really interesting to see what happens when more infections potentially occur in older adults or those with underlying health conditions,” he said. “What’s the outcome in those patients?”As the world waits for answers, scientists suggest people do all they can to protect themselves.“We want to make sure that people have as much immunity from vaccination as possible. So if people are not vaccinated they should get vaccinated,” Lemieux said. “If people are eligible for boosters, they should get boosters, and then do all the other things that we know are effective for reducing transmission -- masking and social distancing and avoiding large indoor gatherings, particularly without masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-vs-delta-battle-of-coronavirus-mutants-is-critical-101638841226364.html
07-12-2021||World||Malaria deaths rose by 69,000 in 2020 due to Covid-19 disruptions: WHO||Healthcare disruptions linked to the coronavirus pandemic helped malaria kill 69,000 more people in 2020 than the previous year, but a worst-case scenario was averted, the World Health Organization said on Monday.In total over 627,000 people globally - most of them babies in the poorest parts of Africa - were killed by malaria last year compared with 558,000 in 2019, the WHO said in its annual malaria report.The number eclipses the 224,000 people reported having died from the coronavirus in Africa since the start of the pandemic.About two-thirds of the additional malaria deaths in 2020 were due to coronavirus restrictions disrupting prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malaria, the WHO said.But efforts to maintain health services despite the challenges meant Sub-Saharan Africa did not see the doubling of malaria deaths in 2020 that the WHO had warned was a possibility.Instead, the number of deaths in the region rose 12% compared with 2019, according to WHO data.“Thanks to urgent and strenuous efforts we can claim that the world has succeeded in averting the worst-case scenario of malaria deaths,” said Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO's global malaria programme.Experts hope the fight against malaria might gain considerable ground following the WHO's recommendation in October that RTS, S - or Mosquirix - a vaccine developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline should be widely given to children in Africa.“With increased funding, access to life-saving tools, and robust innovation in new tools to stay ahead of the evolving mosquito and parasite, we can accelerate transformative action and end malaria within a generation,” said Abdourahmane Diallo, chief executive of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria advocacy group.“We are now at a critical juncture, and I urge global leaders for renewed commitment and investment,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaria-deaths-rose-by-69-000-in-2020-due-to-covid-19-disruptions-who-101638838573335.html
07-12-2021||World||Biden may sanction Russia's top banks if Putin invades Ukraine||The US and European allies are weighing sanctions targeting Russia’s biggest banks and the country’s ability to convert rubles for dollars and other foreign currencies should President Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The sanctions -- including against some of Russia’s biggest banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund -- are among the options that President Joe Biden may spell out when he speaks with Putin on Tuesday, according to the people. The US could also restrict the ability of investors to buy Russian debt on the secondary market, they said. The options were described by two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The most drastic option would be to bar Russia’s access to the Swift financial payments system, but that would wreak havoc on ordinary citizens so officials are more inclined to go after Russia’s ability to convert rubles into dollars, euros, or British pounds, the people said. The Biden-Putin call comes with tensions high over what US intelligence has told allies could be a plan to invade Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops in the coming year. Russia has denied plans to go to war but has also said US and European nations should scale back their support for Ukraine, establishing de facto “red lines” that include barring the former Soviet republic from joining the NATO alliance. It’s not clear how much detail Biden will share with Putin on the possible sanctions that would follow an invasion, and most of the actions would be contingent on agreement from allies. Overall, the measures Biden is considering are part of an American effort to claw back some of the leverage Putin has amassed over Ukraine and, more broadly, the US and its European allies. The Russian leader has made clear that he’s willing to invade Ukraine -- his forces did so in 2014 -- to protect what he sees as vital national security interests, and he has shown a willingness to tamper with energy markets by threatening to cut supplies to Europe.Why Russia-Ukraine tensions are so hard to defuse“The reason Putin has so much leverage is he’s clearly willing to pay the price,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, said of past US moves to sanction Russia that had little effect. “But we’ve got loads more ammunition, there’s lots of stuff we could do. It’s just that no one has ever believed we would go to those lengths.”Biden’s Tuesday call with Putin, which will be the pair’s fourth conversation since the US president took office in January, is also meant to provide a way to defuse tensions that have crested again after an earlier Russian troop buildup in the spring first raised fears of war. “The goal here is to signal lots of action up front so you don’t have to do it, but making sure the threat is credible,” Rojansky said.A senior Biden administration official, speaking to reporters on Monday, made clear that the US doesn’t want to commit its troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. At the same time, the official said the US would help Ukraine and send more forces and capabilities to NATO allies bordering Russia. The official also declined to detail the steps the US would take if there’s a Russian invasion.How Europe Has Become So Dependent on Putin for Gas: QuickTakeThe call will help determine whether Biden’s desire for a functioning relationship with Russia is possible or whether the dynamic will just ricochet from crisis to crisis -- including cyberattacks, the potential invasion of Ukraine, and continuing disputes over Russia’s provision of energy to Europe. Last week Biden previewed his interest in taking a tougher approach, saying, “What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a tweet Monday that he had spoken with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and they “agreed to continue joint & concerted action.”Blinken tweeted that he assured the Ukrainian president that “US support for Ukraine is unwavering” and “there will be serious consequences for any escalation from Russia.”From the Biden administration’s view, a more positive turn of events could see the US having a stable relationship with Russia -- one where the two nations’ embassies and consulates are fully staffed, and where Russia helps bring Iran around to the idea of rejoining the 2015 deal that put limits on its nuclear program. The US could also play some role in getting Moscow and Kyiv to finally adhere to the 2015 Minsk agreements that were meant to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end.Putin’s GoalFor Putin, the goal is partly the meeting itself: He gains legitimacy and international sway the more he interacts with Biden, demonstrating Russia’s continued prowess on the global stage. It’s a strategy that has worked for him, evidenced by the four conversations he’s had with Biden since January, more than most world leaders. Russia has played up the significance of the encounter, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying it will be the equivalent of an in-person meeting and more substantial than a simple phone call.Putin will listen “with great interest” to Biden’s proposals on Ukraine,” Peskov said. “Let’s at least hope that the leaders will be able to get their concerns across, clearly formulate those, and respond.”Putin’s main demand -- binding guarantees from the US and its allies that NATO won’t expand farther east and won’t deploy weapons there that Russia considers a threat -- isn’t likely to get very far with Biden. The US president over the weekend rejected the Kremlin’s “red lines” over Ukraine as out of hand.But with tensions along the Ukraine-Russia border soaring, any high-level talks are helpful, said Rachel Ellehuus, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Biden will have to offer Putin some sort of an off-ramp to deescalate the situation,” Ellehuus said. On the decision to engage, she said, “It keeps people talking and avoids the worse consequence which is military confrontation.”The deliberations underscore just how intertwined Russia’s role as an energy supplier to Europe is with its security posture toward Ukraine, which has transit agreements for Russian gas. Energy is also a potential source of leverage: Continued Russian aggression could reshape the fate of the completed but not yet operational Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which the Biden administration hasn’t tried to stop even though it opposes the project.“I think Nord Stream 2 is very much on the table,” said Steven Pifer, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. Biden still has options to impose broader sanctions, he said. “There are things that you can do to greatly ratchet up the pain.”One crucial result of the call will be a better understanding of what exactly Putin wants. While US officials say the intelligence suggests Putin is planning for a major ground invasion of Ukraine, they say the administration doesn’t know with confidence what the Russian leader is planning -- and don’t believe he’s made any final decision.That uncertainty is a tactic Putin has used for a long time. A key challenge for Biden is one of force posture -- he will have to persuade Putin that stepped up economic pressure would bring the sort of pain that previous sanctions regimes haven’t, while essentially conceding that the use of US forces isn’t really on the table.“It’s Russian roulette, Putin-style -- who will blink first?” said Oksana Antonenko, director at Control Risks in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-may-sanction-russia-s-top-banks-if-putin-invades-ukraine-101638836498621.html
07-12-2021||World||UK minister confirms community transmission of Omicron variant||The UK’s health minister on Monday told Parliament that the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 is now in transmission within the community across regions of England, as he confirmed a total of 336 cases of the mutation first detected in South Africa.According to the latest data, there are now 261 cases in England, 71 in Scotland and four in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases across the UK to 336, Sajid Javid said in his statement to the House of Commons."This includes cases with no links to international travel. So, we can conclude that there is now community transmission across multiple regions of England," he said.The minister informed Parliament about the addition of Nigeria to the UK’s red list travel ban and pre-departure PCR or lateral flow tests for anyone travelling to the country starting Tuesday.“We are leaving nothing to chance. Our strategy is to buy ourselves time and strengthen our defences while our world-leading scientists assess this new variant and what it means for our fight against Covid-19," he said.Javid also updated the Commons on previously released data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) about recent scientific analysis which suggests that the window of infection may be shorter for Omicron than for the Delta variant.However, he said that there is no "clear picture" on whether the variant causes more severe disease or how it is impacted by the current vaccines being administered for Covid-19."And so we can't say for certain, at this point, whether Omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery," said Javid.From 4 AM local time on Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from a non-red list country, whether vaccinated or not, will have to show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test taken no earlier than 48 hours before departing for the UK.Javid said that the new measures, which also include every traveller having a Day 2 PCR test and isolating until getting a negative result, are temporary and will be reviewed next week.Experts have said there is increasing concern Omicron is spreading more quickly than the Delta variant, currently the predominant variant in the UK.Professor Paul Hunter from the School of Medicine at the University of East Anglia said the early signs show that the Omicron variant "will probably spread quite quickly"."And probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least," he told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-confirms-community-transmission-of-omicron-variant-101638834110366.html
