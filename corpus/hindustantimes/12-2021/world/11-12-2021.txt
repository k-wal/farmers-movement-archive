We need to expand our economic and security posture around the world."Truss held talks on the sidelines of the summit on Friday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as Germany's new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.Blinken flies on to Southeast Asia next week on a visit designed to highlight the region's importance in Washington's push for "peace, security and prosperity" in the Indo-Pacific region against an increasingly assertive China.Ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will join the G7 summit for the first time ever on Sunday, in a session earmarked for wide-ranging talks on issues including Covid-19 vaccines, finance and gender equality.South Korea, Australia, South Africa and India will also participate as Britain's chosen G7 "guests", with many attendees taking part virtually due to the pandemic and emergence of the Omicron variant.Truss said before the meeting that she wanted deeper ties between G7 nations in trade, investment, technology and security "so we can defend and advance freedom and democracy across the world".Ukraine talksTruss, who replaced Dominic Raab in the role in September, set out her foreign policy vision in a major address on Wednesday.She warned Moscow it would be "a strategic mistake" to invade Ukraine, following growing concerns over a big Russian troop build-up on the border which the Kremlin says is defensive against any move by Kiev towards NATO.That echoed comments delivered by US President Joe Biden to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a virtual summit the previous day when he warned of unprecedented sanctions if Ukraine was attacked.Washington's top diplomat for Europe and Eurasian affairs, Karen Donfried, will hold follow-up talks with senior government officials in Kiev and Moscow next week to try to end the conflict.She will then head to Brussels for further discussions with NATO and EU allies "to pursue a diplomatic solution" to the stand-off.Britain's G7 presidency has been dominated by responding to Beijing's increasing international assertiveness and alleged widespread domestic rights abuses, including of its Muslim minority Uyghur population.This week, a panel of human rights lawyers and experts in London concluded Beijing had committed genocide by imposing population restrictions, including birth control and forced sterilisations, on the Uyghurs.China rejected the tribunal's findings.At a G7 leaders' summit in June, Biden pushed for a stronger collective stance towards both China and Russia, and this week saw Washington, London and Canberra announce diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Truss has said the West needs to work towards ending the "strategic dependence" of a growing number of low- and middle-income countries on its adversaries, in various areas from energy to technology.At the summit she will push attendees to provide those countries with more finance for infrastructure and technology projects, according to the foreign office.G7 countries and their allies must offer "an alternative to unsustainable debt from non-market economies" like China, it said.Truss will unveil a UK-led initiative -- the Africa Resilience Investment Accelerator -- to boost collaboration investing in Africa's "most fragile markets" and help develop "a pipeline of investable opportunities".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-top-agenda-as-g7-ministers-call-for-unity-against-authoritarianism-101639244974552.html

Imran said that it was necessary to help Afghanistan avoid an economic collapse.“Pakistan valued its long-standing relationship with the United States and was committed to expanding it in all spheres, particularly in the economic dimension,” Khan told the four-member US delegation consisting of senators Angus King, Richard Burr, John Cornyn and Benjamin Sasse. Khan’s latest statement comes amid frayed relations between the US and Pakistan as the Pakistan prime minister boycotted the Democracy Summit hosted by US President Joe Biden.The four senators are members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Senator King is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.The senators also thanked the Pakistan government for helping in the evacuation of the American nationals and others from Afghanistan earlier in August and September following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The senators also affirmed that the US feels that due to Pakistan’s geo-strategic location and population both nations should make determined efforts to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation.Pakistan on several occasions has reiterated to the international community that it should not isolate Afghanistan, which is governed by the Taliban, citing that it will lead to a humanitarian crisis and economic despair. The international community however remains committed to helping the Taliban-led government only if it keeps its pledges regarding women, education and protection towards minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-boycotting-biden-s-summit-imran-khan-shifts-stance-101639244477374.html

Ticket prices have not been disclosed.Alan Shepard performed a 15-minute suborbital space flight on May 5, 1961, just under a month after the Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, orbiting the planet.Shepard, who died in 1998, went on to be the fifth of twelve men to have set foot on the Moon.Previous Blue Origin flights have flown the company's billionaire founder Bezos as well as Star Trek actor William Shatner to space.Bezos, who made his fortune with Amazon, envisages a future in which humanity disperses throughout the solar system, living and working in giant space colonies with artificial gravity.This, he says, would leave Earth as a pristine tourism destination much like national parks today.The year 2021 has been significant for the space tourism sector, with Virgin Galactic also flying its founder Richard Branson to the final frontier, and Elon Musk's SpaceX sending four private citizens on a three-day orbital mission for charity.ia/dw/AMAZON.COM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-completes-third-space-flight-with-6-member-crew-101639237297791.html

The recent actions of Russia, signalling an intention to invade Ukraine, prompted US President Joe to hold discussions with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, over a secured telephone call last Tuesday.The concern over possible invasion of Ukraine has further grown as Russia continues to deploy more troops in the border areas. In an interview with Greek TV channel ANT1, Peskow said Russia can move its forces wherever it wants. Referring to US warplanes landing in Ukraine, the Kremlin spokesperson said that the troops have been moved closer to the areas that could pose a threat to national security.When asked whether Putin was planning to launch a military offensive against Ukraine, Peksov said, "No, the problem is very simple.”“Russia is moving its forces within its territory and we can move our forces in any direction we want and closer to the areas that could pose a threat [and currently] we see US warplanes landing in Ukraine and US military equipment approaching our borders," he added, as quoted by ANI.Peskov was also asked whether Russia and the United States could ever become allies, to which the Kremlin spokesperson said "it would be hard to imagine such a thing" considering the current situation.Last week, Biden said he was coordinating with European allies to make it “very, very difficult” for the Russian president to attack Ukraine.“What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,” Biden told reporters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-not-planning-to-attack-ukraine-adds-problem-is-very-simple-101639227747042.html

So I decided to come down here to see what was going on, and I had no idea the building looked that bad. And I'm just; I'm worried sick," she said.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker tweeted: "My prayers are with the people of Edwardsville tonight, and I've reached out to the mayor to provide any needed state resources."The US National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings on Friday night for areas in several states including Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Illinois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-trapped-after-amazon-warehouse-roof-collapse-near-us-city-of-st-louis-101639224682325.html

11-12-2021||World||Illegal but essential: Afghan migrants, minorities recycle Istanbul's waste||Shrouded by acrid smoke, a young Afghan crouches sorting waste he has pulled from the trash bins of Istanbul, anxious that Turkey will soon strip him of even this subsistence."I start at eight in the morning and finish at eight at night," said Issam Raffur, who has spent four of his 20 years in Turkey."It is very hard and poorly paid, but I have no choice," he shrugged, smoke billowing from a fire barely warming his makeshift sorting centre on a soggy winter day.Considered the poorest of Turkey's poor, Afghans have joined Kurds, the Laz, Roma and other ethnic minorities and undocumented migrants in doing work others snub.For less than $10 a day, they roam the streets of Istanbul, a megalopolis of nearly 16 million people straining under the weight of a currency crisis and a flood of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other conflict-riven states.Diving headfirst into dumpsters, they dig up plastic bottles, glass and other waste they then sort and sell in bulk -- a self-organised, unregulated business that keeps the city clean, and men such as Issam fed.But as public sentiment turns against migrants and other foreigners in Turkey, the state-appointed prefecture of Istanbul has declared this work bad for "the environment and public health".Issam and his friends suspect that what Turkish officials really want is to put this potentially profitable business under the control of a few, well-connected recycling firms."If the big companies take over, they will saw off our last branch of support," said Mahmut Aytar, a Turk who manages one of the small recycling centres on the Asian side of Istanbul. "They will throw us in the ravine."Speaking to AFP, Deputy Environment Minister Mehmet Emin Birpinar did little to ease Aytar's concerns."Waste can be bought and sold, so we have started to view it as a raw material with other uses," he said. "After the price of raw materials increased, the value of recycled goods has risen."- Women and children - Born in multi-ethnic southeastern Turkey, Aytar, 28, launched his recycling business out of desperation after failing to find work befitting his biology degree."This job does not require experience or training. Anyone can do it, but it is mostly the people excluded by the system who get involved," he said while watching his press machines crush plastic bags and empty bottles.After being shrunk into tidy bales, the plastic waste is loaded onto trucks of small, independently run recycling operators who convert them into granules.Aytar said he runs one of 2,500 or so impromptu recycling depots in Istanbul, receiving dozens of trash collectors -- called "cekcekci" (pronounced "chekchekchi" and roughly translating as those who pull carts) -- every day.Tugging white, muddied carts filled with paper, cardboard, plastic and bottles, they dart between honking cars and pedestrian streams, earning 80-120 liras ($6-$9) a day.Women and minors specialise in cardboard boxes, which they find after the shops close at night, their babies sometimes riding along in the carts' lower folds.Each kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of waste is worth about a lira (seven US cents), and the bravest collect about 150 kilogrammes of waste a day."They probably don't realise it, but by being impoverished, they contribute to protecting the environment," said Aytar. "They are helping society."'Harassment' They do so while living in destitution and depend on the whims of the police.In early October, security forces rounded up more than 250 cekcekci in one day, releasing them after a few hours but keeping their precious cargoes of waste."It's harassment," said Elrem Yasar, who started managing his own depot after collecting trash for 12 years."Each confiscation costs me about 560 liras, which I earn in three days."Istanbul prefecture officials defended their crackdown."These cekcekci work illegally," one official told AFP on condition of anonymity. "It is up to the city to take care of recycling and to collect revenues from it."Conceding that his work has no legal status, collector Ekrem Yasar said he would be happy to pay taxes if ever given the chance."We are not asking for state handouts, but if they take away our jobs, tens of thousands of people will be left with nothing," he said, pinning his hopes on the first cekcekci union, which is still in the process of being set up.Most of the trash collectors and warehouse workers live on-site in crudely arranged containers, huddling around open fires in Istanbul's industrial zones."Imagine, life in the city," Yasar said with a bitter laugh. "You think we are making money? Look, we only have one teaspoon between us," he said while serving tea.ach/zak/imm/lth/cdw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-but-essential-afghan-migrants-minorities-recycle-istanbul-s-waste-101639216423116.html

"I was hoping to complete it by Christmas but I guess that’s not happening anymore, but it’s an adventure."Rutherford, who is to remain at in hotel before her planned departure for Taiwan on Monday, said she expects to complete her journey by mid-January.With enhanced Covid-related travel restrictions, Rutherford said she has sometimes not been allowed to see local places in some countries."I’m seeing these places from the air and that is the most incredible thing," she said. "Although I’m not always allowed to go and visit, walk around and check out museums and restaurants, I can always see them from the air and it’s pretty incredible.”Aside from entering the record book, the teenager has expressed hope that her voyage will encourage girls and women to study and work in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), and spark girls' interest in aviation.Rutherford is seeking the title held by from Shaesta Wais, who became the youngest woman to fly solo round the world at age 30 in 2017. The youngest male record holder, Mason Andrews, was 18 years old when he made the journey in 2018.Born to two pilots, Rutherford will start university next year, with the dream of becoming an astronaut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teen-zara-rutherford-lands-in-seoul-in-record-soloflight-101639211242259.html

The filters worn by people infected with Covid-19 glowed around the nose and mouth areas.The team hopes to further develop the masks so that they will glow automatically, without special lighting, if the virus is detected.Tsukamoto, a veterinary professor and the president of the university, has studied ostriches for years, looking for ways to adapt their immunity power to fight bird flu, allergies, and other diseases.Tsukamoto told the Kyodo news agency he discovered his own positivity for Covid-19 after he wore one of the special masks and found that it glowed when checked. The diagnosis was confirmed after a standard test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/using-ostrich-cells-scientists-make-masks-that-glow-in-contact-with-coronavirus-101639208986531.html

Between December 3 and 9, the daily average was at 3,450, growing 22% over the previous week.With transmission at these levels, modelling showed cases could double and another Delta-driven wave could result in four-fold rise, while an Omicron wave could make matters worse.In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said “if spread of the Omicron variant were to accelerate and replace the Delta variant as the predominant variant in Canada” then it was “possible” there could be an “even more rapidly accelerating resurgence in cases”. There have, so far, been 87 cases of confirmed infection related to the Omicron variant.However, the situation will be very different to the winter wave a year earlier. “Despite the challenges ahead with the continuing Delta-driven wave in Canada and emergence of the Omicron variant, we have more and better protections going into this holiday and winter season than previously,” she said. A wide vaccine rollout and extensive coverage, “continue to give us an advantage over this virus, and while some reduction in protection is possible with the Omicron variant, Covid-19 vaccines are still expected to provide a level of protection, particularly against severe outcomes”, she said.Of the entire population, 81% have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 76% are fully jabbed. With paediatric vaccinations having started, 17% of children aged between 5 and 11 have been administered one dose of an mRNA vaccine. In addition, booster doses have also commenced, and a wider population will be covered in January.”Despite the challenges ahead, “we have more and better protections going into this holiday and winter season than previously”, the modelling presented on Friday noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-better-prepared-to-tackle-fresh-cases-in-holiday-season-101639205679938.html

11-12-2021||World||Joe Biden ends summit with call to ‘safeguard’ guardrails of democracy||US President Joe Biden closed the Summit for Democracy on Friday reminding world leaders, who participated, of their responsibility to “strengthen the guardrails of democracy” to make it more resilient against the “buffeting forces of autocracies” and he vowed to do his own part in America by enacting laws advancing voting rights.The two-day virtual summit was attended by leaders of 89 countries - of the 100 who were invited - and the European Union. Biden announced in his closing remarks that he plans to host a second edition of it next year and indicated it would be an in-person gathering.Joe Biden closed the summit saying, “As the leaders of governments, we - we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and to drive reforms that are going to make transparent, accountable governments - governance more resilient against the buffering and - the buffeting forces of autocracy and those who want - and the naked pursuit of power ahead of the public good.”This first summit of its kind was attended among others by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, France’s Emmanuel Macron, UK’s Boris Johnson, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Australia’s Scott Morrison. Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan were not invited and Pakistan’s Imran Khan turned down the invitation.“Over the last two days, we’ve heard government leaders, as well as democratic reformers from every region of the world, talk about the challenges that democracy is facing and the opportunities for its renewal,” Biden said, summarising the remarks and comments at the conference.“We’ve shone a spotlight on the importance of protecting media freedom and how advancing the status of women and girls is an investment in the success for our democracies,” the US president added. “And we’ve focused on the need to empower human rights defenders and make sure … technology … is used to advance democracies to lift people up, not to hold them down.”The last point was an unmistakable reference to Beijing’s use of technology - the persecution of China’s minority Uighur Muslims - is what has been described by the United States and other countries as genocide. The country’s communist party rulers have also used technology to suppress dissent.President Joe Biden went on to say that though challenges to democracy may vary from country to country “the threat we face and the solutions we seek have a common antecedent”. Autocracies, essentially.In the US, the most serious threat to democracy in recent history came from a horde of insurrectionists incited by former President Donald Trump who invaded the US Capitol, home to the country’s parliament, to prevent a joint sitting of its two chambers from certifying Biden’s election as president.Biden addressed the domestic threats to democracy in the US as a voting rights issue and promised to “make real the full promise of America, including by enacting both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act”. The two legislations seek, above all, to make voting easy and non-discriminatory.“Here at home, that means working to make real the full promise of America, including by enacting both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-ends-summit-with-call-to-safeguard-guardrails-of-democracy-101639201906658.html

He was 78.Uemura, the lead architect behind Nintendo Co.'s trailblazing home game consoles, died Monday, Ritsumeikan University said in a statement. The cause of his death was not released.Born in Tokyo in 1943, Uemura studied electronic engineering at the Chiba Institute of Technology and joined Nintendo in 1971.Uemura was tasked by then-president Hiroshi Yamauchi in 1981 with developing a home console for games like Donkey Kong, which was a huge hit in the United States at the time but only available for arcade use.The so-called Famicom game system hit the Japanese market in 1983 as Nintendo's first cartridge-based console, allowing users to play popular games that came in cassette formats. The upgraded Super Famicom was released in Japan in 1990.The Nintendo Entertainment System, as it was known, hit the United States in 1985 and eventually became a global sensation with more than 60 million consoles sold worldwide, bringing international recognition to a company that previously made traditional Japanese card games, other playing cards, and toys.After retiring from Nintendo, Uemura taught game studies starting in 2004 at Ritsumeikan University in the ancient Japanese capital, which is also home to Nintendo."We offer our heartfelt appreciation for Mr. Uemura's huge contributions to the development of the game industry by introducing a variety of video game consoles including family computers," Ritsumeikan University said in a statement. “May he rest in peace."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masayuki-uemura-creator-of-nintendo-s-iconic-nes-console-passes-away-101639198901914.html

I hope that your obsession with her is over,” Judge Daly told Bhavnani.Last month, the court heard that Bhavnani made threats in a 100-page letter delivered to the female nursing student, who cannot be named for legal reasons.He claimed that he had copied the threats from poetry found online.In her statement, the victim said that she was terrified that Bhavnani would sexually assault her.Bhavnani pleaded guilty to stalking, but not guilty to a more serious form of the offence. He has already spent a month on remand after breaching his bail earlier."I started getting six-minute-long voice messages saying he was going to make me be his wife, make me have his children, make me live with him,” the victim had told the BBC.The victim had repeatedly made it clear that she was not interested in any kind of relationship, and warned Bhavnani she would contact the police if he continued to harass her.She is now calling for a change in the university’s policies, and urged more support for stalking victims.In a statement, Oxford Brookes University said it wanted to reassure students that it took "reports of harassment, violence or abuse very seriously" and added that lessons would be learned."In this individual case, following a university conduct hearing, the most severe penalty available was applied by the university and the student was expelled from Oxford Brookes," the university said in a statement."We accept, however, that there are lessons we can learn for the future, especially in cases where student behaviour may also constitute a criminal offence," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-student-expelled-from-uk-university-for-stalking-101639196682467.html

(and) incite division and confrontation."Instead, Beijing vowed to "resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of pseudo-democracies".Ahead of the summit, China ramped up a propaganda blitz criticising US democracy as corrupt and a failure.Instead, it touted its own version of "whole-process people's democracy" in a white paper released last week that aimed to shore up legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party, which has become increasingly authoritarian under President Xi Jinping.While the US has repeatedly denied there will be another Cold War with China, tensions between the world's two largest economies have spiralled in recent years over issues including trade and technological competition, human rights, Xinjiang and Taiwan.The US Treasury on Friday sanctioned two high-level Chinese officials for human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region and placed Chinese AI surveillance firm SenseTime on a blacklist for its facial recognition technology targeting the Uyghur minority.Taiwan, a democratic self-ruling island that is claimed by China, was invited to the US summit in a clear snub to its larger neighbour.But Beijing got a boost in the middle of Biden's summit when Nicaragua dropped its previous diplomatic alliance with Taiwan, saying it only recognised China.The announcement leaves Taiwan with only 14 diplomatic allies. In response, the US State Department called on "all countries that value democratic institutions" to "expand engagement" with the island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-biden-led-summit-china-calls-us-democracy-weapon-of-mass-destruction-101639197174480.html
