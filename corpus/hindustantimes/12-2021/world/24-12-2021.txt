24-12-2021||World||China has turned more aggressive on borders, says Australian expert||China has become much more aggressive in the borders towards the east and west and in its relations with other states since the rise of Xi Jinping as President in 2012, an Australian foreign policy expert has said and noted that the world is heading for a prolonged period of bipolar competition in the Indo-Pacific region.Delivering the 2nd Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture, Dr Michael Fullilove, Executive Director of the Lowy Institute of Australia, said that China's economic rise has been phenomenal but India's economic rise is also important for the Asian success story."Emerging Asia is the most dynamic part of the world accounting for more than half of the global growth despite representing only the third of the global economy," he said in the address.Speaking on 'Australia, India and the Indo-Pacific: The need for strategic imagination,' Fullilove said if "the economic outlook is positive is in Asia, the security outlook is not".He cautioned that the world is heading "for a prolonged period of bipolar competition in the Indo-Pacific region"."Both US and China have exhibited troubling behaviour in the Indo-Pacific over the past decade."Slamming the impact of US policies during Donald Trump's tenure on geopolitics, Fullilove said if Washington's international stance over the past decade has been changeable, that of Beijing "has been consistent and increasingly concerning"."Since the ascension of President Xi Jinping in 2012, China has become much more aggressive in the borders towards the east and west and its relations with other states. Australia is an extreme case," he said in an apparent reference to deterioration in China-Australia ties.He said that the main reason for the downslide in Canberra's relationship with Beijing is that "China has changed." "Its foreign policy has hardened. The constraints on people within China have tightened. Its willingness to accept criticism has disappeared," he added.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) organised the second Atal Bihari Vajpayee Lecture to mark the birth anniversary of the former Prime Minister, which falls on Saturday. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla also spoke on the occasion.The former Prime Minister an important role in shaping India's Foreign Policy and the memorial lecture is a flagship event of MEA to recall his contributions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-turned-more-aggressive-on-borders-says-australian-expert-101640362234199.html
24-12-2021||World||US to lift travel ban on southern African countries: Report||The United States said Friday it would next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected.Countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa after the variant was detected in South Africa, which reported Omicron to the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 24.WHO and the United Nations spoke out against the travel bans, and officials in South Africa said they were being punished for identifying the strain and being transparent."The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, esp boosted," Kevin Munoz, the White House assistant press secretary, said on Twitter.He said the travel ban would be lifted on December 31.A senior White House official added that with Omicron present across the United States and globally, international travelers from the eight affected countries would not have a significant impact on US cases."During the travel pause President Biden reduced the time for pre-departure testing to one day opposed to three days... travelers from these eight countries will be subject to these same strict protocols," the official said.The ban applied to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-lift-travel-ban-on-southern-african-countries-report-101640358515134.html
24-12-2021||World||China sends Tibetan teens to camps for indoctrination, military training||Chinese authorities have begun sending Tibetan children to special camps to be indoctrinated in a Sinicised worldview and given basic military training in order to prepare them to be inducted into militias amid the standoff with India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Though most of the Tibetan children at these camps are teens, there are reports that some as young as eight or nine years have been sent to the indoctrination facilities, people familiar with the matter said, citing intelligence reports and intercepts from Indian security agencies.The indoctrination is also aimed at overcoming resistance within the local population to the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) efforts to recruit more Tibetans, the people added.Earlier this month, the Tibet Action Institute issued a report that said Chinese authorities in Tibet have set up a wide network of boarding schools for Tibetan children to separate them from parents, and reduce their exposure to their own language and culture. The report estimated that up to 900,000 Tibetan children aged six to 18, and an unknown number of four- and five-year-olds, are in the state-run schools.“The schools function as sites for remoulding children into Chinese nationals loyal to the CCP. Removed from their families and communities, students must study primarily in Chinese, are barred from practising their religion, and are subjected to political indoctrination,” the report said.The reports from Indian security agencies suggest children are being sent to special camps to indoctrinate them with a Sinicised worldview that disregards Tibetan Buddhist values and prepares them to be soldiers, the people said.Recent reports have pinpointed at least two camps where Tibetan children aged nine to 14 years are being provided basic military training and indoctrination in order to prepare them for induction into militias. Some 400 Tibetan children were imparted basic military training, including handling weapons, at Nyingchi training camp, located in an area opposite India’s Arunachal Pradesh state, the people said.Almost 200 Tibetan youth, mostly below the age for recruitment into the military, were shifted from a training camp in Shiquanhe to Gar Gunsa in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) in November, the people added.The people pointed out that the move to send children to camps where they are given military training contravenes international conventions against the recruitment of children in war zones or into militias.These conventions include the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, or the child soldier treaty, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2000, the Paris Principles on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict 2007 and instructions passed by Unicef, all of which state that no one below the age of 18 can be recruited into any form of military organisation.As first reported by Hindustan Times in June, China’s military has raised new militias comprising Tibetan youths in the strategic Chumbi Valley in TAR as part of enhanced efforts to recruit more Tibetans. Since last year, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has held recruitment drives across TAR to rope in more locals and there are also plans to raise a Special Tibetan Army Unit.Newly recruited Tibetan youth have now been deployed along the LAC in areas such as Demchok, Chepzi and Galwan Nala, the people said.The people said that Chinese authorities are attempting to recruit more Tibetans in order to offset the disadvantages of posting ethnic Han soldiers at high altitudes, especially in areas under the Western Theatre Command, which is the main PLA formation responsible for the border with India.The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy also concluded in a recent report that Chinese authorities now believe the first responder troops at high altitudes need to be Tibetan, who can function effectively in areas with low oxygen. “In turn, that means not only recruiting Tibetans willing and able to confront the Tibetans of the Indo-Tibetan Border Force, but also ensuring the loyalty of their Tibetan families and communities,” the report said.There have been numerous reports of PLA officers and troops being affected due to prolonged exposure to high altitude, the harsh terrain and adverse weather conditions during the standoff with India that began in May 2020. There have also been reports of Chinese troops suffering from psychological and severe health issues. Despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides have been unable to agree on disengagement at several friction points in Ladakh sector.

Passengers were booked on other flights.Lufthansa said in a statement that “we planned a very large buffer for the vacation period. But this was not sufficient due to the high rate of people calling in sick.”In the US, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said they had to cancel dozens of Christmas Eve flights because of staff shortages tied to omicron.“The nationwide spike in omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,” United said in a statement to several news outlets.“As a result, we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.”The airline said it was cancelling over 100 flights and working to rebook as many people as possible.Delta said it cancelled around 90 flights Friday because of the possibility of bad weather and the impact the omicron after it had “exhausted all options and resources — including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying.”It said in a statement to several outlets that it was trying to get passengers to their destinations quickly.The cancellations come as coronavirus cases driven by the new variant further squeeze staffing at hospitals, police departments, supermarkets and other critical operations struggling to maintain a full contingent of front-line workers.Countries including Spain and the UK have reduced the length of Covid-19 quarantines to ease staffing shortages by letting people return to work sooner after testing positive or being exposed to the virus.Delta CEO Ed Bastian was among those who have called on the Biden administration to take similar steps or risk further disruptions in air travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/omicron-crisis-lufthansa-2-major-airlines-cancel-flights-over-christmas-holiday-101640351578858.html

24-12-2021||World||Chinese province offers $31,000 baby loans to counter decreasing population||A Chinese province with one of the fastest shrinking populations is rolling out special loans to encourage couples to marry and have babies, as the rapidly-ageing country tries to reverse a slump in births.Jilin province in northeast China will support banks to provide up to 200,000 yuan ($31,400) of “marriage and birth consumer loans” to married couples, according to an official blueprint on policies to promote population growth. There were no details on how the government would offer support, but the proposal includes discounted interest rates for the loans that vary according to the number of children a couple has.China’s birth rate has rapidly slowed over the past few years as fewer and fewer people have children. That slump has continued despite the government effectively abandoning any limit on the number of children a couple can have and trying to make it less expensive to raise a family, with some demographers estimating the population may have already started shrinking.  Other measures in the Jilin policy include allowing couples from other provinces to obtain a residence permit -- known as hukou -- and access public services in Jilin if they have children and register them there. Couples who have two or three kids will also get tax discounts if they set up a small business, according to the document which was issued Thursday.Jilin is part of China’s “rust belt” region which is known for heavy industry and agriculture. The area has seen the worst population declines and slow economic growth over the past decade, with Jilin province’s economy expanding 7.8% in the first three quarters of this year from the same period in 2020, slower than the national average of 9.8%.The consumer loan attracted controversy on social media platform Weibo. “Families that need a loan to raise kids wouldn’t want to have them in the first place, and it’s not a good thing to increase their financial burden,” according to one post. “After mortgage and car loans, now we have the birth loan. We are just working for the bank our entire life,” another person lamented. Like many other provinces, Jilin is extending maternity and paternity leave. Women will have 180 days of leave in total, up from 158 days previously, while men are entitled to 25 days, up from 15 days. Couples will also each get 20 days of parental leave every year before their children turn three, the document said, and the province will also encourage kindergartens to set up daycare for children between ages two and three, according to the document.Earlier this year, a Bank of China branch in the southeastern province of Jiangxi drew widespread criticism for promoting a loan product that targeted couples who had just had a child. The bank later said it was only assessing the product and decided not to launch it because there wasn’t enough demand, according to local media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-province-offers-31-000-baby-loans-to-counter-decreasing-population-101640336890203.html
24-12-2021||World||Philippines: UN seeks $107.2 million in aid for victims of Typhoon Rai||The United Nations kicked off a campaign Friday to raise $107.2 million in aid for victims of Typhoon Rai, which ravaged the Philippines last week.The money will be targeted towards 530,000 people in the worst-affected areas, who are in dire need of drinking water, sanitation facilities, food and emergency shelter, the organization said."There is momentum for full support," UN Resident Coordinator in the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez told a virtual press conference earlier."Now the challenge is that all of this announcement and solidarity is rapidly translated into concrete actions."Rai devastated swathes of the southern and central regions of the archipelago when it hit as a super typhoon, leaving at least 375 people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless.It destroyed houses, uprooted trees, wiped out crops, shattered fishing boats and knocked out power across entire islands.The military, coast guard and humanitarian organizations are racing to get food, drinking water and temporary shelter to the hardest-hit regions.But the scale of the destruction, lack of mobile phone signal or internet in many areas, and depleted government coffers after the Covid-19 response has hampered efforts to distribute aid."Rai intensified from a tropical storm to a super typhoon within hours and I think that this is a lesson learned in terms of the impact of climate change," Gonzalez said Thursday.The storm caught everyone by surprise, he said, noting it did not follow the usual "trajectory" of typhoons in the Philippines, which tend to make landfall further north.Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan was the strongest storm ever to have made landfall, leaving over 7,300 people dead or missing.The death toll from Rai is not expected to get anywhere close to that number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-un-seeks-107-2-million-in-aid-for-victims-of-typhoon-rai-101640336708369.html
24-12-2021||World||Over 6,400 journalists in Afghanistan lost jobs since Taliban takeover: Survey||More than 6,400 journalists in Afghanistan have lost their jobs since the Taliban takeover of the country, according to a recent survey.The survey conducted by non-profit organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Afghan Independent Journalists Association (AIJA) shows a radical change in the Afghan media landscape since the Taliban took power.As many as 231 media outlets have had to close.The Taliban takeover's impact on Afghanistan's media has been dramatic, according to the survey by RSF and its local partner, the AIJA.More than four out of every ten media outlets have disappeared and 60 percent of journalists and media employees are no longer able to work.The hardest hit among all are women journalists as 80 percent of them have lost their jobs since Taliban took control of Kabul."Of the 543 media outlets tallied in Afghanistan at the start of the summer, only 312 were still operating at the end of November. This means that 43% of Afghan media outlets disappeared in the space of three months," the RSF said in a statement.Just four months ago, most Afghan provinces had at least ten privately-owned media outlets but now some regions have almost no local media at all."There used to be 10 media outlets in the mountainous northern province of Parwan but now just three are functioning. In the western city of Herat (the country's third largest) and the surrounding province, only 18 of the 51 media outlets are still operating - a 65 percent fall," the RSF said."The central Kabul region, which had more media that anywhere else, has not been spared the carnage. It has lost more than one of every two media outlets (51%). Of the 148 tallied prior to 15 August, only 72 are still operating," it added.The Taliban had promised women's rights, media freedom, and amnesty for government officials in the group's first news conference after the takeover in August. However, activists, former government employees, and journalists among others continue to face retribution.Reports have emerged from Afghanistan of an increasing crackdown by the Taliban on journalists. Reporters covering protests and rallies have been harassed by Taliban fighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-6-400-journalists-in-afghanistan-lost-jobs-since-taliban-takeover-survey-101640320114225.html

Canada has been relying heavily on international migration as its top driver of economic growth, with foreign-born workers accounting for nearly all the employment gains over the past decade.Canada, like other nations, faces an aging native-born population and relatively low fertility rates but has been able to produce the fastest population growth in the Group of Seven in recent years. The high influx of foreign-born workers has helped to mitigate wage pressures and fill in labor gaps in recent months at a time when inflation has been surging.In an interview last month, Fraser said he’s open to ramping up immigration targets if he deems it necessary to fill labor shortages. The immigration targets for the next few years will need to be submitted to Parliament by mid-February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-surpasses-record-immigration-goal-of-401-000-residents-101640331413715.html

And no, Covid-19 won't stop him||Rest assured, kids of all ages: Santa's coming this Christmas Eve, and a second holiday with Covid-19 won't stop him.That's the word from the joint US-Canadian military operation that for 66 years has been tracking Jolly Old St. Nicholas on his global mission and has assured us all — first by landline and more recently by iPhone, Android, OnStar, Facebook, YouTube and more — that he's on his way with a sleigh stuffed with toys and a welcome dose of joy.In what's become its own wildly popular tradition, the Colorado-based North American Aerospace Defense Command provides real-time updates on Santa's progress on December 24, from 4 a.m. to midnight MST.NORAD's Santa Tracker lets families watch Father Christmas in 3D as he transits the South Pacific, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas.From deep inside NORAD headquarters, dozens of volunteers field an unrelenting wave of phone calls to 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6723). They and other volunteers working off-site because of coronavirus distancing protocols will answer such questions as “When will he come to my house? What kind of cookies does he like?” said program manager and NORAD spokesman Preston Schlachter.Want to watch it? Visit https://www.noradsanta.org, check out #NORADTracksSanta and @NoradSanta on Twitter, or use the associated apps. You can also email noradtrackssanta@outlook.com for the latest.Even before Friday's takeoff, the NORAD webpage had been visited more than 3 million times, Schlachter said.“Every household, every country is having to deal with the impact of this pandemic. Santa Claus is an icon, and he is a source of joy for a lot of people,” Schlachter said.For those worried about Santa's safety — or their own — the bearded man likely will be wearing a mask at each stop, and of course, he's wearing gloves, Schlachter noted. For the technically inclined, NORAD's website offers more data on the voyage (Weight of gifts at takeoff: 60,000 tons, or 54,600 metric tons; sleigh propulsion: nine RP, or reindeer power).Like any good Christmas tale, the programme's origin has been told for generations.In 1955, Air Force Col. Harry Shoup — the on-duty commander one night at NORAD's predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command — answered a call from a child who dialed a number that was misprinted in an ad in a newspaper, thinking she was calling Santa.Shoup “answered the call, thought it was a prank at first, but then realized what had happened and assured the child that he was Santa, and thus started the tradition that we are celebrating now 66 years later,” Schlachter said.NORAD's mission is to watch the skies above North America for any potential threats. Come early Christmas Eve, the Santa operation begins when a cluster of radar stations in northern Canada and Alaska pick up an infrared signature emanating from Rudolph's nose. NORAD's array of geostationary satellites above the Earth monitors the journey.It's all shown on large, “unclassified” display screens in a festively decorated command post at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs. Masked volunteers sit at tables equipped with telephones, garland, miniature Christmas trees, plenty of caffeine-laden candy and coffee — and hand sanitizer.“We Have the Watch,” is NORAD's military-mission motto.And when it comes to Santa, NORAD adds:“Santa calls the shots. We just track him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yes-there-is-a-santa-claus-and-no-covid-19-won-t-stop-him-101640330332979.html

That post has been vacant since Nadir Patel left this summer.An announcement from the office of foreign minister Melanie Joly also included changes to Canada’s consulates in India, with new consul generals taking over in Bengaluru, Chandigarh and Mumbai.Cameron Mackay, who is moving from his post as ambassador to Indonesia and Timor-Leste, has expertise in trade negotiations, pointing towards a focus on such discussions that were revived this year. And having served in Jakarta, Mackay is also familiar with issues concerning the Indo-Pacific, as Ottawa frames a comprehensive new strategy for the region.Cameron Mackay joined the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade in 1995, and has served as director of regional trade policy from 2008-10, director general for China trade policy from 2012-13, director general of the Trade Negotiations Bureau from 2013-15 and director general of the Trade Sectors Bureau from 2015-17.Simultaneous changes were also announced at Canada’s three consulate generals in India. Diedrah Kelly is taking over as consul general in Mumbai from Annie Dubé. Patrick Hébert will become consul general in Chandigarh replacing Mia Yen, while Benoit Préfontaine will take over as consul general in Bengaluru from Nicole Girard.These new appointments were announced as Canada and India continue to engage over a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA), which have been discussed for over a decade but talks had stalled in recent years. On Wednesday, Canada’s minister of international trade, export promotion, small business and economic development Marg Ng spoke with India’s commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal.A release from Global Affairs Canada said the two ministers “welcomed a re-engagement on negotiations toward a Canada-India comprehensive economic partnership agreement and a Canada-India foreign investment promotion and protection agreement, and committed to working closely together to reach agreements in the coming months.”After languishing for nearly four years, Indian and Canadian negotiators resumed discussions in June towards a possible trade pact between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cameron-mackay-appointed-as-canada-s-envoy-to-india-101640325798925.html
24-12-2021||World||Two more Tiananmen monuments removed from Hong Kong university campuses||Two more Hong Kong universities on Friday removed public monuments to the 1989 Tiananmen protests in Beijing, following on the heels of the dismantling of a sculpture marking victims of the crackdown at another university earlier this week.A 6.4 metre (20 foot) tall bronze "Goddess of Democracy" statue holding aloft a flame at Hong Kong's Chinese University had been removed from a public piazza just before dawn.The university said in a statement that the "unauthorised statue" had been taken away."Following an internal assessment, and as the manager of the university campus, CUHK has removed the statue," it read.The Hong Kong sculpture was modelled on a 10-metre (30 feet)white plaster and foam statue erected by students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 as a symbol of their resolve in pursuing liberty and democracy in China under Communist party rule."I feel heartbroken and shocked," said Felix Chow, a former Chinese University student and district councillor."This statue represents the school environment is open. It's a symbol of academic freedom ... It makes people doubt whether the school can still ensure the space is free and people can speak freely," he told Reuters.Unlike mainland China, where Chinese authorities ban any memorials or public commemoration of June 4, Hong Kong had previously remained the only place on Chinese soil where such commemorations were permissible.Hong Kong's Lingnan University also took down a Tiananmen massacre wall relief sculpture, that also included a depiction of the "Goddess of Democracy".The bas-relief includes images of a line of tanks halting before a lone protester known as "tank man"; and victims shot by Chinese troops being carried away.Pictures of the Lingnan site after the removal showed a bare wall and rubble on the ground.The artist, Chen Weiming, who created both the statue and wall relief, told Reuters that he would sue the universities if there was any damage to his works.A towering red picture of the Goddess of Democracy in the Lingnan University student union main hall had also been painted over in grey paint. Students responded by pasting a sheet of paper with the word "shameful" on the effaced image, that was quickly ripped off by security guards.Lingnan University said in a email to Reuters that items that may pose "legal and safety risks" had been "cleared, or removed and stored appropriately".Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 and was promised wide ranging autonomy and freedoms by China under a so-called "one country, two systems" arrangement.Authorities have been clamping down in Hong Kong under a China-imposed national security law that human rights activists say is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners and curb basic freedoms.Chinese and Hong Kong authorities say the security laws have restored order and stability after mass protests in 2019, and that fundamental rights and freedoms are still respected.Earlier this week, the University of Hong Kong dismantled and removed an eight-metre tall "pillar of shame" statue from its campus site that for more than two decades has commemorated pro-democracy protesters killed during China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The disappearances of these symbolic monuments at three universities in quick succession mean there are now hardly any remaining public Tiananmen memorials in the financial hub."Since the Chinese communists implemented the national security law in Hong Kong, they have eradicated the freedom of press, of assembly and the freedom of expression," Chen, the artist, told Reuters."They want to remove the real history of the brutal crackdown ... they wouldn't allow any different viewpoints to continue to exist in Hong Kong."When asked by Reuters whether Hong Kong or Chinese authorities had instructed all three universities to remove these Tiananmen monuments, the office of Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, gave no immediate response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-more-tiananmen-monuments-removed-from-hong-kong-university-campuses-101640324471833.html

The plan follows record defence spending in a supplementary budget passed by parliament this week. China Summons Japan Envoy, Rips Abe for Taiwan Invasion WarningJapan’s military budget is modest by comparison with its ally the U.S., at an estimated $778 billion for 2020, and China at $252 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The overall budget must be passed by parliament before it is officially enacted next year. The U.S., Japan Reach Deal on Payments for Hosting American TroopsTies between Japan and China turned increasingly chilly after Beijing’s clampdown on Hong Kong in 2020 and ships from both countries continue to chase one another around islands they both claim in the East China Sea. Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, have also become increasingly outspoken about the need to prepare for a contingency around Taiwan.The current year’s extra budget and next year’s budget together include:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-approves-record-defence-budget-amid-china-threats-101640313873259.html
24-12-2021||World||WHO says blanket use of booster dose will only widen vaccine inequality, prolong pandemic||The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the prevailing idea of blanket administration of booster doses of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), pointing out that undertaking such a policy will widen the pre-existing vaccine inequality among the first-world and relatively poorer nations.Also Read | Omicron: Will India allow Covid-19 booster dose? Here's what central expert panel saidSpeaking on the matter, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news briefing on Wednesday that blanket Covid-19 booster programs are also likely to prolong the pandemic, rather than ending it, “by diverting supply [of vaccines] to countries that already have high levels of vaccination coverage”. This will give the coronavirus “more opportunity to spread and mutate” thus potentially extending the pandemic, the WHO chief said.Why is blanket booster policy not a good idea?The WHO, in consultation with the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation and its Covid-19 Vaccines Working Group, has concluded that the vast majority of hospitalisations and deaths from coronavirus disease are currently among unvaccinated people and not those who have received the jab or booster doses.“No country can boost its way out of the pandemic,” said the WHO director-general during the press conference.In its interim statement about Covid-19 booster doses, issued on December 22, the WHO made it clear that the focus of immunisation efforts must remain on decreasing death and severe disease, and the protection of the healthcare system. This is especially important in light of the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which is said to be highly infectious and capable of undergoing frequent mutations.Also Read | Several countries shorten Covid-19 booster timelines in bid to tackle Omicron spread“In the context of ongoing global vaccine supply constraints and inequities, broad-based administration of booster doses risks exacerbating vaccine access by driving up demand in countries with substantial vaccine coverage and diverting supply while priority populations in some countries, or in subnational settings, have not yet received a primary vaccination series,” the WHO statement read.According to the UN agency, hurdles in access and distribution have led to prevailing inequities in vaccine supply, which can only be resolved by high coverage and the respective countries' commitment to meet global vaccination targets and to assist other countries in need.Projections made by the public health body show that only by the second half of 2022 will there be sufficient vaccines around the world to undertake the extensive use of boosters in all adults, and beyond, should they be broadly needed. But till then the broad-based booster programmes will only keep widening the existing difference in supply, the WHO concluded.Read the interim statement on booster doses for Covid-19 vaccination here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-blanket-use-of-booster-dose-will-only-widen-vaccine-inequality-prolong-pandemic-101640309140095.html

On China’s Twitter-like Weibo microblog service, singer Karry Wang said he would no longer serve as brand ambassador for Intel, adding in a statement that “national interests exceed everything”.Many Weibo users also called on Chinese citizens to boycott Intel, with one posting under the name “Old Catalan” saying, “Must resist, do not buy!”Meanwhile, China has set a 10-day deadline for entertainers and social media influencers to pay overdue taxes, part of a government campaign to tighten the noose on tax evasion and celebrity excesses.Also, Jilin in northeast China is offering married couples bank loans of up to 200,000 yuan ($31,400) if they have kids, joining other provinces in the roll-out of financial incentives to overcome a declining population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/controversy-erupts-over-intel-s-xinjiang-supplier-statement-101640308789188.html

All residents have been ordered to stay indoors, communities have been put under “closed management”, and outgoing transport including trains and flights have been cancelled, health authorities said as the city started the third round of nucleic acid testing for all residents.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases at 234 is low for a big city but given China’s “zero-Covid” policy, the lockdown is likely to be strictly implemented.Yang Zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the tabloid Global Times the key reason for the lockdown “lies in the scale of community transmission in Xian and unclear epidemiological routes - the outbreak has demonstrated at least three transmission chains”. No infection caused by the Omicron variant has been detected in Xian.The local outbreak has spilled over to at least four other cities, including Yanan and Xianyang in Shaanxi province, Dongguan in south China’s Guangdong province, and Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-govt-locks-down-13million-in-xian-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101640308559882.html

Know more about it||As cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are being reported in the US and Europe and rising in India, reports about “Delmicron” have emerged over the last few days.A member of the Covid-19 task force in Maharashtra has said there is a possibility that the West is caught between twin spikes of the Delta and the Omicron variants of the coronavirus."Delmicron, the twin spikes of Delta and Omicron, in Europe and US has led to a mini tsunami of cases," Dr Shashank Joshi was quoted as saying by a leading newspaper.The highly contagious Omicron variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and has now been reported in 89 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).What is Delmicron?Delmicron is not a new variant of the coronavirus but the Delta and the Omicron strains together fuelling Covid-19 cases. Data shows Omicron is the more dominant variant in the US and accounts for 73 per cent of all new cases, up from less than 1 per cent at the beginning of the month.Also read | Omicron alert in Maharashtra: New guidelines today in view of holiday seasonThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the Delta variant was responsible for more than 99.5 per cent of the Covid-19 infections in the US last month.Meanwhile, health officials in Texas said on Monday the state recorded what ABC News reported is believed to be the first known US death related to Omicron.In the United Kingdom, daily cases of Covid-19 surpassed the 100,000-mark for the first time on Wednesday, even as preliminary studies published in the country and South Africa show Omicron is not severe as other variants of the coronavirus.Experts on DelmicronDoctors say people with a weak immune system, the elderly and ones with comorbidities are at higher risk of getting infected with the Delta and Omicron variants, simultaneously, according to a report. It added that areas with low vaccinations rates are also at risk.However, health experts are divided on whether the combination of the two variants can lead to a super strain.Moderna's chief medical officer Dr Paul Burton said it was possible that both the strains can swap genes and trigger a more dangerous variant. Also read | Variant watch: Hospital risk for Omicron 40-45% lower, says UK study"There's certainly data, there have been some papers published again from South Africa earlier from the pandemic when people - and certainly immunocompromised people - can harbour both viruses," Burton was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.Other researchers have also warned that such “recombination events” are extremely rare but possible if conditions are right and there is a coincidence of mostly uncontrollable events.In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, Peter White, a virologist at the University of New South Wales, also warned about the possibility of a super strain.Will Delmicron impact India?India has reported 354 cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant as of Thursday, according to data collated from across the states by HT. So far, experts have said Delta is the variant that has been fuelling Covid-19 cases in India.Also read | Omicron may cause around 3 billion infections in next 2 months: Report“At present, Delta derivatives, descendants of Delta, are the main variants in circulation in India. Omicron is fast replacing Delta in other parts of the world, but there is no way to predict how the Delta derivatives and Omicron would behave," Joshi, Maharashtra Covid task force member, said according to The Times of India."Sero surveys in Mumbai, Delhi showed that over 90 per cent of the surveyed population had been exposed to Covid. Also, 88 per cent of Indians have taken the first vaccine shot at least," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delmicron-could-be-driving-covid-surge-in-us-europe-know-more-about-it-101640308013683.html
24-12-2021||World||‘Unabomber’ Ted Kaczynski transferred from max security prison to medical facility in North Carolina||The man known as the “Unabomber” has been transferred to a federal prison medical facility in North Carolina after spending the past two decades in a federal Supermax prison in Colorado for a series of bombings targeting scientists.Theodore "Ted" Kaczynski, 79, was moved to the US Bureau of Prison's FMC Butner medical center in eastern North Carolina on December 14, according to bureau spokesperson Donald Murphy. Murphy declined to disclose any details of Kaczynski's medical condition or the reason for his transfer.Kaczynski is serving life without the possibility of parole following his 1996 arrest at the primitive cabin where he was living in western Montana. He pleaded guilty to setting 16 explosions that killed three people and injured 23 others in various parts of the country between 1978 and 1995.The Federal Medical Center Butner, in North Carolina's Granville County just northeast of Durham, offers medical services for prisoners including oncology, surgery, neurodiagnostic, and dialysis, according to the Bureau of Prisons. It opened an advanced care unit and a hospice unit in 2010.Butner has 771 inmates, according to the prison bureau, and has been home to notable offenders including John Hinckley Jr, who was evaluated there after shooting President Ronald Reagan and Bernard Madoff, the infamous architect of a massive Ponzi scheme who died at the North Carolina facility earlier this year.In November, the former Oklahoma zookeeper known as "Tiger King" Joe Exotic was transferred to the facility after a cancer diagnosis, his attorney said. Joe Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, had been convicted for trying to hire someone to kill an animal rights activist and for violating federal wildlife laws.The deadly homemade bombs that the vengeful Kaczynski sent by mail — including an altitude-triggered explosion that went off as planned on an American Airlines flight — changed the way Americans sent packages and boarded airplanes.A 1995 threat to blow up a plane out of Los Angeles before the end of the July 4 weekend threw air travel and mail delivery into chaos. The Unabomber later claimed it was a "prank".The Harvard-trained mathematician had railed against the effects of advanced technology and led authorities on the nation's longest and costliest manhunt. The FBI dubbed him the Unabomber because his early targets seemed to be universities and airlines.In September 1995, The Washington Post in conjunction with The New York Times published his anti-technology manifesto, "Industrial Society and Its Future". The manifesto was printed at the urging of federal authorities after the bomber said he would desist from terrorism if a national publication published his treatise.The treatise led his brother David and David's wife, Linda Patrik, to recognise his writing and turn him in to the FBI.Authorities in April 1996 found Kaczynski outside Lincoln, Montana, in a 10-by-14-foot (3-by-4-meter) plywood and tarpaper cabin where he'd been living since the 1970s. It was filled with journals, a coded diary, explosive ingredients, and two completed bombs.Kaczynski hated the idea of being viewed as mentally ill and during his trial tried to fire his attorneys when they wanted to mount an insanity defense. He eventually pleaded guilty rather than let his attorneys proceed.In his personal journals released at trial by the government at the request of the victims' families, Kaczynski described his motive as "simply personal revenge"."I often had fantasies of killing the kind of people I hated - i.e, government officials, police, computer scientists, the rowdy type of college students who left their beer cans in the arboretum, etc, etc, etc,? he wrote.Kaczynski killed computer rental store owner Hugh Scrutton, advertising executive Thomas Mosser, and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray. California geneticist Charles Epstein and Yale University computer expert David Gelernter were maimed by bombs two days apart in June 1993.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unabomber-ted-kaczynski-transferred-from-max-security-prison-to-medical-facility-in-north-carolina-101640306907415.html

Their analysis revealed Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was more effective, as a third dose of the shot administered after two doses of the same or China’s Sinovac vaccine provided “protective levels” of antibody against Omicron.Italy, UK cases hit recordItaly recorded the highest number of cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The first country in Europe to move into lockdown last year reported 44,595 cases on Thursday, up from 36,293 a day earlier.UK cases surged to a new record for a second day, piling pressure on Prime Minster Boris Johnson as he considers whether to tighten pandemic regulations after Christmas.A total of 119,789 new cases were logged on Thursday. That’s more than double the rate seen at the start of the month, and an increase of more than 10,000 on Wednesday’s caseload - which had been a daily record.Meanwhile, France reported around 88,000 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Thursday, health ministry data showed, the highest in the country since the pandemic began.“Today’s figures are not good,” French health minister Olivier Veran said.Six members of Trudeau Cabinet test positiveSix members of Justin Trudeau’s team tested for positive for Covid-19, the Canadian Prime Minister revealed on Wednesday, even as the country reported a record number of fresh infections.Canadian researchers on Wednesday revealed, what they say, is the first molecular structural analysis of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the country which has shown that it has three to five times more mutations in its spike protein than any previous variant.A near atomic resolution analysis of the variant using a cryo-electron microscope, “reveals how the heavily mutated variant infects human cells and is highly evasive of immunity”, the Canadian researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC), which conducted the study, said.(With inputs from Anirudh Bhattacharyya)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-threat-us-clears-use-of-merck-s-covid-pill-101640303163631.html

Spell said officers opened fire on the suspect.Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Nicholas Prange said a man and a woman were pronounced dead at the scene.Authorities did not immediately say which was the suspect, if the suspect had a gun, or if both deceased were struck by police gunfire.Prange said a woman with moderate-to-serious injuries was transported to a hospital. It wasn't immediately known if she'd been shot.Spell said the injured woman was the victim in the first assault report.He added that police had received calls about the suspect acting erratically before the incident.Imelda Garcia said her sister works in the store and was on break when she heard gunshots and everyone started running. Garcia said she spoke to her sister on the phone and that she's OK but sounded "really nervous".Police escorted people out of the store nearly two hours after the incident.No other details were immediately released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-2-killed-1-injured-in-shooting-at-clothing-store-in-north-hollywood-101640304507703.html

One deputy says, “both of them are okay, Ma’am”, as he hands them back to their distressed grandmother.During a horror storm that killed at least 92 last weekend and destroyed hundreds of properties, the childrens’ grandmother Clara Lutz on Friday said a prayer and hid 15-month-old Kaden and three-month-old Dallas with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible in the bathtub just before it was ripped out of the ground, Lutz told an American news channel, WFIE-TV.Then the house started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.”Lutz was hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub. Her house was stripped to the foundation. She said she looked everywhere in the wreckage for the children.“All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee.”’The bathtub was found in her yard, she said, upside down and with the babies still alive underneath. Sheriff’s officers reunited her with the two children, she said.Dallas suffered a big bump on the back of his head and was taken to a Nashville hospital because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said.Lutz said the parents of the children live at the north end of the county and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.Hopkins County Sheriff Matt Sanderson said that deputies Trent Arnold and Troy Blue, along with members of the public Timmy Vannoy and Michael Crook, helped find and untangle the children from their blankets.“Deputy Blue lifted the tub, Deputy Arnold removed the 15-month-old from the blanket, Michael Crook untangled the three-month-old and then Deputy Arnold and Michael Crook carried the children to their grandmother who was waiting in a patrol car back down the hill,” Sherriff Sanderson told the Weather Channel||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bodycam-footage-from-rescuers-shows-two-infants-recovered-from-us-tornado-rubble-101640292323395.html
24-12-2021||World||Daunte Wright death: Minnesota cop Kim Potter, who 'confused' gun for taser, convicted of manslaughter||Jurors on Thursday convicted a suburban Minneapolis police officer of two manslaughter charges in the killing of Daunte Wright, a Black motorist she shot during a traffic stop after she said she confused her gun for her Taser.The mostly white jury deliberated for about four days before finding former Brooklyn Center officer Kim Potter guilty of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter. Potter, 49, faces about seven years in prison on the most serious count under the state’s sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors said they would seek a longer term.Potter, who testified that she “didn’t want to hurt anybody,” looked down without showing any visible reaction when the verdicts were read.Potter, who is white, shot and killed the 20-year-old Wright during an April 11 traffic stop in Brooklyn Center as she and other officers were trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for a weapons possession charge. The shooting happened at a time of high tension in the area, with former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin standing trial just miles away for the killing of George Floyd. Potter resigned two days later.Jurors saw video of the shooting that was captured by police body cameras and dashcams. It showed Potter and an officer she was training, Anthony Luckey, pull over Wright for having expired license plate tags and an air freshener hanging from his rear-view mirror. During the stop, Luckey discovered there was a warrant for Wright’s arrest for not appearing in court on the weapons possession charge, and he, Potter and another officer went to take Wright into custody.Wright obeyed Luckey’s order to get out of his car, but as Luckey tried to handcuff him, Wright pulled away and got back in. As Luckey held onto Wright, Potter said “I’ll tase ya.” The video then shows Potter holding her gun in her right hand and pointing it at Wright. Again, Potter said, “I’ll tase you,” and then two seconds later: “Taser, Taser, Taser.” One second later, she fired a single bullet into Wright’s chest.“(Expletive)! I just shot him. ... I grabbed the wrong (expletive) gun,” Potter said. A minute later, she said: “I’m going to go to prison.”In sometimes tearful testimony, Potter told jurors that she was “sorry it happened.” She said the traffic stop “just went chaotic” and that she shouted her warning about the Taser after she saw a look of fear on the face of Sgt. Mychal Johnson, who was leaning into the passenger-side door of Wright’s car. She also told jurors that she doesn’t remember what she said or everything that happened after the shooting, as much of her memory of those moments “is missing.”Potter’s lawyers argued that she made a mistake by drawing her gun instead of her Taser. But they also said she would have been justified in using deadly force if she had meant to because Johnson was at risk of being dragged.Prosecutors sought to raise doubts about Potter’s testimony that she decided to act after seeing fear on Johnson’s face. Prosecutor Erin Eldridge, in cross-examination, pointed out that in an interview with a defense expert Potter said she didn’t know why she decided to draw her Taser. During her closing argument, Eldridge also replayed Potter’s body-camera video that she said never gave a clear view of Johnson’s face during the key moments.Eldridge also downplayed testimony from some other officers who described Potter as a good person or said they saw nothing wrong in her actions: “The defendant has found herself in trouble and her police family has her back.”Prosecutors also got Potter to agree that she didn’t plan to use deadly force. They said Potter, an experienced officer with extensive training in Taser use and use of deadly force, acted recklessly and betrayed the badge.For first-degree manslaughter, prosecutors had to prove that Potter caused Wright’s death while committing a misdemeanor — in this case, the “reckless handling or use of a firearm so as to endanger the safety of another with such force and violence that death or great bodily harm to any person was reasonably foreseeable.”The second-degree manslaughter charge required prosecutors to prove that Potter caused Wright’s death “by her culpable negligence,” meaning she “caused an unreasonable risk and consciously took a chance of causing death or great bodily harm” to Wright while using or possessing a firearm.Under Minnesota law, defendants are sentenced only on the most serious conviction if multiple counts involve the same act and the same victim. Prosecutors had said they would seek to prove aggravating factors that merit what’s called an upward departure from sentencing guidelines. In Potter’s case, they alleged that her actions were a danger to others, including her fellow officers, to Wright’s passenger and to the couple whose car was struck by Wright’s after the shooting. They also alleged she abused her authority as a police officer.The maximum for 1st-degree manslaughter is 15 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daunte-wright-death-minnesota-cop-kim-potter-who-confused-gun-for-taser-convicted-of-manslaughter-101640288603026.html
