03-12-2021||World||Canada health body recommends Covid booster shots for all adults||Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) on Friday recommended booster shots of the Covid for all adults as the new Omicron variant is identified in more countries.The Canadian health body, that provides the government with medical and scientific on immunisations, said the third dose of the vaccine jab can be offered to those aged over 18 if they completed their full primary series of vaccination at least six months earlier, noting evidence of decreasing protection from the vaccine against Sars-CoV-2 over timeNACI “reviewed the latest data that suggest protection against infection decreases over time since completion of a primary Covid-19 vaccine series,” it said in its recommendation. And while protection against severe illness remained generally high, it could decrease over time for some people, such as older adults. In such cases, a booster dose can “enhance protection against the infection”. “Booster doses of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines can increase the immune response and are expected to offer enhanced protection against infection and severe disease and may help reduce spread of infection,” it said.Health Canada,the department government responsible for national health policy, in November approved the mRNA jabs manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna for booster shots.“Real-world data suggest that a booster dose of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine provides very good short-term effectiveness against Sars-CoV-2 infection. Long-term effectiveness of booster doses will continue to be monitored,” NACI added.“Waning protection trends observed in other countries give us cause for concern,” said Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam. “NACI’s updated evidence-informed advice on booster doses will assist health authorities in vaccine program planning and delivery to ensure Canadians are provided with the best possible protection as the situation evolves.”Health Canada, on Thursday, said, “If it is necessary to modify existing vaccines, Health Canada has a pathway that allows for an efficient review, while maintaining the same high standards for safety, efficacy and quality before approving.”It added the department was working with international partners and manufacturers to “assess the potential impact” of Omicron on approved test kits, vaccines and treatments.“Genetic variations of viruses— such as the virus that causes Covid-19― are common. That’s why Health Canada has systems in place to quickly and effectively respond to any necessary changes to health products,” it said.“Although protection against severe disease remains high in the general population, we know that protection against infection can decrease over time. We have also seen an increase in the risk of severe disease for select groups who are vaccinated, particularly older adults,” NACI chair Dr Shelley Deeks said on Friday. “Offering booster doses will help ensure that protection against severe disease remains high, and may have an impact on spread in the community as well. It is important to note that there is no information yet on the impact of the new variant, Omicron, on the effectiveness of the vaccine.”

It came as French President Emmanuel Macron is in the Emirates on the first stop of a two-day visit to the Persian Gulf. There was no immediate confirmation of the signing from Emirati officials.Manufacturer Dassault Aviation said the UAE is buying the upgraded F4 version of its multi-role combat aircraft. That will make the Emirates Air Force the first Rafale F4 user outside of France, it said.The deal offers a shot in the arm for France's defense industry after the collapse of a $66 billion contract for Australia to buy 12 French submarines.Dassault Aviation boss Eric Trappier called the sale “a French success story" and “excellent news for France and for its aeronautical industry.”The purchase marks a sizeable step up for the UAE's military capabilities in the oil- and gas-rich region. Charles Forrester, a senior analyst at Janes, said the fighter “will significantly upgrade UAE's airpower capabilities in terms of strike, air-to-air warfare, and reconnaissance."Dassault said the Rafale will give the UAE "a tool capable of guaranteeing sovereignty and operational independence."Macron and Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, were present at the contract signing, it said.French defense officials were jubilant. The defense minister, Florence Parly, said the deal “directly contributes to regional stability.”France has deep ties to the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, particularly since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The UAE opened a French naval base in 2009 at Abu Dhabi's Port Zayed.French warplanes and personnel are also stationed at Al-Dhafra Air Base, a major facility outside the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi that's also home to several thousand American troops.Macron's keen interest in forging personal relationships with Abu Dhabi's crown prince and his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Salman Al Saud, makes him a welcome guest in the region. Both Gulf leaders value a degree of pragmatism when discussing democracy and human rights — issues on which their countries have been heavy criticized by rights groups and European lawmakers — while pursuing business opportunities.Months after Macron was elected in 2017, he traveled to the UAE to inaugurate Louvre Abu Dhabi, built under a $1.2 billion agreement to share the name and art of the world-famous museum in Paris.In September, Macron hosted Abu Dhabi's crown prince at the historic Chateau de Fontainebleau outside Paris, which was restored in 2019 with a UAE donation of 10 million euros ($11.3 million).The UAE and France have also become increasingly aligned over a shared mistrust of Islamist political parties across the Middle East, and backed the same side in Libya's civil strife.A senior French presidency official who spoke to reporters ahead of the trip on customary condition of anonymity said Macron will “continue to push and support the efforts that contribute to the stability of the region, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf.”Gulf tensions will be discussed, the official said, in particular the revived talks about Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement by President Donald Trump. Gulf countries have long been concerned by Iran's nuclear ambitions and influence across the region, particularly in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.“This is a hot topic,” the French official said, adding that Macron discussed the issues in a phone call Monday with Iran's president. He will talk about the call and the issues — including the nuclear deal talks in Vienna — with Gulf leaders, who are “directly concerned by this subject, like all of us but also because they are (Iran's) neighbors,” the official said.France, along with Germany and the U.K., thinks the 2015 nuclear agreement — with minor tweaks — is the way forward with Iran, analysts say. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have bitterly opposed the West's negotiated deal with Iran.“Although the Gulf countries did not like the West's deal with Iran, the prospect of it falling apart acrimoniously is also bad for them and arguably presents worse risks,” said Jane Kinninmont, a London-based Gulf expert with the European Leadership Network think-tank.“Their view has always been the West should have gotten more out of Iran before sealing the deal,” Kinninmont said. “But if the West walks away with nothing, the Gulf countries are beginning to understand that their security will not improve as a result.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-signs-mega-weapons-deal-with-france-buys-80-rafale-fighter-jets-101638537663948.html

The statement added that Friday’s decision reflected the Pakistan government’s commitment and seriousness to facilitate the proposed humanitarian aid.Pakistan had earlier linked its decision to allow the transportation of the relief materials to the condition that the goods be moved only by Pakistani trucks. India made the proposal for shipping the wheat and medicines to the Afghan people via Pakistani soil on October 7, and received a response from the Pakistan government only on November 24.“Since then, we have had discussions with Pakistan on the modalities of this supply...Let me reiterate our belief that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday.The Indian side was keen on using its own trucks or Afghan vehicles in order to ensure that the relief materials directly reached the Afghan people without being diverted. The Indian side also envisages the aid will be distributed only through the UN and its agencies.

The construction of the project started in December 2016, and a train departing from Kunming in the morning will arrive in Vientiane in the evening on the same day, according to China State Railway Group. “With a maximum operating speed of 160 kilometers per hour, trains running on the route will take passengers from Kunming to Vientiane in about 10 hours, including customs clearance time,” a state media report said on Friday.There are several bridges and tunnels on the route.“The bridge and tunnel ratio is quite high with that in Chinese section up to 87 percent and Lao section up to 63 percent, including the 1,651-metre Ban Ladhan Mekong Bridge, 1,459-metre Luang Prabang Mekong Bridge, 9,384-metre Ban Sen No. 2 Tunnel, 9,296-metre Ban Nakok Tunnel,” the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Laos state news agency KPL on Thursday said the project was part of the government’s strategy to convert Laos “from a landlocked country to a land-linked one”.The railway will “generate very positive economic returns” for China and possibly other countries, but it is harder to see “exactly what the economic benefits are going to be” for Laos, Scott Morris of the Centre for Global Development in Washington told the Associated Press.“This is essentially a Chinese public infrastructure project that happens to exist in another country,” he said.Chinese media, however, said it will benefit both countries.“The China-Laos railway will bring great convenience to trade and travel between the two countries and become an important part of the north-south artery of the Indo-Chinese Peninsulas in overcoming land transportation difficulties and developing its economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/laos-opens-6bn-railway-line-built-under-china-s-bri-101638533150309.html
03-12-2021||World||India, Canada cooperate on inquiry into activities of pro-Khalistan activist||India is confident of securing cooperation of Canadian law enforcement authorities in the ongoing investigation into the activities of pro-Khalistan Canadian resident Hardeep Singh Nijjar.An Indian official confirmed that Nijjar was among those focused upon during discussions with Canadian law enforcement when a two-member team of Indias’ National Investigation Agency (NIA) visited Ottawa in early November.“Material” related to Nijjar’s activities were shared with the Canadian interlocutors and the NIA was assured of cooperation.The NIA team was in Ottawa at the invitation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and also held meetings with the International Crime and Counter-terrorism Bureau of Global Affairs Canada and with senior officials from the International Affairs Division of Public Safety Canada.At the time, a release issued by India’s high commission in Ottawa noted the visit was intended, among other matters, to ensure “better coordinating investigation against entities and individuals suspected of terrorism and to discuss other criminal matters”. India had also sought the listing of the separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) as a terrorist entity by Canada. Nijjar, originally from Jalandhar and a resident of Surrey in British Columbia, is SFJ’s principal figure in Canada.Perhaps not coincidentally, days after the NIA team returned to India, the agency filed a chargesheet against Nijjar before a special court in New Delhi, under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, related to planning terror acts in India.Nijjar and the SFJ have denied any involvement in terrorism though they openly support secession and are behind the non-binding Punjab Referendum, which is currently in progress. SFJ’s legal counsel Gurpatwant Pannun told the Hindustan Times India was “using charges of terrorism” against Nijjar as “a weapon to stop him from promoting Khalistan Referendum Campaign in Punjab”.He also said their lawyers were “preparing to seek records from (the Justin) Trudeau government about the meeting between NIA and Canadian law enforcement”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-canada-cooperate-on-inquiry-into-activities-of-pro-khalistan-activist-101638528289186.html

They will also not be allowed to enter bars, restaurants, and cinema theatres, according to a draft document signed off by the nation's leaders.What's more, the unvaccinated will also be banned from Christmas markets, a major slap in the face keeping in mind the upcoming festive season, and there will also be restrictions on the number of people they can socialise with.The unvaccinated people will still be allowed to meet others in private settings, but only in very limited numbers. A household with an unvaccinated person over 14 can meet with only two people from another household; the limit does not apply when everyone is vaccinated.“The situation in our country is serious,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin, calling the measures an “act of national solidarity”. In what is likely to be her last news conference as chancellor, Merkel also brought up the highly contentious idea of a general vaccine mandate, which will force the population to get inoculated against Covid-19.Informing that the country's parliament would be debating the proposal with input from the national ethics committee, Merkel said the mandate could take effect as early as February next year.Also Read | Unvaccinated people lead Covid 4th wave in Germany: Report“In light of this situation, I really think it's necessary to pass such a mandate,” Merkel said, adding that she would have voted for it if she were still a lawmaker.Meanwhile, Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz, who is expected to be elected chancellor by a center-left coalition next week, has also backed a general vaccine mandate, but he favours letting lawmakers vote on the issue according to their personal conscience rather than party lines. “If we had a higher vaccination rate, we wouldn’t be discussing this now,” he said.Germany reported as many as 73,209 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday. The Robert Koch Institute also reported 388 new deaths from the coronavirus, bringing the fatality toll since the start of the pandemic to 1,02,178.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-germany-to-ban-the-unvaccinated-from-public-life-as-merkel-scholz-back-jab-mandate-101638522429174.html

03-12-2021||World||'Drowning in garbage': Ukraine struggles with trash crisis||For stray dogs and scavenging birds, Landfill No.5 outside the Ukrainian capital Kiev is a treasure trove of trash, but the mountains of overflowing and noxious garbage are plaguing residents.Nina Popova, a 73-year-old retired accountant who lives in the nearby village of Pidgirtsi, says life there is a misery."It reeks. We're all sick. We have heart problems and difficulty breathing," Popova told AFP outside her modest brick cottage.Breathing heavily, she added that her children "suffocate" when they come to visit.Covering 63 hectares (156 acres), the sprawling dump outside Kiev is one of the largest in Ukraine and part of network of more than 6,100 landfills.Already at capacity, it was slated for closure in 2018, with garbage diverted to a new site. But the new facility was never constructed and trash is piling higher and higher.The story of the site points to a larger problem in the country.Thirty years after Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, it lacks a functioning waste management system and requisite resources to tackle a garbage crisis that is perpetuating public health and ecological concerns.The president's office concedes that most landfills are overflowing and fall short of safety standards. It estimates some 33,000 illegal dumps have proliferated throughout the country."It's not a secret to anyone that Ukraine is drowning in garbage. And every day, every minute the situation is getting worse," then-deputy head of the presidency, Yulia Svyrydenko, warned in September.'Lever' to halt climate changeShe made the comments at a meeting of local and regional officials after President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced concerns. But the problem has much wider ramifications.Globally, landfills like the one menacing Popova's neighbourhood contribute to climate change as a major emitter of methane, a gas 30 times more harmful than CO2 according to the United Nations.UN Environment Programme executive director Inger Andersen in May said reducing methane was "the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years".To address the problem, Kiev introduced a law in 2018 requiring households to sort waste to aid recycling efforts.The order has largely been ignored and just four percent of the approximately 10 million tonnes of household trash produced annually is sorted, according to the presidency.Added to that, there is only one waste incinerator -- dating from the Soviet period -- to serve the entire country of 40 million. It lacks capacity to handle waste even from Kiev.The crux of the problem is that Ukrainian authorities are either unwilling or unable to pay more to better process garbage, analysts said.Kiev shells out less than 10 euros ($11) to process a ton of waste compared to 100-170 euros in Western European countries, explained Svyatoslav Pavlyuk, executive director of the Ukrainian Association of Energy-Efficient Cities.'It's scary'"This sum isn't enough to actually treat waste. It only covers its transportation to a field and its placement in the ground," Pavlyuk said.Yevgeniya Aratovska, a 42-year-old economist, took matters into her own hands six years ago, launching a small sorting site in Kiev called No Waste Ukraine."I realised that a lot of people didn't even know that it's necessary to sort," Aratovska said.Khrystyna Richmanenko did not realise how much waste she was producing until she started sorting it. "It's scary," the 29-year-old teacher remarked.She added that there were no recycling centres near her home or official instructions on where to find one."You have to look for yourself how to do it properly," she added.More than 45 percent of Ukrainians say a lack of recycling bins is the main obstacle to more sorting, according to a November poll.Analysts added that authorities should do more to raise awareness among Ukrainians about the impact their waste has on the environment.Ultimately, said environmental activist Kostiantyn Yalovyi, what was needed is a drastic increase in funding to better handle waste.Even though that investment would be likely to fall on Ukrainians and trigger protests, the stakes of doing nothing were much higher."If today we don't start sorting and generally change Ukrainians' attitude towards garbage, the entire country could turn into a landfill", Yalovyi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drowning-in-garbage-ukraine-struggles-with-trash-crisis-101638520760614.html

03-12-2021||World||Omicron Covid-19 variant: US, Australia detect new cases as several countries impose restrictive measures||The United States and Australia announced their first locally transmitted cases of the Omicron variant as authorities worldwide rushed Friday to stem the spread of the heavily mutated strain of Covid-19.The World Health Organization has said it could take weeks to determine whether Omicron is more transmissible and whether it causes more severe infections -- as well as how effective current treatments and vaccines are against it.But the new variant, first reported by South Africa, has already cast the world's recovery into doubt, with the EU health agency warning it could cause more than half of Europe's Covid cases in the next few months.More than two dozen governments have now detected cases of the variant -- including India, one of the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic since it first emerged nearly two years ago.A preliminary study by South African researchers suggests the strain is three times more likely to cause reinfections compared to the Delta or Beta strains.The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was described as "very concerning" by Michael Head, a scientist at the University of Southampton.Ten cases have so far been confirmed in the United States, including five in New York announced Thursday, one in Los Angeles county, and one in Hawaii.The Hawaii case and one in Minnesota both involved residents with no recent international travel history -- signaling the strain is already circulating inside the country."This is a case of community spread," the Hawaii Health Department said.The cases were reported as US President Joe Biden outlined his plans to battle Covid-19 during the winter, with new testing requirements for travelers and a surge in vaccination efforts."It's a plan that I think should unite us," he said.All incoming travelers will need to test negative within a day before their flights, and rapid tests that currently cost $25 will be covered by insurance and distributed free to the uninsured.Australia on Friday, too, reported a student with no history of foreign travel had tested positive for the variant.The case, detected in the country's largest city of Sydney, comes despite a sweeping ban on non-citizens entering the country and restrictions on flights from southern Africa.And just a day after Singapore reported two cases of the strain, neighboring Malaysia on Friday reported its first infections with the variant.The case was detected in a foreign student travelling from South Africa, who had arrived in Malaysia on November 19, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said.The case was only confirmed on December 2, after officials conducted genome sequencing on some samples taken from recent arrivals at Kuala Lumpur airport, he said.Sri Lanka also announced its first Omicron case, a citizen who returned from South Africa.Restrictions reimposedThe variant's detection and spread represent a major challenge to efforts to end the pandemic, with several nations already reimposing restrictions many had hoped were a thing of the past.In Germany, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel said large parts of public life would be "open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered" from Covid-19 ahead of a vote by the country's parliament on mandatory immunizations.It is not yet clear when the latest measures will go into effect, but the plans include a blanket ban on entering bars, restaurants and cinemas for anyone who is unvaccinated or not recovered from Covid, according to a document signed off by the leaders of the country's 16 states.The agreement also includes new restrictions on large gatherings and the closure of nightclubs in areas with a weekly incidence rate above 350 infections per 100,000 people.Fireworks will be banned on New Year's Eve to stop large crowds from gathering, according to North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Hendrik Wuest.Rising infections of the Delta variant had already forced European governments to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns in a desperate attempt to limit hospitalizations, leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.India has yet to impose new blanket international travel bans, but its health ministry earlier this week ordered all inbound travelers from "countries at-risk" to undergo mandatory post-arrival Covid testing, along with the random testing of other international arrivals.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned of a "toxic mix" of low vaccination and testing rates creating a "recipe for breeding and amplifying variants."And the United Nations said Thursday that the pandemic has pushed tens of millions more people into poverty, estimating that 274 million people would need emergency assistance next year as economies suffer with Covid-19

But every country and every community must prepare for new surges in cases," Kasai said. “The positive news in all of this is that none of the information we have currently about omicron suggests we need to change the directions of our response."Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, or if it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart the vaccine.Kasai said omicron has been designated a variant of concern because of the number of mutations and because early information suggests it may be more transmissible than other variants of the virus. More testing and observation is necessary, he said.Thus far, four countries and regions in the Western Pacific — Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea — have reported cases of the omicron variant, said WHO Regional Emergency Director Dr. Babatunde Olowokure. That number is likely to go up as more cases are discovered globally, Olowokure said.India, Singapore and Malaysia have also reported their first cases in the last 24 hours.“In terms of what countries should be doing now, our experiences over the last few years, especially in responding to delta, provides a guide of what we need to do, as well as how to cope with future surges in a more sustainable way," he said.Those include full vaccination coverage, social distancing, mask wearing and other measures. Those can then be calibrated in response to the local context, Olowokure said.The goal is to “ensure we are treating the right patients in the right place at the right time, and so therefore ensuring that ICU beds are available, particularly for those who need them," he said.Despite the positive trends in handling the pandemic in the Western Pacific region, largely through high vaccination rates, “we cannot be complacent," Kasai said.Globally, cases have been increasing for seven consecutive weeks and the number of deaths has started to rise again too, driven largely by the delta variant and decreased use of protective measures in other parts of the world, he said.“We should not be surprised to see more surges in the future. As long as transmission continues, the virus can continue to mutate as the emergence of omicron demonstrates, reminding us of the need to stay vigilant," Kasai said.He warned especially about the likelihood of surges due to more gatherings and movement of people during the holiday season. The northern winter season will likely bring other infectious respiratory diseases such as influenza alongside COVID-19, Kasai said.“It is clear that this pandemic is far from over and I know that people are worried about omicron," he said. “But my message today is that we can adapt the way we manage this virus to better cope with the future surges and reduce their health, social and economic impacts."The WHO Western Pacific Region includes 37 countries and areas from Palau to Mongolia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/measures-against-delta-work-for-omicron-variant-too-who-101638512639381.html
03-12-2021||World||Omicron: Canada speeds up Covid-19 booster dose campaign||Canadian health authorities are scrambling to accelerate timelines for administering booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines as concerns over the Omicron variant of the virus grow.At least two provinces in the country have announced that they are expanding administration of booster doses. Alberta has announced that it will provide the third dose of a vaccine approved for boosters to those above the age of 18.Meanwhile, Ontario, the country’s most populous province announced on Thursday it is expanding its booster eligibility to those above 50 from December 13.As yet, the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation (NACI) has only recommended boosters for those above 70 and certain vulnerable demographics, including frontline healthcare workers and residents of long-term care homes.However, an updated recommendation is expected, perhaps as early as on Friday, expanding the eligible population. NACI has suggested a gap of at least six months between the completion of the primary series of vaccination and the booster. Thus far, boosters manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been approved in Canada.But given the arrival of the Omicron variant, there may be reconsideration of information related to boosters since they were approved earlier. In a tweet on Thursday evening, Health Canada said, “If it is necessary to modify existing vaccines, Health Canada has a pathway that allows for an efficient review, while maintaining the same high standards for safety, efficacy and quality before approving.”It added the department was working with international partners and manufacturers to “assess the potential impact” of Omicron on approved test kits, vaccines and treatments.“Genetic variations of viruses - such as the virus that causes Covid-19 - are common. That’s why Health Canada has systems in place to quickly and effectively respond to any necessary changes to health products,” it said.Announcing the expanded booster programme, Ontario’s Deputy Premier and Minister of Health Christine Elliott said, “Vaccines continue to be our best protection against Covid-19.”“Achieving the highest vaccination rates possible remains our best tool to protect us, reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, and fight the significant surge of new cases and the new Omicron variant,” Dr Kieran Moore, the province’s chief medical officer of health, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-canada-speeds-up-covid-19-booster-dose-campaign-101638515748882.html

03-12-2021||World||Dead or alive? On the trail of Taliban's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada||When the Taliban overran Kabul in mid-August, seizing power for the second time, the years-old mystery over the whereabouts of the movement's Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada deepened further.Whether the elderly cleric is alive or dead is something many Afghans are uncertain about, and even the most dedicated analysts have doubts about who is really leading the group.AFP went on the trail of the elusive leader, and the findings are inconclusive.On October 30 -- two months after a Taliban spokesman insisted Akhundzada was alive and well in Kandahar -- rumours swirled in the southern city that the "emir" had delivered a speech at a Koranic school, or madrassa.Taliban officials gave their stamp of authenticity to his appearance at the Hakimia madrassa, releasing a crackling audio recording lasting more than 10 minutes."May God reward the oppressed people of Afghanistan who fought the infidels and the oppressors for 20 years," intones an aged and echoing voice, said to be that of Akhundzada.His public profile had previously been largely limited to annual written messages released for Islamic holidays.In one of the poorest suburbs of Kandahar, between a litter-strewn stream and a dirt track, two Taliban fighters stand guard in front of the Hakimia madrassa's blue-and-white gate.It has become something of a magnet since October 30, attracting curious -- albeit respectfully distant -- crowds of Taliban supporters.- 'Watching and crying' -When the supreme leader visited, he was "armed" and accompanied by "three security guards", the madrassa's head of security Massum Shakrullah told AFP."Even cellphones and sound recorders" were not allowed into the venue, he added.One of the students, Mohammed, 19, said "we all were watching him and were just crying".Asked if he could confirm that it was definitely Akhundzada, Mohammed said he and his peers were so overjoyed that they "forgot to watch... his face".The need for Taliban leaders to keep vanishingly low profiles became especially pronounced in the last decade of war, as deadly US drone strikes multiplied.Akhundzada rose to the top spot after one such strike killed his predecessor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, in 2016.He quickly secured the backing of Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, who called him "the emir of the faithful".This endorsement by Osama bin Laden's heir helped seal his jihadist credentials with the Taliban's long-time allies.The Taliban have released just one photograph of Akhundzada -- five years ago, when he took the group's reins.And even that photo, depicting him with a grey beard, white turban and a forceful gaze, was taken two decades prior, according to the Taliban.The supreme leader's appearance scotched "rumours and propaganda" about his death, said Maulvi Said Ahmad, who heads the madrassa where Akhundzada reportedly appeared.He looked "exactly the same" as in the famous photo, said Mohammad Musa, 13, who watched from afar.- 'Long been dead' -Officials of the ousted Afghan regime and many Western analysts are sceptical, believing that Akhundzada died years ago.For them the madrassa visit was a carefully choreographed deception.There is a precedent -- the Taliban pretended founder Mullah Omar was alive for two years following his death in 2013.Akhundzada himself "has long been dead and had no role before the takeover of Kabul", one security official of the former regime told AFP.He was killed alongside his brother in a suicide attack in Quetta, Pakistan, "about three years ago", the source believes.This theory, sometimes with slight variations, is seen as credible by several foreign intelligence agencies.A separate regional security source told AFP that "nobody would confirm and nobody would deny" Akhundzada's purported death.The Pentagon and the CIA, meanwhile, did not respond to AFP's request for comment on the rumours of Akhundzada's death.- Eminent scholar -In Panjwai, a district on a vast arid plateau near Kandahar, everyone knows of the Akhundzadas, a line of respected theologians.The emir was born in the village of Sperwan."At the time of the Soviet invasion (1979) fighting broke out in the village and Hibatullah left for Pakistan," Niamatullah, a young fighter and former student of the supreme leader, told AFP.After this first move to Pakistan, Akhundzada became a respected scholar and earned the title "Sheikh al-Hadith", a distinction reserved for the most eminent scholars of the Prophet Mohammed's sayings.In the early 1990s, as the Islamist insurgency was taking hold in the wake of the Soviet occupation, Akhundzada, then in his thirties, returned to the village.He would hold consultations with visitors from "the city and from Pakistan", remembers Abdul Qayum, a 65-year-old villager.According to snippets from his official biography, his rise was meteoric after the Taliban took power in Kabul in 1996.After running the local madrassa, he became a judge at Kandahar provincial court, then head of the military court in Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan until 2000.By the time the Taliban were forced from power in late 2001, he was heading Kabul's military court.Akhundzada then fled to Pakistan, finding sanctuary in Quetta.His mastery of Islamic law made him the head of the Taliban's shadow justice system and the acclaimed trainer of a whole generation of fighters who graduated through Quetta.- 'Centre of gravity' -Akhundzada was "the centre of gravity for the Taliban... keeping the group intact", one Pakistan-based Taliban member told AFP.According to this source, who says he has met the supreme leader three times -- the last time in 2020 -- Akhundzada does not use modern technology.He prefers to make phone calls on landlines and communicates via letters to the Taliban officials who now make up the government and with whom he retains a strong rapport.He would have given the green light to the final offensive against the old regime and kept track of operations from Kandahar, where he had already been discreetly installed for several months, the Pakistani source said.The continued fear of elimination, even after the end of the war with the Americans, explains Akhundzada's continued low profile, several Taliban sources say.And if he were already dead, a regional security source said, concerns over the rival Sunni extremist group, the Islamic State's local chapter (IS-K), would in part explain the Taliban concealing the news -- as any such announcement could prompt defections."If they announce Akhundzada is no more and we are looking for a new emir, it will factionalise the Taliban and IS-K could take advantage," he said.Despite the speculation, the Taliban insist nothing is untoward.The emir is "leading in an orderly manner", a spokesman told AFP, adding "it is not necessary" for him to appear publicly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dead-or-alive-on-the-trail-of-taliban-s-supreme-leader-hibatullah-akhundzada-101638499178664.html
03-12-2021||World||In surprise move, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath to take top leadership role||International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath is set to take over from Geoffrey Okamoto as the institution’s No. 2 official, the institution said Thursday.The move comes as a surprise because Gopinath, the first woman to serve as the IMF’s chief economist, had said in October she planned to rejoin Harvard University in January to retain her tenured facility post after three years of public service.The IMF said in a statement that “some realignment in the roles and responsibilities of the fund’s senior management team is being undertaken.”By tradition, the first deputy managing director is nominated by the U.S. and appointed by the IMF managing director. The Treasury endorses this choice and is pleased the job responsibilities of this role are being restored, according to a person familiar with the department’s position who asked not to be identified.The first deputy managing director “will take the lead on surveillance and related policies, oversee research and flagship publications and help foster the highest-quality standards for fund publications,” the IMF said. Gopinath led the IMF’s research department through the pandemic era and a 2020 recession that was the worst peacetime decline since the Great Depression. She joined the Washington-based lender at the start of 2019, succeeding Maury Obstfeld, after having taught in Harvard’s economics department since 2005. She holds a doctorate in economics from Princeton University, where Ben Bernanke was among her advisers before he became Federal Reserve chairman. Another adviser was Ken Rogoff, one of Gopinath’s predecessors as IMF chief economist.Okamoto, who took the first deputy MD position in March 2020, plans to return to the private sector, according to the statement. Before joining the fund, he was the U.S. Treasury Department’s acting assistant secretary for international finance and development, and a veteran of President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations with China. While at the fund, he helped guide it on country issues and in strengthening its relationships with key multilateral groups including the Group of Seven and Group of 20, the IMF said. During their time at the organization, the IMF issued a record $650 billion of reserves to help nations confront the Covid-19 crisis. The institution also weathered accusations that Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva improperly influenced a World Bank ranking of China’s business climate when she was a top official there. The scandal brought IMF data and forecasts under increasing scrutiny and poses a challenge to the fund in terms of protecting its reputation and credibility.Georgieva repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and the IMF board in October said its investigation didn’t conclusively demonstrate that she played an improper role in the report in question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-surprise-move-imf-chief-economist-gita-gopinath-to-take-top-leadership-role-101638495467628.html

There were 35,670 suspected reinfections among nearly 2.8 million individuals with positive test results for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Those who tested positive for Covid 90 days apart were considered to have suspected reinfections.The paper is available on a medical preprint server and has not yet been peer-reviewed."Recent reinfections have occurred in individuals whose primary infections occurred across all three waves, with the most having their primary infection in the Delta wave," tweeted Juliet Pulliam, director of the South African DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis.The researchers also observed a recent surge in the number of reinfections in individuals who already had multiple suspected infections from mid-November. The study may have significant implications for public health measures, particularly in countries with high rates of immunity from prior infection.Omicron threat: US' new testing rules to increase hassle for inbound travellersPulliam said the authors didn’t have information about the vaccination status of individuals with suspected reinfections and therefore could not assess whether Omicron also evades vaccine-derived immunity. The scientists are planning to quantify the extent of Omicron’s immune escape for both natural and vaccine-derived immunity.“Data are also urgently needed on disease severity associated with Omicron infection, including in individuals with a history of prior infection,” Pulliam wrote.Praising the research as "high quality”, Michael Head, a scientist at the University of Southampton, said that the analysis look “very concerning”.“Might this all still be a 'false alarm'? That is looking less and less likely," he said in a statement, reported news agency AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-linked-with-substantial-ability-to-evade-immunity-from-prior-infection-south-african-study-101638494167458.html
03-12-2021||World||Germany's Merkel at farewell ceremony: Don't tolerate hate||Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Germans to stand up to hatred, at a military ceremony Thursday bidding her farewell after 16 years in office.Merkel was honored with a traditional military musical performance and march in front of almost all the country's political elite — save for the far-right Alternative for Germany, who weren't invited.“Our democracy also lives from the fact that wherever hatred and violence are seen as a legitimate means of pursuing one's interests, our tolerance as democrats has to find its limit,” said in a speech ahead of the ceremony.The event, which was held at the Defense Ministry rather than in a more public setting due to pandemic constraints, involved a parade and a brass band playing three songs of Merkel's choice.The first piece was “You Forgot the Color Film” released in 1974 by East German-born punk singer Nina Hagen. In it, the singer recounts a young woman’s lament that her boyfriend failed to take color pictures of their beach holiday.Hagen, like Merkel, grew up in East Germany, but emigrated to the West in 1976 after clashing with the communist country’s authorities.Merkel explained that the song was “a highlight of my youth, which is known to have taken place in the GDR.” East Germany was officially known as the German Democratic Republic.“By chance, (the song) is also set in a region that was in my former constituency" on the Baltic Sea, she added. “As such, it all fits together.”Her second choice was a popular chanson by German singer Hildegard Knef called “It Shall Rain Red Roses for Me.” She was presented with a bouquet of the flowers.The final piece chosen by the daughter of a Protestant pastor was an 18th century Christian hymn, “Holy God, we Praise thy Name.”Merkel remains caretaker chancellor until her successor, the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, is sworn in next week. She wished him and his new center-left government “all the best, good luck and much success.”The long-time leader also urged her audience to “always see the world through the eyes of others too” and to work “with joy in your hearts.”Before Thursday evening's ceremony, she met other federal and state leaders to agree on new measures to curb coronavirus infections in Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-merkel-at-farewell-ceremony-don-t-tolerate-hate-101638489903031.html

The new travel guidelines would require air travellers entering the United States to produce a negative test for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) within one day of boarding their flight.This is expected to increase hassle for inbound travellers as the previous period was three days.“This tighter testing timetable provides an added degree of protection as scientists continue to study the omicron variant,” Biden said.The spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the new testing requirement would strengthen the “already robust protocols” for international travellers.The federal mask mandate requiring passengers to wear face masks on planes, trains, and buses has also been extended to March 18. The mandate was scheduled to expire in mid-January.What India's 2 Omicron cases reveal: How the variant spread, symptoms, CT valueWhile the new travel requirements of vaccination or negative test have not been extended to domestic fliers, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press conference that “nothing is off the table.” The fresh guidelines underscore the urgency with which the White House is acting in the wake of the Omicron variant first identified in South Africa but has been detected in many countries since then.However, the hassle has somewhat been offset by other relaxations, including allowing the use of rapid antigen tests instead of requiring more costly PCR tests. The insurance companies have been directed to cover the cost of the Covid test, which could be an added relief for the travellers.White House said that the new testing rules are expected to take effect early next week.The United States has reported cases of Omicron variant from California, Colorado, Minnesota, and New York state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-threat-us-new-testing-rules-to-increase-hassle-for-inbound-travellers-101638490733068.html

As per the report by the UK daily -- The Guardian, which obtained an advance copy of The Chief's Chief, a memoir by Meadows, Trump had tested positive for Covid-19 just three days before his September 29, 2020 election debate with Biden.The initial symptoms were mild and were taken to be a cold, the upcoming book recounts. Meadows also wrote that the positive Covid-19 test was quickly followed by a negative, shortly before the presidential debate.On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter he and his wife Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. However, despite the negative test, as claimed in the report, Trump fell seriously sick due to the infection and was flown to the presidential facility at Walter Reed National Military Medical Hospital a day later. He received intensive treatment for three nights there.According to Meadows' account, the positive result came through just as Trump was leaving the White House for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on September 26.A second test, that Meadows said was a more accurate kind, gave a negative result shortly afterwards. Trump took this as "full permission" to continue his schedule, including that night's rally and the Biden debate three days later, Meadows said in his book.The latest developments have raised fresh questions on Trump about potential safety risks faced by the attendees of the debate. If the claims are confirmed, it would further show that the Trump administration, which has already faced heavy criticism for showing negligence in managing the pandemic, did not take the virus seriously.According to the book, Trump's campaign also did not inform the debate organisers about the positive test. "I didn't want to alarm the public," Meadows wrote in the book explaining why he allowed Trump to continue with his schedule after the second, negative test.Meanwhile, Trump has denied the claims. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Trump said, "The story of me having Covid prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News. In fact, a test revealed that I did not have Covid prior to the debate," he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tested-covid-positive-days-before-1st-presidential-debate-reveals-book-101638412517754.html
