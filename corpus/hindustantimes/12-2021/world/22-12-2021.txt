While hospital-grade air filters on modern passenger jets make the risk of infection much lower on planes than in crowded places on the ground such as shopping malls, omicron is rapidly spreading just as more travelers take to the skies for year-end holidays and family reunions.Business class may be safer than more densely packed economy cabins, said David Powell, physician and medical adviser to the International Air Transport Association, which represents almost 300 carriers worldwide. As before, passengers should avoid face-to-face contact and surfaces that are frequently touched, and people sitting near to each other should try not to be unmasked at the same time during meals, he said.Powell, former chief medical officer at Air New Zealand Ltd., spoke with Bloomberg News on Tuesday about flying during the pandemic. Here’s an edited transcript.What are the risks of infection during a flight?Whatever the risk was with delta, we would have to assume the risk would be two to three times greater with omicron, just as we’ve seen in other environments. Whatever that low risk -- we don’t know what it is -- on the airplane, it must be increased by a similar amount.What should passengers do to minimise the risks?Avoid common-touch surfaces, hand hygiene wherever possible, masks, distancing, controlled-boarding procedures, try to avoid face-to-face contact with other customers, try to avoid being unmasked in flight, for meal and drink services, apart from when really necessary. The advice is the same, it’s just that the relative risk has probably increased, just as the relative risk of going to the supermarket or catching a bus has increased with omicron.What about masks at meal times?For a two-hour flight, it’s pretty easy to say, ‘just keep your mask on the whole time.’ But if it’s a 10-hour flight, it becomes pretty unreasonable to ask people not to eat and drink. What most airlines have been doing is encouraging, but not insisting, on customers trying to stagger their mask-off periods a little bit.In simple terms, two people masked have minimal transmission from one to the other. If one of you removes your mask, then that person’s at greater risk of transmitting and at slightly greater risk of receiving. But if both of you remove then obviously, there’s no barrier there and you can freely transmit one to the other.Would it be safest not to fly at all?The greatest protection you can give yourself is to be vaccinated and boosted. The protection that you give yourself from an extra mask or a different type of mask, or not flying at all, frankly, is probably less than the benefit you would get from just being fully boosted. There’s a sort of a rule of thumb starting to appear, that essentially omicron loses you one vaccine dose of benefit. So, two doses against omicron is about similar protection to one dose against delta. That’s not established in hard science, but it roughly seems to correlate with what’s coming out in studies.Is it safe for healthy passengers if an omicron case is sitting on the plane?It’s an enclosed space, but it’s a leaky box, and we pressurize it by putting a huge airflow on one end of it, and then having an exhaust valve out the other end. So you’re sitting in a very high-flow airflow environment. It is an enclosed space, but that doesn’t shout ‘risk’ to me. An Irish pub with a fan in the corner shouts ‘risk’ to me, or a gymnasium with a whole lot of people shouting and grunting and sweating. But any flight you take does involve airports as well, which are a little bit less controlled. So, there is risk there. What can you do? Vaccination, testing, mask-wearing, distancing. Are surgical masks better than cloth masks? Yes, probably. On average, maybe 10-20%.Most of the documented cases of spread in flight are from way back in March 2020 -- before we had testing, before we had masks, before we had organized boarding procedures, before there was a high degree of awareness about not flying if you were unwell.What about leaving middle seats on rows empty?It’s incredibly appealing, intuitively. It does give a greater physical distance between you and the next person. But we haven’t seen that actually deliver a whole lot of benefit. But if there’s some cross airflow from the aisle to the window, or the window to the aisle, and you remove the person from the middle seat, you’ve helped the person who would have been in the middle seat. You probably haven’t helped the person in the next seat a whole lot, because it’s likely to drift across without the obstruction of that first person.Should cabin crew wear full protective clothing, such as body suits and face shields?Probably not. There hasn’t been a lot of passenger-to-crew transmission throughout Covid-19. There has been some, but it’s very, very small numbers. It’s tended to be passenger-to-passenger or crew-to-crew. And again, very small numbers of crew-to-passenger. Let’s just be stringent about the measures already in place, and wait until we have a bit more data on omicron.What are the risks of infection at the airport?The requirements for airflows on board are much more stringent than they are for airport buildings generally. The protections for the airline cabin are: everybody stays seated, facing the same direction, there are these physical barriers that are in the way, you have a high degree of airflow that’s by and large from ceiling to floor, minimal drift along the airplane, a little bit more drift across the airplane. Roughly 50% of the airflow is fresh from outside, 50% is recirculated, but when it’s recirculated, it’s HEPA-filtered, so it’s clean. Most of those aren’t present in the airport phase. You’ve got much more random movement, much more potential for face-to-face contact, you’ve got generally reduced airflows. Airport ventilation rates are a 10th, maybe, of what they are on the airplane.What about children on the flight? How should families manage them?The risk of severe illness to small children themselves from traveling is low, just because the risk of severe Covid is so low for children. It’s one of the unanswered questions with omicron. The risk is not so much to them. The risk is that they may be mildly infected, not know it, and potentially be spreading whilst they’re traveling. And so that is a risk. Getting them to keep a mask on is hard. The smaller they are, the harder that’s going to be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flight-passengers-at-least-twice-more-likely-to-catch-covid-amid-omicron-spread-101640190036222.html

Ahead of the festive week of Christmas and New Year, the WHO chief told a media briefing that vaccine booster doses cannot be seen “as a ticket to go ahead with planned celebrations."Citing a report of Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) on Immunization, the WHO chief stressed that the focus of vaccination must remain on decreasing death and severe disease. He said about 20% of all vaccine doses administered every day are currently being given as boosters or additional doses, expressing concern that blanket booster programmes will exacerbate vaccine inequity.“Blanket booster programmes are likely to prolong the pandemic, rather than ending it, by diverting supply to countries that already have high levels of vaccination coverage, giving the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate," he told the briefing.Western countries have expanded their booster programme for the majority of the eligible adult population while many countries are yet to fully vaccinate half of their population. Tedros highlighted that the vast majority of hospitalisations and deaths are being in “unvaccinated people, not un-boosted people.”“And we must be very clear that the vaccines we have, remain effective against both the Delta and Omicron variants," he said, adding that global priority must be to support all countries to reach the 40% target as quickly as possible, and the 70% target by the middle of 2022.The WHO also issued updated guidance for health workers, recommending the use of either a respirator or a medical mask, in addition to other personal protective equipment, when entering a room on suspected or confirmed case Omicron patient. It advised that respirators, which includes masks known as N95, FFP2 and others, should especially be worn in care settings where ventilation is known to be poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-omicron-scare-who-chief-says-no-nation-can-boost-its-way-out-of-pandemic-101640190817910.html
22-12-2021||World||Japan confirms first known local omicron transmissions||Japan on Wednesday confirmed its first known local transmissions of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus in Osaka, a sign it is already making its way in the country.The family of three in Osaka had no record of travelling overseas and their infections could not be traced, Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura said.The three are the first known cases of community transmission of the highly infectious omicron variant in Japan, Yoshimura said. “I believe they only happened to be detected and we must take steps on the assumption that there already are other cases of community transmission,” he said.Yoshimura said current restrictions on eateries in Osaka will remain in place, including a limit of four people per table for a maximum of two hours, to minimize risks during the yearend holiday season, when coronavirus infections surged last year.More than 100 omicron cases have been identified in mainland Japan, but all involved people who tested positive upon entry at airports or those linked to them, government officials have said.Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto, responding to the confirmation of the Osaka cases, said the government will do its utmost to prevent a further spread of the variant.Concerns are also growing on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, where a large virus cluster has developed at a U.S. military base. Several Japanese employees at the base have tested positive for the omicron variant, raising suspicion they might be linked to the cluster on the base.As of Wednesday, 215 Marines recently transferred from the U.S. to Camp Hansen on Okinawa have tested positive for the coronavirus, but it is not known if they are omicron cases, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said.Hayashi said he urged the commander of U.S. Forces Japan, Lt. Gen. Ricky Rupp, to conduct genomic analyses of the samples, step up anti-virus tests and other measures and prohibit troops from leaving the base to prevent the spread of the virus into the community.Hayashi said the U.S. military has agreed to cooperate with Japan in testing cases for the omicron variant and share results with Japanese authorities.Japan eased its border controls in November, but quickly reinstated a ban on most new foreign entrants after omicron was first identified in South Africa.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that he plans to keep the border controls, among the world's most stringent, in place until more details about the omicron variant are known.Kishida said Japan is also tightening quarantine rules for those who come in close contact with omicron patients, requiring 14 days of isolation at designated facilities instead of the previous self-isolation at home.He also announced plans to accelerate booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines, which started with medical workers in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-confirms-first-known-local-omicron-transmissions-101640189637170.html

The tabloid, Global Times, quoted Lam appreciating that Xi acknowledged the work of the HKSAR government over the past year.“She described the year 2021 as very unusual, particularly as it was the year to fully implement the ‘one country, two systems’’ policy. She said she is glad to come to Beijing in person as it’s the last annual duty trip in her 5-year term,” the Global Times report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-hails-hong-kong-vote-in-meeting-with-carrie-lam-101640182203200.html
22-12-2021||World||US secret service says nearly $100 billion stolen from Covid-19 relief funds||Nearly $100 billion at minimum has been stolen from Covid-19 relief programmes set up to help businesses and people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, the US Secret Service said on Tuesday.The estimate is based on Secret Service cases and data from the Labor Department and the Small Business Administration, said Roy Dotson, the agency's national pandemic fraud recovery coordinator, in an interview.The Secret Service didn't include Covid-19 fraud cases prosecuted by the Justice Department.While roughly 3% of the $3.4 trillion dispersed, the amount stolen from pandemic benefits programmes shows “the sheer size of the pot is enticing to the criminals,” Dotson said.Most of that figure comes from unemployment fraud.The Labor Department reported about $87 billion in unemployment benefits could have been paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud.The Secret Service said it has seized more than $1.2 billion while investigating unemployment insurance and loan fraud and has returned more than $2.3 billion of fraudulently obtained funds by working with financial partners and states to reverse transactions.The Secret Service says it has more than 900 active criminal investigations into pandemic fraud, with cases in every state, and 100 people have been arrested so far.The Justice Department said last week that its fraud section had prosecuted over 150 defendants in more than 95 criminal cases and had seized over $75 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Programme funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with the proceeds.One of the best-known programmes created through the March 2020 CARES Act, PPP offered low-interest, forgivable loans to small businesses struggling to meet payroll and other expenses during pandemic-related shutdowns.Law enforcement early in the pandemic focused on fraud related to personal protective equipment, the Secret Service said.Authorities have now prioritised the exploitation of pandemic-related relief because the federal funding through the CARES Act attracted the attention of individuals and organised criminal networks worldwide.“Can we stop fraud? Will we? No, but I think we can definitely prosecute those that need to be prosecuted and we can do our best to recover as much fraudulent pandemic funds that we can," said Dotson, who is the Secret Service's assistant special agent in charge of the agency's field office in Jacksonville, Florida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secret-service-says-nearly-100-billion-stolen-from-covid-19-relief-funds-101640165747407.html

And most Chinese metaverse-related stocks rose on Wednesday following the Xinhua announcement.Augmented reality firm Goertek jumped 6% while online gaming company Perfect World gained nearly 4%. Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings said last month it expects Beijing to allow the metaverse to operate in China, provided it fall into line with Chinese rules.Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are seen as the natural means of payment in the metaverse, but Beijing has clamped down on them as possible conduits for illegal capital flows and money laundering, and ordered a blanket ban of trading and mining of digital currencies in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boost-for-blockchain-in-china-as-xinhua-to-issue-photos-as-nfts-101640162683063.html

With Isreal, now there are three countries that have recorded fatalities from Omicron, the variant which is spreading faster than Delta, but causing apparently milder illness.Here is all you need to know about Omicron deaths in 3 countries.IsraelThe Israeli hospital, where the death was reported, said the patient was a male in his sixties with a number of serious pre-existing conditions. "His morbidity stemmed mainly from pre-existing sicknesses and not from respiratory infection arising from the coronavirus,” the hospital said.United StatesThe first Omicron death in the United States was recorded on Monday. The patient was aged between 50 and 60 years and was believed to be unvaccinated.United KingdomBritain said 12 people who have been infected with the Omicron variant have died in the country. In the UK, the new variant is spreading faster with the number of hospitalisation also increasing. Fresh restrictions ahead of the Christmas and New Year celebrations are also on the cards.The first case of Omicron was reported by South Africa on November 24. Within weeks, the variant spread to the maximum number of countries. Experts said the variant is spreading faster than Delta, which caused the second wave of the pandemic, but is not causing severe illness. Almost all Omicron cases across the world have zero to mild symptoms. The virus is also not affecting the lungs, as scientists believe that the variant is multiplying in the throat making scratchy throat a symptom of the variant. For weeks, there was no death attributed to Omicron. The deaths reported from these three countries -- though details of all cases are not known -- indicate people above the age of 50 with comorbidities are at a greater risk. More so, if they are not vaccinated. Omicron is known to be capable of evading immunity, but experts have said that present vaccines can still guard against the severity of Covid caused by Omicron – to some extent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-omicron-is-milder-than-delta-what-covid-deaths-in-uk-us-israel-indicate-101640156554361.html

We have also seen an increase in our positive cases and quarantines,” Dr Hamilton said in the letter on Monday.Also Read| Amid Omicron crisis in United States, Joe Biden's message to the 'unvaccinated'He pointed out that he has been reluctant to close schools in Mount Vernon but given the current trend in coronavirus infections, "it would be risky not to do so."The superintendent said on Monday that all schools in the district will provide breakfast and lunch during the closure period.Before returning to schools on January 18, all students, teachers and other staff members are expected to be tested for Covid-19. Dr Hamilton also said that free testing kits will be available at schools on January 3 and 4.According to a news report, the closure of schools from Wednesday will affect nearly 7,000 students and 1,400 teachers and staff members.Since September, nearly 340 students living in the Mount Vernon City School District have been infected with Covid-19, the above report added.New York City, which is one of the worst-hit areas from Covid-19 in the US, has in one week seen a 207% increase in the average daily number of infections.According to the Associated Press, as recently as December 13, New York City was averaging fewer than 3,600 new infections daily.

"2022 must be the year we end the pandemic," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing on Tuesday."If we are to end the pandemic in the coming year, we must end inequity, by ensuring 70 per cent of the population of every country is vaccinated by the middle of next year," he added."Last week, WHO issued Emergency Use Listing for a ninth vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India under license from Novavax. This new vaccine is part of the COVAX portfolio, and we hope that it will play an important role in achieving our global vaccination targets," the WHO chief added further.Tedros, however, painted a grim picture saying that a pall of gloom has descended on the world because of Covid-19.He said that that more than 3.3 million people have lost their lives to the pandemic this year - more deaths than from HIV, malaria and tuberculosis combined in 2020, and still continues to claim around 50,000 lives every week."That's not to mention the unreported deaths, and the millions of excess deaths caused by disruptions to essential health services," the WHO chief added.The ferocity with which Covid-19 is spreading once again has been attributed to the Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa on November 24 and has spread to more than 100 countries since then."There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant. And it is more likely that people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 could be infected or reinfected," said Tedros.From reporting its lowest number of cases in 18 months, Africa recorded fourth-largest number of cases in a single week, said the WHO chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-must-end-covid-19-in-2022-says-who-chief-explains-how-101640149665463.html

He maintained that investigators didn't keep any record of their interviews with Lieber prior to his arrest.He argued that prosecutors would be unable to prove that Lieber acted "knowingly, intentionally, or willfully, or that he made any material false statement." Mukasey also stressed Lieber wasn't charged with illegally transferring any technology or proprietary information to China.Prosecutors argued that Lieber, who was arrested in January, knowingly hid his involvement in China's Thousand Talents Plan — a programme designed to recruit people with knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property to China — to protect his career and reputation.Lieber denied his involvement during inquiries from US authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, which had provided him with millions of dollars in research funding, prosecutors said.Lieber also concealed his income from the Chinese program, including USD 50,000 a month from the Wuhan University of Technology, up to USD 158,000 in living expenses and more than USD 1.5 million in grants, according to prosecutors.In exchange, they say, Lieber agreed to publish articles, organize international conferences and apply for patents on behalf of the Chinese university.The case is among the highest profile to come from the US Department of Justice's so-called "China Initiative."The effort launched in 2018 to curb economic espionage from China has faced criticism that it harms academic research and amounts to racial profiling of Chinese researchers.Hundreds of faculty members at Stanford, Yale, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple and other prominent colleges have signed onto letters to US Attorney General Merrick Garland calling on him to end the initiative.The academics say the effort compromises the nation's competitiveness in research and technology and has had a chilling effect on recruiting foreign scholars. The letters also complain the investigations have disproportionally targeted researchers of Chinese origin.Lieber has been on paid administrative leave from Harvard since being arrested in January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-professor-found-guilty-of-hiding-ties-to-china-101640144058232.html

AJ Webber posted the tour of the apartment on popular video-sharing app TikTok.In the 46-second clip, Webber is seen opening the door to give a small tour of his Manhattan pad in the much sought-after West Village neighbourhood. The video went viral overnight.It was among the top 25 of most expensive New York City neighbourhoods in 2020, according to a study from Property Club.The apartment is really tiny – about 75 square feet – which looks like a walk-in closet.“Here is what it’s like living in the smallest apartment in New York,” Webber said. “Whatever your expectations are, lower them,” he added for people who plan to move to the Big Apple.“As soon as you walk in the door, you have the sink,” Webber said in the video. “Right next to the sink is, conveniently located, the kitchen.”In the visuals shown by Webber, the kitchen seems to be consisting only of a microwave and a tiny fridge, without any stove.In his “living quarters”, Webber has two beds – one of them is a bunk bed – with a queen-sized mattress on top on one of them.“I lowered my expectations and still, they were too high,” one user said in the comments section.“My dorm room is bigger than that,” another user added.News agency Bloomberg reported in October that Manhattan apartment sales surged to a record in the third quarter as buyers grabbed what they could while inventory remains high.Closed purchases totaled 4,523, the most for any quarter in data going back to 1989, Bloomberg said quoting a report by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. The median price of all properties that changed hands climbed 1.4% from a year earlier to $1.12 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-gives-tour-of-smallest-apartment-in-nyc-on-tiktok-people-are-horrified-101640139251000.html
22-12-2021||World||'Significant surge' in European cases expected as Omicron spreads, says WHO||The World Health Organization's European head on Tuesday warned countries to brace for a "significant surge" in Covid-19 cases as Omicron spreads, and advised the widespread use of boosters for protection.Since it emerged in late November, Omicron has been detected in at least 38 of the 53 countries in the WHO's European region and is already dominant in several of them including Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom, Hans Kluge told a news conference in Vienna."We can see another storm coming," said Kluge. "Within weeks, Omicron will dominate in more countries of the region, pushing already stretched health systems further to the brink."The WHO's Europe region includes Russia and other former Soviet republics, as well as Turkey.WHO data shows the region has in recent weeks reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases compared to the population size anywhere. Even before Omicron, officials had warned of a further 700,000 deaths from the disease by March.WHO headquarters in Geneva has advised that vaccine boosters be saved for the most vulnerable, but Kluge urged people to "boost, boost, boost.""The booster is the single most important defence against Omicron," he said.A WHO spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request to comment on Kluge's remarks.So far, 89% of the early Omicron cases in Europe were associated with common Covid-19 symptoms such as cough, sore throat and fever, Kluge said. Most cases had been reported among adults in their 20s and 30s, spreading initially in cities at social and workplace gatherings, he added."The sheer volume of new Covid-19 infections could lead to more hospitalizations and widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services," he said."Governments and authorities need to prepare our response systems for a significant surge."The WHO said on Monday that Omicron is spreading faster than the Delta variant, causing infections in people already vaccinated or recovered from the disease. Its chief scientist has called it "unwise" to conclude from early evidence it is a milder variant than previous ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/significant-surge-in-european-cases-expected-as-omicron-spreads-says-who-101640131858684.html

Burgess Owens, the Congressman from Utah's Fourth Congressional District, was speaking at Turning Point USA’s America First in Phoenix.He asked the women to keep their standards high so that real men “strive to achieve your respect”.“When evil steps up to the doorstep, a real man does not get on his knees and beg for mercy with a wife and kids. Just like he knows how to use an iPhone, he knows how to use a gun,” the Republican said in his remarks on Sunday, telling women how to recognise “real men”. “He shows up and takes care of business.”“He’s determined to never, never allow his wife and kids to look at him as a whiner, weenie and wimp,” the Congressman said drawing applause and cheers from the crowd.He also lashed out at the Pfizer and BioNTech’s plan to test coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine on children.“Real men do not stand silent as their kids are being used as guinea pigs. Pfizer and BioNTech is testing a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on children aged six months to under five years,” Owens said. “A father who allows that is a coward who lets little babies get the vaccine.”The remarks were made amid a surge in Covid-19 infection in the United States as the Omicron variant wreaks havoc. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday appealed to all Americans to get vaccinated to fight the Omicron variant sweeping the world days before the second Christmas of the pandemic."If you're not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned," Biden said at the White House, where he unveiled plans to buy 500 million rapid Covid-19 tests to be distributed for free to Americans who request them starting in January.Omicron infections are multiplying across Europe, the United States and Asia, including in Japan, where a single cluster cases at a military base has grown to at least 180.It is now the dominant strain in the US, accounting for 73 per cent of all new cases, up from less than 1 per cent at the beginning of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-on-real-men-they-know-how-to-use-a-gun-just-like-an-iphone-101640132635507.html

As of Tuesday, the authorities have confirmed 90,629 new cases and 172 fatalities.In this regard, the government announced earlier in the day an allocation of $1.3 billion to assist businesses hit by a new wave of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-says-no-new-restrictions-before-christmas-despite-omicron-surge-in-uk-101640126695178.html

He said his health advisers had suggested he reconsider the ban.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday that omicron now accounts for more than 70% of new US cases of Covid-19.The US government imposed restrictions on people traveling from South Africa and seven other nearby nations on Nov. 29 after the discovery of the new variant. The CDC the next day notified airlines they must provide the names of passengers who had traveled in southern Africa in recent days so that local health agencies could conduct contact tracing. However successful the travel restrictions may have been in stopping people infected with the omicron variant from entering the US, it hasn’t prevented the Covid-19 mutation from rapidly becoming the dominant strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-he-s-considering-lifting-us-omicron-travel-ban-101640120491548.html

Almost 6,000 employees work at Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s headquarters in Hawthorne, near Los Angeles International Airport, according to the Los Angeles Times.The cases come during a busy stretch for the company, which has completed four Falcon 9 launches since Dec. 9, including a cargo supply mission to the International Space Station early Tuesday.The US is grappling with a renewed surge amid the spread of the omicron variant. Daily coronavirus infections nationwide jumped to the highest level since September, with almost 254,000 cases reported Monday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.Musk ChallengeIn March 2020, SpaceX founder Elon Musk challenged officials in California’s Alameda County, the site of a Tesla Inc. factory, over pandemic restrictions that closed the auto plant in Fremont. Musk also sued the county before later dropping that lawsuit.L.A. county’s public health office requires that all employees wear a face mask while working indoors, regardless of vaccination status, except when eating, drinking or alone in a room. For the most part, private employers like SpaceX aren’t included in the county’s strict policy on showing proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test to enter some public venues such as restaurants, bars and gyms.SpaceX’s workplace testing in Hawthorne prompted the company to report the cases to the county, according to the memo. L.A. county health officials didn’t immediately comment on the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-headquarters-hit-by-covid-19-outbreak-with-132-infected-101640116186073.html
22-12-2021||World||Germany clamps down on New Year's parties to tame Omicron||Germany announced new restrictions Tuesday that will begin after Christmas to slow the spread of the new omicron variant, rules that will fall short of a full lockdown but will include contact restrictions even for vaccinated people.“I can understand anyone who doesn’t want to hear about the coronavirus, mutations and new virus variants,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a press conference Tuesday evening. “But we cannot and must not turn a blind eye to this next wave.”Among the new rules are limiting private gatherings to 10 people, closing nightclubs nationwide and having large events like soccer matches held without an in-person audience. The restrictions will go into effect nationwide on Dec. 28, although states can implement the measures sooner.Scholz said the government decided to wait until after Christmas to implement new national restrictions because family-focused holidays such as Christmas and Easter “have not proven to be major drivers of the pandemic." But he said restrictions on New Year's celebrations are necessary to keep Germany's health system from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.“This is no longer the time for parties and social evenings in big groups,” Scholz said.Scholz and Germany's 16 state governors agreed on the new restrictions at a meeting Tuesday, after the government's new panel of experts called for action to be taken within days nationwide because the omicron variant is racing across Europe.Scholz and the state governors will meet again on Jan. 7 to discuss whether the measures should be continued or even tightened.Hours before the meeting, the national disease control center called on Twitter for “maximum contact restrictions” starting immediately and lasting until mid-January, and for Germans to reduce their holiday travel “to the absolutely necessary.”One state, Hamburg, already moved Tuesday to impose restrictions starting on Christmas Eve. There will be a 10-person limit on private meetings and dance events will be banned, effectively closing nightclubs. Restaurants and bars in the state will have to close at 11 p.m. — except on New Year's Eve, when they can stay open until 1 a.m.Restrictions already in place in Germany target mainly the unvaccinated, with proof of vaccination or recovery required to enter nonessential stores. Also, the sale of New Year fireworks has been banned nationwide.Scholz said the German government is also trying to speed up its booster vaccine campaign, aiming to give out an additional 30 million shots by the end of January by keeping some vaccination centers open over the holidays.“Vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate remains our goal,” Scholz said. “The coronavirus doesn’t take a Christmas break.”But authorities remain dissatisfied that only 70.4% of Germany's population has been fully vaccinated and 32.6% have received boosters.Germany's infection rate is, for now, drifting downward slowly. On Tuesday, the disease control center recorded 306.4 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, down from 375 a week earlier, with 23,428 new daily cases.However, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has warned that Germany faces “a massive fifth wave” of infections because of omicron, which he says can't realistically be prevented.The disease control center said Monday that people who have recovered or have been fully vaccinated now face a “high” risk of infection, while it is “moderate” for those who have received a booster. It said the risk of getting COVID-19 is “very high” for the unvaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-clamps-down-on-new-year-s-parties-to-tame-omicron-101640115574130.html
