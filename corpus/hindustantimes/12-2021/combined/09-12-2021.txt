09-12-2021||Delhi||NEET PG protest: Resident doctors suspend strike for a week||Resident doctors from hospitals associated with medical colleges have decided to suspend by a week the nationwide strike to protest delays in the NEET postgraduate counselling process, after the Union health ministry issued a plea for the court hearing in the matter to be fast-tracked. The NEET PG counselling process was delayed repeatedly due to a bunch of cases in the Supreme Court over economic reservations. “A plea was issued by the MoHFW [Union ministry of health and family welfare] to fast-track the court hearing and we were assured by the health minister that the office of the Prime Minister is also looking after the issue and the process will be completed within a week. Considering the above and looking at the security situation of the nation owing to the untimely demise of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and other Army personnel in a tragic accident yesterday [on Wednesday], FORDA has decided to [put on] hold the agitation for a period of one week,” said a release from the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA), one of the two national associations co-ordinating the nationwide protest. The other association, the Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), in a statement said it had called off the strike and will continue a “symbolic protest”. “With the government showing positive response from their side to fast track the process, FAIMA and many of our associated state RDAs are currently not in favour of continuing our agitation at the cost of patients’ lives. We have decided to call off the nationwide strike and withdrawal of services, and continue our symbolic protest by wearing black badges and demonstrations.” The Union director general of health services Dr Sunil Kumar in a doctors’ WhatsApp group said he appreciated the decision. The move comes on the 13th day of the doctors’ strike, which started with them withdrawing from out-patient clinics, followed by other routine services such as treatment of patients admitted to the hospital and planned surgeries. Doctors from many of Delhi’s major hospitals, such as Safdarjung and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia withdrew from emergency work on Monday, with patients being turned away or referred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) or Lok Nayak hospital. Doctors from Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals, two of the biggest Delhi government hospitals that were running their emergency departments, also withdrew from emergency work on Thursday morning. The doctors have been protesting delays in NEET PG counseling that has resulted in a one-third decrease in the number of resident doctors in the hospitals, resulting in the others being overworked. It has also resulted in over 42,000 medical students being left in a lurch over their education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/neet-pg-protest-resident-doctors-suspend-strike-for-a-week-101639074520086.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Blast at Rohini court in Delhi, months after gun battle, throws up questions||Lawyers at the Rohini court on Thursday said the explosion inside a courtroom has been a major lapse on part of the security agencies, and added that despite the murder of gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi inside a courtroom on September 24, the situation has remained unchanged. Manjeet Mathur, honorary secretary, Rohini Court Bar Association (RCBA), said the changes in security apparatus after gangster Gogi’s murder have proven to be just “optics”. “There has been no change except for the deployment of some extra security personnel. No new X-ray machines or CCTVs have been installed even after the shoot-out in September. This is a complete security lapse on the part of the police. Our suggestions to the authorities have not been considered, and the higher administration is not acting on them.” He said that there is only a single gate where the X-ray machine has been installed, and the administration has asked the lawyers to use that gate only.After the shocking September shoot-out, the Delhi Police handed the court’s security to the security unit, and assured better safety within the premises. The security unit is a specialised department whose officers are trained in managing security at vital installations or protecting senior dignitaries. The officers of this unit are not engaged in solving crimes or maintaining law and order.Until three months ago, the courts security was managed by personnel from the local police.Rakesh Chahar, former secretary general, RCBA, said lawyers have being accused of not cooperating with police during frisking in the past, but this blasts is a clear lapse on part of the police.“The checking at the gate is not up to the mark, and after 11.30am security personnel are lethargic. Lawyers are co-operating wholeheartedly, but despite this, such incidents are happening. If this happens every quarter, this is worrying,” Chahar said.Delhi Police did not give specific details of the explosives used, but officials aware of the investigation said they have found shrapnels, iron nails, and a white powder, all suggesting that it was a “crude bomb”. On October 13, the then chief of the police’s security unit, ID Shukla, issued an order assigning duties to senior officers with new roles for each court. For example, an inspector rank officer was made the security in-charge and his senior – an assistant commissioner of police rank officer, was appointed the supervisory officer. At each court, the two officers were appointed to monitor the security. They were responsible for ensuring that no outsiders with arms or explosives entered the court premises. “There are 70-95 officers from security unit now. Earlier there would be 20-25 police personnel from local police,” a police officer, who asked not to be named, said.HT contacted Delhi police commissioner Rakesh Asthana and Manish Agarwal, special commissioner of the security unit, for their response on the alleged security lapse, but they did not respond despite calls and text messages.After gangster’s Gogi’s murder during a court hearing on September 23, the Delhi High Court’s chief justice DN Patel had taken suo motu cognizance of the matter, and initiated a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on court’s security. The high court called for suggestions from all the bar associations and the Delhi Police. On November 8, the court suggested a slew of measures for improving security. Police during the proceeding had informed the court that a specialised unit of the city police had taken over the security. The court had also suggested creation of special courtrooms to hold proceedings related to the high risk under trial prisoners instead of their physical production in the courts. Advocate Prince Gupta, who was in the adjoining court when the explosion happened on Monday, said, “There is fear among the lawyers. This blast has taken place just a couple of months after that top gangster was shot in the courtroom. There is no safety of the litigants, lawyers and judicial officers. The bullet or the bomb in both the incidents could have hit anyone.”

Kumar was speaking at a rally organised at Congress Bhavan in the city on Thursday. Kumar said, “The opposition and the media are asking for an alternative to be provided for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In democracy there is no dearth of alternatives for leaders. Before Modi, there were leaders and even after him there will be good leaders. This is the power of democracy.” Kanhaiya Kumar said, “Intentionally, government companies are weakened by the BJP government. To keep the balance in the market, there is a need to have the presence of government companies. If the BSNL remains in the market, private companies like Jio will not charge more. If there is Air India, private companies will not charge more.” Kumar added, “Earlier, all governments were an alliance, like UPA 1 or UPA2, but this government intentionally announces itself as a Modi government. If an individual becomes more important than the party or country, it is harmful for democracy.” Instead of giving answers to various promises given by them, BJP use to blame former Prime Kanhaiya Kumar said, ‘This government and media are intentionally diverting citizens’ attention from basic issue to non-issues. Media speaks on issues which are not important to citizens.” Congress leader and revenue minister Babasaheb Thorat, also speaking at the rally, said, “BJP used social media effectively and created a propaganda of wrong things. By using fake messages, they diverted voters from real issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/there-is-no-dearth-of-alternatives-for-leaders-kanhaiya-kumar-101639074342323.html

The scheme offers plots having a size of 450 sqr mtrs, 1000 sqr mtrs and 3000 sqr mtrs in sectors 32 and 33, close to the airport project site along the Yamuna Expressway. The Yeida wants to encourage small-scale industries and ‘start up’ businesses to set up their units in the plots, said officials.“This is the golden opportunity for those who want to invest in plots of size less than 4,000 square metres. We have come up with the scheme as the demand for plots has increased after work on the airport expedited,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yeida. Initially, the Yeida will offer 68 plots to interested buyers and later put up more plots for sale if there is enough demand in the market, said officials.Applicants can apply for the scheme till January 5 on the portal of the authority. Once all the applicants apply, the Yeida will examine the documents of each applicant and subsequently call the eligible parties for an interview to decide the allotment of the plots. The Yeida is developing roads, parks, drainage and other basic civic amenities in sectors 32 and 33. “We have acquired the land for this scheme and will complete the development of basic facilities at the earliest,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yamuna-authority-offers-plots-near-noida-airport-for-industrial-purposes-101639074159797.html

09-12-2021||Noida||Four held in Noida for impersonating SSC candidates during their written exams||Police on Thursday arrested four men from Noida’s Sector 62 for allegedly impersonating candidates of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC GD constable) during their written examinations. The SSC exams are conducted to recruit staff to various posts in ministries, departments and organisations of the Government of India.The suspects have been identified as Vikas Kumar (24), Sanjay Kumar (28), and Raghvendra Kumar (23)--all residents of Firozabad, and Anish Chahar (26), a resident of Fatehpur Sikri in Agra. Police said Vikas runs a coaching centre in his home town while Raghvendra is an SSC candidate. “Vikas impersonated Raghvendra in the written exam at the examination centre in Noida’s Sector 62 on Wednesday. Vikas was planning to impersonate another candidate on Thursday when he got arrested. The two other suspects were involved in finding candidates appearing for the SSC written exam,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Noida. Police said the suspects used to strike a deal with candidates appearing for the SSC exam in exchange of ₹5-7 lakh per candidate. “The suspects had a unique modus operandi— they would start the whole process at the time of filling the application forms itself. To impersonate Raghvendra, Vikas first made a fake Aadhaar card using Raghvendra’s name and his photograph and also filled a separate exam form with a fake identify to get easy access to the exam centre. That way, two admit cards were issued on Raghvendra’s name with different roll numbers. At the exam centre, Vikas sat in Raghvendra’s seat and gave the written examination while the other seat remained vacant,” said the ACP. Police said Rinku Yadav, a cyber cafe owner, helped the suspects forge the necessary documents and also file the duly filled application forms. He is on the run since the arrest of the four suspects. On Thursday, police received information that the suspects would be meeting near Gupta T-Point in Noida’s Sector 62. “A police team reached the spot and arrested the four suspects. We recovered five mobile phones, five PAN cards, five Aadhaar cards, one debit card, two admit cards and ₹52,150 cash. On checking their phones, we found at least 46 WhatsApp chats, indicating their involvement in the racket,” said the ACP adding that the suspects have been running this racket for the past five years. “They claimed to have impersonated at least 10 candidates so far. Noida police will write to the authority conducting the exam to probe the matter,” said Verma. A case has been registered against the suspects under sections 416 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and also under sections 6,9 and 10 of the UP Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998. “The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said Vinod Kumar, station house officer of Sector 58.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-held-in-noida-for-impersonating-ssc-candidates-during-their-written-exams-101639073738809.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Construction ban adds to delay in key infra projects||Several key infrastructure projects aimed at decongesting arterial stretches, some of them on the verge of completion, are stuck as a ban on construction activities in Delhi is on since November 14.Agencies executing these projects and site managers have said that the prolonged halt on work will ensure that it will take them at least 20-25 days to achieve the same speed of work as it was when the work stopped. The managers said the sourcing of construction material has also become difficult due to the ban on the operations of stone crushers and hot-mix plants which was enforced by the Central Pollution Control Board on November 8, 2021.At least three of these projects -- Ashram underpass, Pragati Maidan underground tunnel and the underpass connecting San Martin Marg-Benito Juarez Marg -- have missed deadlines set earlier due to various reasons, and are yet again looking at delays.Experts, however, have been arguing that instead of imposing restrictions on an impulse, the authorities should combine a forecast-based system with the measures mentioned in the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). When the air quality is expected to deteriorate, these measures such as shutting of schools and ban on construction should be imposed immediately. But, when an improvement is expected, these measures should be reviewed immediately.The Supreme Court in its order on 24th November decided to reinforce the prohibition till further orders. The ban remains in force. It also directed the state governments of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to utilise the corpus of labour cess for paying wages to construction workers during suspension of activities. The local task force of CAQM is holding daily review meeting however the CAQM is yet to hold a review meeting on the construction ban.A 2018 study conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), a Delhi-based research institute, showed that vehicle emissions account for 24%-28% of the city’s pollution. Dust, on the other hand, contributed only 18%-38% to the city’s overall pollution.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment says Grap was designed so that restrictions could be imposed and lifted dynamically, based on the air quality. However, that is not seemingly being done. “Under Grap, construction work is banned when the air quality touches severe plus levels, but even when air has come down to the poor category, these activities stay banned. We need to implement Grap in the correct manner,” she said.Delhi has not seen a severe-plus day this year. However, Delhi recorded 11 severe (AQI between 401-500) air days in November this year.Dr. S Velmurugan Chief Scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) said maintaining a timeline may not be possible in several infrastructure projects if the ban on construction is extended. He suggested that the agencies should apply to the courts to permit construction work during the night time when the vehicular load is low on the roads. “The authorities should consider providing some relaxation to the projects which are in advanced stage by mandating stringent dust pollution control norms like regular sprinking of water at the site, prohibition on idling construction vehicles etc. Lakhs of vehicles are passing through the congested intersections are also contributing to additional air pollution,” he added.HT looks at the three key projects:Ashram UnderpassWork began: December 2019Work finished: 96%Deadlines missed: 5Latest deadline: End of this monthWhy it is important? The 750-metre underpass connects Nizamuddin railway bridge and CSIR Apartments at the Ashram intersection, the busiest road stretch in the capital with over 300,000 vehicles using it daily. It also connects south and central Delhi, and virtually serves as the link for two NCR cities Noida and Faridabad.What officials say? A senior PWD official overseeing the project said that 96% work has been finished and as soon as the construction ban is lifted, the remaining work of laying the approach roads is likely to take another 30 days. “The 220KV power line which was the last remaining hurdle in clearing ROW for underpass, has been relocated by Delhi Transco Ltd and the realignment of wall has also been completed.. We were about to fill the base structure with concrete a week after Diwali when work was banned,” the official said.Pragati Maidan tunnel road projectWork began: October 2018Work finished: 95%Deadlines missed: SixLatest deadline: December-endWhy it is important? The 6-lane, 1.2-km tunnel from Road to Ring Road running below Pragati Maidan is expected to take the pressure off the ITO and Bhairon Marg.Along with underpasses to provide access, the tunnel will also make Mathura Road signal-free. Commuters from south Delhi to east Delhi, and those going from ITO to south Delhi will be the main beneficiaries.What officials say? “The supply of bitumen and raw material has been affected due to ban on operations of hot-mix plants and stone crushers. We estimate that the remaining work can be completed in two months once the ban is lifted,” a senior PWD official overseeing the project said. He added that the work on strengthening the tunnel base below the railway line is being carried out simultaneously, and it is expected to take around two weeks.Rao Tula Ram Marg underpassWork began: November 2015Work finished: 93%Deadlines missed: SixLatest deadline: NoneWhy it is important: It was part of the much-delayed Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover. The an underpass from Benito Juarez Marg to San Martin Marg passing under the Ring Road was conceived in 2013. It is aimed at providing smooth movement of traffic coming from IGI airport, and take the load off the Outer Ring Road.What officials say? “We were facing issues in shifting utilities passing through the 11m portion ring road portion abutting Satya Niketan. But now the work has been suspended due to the construction ban. It may still take around two months to complete the remaining after even after the ban is lifted,” a PWD official said.When HT visited the construction site on Wednesday, half of the carriageway on the Ring Road meant for the movement of traffic movement towards Dhaula Kuan was lying dug up while the barricading has led to a traffic-bottleneck right below the Durgabai Deshmukh metro station near South Campus of Delhi University. The traffic snarls extended from Satya Niketan up to Moti Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-construction-ban-adds-to-delay-in-key-infra-projects-101639073678914.html
09-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi reviews preparations for Saryu canal project inauguration by PM Modi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday visited Balrampur, Bahraich and Shravasti districts of Uttar Pradesh to review preparations for the inauguration of the Saryu Canal National Project by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 11. The Saryu Canal National Project will irrigate about 15 lakh hectare land in 6,227 villages, the chief minister said in a series of tweets before visiting the three districts.The government has spent ₹ 10,000 crore on the canal project. Dedicated to agriculture and uplift of the farmers, the project will set new standards of development, Yogi Adityanath said.The Saryu Canal National Project was pending for more than four decades. The Prime Minister will dedicate the much-awaited project to the nation on December 11 and it will benefit about 30 lakh farmers of nine districts, paving the way for all- round development of the state, Yogi Adityanath said.The chief minister inspected the programme site at Balrampur on Thursday. He held a review meeting with officials and people’s representatives and gave instructions about the arrangements for the PM’s programme. Later, at a press conference in Bahraich, the chief minister said the Saryu Canal National Project starts from the Saryu Barrage and will benefit the farmers of Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabirnagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj districts. The Saryu canal project was planned in 1972 and work on it started in 1978. Initially, the project was limited to three districts of the Devipatan division but was expanded to nine districts in 1982, he said.Only 52% of the work on this entire project could be completed in about 40 years from 1978 to 2017, he said. After the BJP government came to power in UP, the remaining 48% of the project was completed between 2017 and 2021, Yogi Adityanath added.The 6623-km canal system has been made in the nine districts by connecting the Ghaghra with the Saryu, Rapti, Banganga and the Rohini rivers.This project is the best example of the river linking campaign, Yogi Adityanath said.From 2015 onwards, the central government made funds available to the state government through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to develop better irrigation facilities, the chief minister said. The BJP government in UP took full advantage of the scheme to develop a network of canals, he said. The Saryu Canal National Project has now been completed with the help of the Central government. The income of the farmers of this area will increase manifold, he said.After assuming office in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged to double farmers’ income by the year 2022 and this project is very important from the point of view of fulfilling that resolution, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-reviews-preparations-for-saryu-canal-project-inauguration-by-pm-modi-101639073501787.html

For the last many years concretisation of this road has not been done and often, there are accidents. “The entire road stretch has been dug up, hundreds of potholes and mud is lying all over and citizens risk their lives while traveling on this stretch. Daily there are small mishaps like bikes slipping and now the citizens are demanding immediate repair of this road,” said Shankar Beldare, president of the Siddhivinayak Cultural and Educational Association in Katraj. At least 50 citizens and members of various citizens groups gathered at the Dattangar chowk at around 10 am and protested against the bad condition of the road. A few months ago in one of the serious accidents on this road, a two-wheeler rider lost his leg after an accident with a heavy vehicle. “We protested at the Dattanagar chowk and have given a memorandum to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) road department in this regard. If there is no action taken soon, then the protest will be made more aggressive in coming days,” added Beldare. In last 10 years this entire Jambhulwadi road stretch of 5kms has developed into a residential area. At least 50 small and big residential housing societies have come up on this road, and 20,000 residents live here. It is one of the major roads in the Katraj area, which connects various localities like Bharati Vidyapeeth, Ambegaon Budruk and Jambhulwadi. Another resident Kishore Swami said, “For my office work I daily travel on bike and feel afraid to go by this road. Due to the rains in last week the roads have become slippery with lot of potholes.The road needs an urgent repairing work as daily thousands of people including women, children and elderly people travel through it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/katraj-residents-protest-poor-state-of-jambhulwadi-road-101639073078695.html
09-12-2021||Pune||Obesity in Maharashtra: 24% above age of 15 obese, claims study||PUNE Obesity is as a major healthcare challenge in the country today, because of the epidemiological shift to an overweight population. A study done by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Public Health Foundation of India, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, suggests approximately 650 million people are affected by obesity globally, of which 20% live in India. Obesity in Maharashtra, according to the study, is quite high with 24% of people above the age of 15 being cited as obese, as per a survey entitled ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States’. According to city-based doctors, being a healthcare challenge in itself, obesity is also a major risk factor for many diseases, including diabetes and heart ailments. India is home to approximately 135 million obese people who are at risk of developing multiple healthcare issues. “Of the overall type 2 diabetic patients, 52% of the patients are obese. At the same time, among the female population, 23.4% of the female population is overweight,” according to data shared in the study.Dr Jayashree Todkar, Consulting General Laparoscopic, Bariatric & Metabolic Surgeon, said, “Approximately 650 million people are affected by obesity globally, of which approximately 20% of obese people live in India. The obesity burden in Maharashtra is quite high and around 24% of people above the age of 15 years are obese. Being a major risk factor for other healthcare issues, the actual burden of obesity is manifold than what the data suggests.”Explaining the diseases associated with obesity, Dr Todkar added, “Every 10kg increase in weight from the normal weight band results in 3.0 mmHg Higher Systolic & 2.3mmHg Higher Diastolic BP, which contribute to 12% Increase in CHD risk and 24% increase in stroke risk. Additionally, 30% of diabetic people are overweight.”Obesity needs immediate attention to control the burden of non-communicable diseases in India. “It is estimated that by 2025,obesity-related diseases will cost more than $13 billion in treatment. To control the burden of other non-communicable diseases, it is important that obesity management gets its due attention,” added Dr Todkar. Obesity is divided into two grades - Grade 1 obesity in which a person’s body mass index is between 26 and 32; and Grade 2 obesity in which a person’s body mass index is above 32. As per guidelines, people with grade 1 obesity are not eligible for bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is only considered for people with grade 2 obesity who fit the qualifying criteria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/obesity-in-maharashtra-24-above-age-of-15-obese-claims-study-101639072718309.html
09-12-2021||Pune||MSRTC bus services resume in Pune after one month||PUNE The Pune division of the Maharashtra State Transport Corporation (MSRTC), on Thursday, claimed bus operations are back to normal, one month after MSRTC workers, including drivers and conductors went on strike. At least 1,200 staffers have re-joined work and on Thursday, 135 ST operations took place, this is apart from private, contractor-operated buses still operating on various routes because of the strike. December 9 was the 30th day of the strike. Till now, at least 500 workers from the Pune division who were on strike have been suspended by the department. ST buses are running on various routes from the Baramati, Bhor, Indapur and rural areas ST stands in the Pune division. The ST bus operations from Pune’s Swargate and Shivajinagar ST stands had not yet started, with private tourist buses and contractor-operated Shivshahi and Shivneri buses running from here. “Most of the ST bus operations from Pune division have been regularised today as around 1,200 workers joined back, of 300 are drivers and conductors. So it has become easy for us to run the bus operations from our stands. A total of 225 bus operations was held of which 135 were our normal ST buses going into remote villages around the district. Rest were the Shivshahi and Shivneri buses operated by the private contractors,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Ramakant Gaikwad. For the last one month, MSRTC workers and a Kruti Samiti of unions wanted for the bus division to become a state government department, so workers (apart from union members) spontaneously started a strike at all the 13 depots in Pune division.

Mohol filed an application through his lawyer after which the court stayed the order. Mohol said, “There are two toilets in this neighbourhood. Proper procedure was followed to remove one of them for road work. There is a resolution of the Women and Child Welfare Committee. As the house of Javed Shaikh also came under the road work, he had been instigating people. A case of obstructing public servant from discharging official duty is already registered against him.” “The demolition of toilets is an administrative task; I have nothing to do with it. After bringing facts to the notice of the court, the FIR order has been stayed.” Based on a complaint from Devidas Bhanudas Oval of Sheelavihar Colony, Paud phata, Judicial Magistrate (First Class) Janhavi S Kelkar, on December 7, directed the Kothrud police station to register the case and investigate as per provision 156 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Besides Mohol, the order also names contractors Vasant Chavan, Rahul Shivaji Shinde and an unidentified person. The complainant had also demanded registration of a case for offenses under relevant sections of the Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act. It is alleged that mayor Mohol, a corporator of the area, along with three others conspired to remove the doors of the toilets on October 20 with the help of some persons, making it impossible for women to use the bathrooms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-court-stays-fir-against-mayor-murlidhar-mohol-101639071879030.html

09-12-2021||Pune||Consuming alcohol in public irks Aundh residents||PUNE Residents of Visava Park and other adjoining residential societies have given up on the municipal corporation as well as the police, over acting on complaints of alcohol being consumed in public in the area. The allegations concern one liquor store right next to a diagnostic centre, which allegedly has customers consuming the liquor in front of the shop. The sit-outs and the trees of Smart City are now the new ‘addas’ for the alcohol sessions. Residents living in Visava Park have video clippings and photos that have been forwarded to the police. “I had formally filed a complaint two years ago. The police had warned the liquor shop owner. Ever since these sit outs were made for senior citizens, these have been mostly been occupied by drinkers,” said Charu Shrotri, a resident. The Aundh Vikas Mandal (AVM) too has raised concerns. “Vaishali Patkar, AVM member said drinking in open areas creates annoyance and nuisance and is punishable by law. Permitting drunkenness or allowing the gathering of unsocial elements must be punishable under law, which we have mentioned in our letter earlier, but it does not seem to work.” “Drunks are found loitering around our society gate,” said a resident speaking anonymously, but pointed to a newly placed board on a tree seeking a guard and help to clean up the mess of leftover bottles. Residents state that the police and civic authorities are aware of the issue, but have done little to curb the practice. Interestingly, the drinking sojourns take place right opposite a corporator’s office. Archana Madhukar Musale, local corporator, said, “We had requested the police to do rounds, which they did initially, but soon lost interest. We have even put up a board. We have informed the shop keeper and he also put up a board. We will be informing the police and giving them a letter again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/consuming-alcohol-in-public-irks-aundh-residents-101639070918012.html

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drivers in US who took us for a ride, with a rider||My wife Koumdi and I were leisurely walking on the 16th Street in Denver. We saw an electronic poster that gave details about the “Unsinkable”. We got curious. We found that it was the house of Molly Brown, who had survived the sinking of The Titanic. We found out the directions and boarded a bus for Lincoln Way. On boarding, I tried feeding three dollar bills for our tickets when the driver watching me nearly frowned, “$30!” I looked at him in bewilderment and as if questioning that it was too huge a fare than we had known. I looked at Koumdi to gesture that we had taken a wrong bus and shifted my gaze again at the driver ,who was firm and sterner this time repeating, “30 dollars, 30!” I began looking for the credit card since I didn’t carry that much cash when the driver smiled and said, “Hota hai, hota hai Bhai Jaan, hota hai (It happens).” Fair complexioned, he had short hair on the nape and golden brown of about an inch near his forehead. By no standard did it seem that he knew Hindi. He was a Muslim and came from Mumbai. Jocularly, he said he was sorry to have put us in a quandary. He issued us a ticket with free return till 5pm. “You must stay at a nearby market for a few hours to see Indian eateries and a yoga centre,” he said. Later, in the typical Indian fashion we kept chatting loudly with him from our respective seats, much to the amazement of the co-passengers. Just a year before the onset of Covid-19, we were in Redmond, the headquarters of Microsoft. Our son Sawan dropped us in a market near Bear Creek where we could shop leisurely till he would collect us in the evening. When Sawan left, I noticed a bus of Route no. 245 to Seattle. Suddenly, an idea flashed my mind. We could go to downtown Seattle and come back by the evening. Koumdi agreed. Waiting for the next bus, we met a youngster from Bangladesh. He began talking about his parents who were then visiting him. He said that there was a big concession for seniors in buses and all one had to do was to tell the driver that he or she was one. “But on our senior citizen card, our age is 60, while in the US it should be 65.” I told the young man about our predicament and pat came the reply, “Oh, come on, they don’t check!” Well, we embarked on Route no. 245 and told the driver that we were seniors. He smiled and let us head forward to our seats. I wasn’t too pleased, since I thought how could the driver, going by our looks, have thought us to be that aged. Having spent some time on the West Lake Plaza, we boarded a bus to return. We repeated the trick. This time, the driver was a woman who said she wanted to see our cards. Having a look at them from a distance, she too signalled us to move to our seats. All through the return journey, I kept appreciating the woman driver for having thought of us not being that old, and for insisting on authentication. rajbirdeswal@hotmail.com The author is a Panchkula-based retired IPS officer, advocate and commentator||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drivers-in-us-who-took-us-for-a-ride-with-a-rider-101639070498993.html

This new facility will be provided in collaboration with HDFC Bank for which they have signed an MoU with MPMMCC. Under this, an amount of ₹1.5 crore will be provided by HDFC Bank to the hospital, which will be used to start other facilities, including therapeutic drug monitoring tests, in the hospital.The importance of the test is to monitor the medicines dose given to cancer patients and understanding its side effects. So far the samples had to be sent to Mumbai for test.Dr Pratibha Gavel, in charge of the biochemistry department of MPMMCC and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH), said “Monitoring the dose of medicines given to patients in any disease is very important. When the patient is battling cancer, its role increases even more. If the amount of medicine given to the patient is less during the treatment, then it reduces the effect of the medicine. Also if the amount of the medicine is exceeded, it can have side effects on the patient’s body, so it is very important to know the right amount of medicine to be given to a patient.”Dr Satyajit Pradhan, director, MPMMCC and HBCH thanked HDFC and said along with providing timely treatment to cancer patients, proper treatment is also very important. Neighbouring cancer states will also benefit from the launch of this facility. Also, from the point of view of research, this investigation will be very important for the hospital.Senior HDFC officials Manish Tandon, Akhilesh Shukla, Mr Vaibhav Tripathi, Abhishek Singh and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.

This, at a time when erratic weather is leading to multiple complaints about cough and cold.Abrarali Dalal , CEO Sahyadri Hospitals said “We have not seen any significant rise in the number of people coming for RT-PCR tests in recent times.”The government resolution (GR) issued on Monday stated, ₹350 would be charged for samples given at collection centres instead of ₹500. For the same test at Covid care or quarantine centres, the charge would be ₹500 instead of ₹600 and labs would charge ₹700 instead of ₹800 to collect swabs from home.

There is little stress on people as their concern is getting a report in 24 hours. Our labs provide service even over weekends so we are not facing much issue in delivering reports,” added Dr Awanti Golwilkar-Mehendale.Dr Avdhut Bodamwad, medical superintendent at Ruby Hall Clinic said “There has been no increase in the number of people coming for the RT-PCR test.

09-12-2021||Mumbai||Germany offers to support restoration work in Maharashtra||MUMBAI In a bid to strengthen diplomatic relations between the two countries, Germany has offered to support Maharashtra in the restoration of temples and heritage structures in the state. German ambassador Walter J Lindner said that the German consulate in Mumbai will draw up a list of structures that they can help restore in Maharashtra. These structures could include temples, libraries, synagogues and forts.Lindner said that the plan to offer support in the restoration work is in its “early stages”. “We had a heritage tour today (in Mumbai) and asked our experts for a list of structures that we could support. We extend cultural heritage support in other parts of the country. Like, we restored the Mughal tombs in Hyderabad. We might do it here as well. It can be too big, as the government needs to be convinced. We are willing to offer support,” Lindner said.“We are drawing up a list of possible options that we could help restore - whether it is a museum or synagogue or garden or library or fort. We need to see which one fits our budget but we are willing to do it. There are many things to be done here,” Lindner said.Lindner is on a two-day Mumbai visit and said that Mumbai will continue to remain the economic backbone of India in the post-pandemic world. “Mumbai is an economic powerhouse. I think it is modernising itself; it has its share of challenges. In the post-pandemic world, it will continue to be the backbone of India. The location of Mumbai, its harbour, multicultural environment, a mix of mentalities, all these things are what makes it unique,” the ambassador said in an interaction with media persons in Mumbai.During his visit, he met the dabbawallas and said that he was very impressed with their modus operandi and their zero failure record. He also visited the Gateway of India and took a ride on an electric Victoria.Lindner is slated to meet Bollywood producers and directors to collaborate on film shootings, and pitch Germany as a destination for Hindi and other language films in the country. “We can provide 10 absolutely breathtaking locations in Germany for shooting. I will meet the film producers tomorrow and discuss collaboration. I recommend that filmmakers and producers should consider Germany too for filming. We can give details on what the government can do to make life easier for them. Mostly, the idea is to create more interest in German locations,” he said.As the new chancellor Olaf Scholz was sworn in on Wednesday, the ambassador said that the new government in Germany will continue to have cordial relations with India even after the end of former chancellor Angela Merkel’s era.

As per the agitating pharmacists, the work boycott will continue till December 17. Hospital outpatient department (OPD) services start functioning from 8am hence work such as getting an OPD ticket to see a doctor, giving samples for tests or other diagnostic facilities were hampered.“The work boycott will begin from 8am in urban areas and 10am in rural areas,” said Sunil Yadav, executive president of the Diploma Pharmacist Association, Uttar Pradesh, that has over 7500 member pharmacists. Long queue of patients could be seen at OPD counters of hospitals as pharmacists staged protests. At the Civil Hospital, pharmacists held ae meeting led by Sunil Yadav, who is also president of Pharmacists Federation, UP Chapter.They are posted at district level hospitals, medical colleges, community health centres and primary health centres and are engaged in drug distribution and at many places work in injection rooms to administer injectable drugs and vaccines.“The pharmacists deployed at emergency wards did not join the work boycott. But if our demands are not addressed, we will go on complete work boycott from December 17 and boycott emergency work also from December 20,” said Yadav.“Besides wage revision, the pharmacists are also demanding right to prescribe drugs, creation of new posts and standardisation of their work. Posts of pharmacists are fewer than required in violation of the guidelines and at some places there are no pharmacists at all,” he added.“Drug distribution is a significant work as an incorrect dose taken by patients can actually do more harm than benefit,” said Yadav. For the past one week, the pharmacists in the state have been working with black badges during their duty hours at the health facilities.“We had held protests at office of chief medical officer in all districts and handed over memorandum to officials. We had announced that work boycott will begin if our demands are not met.

09-12-2021||Patna||ED attach properties worth ₹2.48 crore of a pvt finance company in cheating case||PATNA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday attached properties worth ₹2.48 crore of a private housing finance and construction company along with its other group companies for cheating investors in several districts in Bihar, West Bengal, and Arunachal Pradesh, officials familiar with the development said.According to the ED officials, three immovable properties worth ₹62 lakh were attached in Katihar, six immovable properties worth ₹1.10 crore at Banka, and property worth ₹76 lakh registered in the name of Pratigya Housing Finance and Construction Limited and its Managing Director Dipten Banerjee was attached in West Bengal’s Jalpaiguri.ED initiated the investigations following an FIR registered by the Economic Offences Unit (EoU), Patna, Town police station in Katihar, Forbesganj police station in Araria in 2014, against Dipten Banerjee, Sambit Banerjee, Ruma Banerjee, Soma Banerjee, and others.As per the ED investigation, non banking company Pratigya Housing Finance and Construction Company Limited has registered under Registrar of Companies at West Bengal. Its MD Dipten Banerjee, director Sambit Banerjee and his wife Soma Banerjee, opened branch offices at Araria, Bhagalpur, and other parts of Bihar in 2009 and started its forged business by appointing agents to work on commission basis. The agents appointed by the regional manager and branch manager started hiring more agents. The said agents started collecting daily deposits, by issuance of equity, redeemable preferences shares, bonds, securities from public by alluring them of higher returns. They also promised investment of the said money in various schemes of the company by making them members. The company collected huge deposits from people in different schemes and kept the deposits violating the rules of the Companies Act, regulation of RBI and rules of SEBI, officials said.“Further investigation, in this case, is under progress,” said an official familiar with the matter.

The institute stopped NGS amid shortage of funds to buy reagents, after having tested one sample in the last week of November that was found positive for the Delta variant, said doctors at the institute requesting anonymity.The 53-year-old patient had a travel history to the United Kingdom. He had gone to attend a marriage ceremony in Motihari town of East Champaran district, where he fell ill and was admitted to a private hospital in Patna.Prior to this, the institute had done a trial run of two archived samples of the second wave (April to June), which tested positive for the Delta variant, the doctor quoted above said.Sources at the institute said the reagents for NGS cost nearly ₹15 lakh (approx.) for one run of the machine. A maximum of 96 samples could be accommodated in one run. It generally took a minimum of 10 days to get the test result, which involved multiple tests. The machine aborts the sample if, at any stage, the quality of the test was not up to the mark. In such an event, one had to re-run the entire process, leading to a delay in getting the precise result, said a microbiologist at the institute.Officials at State Health Society, Bihar, said funds to purchase NGS reagents are on the way after the IGIMS made a formal request for it on December 7.“Based on information of travellers from “at risk” countries on the Air-Suvidha portal of the government of India, as many as 957 of the 1,200-odd samples of international travellers collected from the last week of November have tested negative, while four are positive. The samples have been sent for genomic sequencing. Results of the remaining 239-odd samples are awaited,” executive director of the State Health Society, Sanjay Kumar Singh, had said on Tuesday.

The updated version of the software is meant to have new templates, a facilitated version for developers for verification and data integration with Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). “Basic version is currently functional. We are continuously trying to make it better so that the process will be easier. Currently some big developers have registered with us. There should be wider acceptance about this process from the developers and the people,” said Suhas Mapari, deputy Inspector General of Registrations (IT). The e-registration of first-sale properties has been started in Maharashtra to ensure less crowding at the sub-registrar offices. This new system allows developers and buyers to conduct online registrations from their offices in coordination with the department of property registration, Maharashtra. “We have conducted meetings with developer associations to seek their suggestions as well. We are trying to be more inclusive. Any developer who is registered with Rera and is constructing more than 50 flats can utilise this facility,” said an official from the head office of the Department of Registration and Stamps. Earlier while speaking in Pune, Balasaheb Thorat, state revenue minister had hinted that the state government will make it mandatory for developers to register from their offices only. The initiative of e-registration was proposed after Covid-induced curbs were affecting the registration process. “We are working closely with the IGR and his team to start a new e-registration system. We are sure it will revolutionise the process of registration by offering convenience to consumers/ citizens. It will also substantially reduce the pressure on sub-registrar offices across the state as most developers will no longer need to visit sub registrar offices to register their flats booking agreements,” said Anil Pharande, president, Credai Pune Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/eregistration-of-first-sale-properties-software-update-to-enhance-process-101639069001284.html
09-12-2021||Lucknow||TN chopper crash: Wing Cdr Chauhan’s father remembers soft-spoken son||Surendra Singh Chauhan, 74, is unable to come to terms with the untimely demise of his only son Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, 42, who was flying the ill-fated military helicopter carrying among others India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat and 12 others. Thirteen out of 14 people, including Wing Commander, were killed when the Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper crashed near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. “We came to know about the tragic loss from television at about 6.30 pm on Wednesday. We could not get any official confirmation about the death from the Indian Air Force on Wednesday. My son-in-law in Mumbai left for Coimbatore where my son was posted,” he said while sitting at corner of a room in his house in Saran Nagar locality of Agra on Thursday. “Prithvi was a soft-spoken person, at good terms with all family members and was very close to his uncles. He last came home on Raksha Bandhan this year and it was after 31 years and unfortunately for last time that his three sisters (the eldest one could not make it) tied Rakhi to him. We are all shattered,” said the father of the wing commander who was the youngest among his siblings. “My eldest daughter in Mumbai saw the news about the chopper crash in Tamil Nadu on television and tried to call Prithvi but his mobile phone was switched off. After that, she called Prithvi’s wife Kamini who somehow confirmed his death,” said a teary-eyed Surendra Singh Chauhan who earlier ran a bread business in Agra. Soon after the tragic news broke, neighbours, friends and relatives started gathering at Chauhan’s house in utter house. Chauhan’s family shifted to Agra from Gwalior in 2006. Young Prithvi had his schooling in Gwalior and then went to Sainik School in Rewa. After his friend cleared the National Defence Academy (NDA) exam, Prithvi too decided to go for the elite defence services, cleared the NDA and joined the Indian Air Force in Hyderabad. He was to visit Agra in January next and had last talked to his father three or four days back. “His mother had a problem in her eyes and Prithvi had assured her to fix an appointment this Saturday at Military Hospital in Agra,” said his father. Prithvi’s mother Sushila Chauhan, 70, is in a state of shock and listlessness. Yashpal Singh Chauhan, one of Prithvi’s uncles, said his nephew and his family lived in Coimbatore. He is survived by his wife Kamini Singh, 40, daughter Aradhya, 12, and son Aviraj, 7. He said his nephew was married in 2007.Sanjay Chauhan, a family friend, said all through Wednesday family members prayed for Prithvi. On Thursday morning, Prithvi’s uncle Yashpal Chauhan said mortal remains of deceased defence personnel, including that of his nephew, were to reach Delhi on Thursday evening.
09-12-2021||Pune||Why property registration at Pune sub-registrar office is a two-day affair||PUNE Crowding and long queues at the sub-registrar’s offices have continued, leaving citizens who wish to register property or register certificates related to other matters in a state of despair. To make matters worse, the perennial problem of “servers down” has still not been solved, despite the department being responsible for large amounts of revenue coming in to the government’s coffers. For a citizen who wishes to complete a task related to the sub-registrar offices, a minimum of two working days is required. Raghvendra Shevale is one of many such people at the joint sub-registrar haveli 21 and 22, in Erandwane, waiting for his turn in the queue. He wants to register his apartment in the Kharadi area. “I have been here for more than three hours and my turn still hasn’t come. Servers had gone down and the work resumed once they were restored. I had been told by the developer’s office to spare three days to complete this work. I am mentally prepared. I had to take off from work to do this. There are 24 flat owners from our scheme who have come here,” said Shevale. The department is known to be cash rich as citizens pay large sums as part of stamp duty on the property they purchase. The budgeted estimated collection from stamp duty and registration for the financial year 2021-22 is ₹32,000 crore. At most sub-registrar offices, there is no proper place to sit while the internet connection is often sketchy. Earlier last week, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture’s (MCCIA) president Sudhir Mehta, post his visit to sub-registrar’s office, noted that the entire process highlights a “low ease of doing business”. “A trip to the property registrar’s office reminds you of why we remain so low in the ease of doing business. You have the privilege if 1) Standing outside for hours in the rain/ sun with no place to sit or any basic amenities; 2) Request “Mai- Bap to accept your lacs in transfer charges; 3) bonus opportunity to get Covid in circumstances with no social distancing while getting your fingers full of blue ink; 4) thank the “mai-bap” by Prasad; 5) leaving with feeling we deserve better”, Mehta said in a series of tweets. There are a total 27 sub registrar offices in Haveli tehsil. Though the registration department has been rolling out online facilities, wait times at the registration offices haven’t reduced. Citizens have demanded that the offices remain open on weekends. “For working people like us, spending a day waiting in queues is not possible. There are some tasks which have to be done through these offices and visiting them becomes inevitable. It will be great if they remain functional on weekends. That way we won’t have to tussle between office work and the registration work,” said Dhanashri Bhagat, who recently visited the sub-registrar’s office to register a rent agreement. A 64-year-old resident of the Kothrud area who did not wish to be named said that he had come to the office with his whole family to register the family-owned land and every member had to be present. “Elderly people cannot wait for so long. It has been more than two hours. We have asked our lawyer to arrange this. So we could come a little late. People have been waiting here since 6am,” said the elderly resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/why-property-registration-at-pune-sub-registrar-office-is-a-two-day-affair-101639068821662.html
09-12-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad University hostellers begin fast-unto-death on varsity campus||Around 45 inmates of different hostels of Allahabad University (AU) have started an indefinite fast-unto-death at the office of the dean student welfare (DSW) of AU on Thursday. The inmates are protesting on the issue of levying of “fine” on them by the varsity administration for forcefully occupying the room of their respective hostels at a time when it was officially closed during lockdown period.However, the AU administration maintains that they have not levied any fine and instead the amount of ₹15,000 per student being sought from 1097 inmates was fee for their stay in the allotted rooms during the said period.The protest began with 52 inmates sitting on fast unto death on Wednesday. However, by Thursday evening, eight of them fell ill while the rest continued with their fast. DSW prof KP Singh tried to persuade them to end their agitation.Former vice-president and the present state president of National Student Union of India, Akhilesh Yadav said, “The AU administration has issued a notice to the students to pay a fine of ₹15,000 against which the students are agitating for the past many days but varsity administration is adamant on realizing the money which is unjust.” Meanwhile, AU authorities on Thursday again tried to clarify their stand on the issue. “We have not imposed any penalty. It is just the fee being sought from them for staying in the hostels during the pandemic. It is an approximation of the expenses incurred by the hostels during the period which has to be paid only by the 1097 students who have stayed in the hostels without allocation and due permission of the competent authority,” said a communiqué issued by AU.Varsity administration maintains that AU has a list of 1097 boys who had illegally entered the hostels by breaking the locks and without the permission of the competent authority. There are no girls in this list. These boys are liable for legal action under Disaster Management Act and for damaging public property but it was not done at that time because of the severity of the second wave, they said.In spite of repeated warnings, notices and instructions, the students did not leave and continued to use the premises, its facilities including electricity without paying any charges. They did not pay any fees for staying in the hostels though the staffs including the block servants, the gardener and sweeper were engaged. In this regard, students are also once again being instructed to pay their dues according to the formula developed, AU administration said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-university-hostellers-begin-fast-unto-death-on-varsity-campus-101639068818939.html

Vice chancellor of UPRTOU prof Seema Singh said on December 15, the NAAC peer team will reach for on-site inspection. The team will undertake its inspection, interaction and assessment in the university for three days between December 15 and December 17. After the visit, the NAAC team will submit its report to NAAC which would then award the final grading to the university, she added.Earlier, NAAC grading was not necessary for open universities of the country. However, after the UGC (Open and Distance Learning) Regulations-2017, which came into effect in April 2019, every open university has to apply for this vital grading within one year. The time duration for applying for the same was, however, extended because of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.This led to UPRTOU kick-starting the process for bagging a NAAC grading. The process involves registration of the higher educational institutions (HEIs) on the NAAC official website, compilation of the institutional data and information for initial Quality Assessment (IIQA) and submission of the self-study report (SSR) after the acceptance of IIQA (If it is rejected, the educational institutions get two more attempts to resume the process within one year) followed by data validation and verification process student satisfaction survey and NAAC peer team visit in the institution for further verification. This finally leas to final grades being assigned to the institution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/22-years-on-uprtou-close-to-bagging-naac-grading-101639068159232.html

The plea stated that certain channels operating unrestrictedly on social media platforms were spreading “sponsored misinformation” about Wankhede and Redkar at the “behest of the individuals against whom he had to act as part of his official duty” and sought relief under provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. It is scheduled to come up for hearing on December 17. This follows a the ₹1.25-crore civil defamation suit filed by Wankhede’s father, Dnyandev Wankhede on November 7, against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik for posting what he called “derogatory comments on social media against my son and family”. Dnyandev also sought a permanent injunction restraining Malik and others “acting under his instructions” from publishing, writing or speaking in the media about the family, after the Maharashtra minister posted photos of Wankhede’s birth certificate and claimed that he had lied about his religion to avail caste-based reservation. Wankhede and Redkar filed a plea for interim relief on October 28 in which they claimed that Wankhede is an “honest and upright officer” who has been instrumental in curbing illegal activities like smuggling and trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in Mumbai. Their plea stated that some unscrupulous elements, against whom Wankhede has taken action, have taken to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, to launch a “tirade against him”. “When special investigation teams have been set up (to investigate some drug cases registered by NCB, including the one involving Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and another involving son-in-law of Nawab Malik) such continued illegal tirade against me and Plaintiff No. 2 (Redkar) is purely intended to discredit me and my official work.” “It is only just and fair that the Defendants (social media platforms) be directed to prevent the misuse of their platforms to threaten and defame me for being a Government servant, who has no other remedy,” the plea stated. Wankhede has sought an order under section 79 of the IT Act asking that the companies stop airing, displaying, publishing malicious, defamatory, scurrilous messages against him and his wife. When contacted, media representatives for Facebook and Twitter said they were unaware of the legal issues involved and therefore expressed inability to comment on the proceeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sameer-wankhede-sues-social-media-platforms-seeks-restraint-on-allowing-defamatory-material-against-him-wife-101639066479422.html

Shelar’s petition states that the FIR is blatantly false, vexatious, frivolous, concocted and a product of abuse of process of law. Shelar further stated that as the Maharashtra State Women’s Rights Commission had issued a letter to the police authorities to inquire and submit a report on the alleged objectionable remarks by him, he had addressed a letter to the Mumbai police commissioner apprising him of the incident. Despite his letter, the FIR was filed. “The present FIR is nothing but a result of brainstorming and imagination of the ruling party, who are falsely implicating the petitioner in the present crime,” says the petition. In her complaint to the Marine Drive police, Pednekar alleged that Shelar had made derogatory remarks about her in the context of the cylinder blast at BDD Chawl on November 30, which resulted in the death of a man, an infant and two others. Post the tragedy, Shelar, while addressing a press conference on December 4, slammed the mayor for visiting the site nearly 72 hours after the incident. Shelar allegedly remarked, “Where were you (the mayor) sleeping for these many hours?” In her letter to state home minister Dilip Walse Patil, she wrote, “The mayor of Mumbai is the first citizen and it is a very important post. The term used to describe me as a woman mayor is objectionable.” The letter stated that Shelar’s remark insulted not only Pednekar, but other women as well. The petition has been filed by advocate Rizwan Merchant and is expected to come up for hearing in due course before a division bench of the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ashish-shelar-moves-hc-seeks-to-quash-fir-filed-by-mayor-101639065098432.html
09-12-2021||Mumbai||Versova beach construction violates CRZ clearance: NGT||Mumbai: The ongoing construction work of an anti-sea erosion wall at Versova Beach has run into trouble with the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The project, which is being carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD), allegedly violates the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) clearance. However, the NGT is yet to pronounce a judgement in the matter and has given concerned parties time till January 28, 2022, to file their affidavits. These include the PWD, the municipal corporation and the district collector.It was reported earlier that an elevated walkway is being constructed along the beach, despite clear instructions that prohibit any reclamation of the shore. At present, a 1.2km long wall about eight metres from the original high-tide line has been built, with tetrapods dumped on its seaward side. Earth has been backfilled into an eight-metre space between the original high-tide line and the new anti-erosion wall. Environmentalists have demonstrated that it is now possible to drive large cars along this part of the beach, which was earlier inaccessible to vehicles. A two-judge bench comprising justices M Sathyanarayanan and Dr Arun Kumar Verma observed, “NGT has read the materials placed before it and is of the prima-facie view that a walkway/road has been created between the existing wall and the place identified for construction of a new retaining wall and the same is in violation of one of the clearances granted by MCZMA.” The sandy beach is a CRZ-I area where construction activities are prohibited, the coastal authority has noted in response to similar proposals by Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), which have, at different times, sought to carry out “beautification” of the beachfront. PWD was allowed to go ahead with the ostensible purpose of their proposal to reconstruct an existing 1.2-km anti-erosion bundh from Picnic Cottage, Versova to the Hindu crematorium before Versova Koliwada. This bundh, PWD had submitted, was essential for protecting properties along the stretch “from further damage caused by the tidal action”. MCZMA had categorically prohibited any promenade construction or reclamation of the CRZ-1 area and allowed for the bundh to be remodelled into a sea wall. Environmentalist Zoru Bhatena whose petition challenging the project was admitted by the NGT in September, shared, “Constructing a new facade, eight metres from the original bundh has neither been recommended nor approved by MCZMA. The eight-metre gap has been backfilled to about 16 feet above sea level and the walkway is to be built over that, according to the plans we have obtained. What is expressly not permitted cannot be done by creative engineering. A walkway cannot be created in the garb of anti-erosion measures.” Narendra Toke, chairman of MCZMA and director, state environment department, could not be reached for comment. However, in an affidavit before the Tribunal on December 2, Toke wrote that no walkways or elevated promenades are permitted to be built in the area. “It is binding for the PWD to carry out the activities within the framework of CRZ clearance granted to the project,” he explained. A PWD engineer directly involved in the project declined to comment in detail, saying that the matter is sub-judice. “We will submit our response before the court directly before the next date,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/versova-beach-construction-violates-crz-clearance-ngt-101639064316668.html

Sharad Pawar, the architect of MVA, has never pressured the Chief Minister on any issue and also asked us to accord him due respect and allow him to take his decisions. Pawar told us that he was confident that MVA will win the next assembly elections and that Uddhav Thackeray will become the CM again.” While he said that Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde fully supports MVA unity for NMMC elections, he blamed Shiv Sena for not adhering to coalition unity in Navi Mumbai, where he said party workers were being targetted and NCP leaders not given due respect.Attacking the BJP on the OBC reservation issue, Awhad said, “The empirical data on OBCs is required for the reservation and the central government has to give us the data. It is, however, playing politics on the issue. It doesn’t want the OBCs, who constitute 51% of the population of Maharashtra, to progress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-will-win-state-elections-in-2024-uddhav-thackeray-to-be-cm-again-awhad-quotes-sharad-pawar-as-saying-101639064076706.html

But at the same time, majority of the farmers don’t trust the government until they execute their commitments,” stated farmers’ leaders. “We are happy over our victory, but also feel sorry for over 700 fellow farmers who sacrificed their lives during the movement. Making MSP legal remains a big issue and our organisation has decided to continue its battle for MSP,” said Harpal Singh Bilari, a veteran farmer leader who heads BKU(Asli) and has good following in Sambhal, Amroha and neighbouring districts of western UP. He is also associated with the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha since beginning of the movement. He said MSP would be made a political issue as his organisation had given a ‘MSP laao, vote paao’ call. “The government has not clarified how 40,000 cases registered against farmers in Haryana would be taken back besides cases in UP and other states. Farmers are elated over the victory of their movement but have lost trust in the government,” added Bilari. BKU’s National Capital Region president Mangeram Tyagi shared that farmers had a mixed feeling as they were elated over the success of their movement, but at the same time their eyes were filled with tears for 700 farmers who lost their lives to ensure the historic victory.“Withdrawal of three farm laws and acceptance of other demands may give breathing space to the BJP, but they won’t regain the trust of the farmers’ community after what they did in the past one year,” he said. Echoing similar views, Bilari said: “Withdrawal of the movement doesn’t guarantee the revival of trust in the BJP.”Kamehameha Tyagi of Falauda village in Muzaffarnagar and sugarcane farmer Manoj Malik in Paswara village of Meerut said acceptance of farmers’ demands and withdrawal of bills were a “historic victory” for farmers. Jitendra Pal, secretary in Meerut and Saharanpur divisions of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, said farmers were still doubtful over the intention of the government because many leaders said that the bills could be withdrawn and introduced anytime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/elated-over-victory-but-have-lost-trust-in-govt-say-farmer-leaders-in-west-up-101639063957497.html

The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the ₹ 44,605 crore project to address water scarcity problem of Bundelkhand region spread across Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It will be completed in the next eight years.“For proper implementation of the project, there must be local representation in the Ken-Betwa Link Project Authority. Without monitoring at the local level and by locals, we cannot ensure proper execution of the project,” Raja Bundela, vice-chairman of Bundelkhand Development Board, said on Thursday. “We will forward our suggestions to the Centre through the state government,” said Bundela. The project will not only provide water for irrigation but will also ensure drinking water for around 62 lakh people of both the states. The project will be of immense benefit for the water-starved regions of Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur districts of Uttar Pradesh among other districts. “The project, if implemented properly, will change Bundelkhand’s image as a water-starved region. It is an ambitious project for the welfare of the region. But it requires proper implementation,” said Raja Bundela. The board will also prepare a proposal for the state government suggesting promotion of agro-based industries in Bundelkhand. The state government, in a statement issued on Thursday, stated that in the past four years several big irrigation projects for Bundelkhand region have been implemented. This has led to an increase in irrigated land by 2,16,666 hectare. The project will also help generate 103 megawatt (MW) hydro-electricity and 27 MW solar energy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bundelkhand-development-board-wants-local-representation-in-ken-betwa-link-project-authority-101639061736429.html

According to the officials from Nagaon gram panchayat, the local governing body here, more than 300 tourists visit the beach during the weekends.Chetan Gaikwad, sarpanch of the gram panchayat, said, “The beach is around 2km long and it’s a very good hangout for people who want to enjoy a day. No one was coming here during the lockdown last year and earlier this year. With the drop in temperature, people have started coming in large numbers.” There is a dargah on the one side of the beach and pilgrims including many from Raiagd visit it every year. The pilgrims from Thane, Mumbra and Raigad travel by bus. Those from Mumbai normally travel by boat from Bhaucha Dhakka at Mazgaon.The beach is maintained by the gram panchayat and it has allotted a ghanta gadi and three people for lifting garbage. It has also installed several dustbins there.Sudheer Mane, an activist from Uran said, “This beach is no less than those in Mumbai, Alibaug and Murud. However, many people from this region don’t know about it and thus don’t come here. The gram panchayat officials have maintained it well, but there are a lot of options to improve it. They may think of developing a few modern public toilets, changing rooms, seating arrangements among others.”Gaikwad said, “The beach is close to the ONGC plant in Uran and we have been requesting them to provide some facilities from their CSR plans. We had a meeting with their officials last week too. We hope they will take a decision and do the needful soon.” At present people from Navi Mumbai can travel to Uran both on NMMT and ST buses. From there, they can take autos and reach the beach in 10 minutes. With the completion of the Nerul-Belapur-Uran railway project (phase II), it will be more convenient to explore the beach and its surroundings.Gokul Puri, a 37-year-old resident of Ulwe, said, “I had been to the beach last weekend with my family and friends, and we enjoyed there till evening. There are also a lot of stalls close to it and thus the tourists don’t have to bother about food. It’s a nice play to enjoy a picnic with family.”

09-12-2021||Mumbai||Work on sewage treatment in Kalyan Dombivli to be completed by May 2022||The pollution caused in Ulhas and Kalu rivers due to sewage generated in Kalyan-Dombivli will soon be under control. The work for sewage waste treatment is expected to be completed by May 2022. In Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) limits, the Ulhas river, which is a source of drinking water, and Kalu river meet the Kalyan creek. Several nullahs in the city meet the rivers at different places while a few also meet the creek. The untreated sewage waste that flows through the nullah also ends up in these rivers.Under the KDMC Amrut scheme, the civic body initiated the project of intersecting nullah and diverting the sewage to the sewage treatment plants (STPs). “The work under this scheme is in its final stage and is expected to be completed by May 2022. With this, the pollution caused to the river due to the nullahs in Kalyan-Dombivli limits will be under control,” said an officer of KDMC. As per the KDMC, in Ulhas River, sewage waste from the nullah mixes with the river water without any treatment. The project will ensure that the nullah water is treated at the STPs before mixing with the river. The work of treating the sewage water is being carried out in two phases by the KDMC. The proposal for the project was sanctioned in 2018 under the Amrut scheme.In the second phase of the project, the estimated cost was ₹132.82Cr. Till January 2020, only 20% of the work for the second phase was completed. Throughout the pandemic, KDMC managed to finish the work for the second phase up to 85%. In the second phase, KDMC has built eight pumping stations out of the proposed 11. Till November, KDMC had spent ₹103.39Cr for Phase II of this project.“This entire work is only limited to the KDMC jurisdiction. However, there are many other factors that lead to pollution in the river. There is a need to ensure other authorities are also implementing pollution-control measures like us,” added the officer.In the first phase of the project, which cost around ₹153.38Cr, KDMC has managed to build 10 pumping stations out of the proposed 11 and also the work for 47km sewage pipeline while work for 3km is remaining. According to KDMC, the pipeline connects 30,000 households in its limits.In total, the KDMC has spent ₹118.25Cr for this project. A total of 90% of the work of the first phase is also finished and it is also expected to be completed by 2022.

To avoid the task of coming to the court and facing the case, it is best to pay the penalty as issued by the challan,” DCP Purushottam Karad said.In order to bring discipline into the motorists, traffic police have been conducting various drives. While some of them pay the fine up front, some others are issued with an e-challan for paying the fine online or at the nearest traffic chowky“In some cases, when it is physically not possible to stop everyone, police monitoring the CCTV cameras find the people breaking traffic norms and issue an e-challan. A message is sent to the person immediately when the challan is issued. It is also possible to get to know if there is any pending amount to be paid for the challan through the app and one must keep checking the app once in a while,” a traffic police officer from Navi Mumbai said.On the total 13.78 lakh challans issued, maximum issued are for riding without helmet, which is 3.10 lakh, followed by violation of speed by driver issued to 77,338 people.

This comprises less than 1% of the samples tested.In a statement on Thursday, BMC said, “The fifth batch of genome sequencing results have overall indicated that the Covid outbreak in Mumbai is under control. However, despite this, in light of the Omicron variant, it is important to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Those who have not yet been vaccinated with the first or second dose should get jabbed on priority.”Only one of the 221 patients who received the first dose, and 26 patients who received both doses had to be hospitalized. Twelve of the 47 people who did not receive a single dose of the vaccine had to be hospitalized. None of these 221 infected patients died.In its statement, BMC said, “Both the Delta variant and the Delta derivative are relatively mildly invasive and do not pose a significant risk. Compared with the Delta variant, the delta derivative virus transmission rate has also been found to be lower. But it is important to seek timely medical help.”Out of 221 patients in Mumbai, 19 patients (9%) are in the age group of 0 to 20 years, 69 patients (31%) in the age group of 21 to 40 years, 73 patients (33%) in the age group of 41 to 60 years, 54 patients (25%) in the age group of 61 to 80 years, and six patients (3%) are in the age group of 81 to 100 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/results-of-genome-sequencing-reveal-11-delta-cases-101639055255084.html

The events will be organised at the Shaheed Smarak in Kakori, said officials. “We are planning a programme to mark the 94th anniversary of Kakori Shaheed Diwas, which is observed to pay tribute to the heroes of Kakori. The event would start on December 17 and culminate on December 19,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate, while addressing a meeting to review preparations for the programme. The Kakori Shaheed Diwas event will be packed with cultural and patriotic programmes. “We would also organise essay and painting competitions in which the students of many schools and colleges would take part. On day one of the event, the governor will also pay floral tribute to the five heroes of Kakori who executed the Kakori train episode and gave the supreme sacrifice for the country,” said the DM. Prominent among these freedom fighers were Rajendra Lahiri, Ram Prasad Bismil, Roshan Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and Ashfaqullah Khan.The program would also witness mushaira, kavi sammelans and other cultural events. The DM also directed the LMC and other departments to make elaborate arrangements. On August 9, 1925, some members of Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), an undercover rebel outfit, attacked a running train on Lucknow-Saharanpur route close to Kakori railway station, and plundered the government treasury from the train. The reason behind the attack was the outfit’s need for money to fund their independence movement activities. More than 40 people were arrested in this incident. They were finally sentenced to death by the British government and severe punishments were also given to those people who helped this incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-to-organise-shaheed-diwas-events-from-dec-17-19-to-pay-tribute-to-kakori-heroes-101639055136253.html
09-12-2021||Mumbai||Thane district sees 5.25% rise in vaccination dose against Covid over last 10 days||With Thane district being the first to detect the Omicron variant last week, the vaccination here has shown a marked increase over the last 10 days.Till Wednesday, the district has administered 99.37 lakh vaccine doses, 5.25% of these doses were administered in the last 10 days. The increase is basically among the beneficiaries due for their second dose as 13 lakh are yet to take the first dose.Around 4.96 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated since November 29 within the district. Among these, 2.90% have taken the first dose and 9.10% have been fully vaccinated.After November 25, Thane district started keeping a close track of the travellers visiting the district from countries of concern. The new variant scare, Omicron, seems to draw more people towards vaccination centres in the district. The number of people taking the second dose across the district has increased in the last few days. In the last 10 days, the daily number of vaccinations was more than 50,000 doses each day. On some days, it crossed the 70,000 mark as well.Dr Anjali Chaudhari, district vaccination officer, Thane, said, “We still have around 13 lakh who have not been vaccinated with the first dose. The increase in figures is mostly those who are due for the second dose. With the news of the new strain, a positive response to get fully vaccinated has emerged. However, we continue to create awareness and adapt various means to increase the number of first dose vaccinations across the district.”In the last week of September, the district had ample vaccine doses and around 75% of the target population had taken their first dose, out of these 21.32% are yet to get the second dose.“As most of them are now due for their second dose after three months, a positive response in vaccination has been noted. Moreover, there are a few who had taken the first jab and did not find it essential to get fully vaccinated. Those people also seem to have come forward for their second jab following the new variant scare,” said an officer from the district health department. Within the district, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has noted hardly a 4% increase in vaccinations in the last 10 days while Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) recorded 6.37% rise. Similarly, 5.08% increase in vaccination was noted in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) as well.Reluctance has been noted among both the first and second dose beneficiaries within TMC. Until November end, the vaccination drive had picked up pace with around 15,000 vaccinations administered daily. However, the numbers have started to dip again with hardly 10,000 daily vaccinations now in the city.“We now have a dedicated team who are making calls to those who are due for their second dose. Also, we have door-to-door surveys and mobile vaccination facilities. We expect a positive response towards vaccination in the coming days,” said Dr Prasad Patil, immunisation officer, TMC.Meanwhile, KDMC and NMMC have noted a remarkable response from those who are due for their second dose. KDMC has seen around 12.13% increase in those getting fully vaccinated and around 2.57% increase in first dose vaccinations in the last ten days. Similarly, NMMC saw a 9.17% increase in second dose vaccinations while hardly a 2.39% spike in those getting their first dose.“There was a lull during the festive season. Many must have postponed their second vaccine. This might be the reason more people have now come forward to get fully vaccinated. We are continuing with our surveys and awareness programmes related to vaccination. However, there are some who continue to show hesitancy in getting immunised,” said Dr Ganesh Doiphode, vaccination officer, KDMC.NMMC has completed the first dose vaccination and hence has a positive response for second dose vaccination.“By mid-October, we had completed 100% first dose vaccination. Those who took the first jab in that period are due for their second now. This is the reason we have over 9% increase in second dose vaccination. Now, considering that people from the neighbouring cities or those who have travelled to Navi Mumbai can avail the first dose, we continue to provide the same,” said a senior officer from NMMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-district-sees-5-25-rise-in-vaccination-dose-against-covid-over-last-10-days-101639052975933.html

09-12-2021||Mumbai||Fashion faux pas leads to arrest of burglar in Thane||Wearing the same clothes twice is considered a ‘fashion faux pas’ among the rich and the famous. But, for a 27-year-old who allegedly tried to break into two shops in Thane last month wearing the same clothes led to his arrest on Tuesday.According to the Naupada police, the accused has been identified as Manoj Sahu (27). The police said that on the intervening night of November 27 and November 28, Sahu tried to break open the shutters of two commercial establishments, a plywood store and a cell phone shop, at Chhaya Society near Makhmali Talao in Thane. He was, however, unsuccessful in breaking into both the shops and had to flee empty-handed.A complaint was subsequently registered by the shop owners and a team led by sub-inspector Vinod Labhade initiated inquiries into the matter.“We examined CCTV camera footage, and obtained stills of the accused. The clearest of these were circulated among our informants, who were asked to provide any and all information about him,” Labhade said. In the early hours of Tuesday, an informant spotted Sahu, who was wearing the same clothes as seen in the CCTV footage, near the Mahagiri cremation ground in Thane . The informant tipped off the police and a team reached the spot. Sahu was picked up and taken for questioning, during which he allegedly confessed to having committed the crime. “Sahu is homeless and works on a daily wage basis at construction sites or for caterers whenever they get orders for large events. He desperately wanted to go home but had no money to pay for the journey due to lack of work.

The change in uniform covers 64,000 state-run schools, according to the order.For 20 years since 1997, boys in Rajasthan’s government schools wore a blue-and-khaki combination, while girls put on a blue-and-white combination. In 2017, the colour combination was changed to light and dark brown, sparking criticism from the Congress at that time.A senior education department official said the new uniforms will be provided free of cost to students from Class I to VIII, covering around seven million school kids. The remaining 2.8 million students, studying in Class IX to XII, will have to purchase the new uniforms from government-authorised stores. Education minister BD Kalla said the process of changing the uniform was started by the previous minister, Govind Singh Dotasara. “There is nothing political behind changing the uniform colour. It is the BJP that always works on an agenda,” he said. Former education minister and state Congress chief Dotasara said the decision was taken on the basis of a six-member panel’s recommendation. “The committee considered complaints from parents and school teachers about the uniform introduced during the BJP government in 2017 and recommended a change,” he said. A government functionary familiar with the development said the existing colour of the trousers and salwars was identical to that of the RSS uniform, but insisted that the Congress government’s decision to change it is not a political one. BJP MLA and former education minister Vasudev Devnani slammed the new decision. “They have no reason or logic behind changing the colour of the uniform. It’s done only to change what the previous BJP government had done. This is an autocratic decision,” Devnani said. He argued that the move was harsh for parents who had already been suffering financially due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

But those arranging weddings and other pre-wedding functions during this season, are running from pillar to post to find alternate ways to ensure the supply is swell at their gatherings. The shortage of liquor, especially the premium brands in Delhi, is affecting the numerous weddings since the few licensed liquor shops in the Capital are running with almost empty shelves, and quite a few Delhiites are forced to rejig their alcohol preferences. “My daughter recently got married, and it became quite difficult for me to get alcohol for all the functions that we had planned for her wedding,” says JK Kriplani, a businessman who lives in Shalimar Bagh. He adds, “I live in north Delhi and travelled all the way to Khan Market in south, when I got to know that one wine shop had some good stock available. But, the next day when I went to buy more, the shop was empty! Then we were forced to opt for lower brands. In fact, we were only able to source only one average brand, and scotch toh thi hi nai wahaan... It was such a disappointment that we couldn’t offer all the brands to our guests, but ab kya hi karein.” City-based caterers are also experiencing a challenge to pacify the guests who are ready to shell out extra for brands of their choice. “Popular brands gayab hain market se, woh bhi is time pe jab demand itni zyada hai shaadiyon mein. Bahut dikkat ho rahi hai hume logon ko samjhane mein ki hum jaan bhujhke ek hi brand nahi rakh rahe, peeche se maal hi nahi aa rha,” says Rajesh Gupta from a catering and decorator company in Paschim Vihar, adding, “Majboori me log wedding functions ke liye lower brands le rahe hain. Humein unhe convince karna padh raha hai ki jo hai usi me maan jayein. Kayi log jo bahut specific hote hain brands ko leke, they are OK to buy lesser number of bottles, but refuse to go for cheaper variants.”“Peeche se hi samaan kam aa raha hai,” says Ankit Aggarwal from a catering and wedding planning company based in Shahdra. He adds, “Jahan toh house parties hain, uske liye expensive brands reserve kar rahe hain zyadatar log, aur shaadi ya bade functions mein saste brands se kaam chala rahe hain. Ab sabko pata hi hai dilli me kya haal hai, toh jo guests wedding attend karne aa rahe hain, woh bhi samajhte hain is situation ko. Par kuchh log phir bhi shaadi pe tamasha karte hain agar unki pasand ka brand na mile.”In the quest to appease their guests, many Delhiites have been flocking to NCR to buy the stock of alcohol for weddings. “Dilli se bahut saare log aa rahe hai aur kaafi saari bottles leke jaate hai ek hi bar mein,” says Manish Jain from a wine shop in Gurugram, adding, “Aaj kal toh itna rush ho gya hai, ki yahaan par humara stock bhi low hi chal raha hai. Kai Gurgugram ke log abhi khaali hath wapis laut rahe hain.”Some Delhiites have been requesting their wedding guests from cities near Delhi, to help them with alcohol. “It was my cousin brother’s wedding recently and we just couldn’t get the brands of our choice. So for the big functions, we just went with the brand available. For the functions at home. we requested our family members who were travelling from NCR and Punjab to get some bottles for us,” says Rupesh Goyal, an IT professional from Pitampura.

That had also confused the motorists as many of them did not understand the Marathi numbers.Officials from the electrical department of NMMC then said that they were doing that on a trial basis to understand the feasibility of the system. They also said that they would take the motorists’ opinion into consideration and accordingly take the next course of action.Contradicting their own statements, they are now saying that the numbers appeared in Marathi due to some software issues and that it was not an intentional move.“We had no intention of changing the language from English to Marathi. That happened due to some issues in the software and we fixed it earlier this week. Now all the traffic signals in the city are displaying the countdown numbers in English,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Suman Mukherjee, 45, a resident of Vashi said, “It seems, the NMMC officials are now blaming the software to hide their own haphazard actions. Since the numbers have reappeared in English now, no one will face any issue.”

09-12-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Keventer and Poona’s slice of success with cheddar cheese||Last month, while browsing through the archives of “The Poona Observer”, I came across a small advertisement published all through the month of November 1876. “First class guavas from Satara available for making jelly and cheese”, it declared. The advertisement did not mention the name of the enterprise or the person offering guavas. It only had the address – 12, Civil Lines, Poona. Similar advertisements announcing the arrival of “first quality” guavas could be found in “The Bombay Gazette” too. The fruits were used in making jelly and cheese as the advertisements mentioned. Guava jelly and guava cheese were made in some European homes in Poona in the 19th century. These delicacies were always meant for private consumption. They were not offered for sale. Cheese was considered a valuable food material, rich in protein, and was prized as such all over Europe and America. It made good food and in combination with bread, butter, and beer was considered a delicacy in many countries. Cheese was always imported from Europe and sold in European shops in Indian cities. Europeans in India yearned for good cheese. The cheeses made at home could never match the texture, taste, and smell of the ones available in Europe. The Portuguese had somewhat mastered the art of making cheese in Bengal and Goa. A Portuguese baker from Calcutta sold homemade cheese in Poona in 1885, according to an “Agricultural Report” published in 1910. But these were isolated efforts, and the British did not like the cheese made by the Portuguese. There was also a serious handicap in the manufacture or storing of cheese in tropical climates where the high temperature affected its keeping qualities. Whereas in cold climates, it could be easily stored for a length of time, it was difficult to keep it even for a few weeks either in the summer or the monsoons in tropical climates. Dr Ozanne, the director of agriculture in Bombay Presidency, and a friend of the great Mahadev Govind Ranade, wanted to reform the dairy industry. He also wanted to make cheese available on a commercial scale. Enter, Edward Keventer. Keventer, and Keventers, are familiar names and brands in India. Keventer’s milk and butter have been known all over the country for their “purity and life-giving properties” for more than a century. It has been an old favourite of locals and tourists and an unforgettable part of growing up in Darjeeling, Kolkata, Delhi, Bengaluru, and several other cities in India. It started as a dairy in Aligarh and has grown into one of the best breakfast-and-milkshake places in India. Keventer, a Swedish urbanite, studied dairy farming in Antwerp in 1885-86. He ran his own dairy in a small town nearby, and within a couple of years came to be known as a respected expert in the processing of dairy products. Around the same time, Ozanne desired to introduce cream separators and other dairy machinery and appliances in Bombay and Poona, to establish departmental dairies, to induce capitalists to take up dairying under European methods and to improve the breeding and feeding of cattle for dairying purposes. For this, he sought help in Europe. In 1889, Ozanne’s search was successful and the London Dairy Supply Company sent out to Bombay Mr Howman, as a demonstrator of modern dairy practice, with improved appliances. Edward Keventer after holding various appointments in England and Scotland came out to India as his assistant. Reports written by Ozanne suggest that satisfactory progress appeared to have been made in at least some of the directions he desired, a few dairies having been started, and modern machines and other appliances having been purchased by a considerable number of Parsi dairymen in Bombay Presidency. Ozanne, with the help of Howman and Keventer, demonstrated the use of the first-ever “Made in India” cream separator in Poona in the presence of Ranade in 1891. The use of separated milk became more extensive, and brisk demand for well-made butter sprung up in Bombay and Poona. Howman had then spent a couple of years in Bombay and Poona and helped set up the Government Dairy Farms in Bombay and Poona. He had also helped a Parsi gentleman set up a private dairy near Poona. Howman’s work was so appreciated by the officers in the Bombay Presidency that the services of his assistant, Keventer, were retained by the Government of Bombay in order to carry out further experiments. The British Government, in 1891, assigned Keventer two important tasks – modernizing the Indian dairy industry and making cheese locally. Keventer not only made butter-making pay on the government farms in Poona but also succeeded in cheese-making, which was quite a new achievement in India. He was the first to make “good quality” cheddar cheese commercially available in India. It had so far been impossible to make cheese of uniformly good quality in India. The reason was that the temperature of the cheese room could not be regulated, so that proper ripening of the cheese was ensured. At Poona, it was found impossible to secure in the curing room an even temperature of 65 degrees to 75 degrees F. which, in order to obtain the best results, should be maintained with moist air. But still, Keventer’s cheese was found to be quite pleasing to the British palate. He had stayed in Poona to bring Ozanne’s dream to reality. He now wanted to start his own dairy farm in the city. He wanted to make other varieties of European cheeses after successfully making the cheddar cheese. But Poona lost to Aligarh. The Government of the North-West Provinces and Oudh then owned a dairy farm in a small village named Chherat near Aligarh. The dairy had turned out to be a complete failure. The government hoped that Keventer would help them turn its fortunes. It decided to follow the Bombay example and requested the Bombay government to loan Keventer for a year. He was engaged to advise the government on how to improve the provincial dairy industry by the introduction of modern methods of butter–and cheese–making, the cows at Chherat being the only cattle readily available for his experiments. Land was offered to Keventer on lease for a couple of years. He left Poona for Aligarh. The land at Aligarh had been considered useless for cultivation because of being impregnated with soda salt. For several years the government tried fruit raising and failed. Keventer subsoiled the ground and put fertilisers under the surface. After toiling for nearly a decade, he was able to redeem the desert. Over thirty acres were then producing vegetables and other crops “of the best quality”. His dairy in Aligarh was operated according to the most improved methods. The butter was never touched by hand in the making. A ready sale was found for all that they could produce. Keventer had employed thirty teenaged orphans from the famine of 1897 who did most of the work. In the next few decades, Keventer had established his dairies in several cities, with pasteurised bottled milk being sent to Delhi, Agra, Calcutta, and Allahabad. Even though Keventer did not return to Poona, his experiments with cheese-making and pasteurizing milk at the Poona dairy farm were responsible for making western Uttar Pradesh known as the birthplace of the modern Indian dairy industry. More about Keventer and his “Poona experiment” next week. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

09-12-2021||Mumbai||‘Please clear the doubts’: Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut to govt on chopper crash||A day after Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and 12 others died in a chopper crash in Coonoor, the Shiv Sena on Thursday said that there were some doubts in the minds of the people, which should be dispelled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh, even though a high-level inquiry has already been ordered. Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut argued that the CDS had been playing a key role in planning action against China and Pakistan, and so, when such a tragic accident happens involving a technologically advanced helicopter, the episode raises questions.“Bipin Rawat had the responsibility of modernising weapons in the country. He contributed to missions against Pakistan and China. After Pulwama, the action against Lashkar [e-Taiba] had an important contribution. When such an accident happens while travelling on a technologically advanced helicopter, then it definitely raises doubts in the minds of the people,” Raut told reporters in New Delhi. “There will be an inquiry by the government. But it is the responsibility of the prime minister and the defence minister to dispel these doubts.” Raut pointed out that the doubts cropped up because the tragic accident happened at a time when tensions between India and China were high.The Shiv Sena MP said that he had worked closely with General Rawat when he was a member of a defence committee, recalling that he would simplify complex issues so that the committee members could understand them. Raut went on to question why multiple high ranking military officers were travelling together on the IAF chopper that crashed in Coonoor on Wednesday.The Sena leader said that if the chair permits a discussion in Parliament on the accident, he along with others would like to take up the matter. “It was a technologically advanced helicopter. The incident has not only shaken the nation, but the government as well. If there is any discussion on this, then we will speak in the Parliament. We hope the government allows a discussion on this [issue] at least... There is a doubt in the minds of the people about the accident happening at a time when there are tensions with China,” he said.

The state revenue officials are protesting against the vigilance DSP on Thursday and will hold a rally in front of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s house in Morinda on December 10. Since the arrest of Kumar and three others by the Jalandhar range vigilance bureau, the revenue officials, backed by the Deputy Commissioner Office Employees Union, have been protesting against the Punjab government. The PCS Officers Association has also decided to proceed on mass casual on Friday in support of the revenue officials.An IAS officer in Doaba said that the delivery of public services has been crippled and the worst hit are students and job seekers who need certificates of domicile and proof of income for higher courses and government jobs. “What is their fault? Why should they suffer?” he said, requesting anonymity. A senior Punjab Civil Service (PCS) officer posted in the Malwa region said 50% work of the DC office depended on revenue officials. “How can we work without them when other employees too are joining their protest. Ultimately, people suffer,” he said. He said election-related work was also hit as with every returning officer (SDM) there are two assistant returning officers (tehsildars), who are now on indefinite strike. “The compensation to be given to Covid-19 victims is linked with revenue officials but we were forced to take an alternative,” said the officer adding that state also suffers financial loss in the form stamp duty due to the strike.

Hailing from diverse backgrounds, 15 creative souls have come together to showcase their labour of love. One of the artworks on display is by Delhi-based Binay Kumar, who uses everyday objects like fan regulators to showcase the passage of time. “My work also talks about the fast pace of today’s life. And I want to remind the viewers, to take care of people who need our support, such as the elders, children, the weak and the poor,” he says. While city-based artist Sanjeev Kumar Sinha grew up in the green hills of Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, his watercolours speak about his fascination with the “beauty of the Capital, despite its hustle and bustle”. He explains: “In each of my paintings, there is a part of the old and new Delhi. For me, this city isn’t just about a grey landscape, but contains so much beauty within it.”Other artists showcasing their work include Sonia Sareen, Seema Sirohi, Shakti Sagar, Sourabh Mazumdar, Sunil Bhonwal, Radha Dhaka, Pritom Saikia, Narottam Patel, Kamal Sharma, Gouri Shankar Mukherjee, Binay Kumar, LN Ramaswamy and Alok Shankar.Curator of the show, artist Pankaj Nigam explains how he came up with the name of the exhibition. He says, “Since the pandemic, we’ve all felt the same grief, helplessness and at the same time, humanity has fought against this adversity keeping aside our differences. As a curator, I feel that we are all governed by one universal mind, which is ekAtm. This realisation of non-duality and assimilation inspired us to come up with this show.”Artist Gouri Shankar Mukherjee, who captures the notion of happiness in his painting titled Nostalgia, explains, “There’s a saying that happiness shared is happiness doubled. In my painting, you’ll see figurines of a male and a female, but they are both viewing with one eye, which shows that all we want is happiness... Nature has been a great teacher for me. What it profoundly teaches is to live in a moment of joy, living it for the self and praying for other’s happiness.”The exhibition was earlier inaugurated by painter Paramjeet Singh, and had poetry recitation by Utsa Seth, author of Fine Tangled Strands, and an interactive session with theatre actor-director and NSD alumnus Rakesh Singh.Catch It LiveWhat: ekAtm - Assimilated in OneWhere: Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre, Lodhi RoadOn till: December 9Timing: 11am to 8pmNearest Metro Station: Jor Bagh on Yellow Line and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Violet Line Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

By the time he landed in Mumbai, he was informed by the Delhi airport authorities that he has tested positive for Covid-19.The Maharashtra health authorities had then sent his swab samples for genome sequencing and the test report later confirmed that he was carrying the Omicron strain.The man had joined his duty on a private ship in April this year and was on high seas since then.

09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi air quality in poor category; IMD says min temp will be 9 degree Celsius||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality remained in the poor category on Thursday morning on the hourly air quality index (AQI) of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), while the city is likely to see shallow fog and a minimum temperature of about 9 degree Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast.According to the CPCB’s website, the hourly AQI at 7 am stood at 259 on Thursday, the middle end of the “poor” category. The average 24-hour AQI on Wednesday was 237.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. Prolonged exposure to air in the poor category leads to breathing discomfort to most people.As far as Delhi’s weather is concerned, the maximum temperature is likely to be at 24 degree Celsius while minimum temperature is predicted to be around 9 degree Celsius. The minimum temperature on Thursday was 10.1 degree Celsius, one notch above normal. The maximum temperature was 24 degree Celsius, usual during this time of the year.On Thursday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “As predicted by Safar, the air quality improved significantly. However, the improvement was higher than expected and AQI slipped to ‘Moderate’ today implying that control measures seem to be effective and are yielding results.”Safar follows a different air quality index metric. “For the next four days (8th to 11th), winds are likely to be moderate increasing ventilation of pollutants. Minimum temperatures are likely to drop gradually leading to more stable boundary layer during night time that helps accumulation of pollutants. With mostly clear sky conditions during day time, the peak mixing layer height is likely to be around 1.5 km causing moderate vertical mixing of air mass. The net effect is that air quality for the next four days likely to improve gradually but within ‘Moderate’ or ‘lower end of Poor’ category.”Mixing height is an invisible boundary layer of the atmosphere within which movement of air and particles can take place. The lower the mixing height, the lesser the room for pollutants to move or disperse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-in-poor-category-imd-says-min-temp-will-be-9-degree-celsius-101639025309038.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Where the stars descended||A dome that’s like a Buddhist stupa. Pillars resembling those at ancient Hindu temples. Designs on the gateway inspired by Islamic monuments.This red-and-white sandstone edifice is permeated with the essence of India’s histories. But the Nepalese ambassador’s palatial residence across the road is more easily visible from the road outside and attracts more attention.It is Sapru House, however, that is the precious souvenir of our city’s post-independent past. Tucked away on Barakhamba Road in central Delhi, close to the Mandi House circle, you might have passed by it a hundred times without knowing that it has been graced by the presence of international notables such as Ho Chi Minh and Dag Hammarskjold (Google him!). Its library is stacked with thousands of old and new books, and unlike the libraries of members-only institutions such as the IIC, it has free access.Inaugurated by the then prime minister Jawarharlal Nehru in 1950, Sapru House was dedicated to his passion - world affairs. After shuttling through five offices earlier, the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) founded its permanent home here. Named after Tej Bahadur Sapru, the ICWA’s first president, the landmark was built with public donations from maharajas, maharanis and a few corporate houses.The ICWA was fashioned after London’s Royal Institute of International Affairs. Our own Chatham House. The forthcoming years met the expectations. Intellectuals such as Dr Zakir Hussain and S Radhakrishnan patronised it. Margaret Thatcher and Kurt Waldheim delivered speeches in its halls. Stephen Cohen and V I Potapov browsed reading matter at its famed library. Sapru House became the place to see and be seen. Only after staging a performance here was an artist said to have finally “arrived” - according to kathak dancer Shovana Narayan’s memoirs. She was talking of the Delhi of 1960s and 70s. Over the subsequent decades, the Capital’s highbrow society got distracted by other destinations to while away its evenings. The India Habitat Centre, for instance.But Sapru House has continued to exist. These days, parts of the building are under renovation, as if the institution is eagerly getting ready to re-enter the city’s vital blood streams with renewed vigour. This sunny afternoon, the place is gleaming gracefully with its grand marble stairs, Ashoka trees, beautiful lawns, cobbled driveway and wide corridors illuminated with daylight. Once the pandemic becomes less threatening and it is again safe to mingle with the smart set, Delhi evenings might again include Sapru House as a necessary stop. Perhaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-where-the-stars-descended-101639005902336.html

09-12-2021||Noida||Supertech told to pay ₹40 lakh to aggrieved homebuyer||he Delhi high court on Wednesday directed real estate developer Supertech to pay ₹40 lakh, in two instalments, to a homebuyer, on whose complaint of delay in giving possession of a villa the company’s managing director was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.Justice Amit Bansal ordered that the first instalment of ₹20 lakh should be given on or before December 31 and the second instalment by January 31.The counsel for Supertech said the balance amount is ₹72 lakh, and that they have paid more than the principal amount. He also sought six months to pay the money, saying that the company was not doing well financially. “Please allow us to pay in nine instalments,” he said.However, Vrinda Kapoor, counsel for the complainant, objected to the proposal, saying the balance was ₹76 lakh. She requested that the money be paid in two instalments of ₹35 lakh. But the court asked the company to pay ₹40 lakh in two instalments as there was dispute over the pending amount, and posted the matter for hearing February 11.On September 20, the national consumer commission sentenced the managing director (MD) of Supertech to three years in jail for not refunding the homebuyer after having failed to hand over possession of the house in Uttar Pradesh’s Yamuma Expressway Industrial Development Area (YEIDA) for several years.The commission also issued an arrest warrant against MD, while directing that its order will come into effect after seven days if the builder fails to deposit around ₹1.79 crore by then.The money ( ₹1.75 crore) is to be paid to Brigadier (retired) Kanwal Batra and his daughter Aakriti Batra, who jointly purchased a villa in Supertech’s Upcountry project, offered by the builder in December 2013 at a cost of approximately ₹1.03 crore, which the builder promised to deliver in August 2014.Challenging the national consumer panel’s order, Supertech had gone to the high court in September arguing that it acted out of its jurisdiction and also did not give the company a chance to present its case.On September 24, the court stayed the arrest after Supertech MD agreed to give ₹50 lakh to Batra. Till date Supertech has repaid ₹1.07 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/supertech-told-to-pay-40-lakh-to-aggrieved-homebuyer-101639002776464.html

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Officials indifferent to potholes, grime coating MC’s multi-storey parking||Potholed floors, defunct lifts, stinking washrooms, and a thick coating of grime have sadly become the defining features of the lone multi-storey parking on the premises of the municipal corporation’s Zone-A office near Mata Rani Chowk. With the parking catering to old city markets, including Chaura Bazar, and Akalgarh Market, hundreds of vehicles, including two and four wheelers of those visiting the MC office, are parked at the lot on a daily basis. However, authorities have been turning a blind eye to the abject state of disrepair the multi-storey parking has fallen into. On an average, around 500 cars are parked in six-storey parking facility on a daily basis and the number increases to around 1,000 on Saturday and Sunday. Two-wheelers are mostly parked on the ground floor and basement.No major repair work has been undertaken by the MC since the parking was thrown open to the public in the year 2000, and only ad hoc work has been taken up from time to time. Any repair to the potholes wears off in no time, subjecting the public to a bumpy ride. The contractor’s staff says that the lifts have never been operated and are have been lying defunct for a long time.Swachhta claims go for a tossDespite tall claims made by authorities to promote ‘Swachhta’ in the city, its own parking facility is filthy. The defunct fountain at the entry of the parking facility is a mere preface of what is to come. A visitor, Gurminder Singh, says, “There are deep potholes on the first floor of the parking lot, which are not visible to drivers. Unhygienic conditions prevail with foul smell emanating from the washrooms. Sadly, this is the only parking facility in the area and it too is ill-maintained.” A staff member, requesting anonymity, said, “Many times vehicles get damaged due to potholes and even the staff tries to keep away from the washrooms due to unhygienic conditions. The issue has been raised several times, but to no avail.” The parking contractor also slammed the civic body for not taking up the repair work. Contractor Manish Shah said the MC failed to repair the parking before handing over the possession of the lot. “As per the contract, the contractor has to maintain the parking facility, but one can only maintain something if it was in good condition in the first place. We have already spent ₹3 lakh on repairs and improving the lighting of the parking lot, though we were not compensated for it. We will again take up repair work as it is for the betterment of visitors, but the MC is not bothered about the same,” said Shah. Despite attempts to reach the MC zonal commissioner Jasdev Sekhon, he remained unavailable for comment.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that directions will be issued to the contractor and MC staff to repair the potholes and clean the parking lot. Sandhu said, “The MC is working on a proposal to revamp the building and parking facility of the MC headquarters. The proposal is being discussed at state level as it requires a lot of funds.” Proposal to establish restaurant hangs fireThe proposal to establish a restaurant at the seventh floor the multi-storey parking is yet to see the light of the day. The floor is in a sad state with wild grass and waste all around. In December 2017, the MC house had also approved a resolution to establish a shopping complex in the basement and ground floor of the facility, but it failed to materialise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-officials-indifferent-to-potholes-grime-coating-mc-s-multi-storey-parking-101638999627273.html

If we wait for labour then this crucial period will lapse. And we may have to wait for the whole year to conduct the experiment. This could lead to delaying our degree. So, we decided to conduct the field work and began helping each order in carrying out labour work,” said the students in the experimental field.A BSc agriculture final year student said, “Due to the pandemic, our studies have taken a hit and the teachers’ protests have led to delay in examinations.

The CM suggested the youth could earn money by ferrying rickshaws.”“The CM’s job is to give a new vision to the state and open more economic avenues. But Channi is still living in the 90s-era hangover. Instead of schools, colleges and hospitals, he is boasting rickshaw riding skills,” he added.He further stated that the Channi-led Congress government had failed to deliver on any of their prior promises, adding, “Neither did they make schools or a hospital, nor did they build any road network or bridges, but only fooled the people.”The protest also saw the participation of several top Akali Dal and Youth Akali Dal leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-akali-dal-slams-channi-led-government-for-hollow-promises-101638997108350.html

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||To claim RDF for paddy procurement, Punjab food & civil supplies dept seeks amendment in Rural Development Act||The Punjab food and civil supplies department has asked the state government to amend the Rural Development Act, 1987, so that rural development fund (RDF) could be claimed from the Centre for the paddy procurement season. The central government has mandated the states to make amendments to specify the RDF usage and stop fund diversion for purposes other than development works in rural areas. According to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, the state charges 3% RDF on the total value of grain (wheat in rabi and paddy in kharif seasons) procured from Punjab at minimum support price (MSP). Last year, the state government had assured the Centre to bring in amendments in the Act with a view to specifying the RDF usage. Also, the Centre ahead of the kharif procurement had asked the state to justify the usage of the RDF collected. In the provisional cost sheet mentioning taxes to be paid on paddy procurement that was received from the Centre last week, there is no mention of the RDF. In case of non-payment, the state government stands to lose ₹1,091 crore in the recent kharif season procurement that ended on November 30. “We have asked our government to amend the Act at the earliest,” said an official of the food and civil supplies department. The Centre has raised objection to the “vague provisions” and the rural development board’s discretion in deciding the use of funds. The board is headed by the chief minister. The governments in Punjab have funded its farm debt waiver scheme to the tune of ₹4,610 crore from the RDF, gave grants for development projects under sangat darshan programmes besides raising funds by pledging future accruals from the fund. The Centre, however, wants to put an end to the practice.
09-12-2021||Chandigarh||OYO Rooms penalised for denying occupancy to Ludhiana complainant||For denying occupancy in the rooms of a hotel booked by the complainant through the website of OYO Rooms, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Ludhiana, directed the latter to pay ₹20,000 compensation along with ₹5,000 litigation cost to the complainant. Kulwant Singh (52) of Guru Nanak Colony, Ludhiana, in his complaint against OYO Rooms, submitted that he booked four rooms for Mallital (Nainital) in Hotel Flatties, Mall Road, Mallital through the OYO website on June 07, 2017. He paid ₹42,200 for the booking from his bank account following which OYO confirmed his bookings through a WhatsApp message. The complainant and his friends were to check in on June 10, 2017 afternoon and check out on June 13, 2017, at 11 am. Kulwant alleged that when he reached the hotel with family and friends, the hotel staff flatly refused to acknowledge any booking. He alleged that after OYO failed to render any help, he along with his family and friends had to stay at another hotel after paying a much higher rate causing inconvenience and harassment. Kulwant contended that when he sought a refund, OYO refunded only ₹14,494 to him resulting in a deficiency of service and unfair trade practice on the part of the OYO Rooms. Meanwhile, the counsel for the respondent averred that the booking was only for four persons instead of four families or 16 persons as alleged by the complainant. The counsel added that even in the confirmation message, it was specifically mentioned that the booking of four rooms was for four numbers of guests. “Accordingly, the complainant was refused room accommodation for four families aggregating to 16 persons. Due to the peak season, there was no refund policy applicable, but as a goodwill gesture, the respondents refunded one-night tariff,” stated the counsel seeking dismissal of the complaint against OYO Rooms. However, the commission observed that it is totally unthinkable that there could be a restriction of stay of just one person in one room. The commission stated, “It is a matter of common knowledge and usual practice that one room is meant for the stay of a minimum of two persons. In the event of a stay of more than two persons is required, especially in the case of children accompanying the couple/parents, the hotel usually charges extra for an extra bed for the additional person/child staying in the room. Therefore, it is quite arduous to believe and hold that the four rooms were booked by the opposite parties for the stay of just four persons i.e. one person per room”. The commission further directed OYO Rooms to refund ₹25,506 to the complainant and to pay additional ₹20,000 compensation along with ₹5,000 litigation expenses. “It has to be held that there has been an acute deficiency of service as well as unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite parties which has resulted in inconvenience, embarrassment and humiliation to the complainant and his family and friends accompanying him,” read the order..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oyo-rooms-penalised-for-denying-occupancy-to-ludhiana-complainant-101638996084908.html
09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jai Ram Thakur doles out sops for Kangra’s Jaisinghpur assembly constituency||Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of developmental projects worth ₹144 crore in the Jaisinghpur assembly constituency of Kangra district on Wednesday. Addressing the public on the occasion, the chief minister announced to open division of jal shakti department, HRTC bus depot and block medical office. Besides, he announced the upgrade of many health and educational institutions. He said the Jal Jeevan Mission started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured that every household in the state gets drinking water. “With the concerted efforts of the state government, Himachal Pradesh has emerged as the first state in effective implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission,” said Jai Ram Thakur. He said the state government has opened a PWD division at Jaisinghpur to ensure proper maintenance and construction of roads and bridges in the area. He said that although the pandemic adversely affected the economy of the country and the state, the Himachal government ensured that the pace of development goes uninterrupted. The chief minister accused Congress leaders of politicising the sensitive issue of the Covid pandemic.

The last popular government in Jammu and Kashmir ceased on June 19, 2018, after the BJP pulled out of the PDP-BJP coalition regime. “Being members of the commission, we were neither invited nor shown any preliminary report,” Farooq said while addressing a day-long convention of the party’s OBC cell here. He said, “The people of Jammu and Kashmir cannot wait anymore as there is no alternative to the popular government. The people have lost their patience due to misgovernance of authoritarian and bureaucratic rule”. “There can be no substitute to the elections and going by the inordinate delay in delimitation report, it appears the government has no intention to hold polls in near future”, he added. The NC president also “rubbished” the claims of normalcy in the Valley, claimig Central leaders remained in a denial mode over Kashmiri Pandits fleeing Kashmir in the wake of recent civilian killings. He expressed concern and anguish over unprecedented media gauge and called for bringing legislation for ensuring complete freedom to the press with a caveat that nothing should be reported that can jeopardise communal harmony and brotherhood. “How can you expect a free press when the media houses are starved for advertisements in case they report against the interests of the government,” Dr Farooq Abdullah said, adding that the media should have the freedom to voice the concerns of the people freely and fearlessly. He said he has always encouraged free media because it is the essence of democracy. Referring to the resolutions passed by the OBC Cell with regard to, inter alia, restoration of special status and statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, Dr Farooq Abdullah said the people will fight peacefully and democratically for their rights with a sense of commitment. They will weather all the storms and shall remain steadfast in getting back what has been snatched from them, he added. Strongly advocating the genuine demand of reservation for the Other Backward Communities, Dr Abdullah said this is imperative for providing a level playing field to the marginalised segments of society to grow and prosper. The reservation for their youth is necessary as they too have the right to contribute towards the nation by becoming doctors, engineers and high-ranking officials like similarly placed reserved categories are availing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farooq-abdullah-slams-repeated-extensions-to-jammu-and-kashmir-delimitation-commission-101638995551294.html

You are part of our culture and existence. Believe me that you are always missed back home. Your exodus has hurt us too and we want you to return in a dignified manner,” said the former chief minister, who is currently in the national capital.Mehbooba urged the youth of the two communities to be at the forefront of initiatives of reconciliation underlining that youth alone can make any such effort sustainable to yield desired results.“The new generation from both Kashmiri Muslim and Kashmiri Pandit community has had no interaction and thus don’t know much about each other. The distances between us have only grown. If we want to make headway in community reconciliation, our youth have to interact and know each other better,” she said.Underlining how the pain and suffering of Kashmiri Pandit community have been weaponised by some political parties while doing nothing to help them and see their dignified return to the Valley, Mehbooba said a deliberate and concerted effort is being made through hateful television debates to further the wedge between the two communities.“A sinister design is in play to deepen the fault lines between the two communities in furtherance of communal and divisive agenda. They want us to hate each other. A deliberate attempt is being made to widen the gap and create an atmosphere of hate at the cost of community interests,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mehbooba-mufti-meets-kashmiri-pandits-in-new-delhi-tells-them-your-exodus-has-hurt-us-too-101638995488650.html

Also, healthcare facilities will be strengthened in the town and the 5-bedded hospital will be upgraded to 50 beds. A school and railway over-bridge will be built at Rama Mandi.” On delay in the disbursement of compensation to farmers whose cotton crop was damaged in the pink bollworm attack, Channi said a cabinet in a meeting on Thursday will give a formal approval for the same. The affected farmers, he said, will get the compensation within a week.He rubbished the charges of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leadership that he struck a deal with Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and create a drama of arresting their party leader Bikram Singh Majithia in a “weak” drug case.“The AAP owes a public explanation on why their national convener Arvind Kejriwal had tendered an apology to Majithia for having levelled allegations related to involvement in the drug trade. My government is committed to breaking cartels of Sukhbir Badal and Majithia,” he added.Meets Akal Takht jathedarDuring his scheduled night stay at Takht Damdama Sahib, Channi handed over a memorandum to acting Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to direct the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to immediately grant rights to all the TV and radio channels for direct telecast/broadcast of live gurbani kirtan from the Golden Temple in Amritsar.The Punjab government is ready to bear the entire expenditure of requisite infrastructure for the purpose, he said.“The SGPC has given exclusive rights to a particular channel with ownership by a single family in lieu of a paltry fee enjoying monopoly which is totally unfair and unjustified. The holy programmes should be made available to the sangat on various platforms,” said the CM.Ex-MLA Jassi stopped from going near CMInfighting in the local Congress came to the fore at the Rama Mandi rally on Wednesday when three-time MLA and senior Congress leader Harminder Singh Jassi was prevented by the party’s youth wing activists from going near chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on the stage. Jassi, a former minister, was not invited to address the rally and he was given a corner seat. Youth Congress leader Khushbaz Jatana, who unsuccessfully contested the last assembly from Talwandi Sabo, organised the event and even staked claim for party ticket from the segment in the CM’s presence. Earlier, Jassi had publically expressed his desire to contest from Talwandi Sabo, his home turf. Jassi is a relative of jailed Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and has a Z-plus cover as he survived a bomb attack at Maur in 2017. On Tuesday also, he nearly came to blows with Jatana’s aides when they objected to his presence at the rally venue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-develop-talwandi-sabo-as-religious-tourism-circuit-says-punjab-cm-channi-101638995065081.html

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||HPSC recruitment scam: Congress steps up attack on BJP-JJP government||The opposition Congress continued its attack on the BJP-JJP government in Haryana on the “slipshod” handling of the HPSC recruitment corruption case. Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday met the Haryana governor to demand investigation into the recruitment scam under the supervision of a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. “The government has made former HPSC deputy secretary Anil Nagar a scapegoat. An official of the deputy secretary rank cannot carry out such a recruitment scam on his own. The recruitment mafia has sold jobs like goods at a grocery store. But only the salesman of the shop has been caught while the owner has been let off. Justice demands that the HPSC chairman and members should be suspended,” Hooda said at a press briefing. Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and former Haryana minister Kiran Choudhry, at a separate briefing, said since the order to dismiss HCS officer Anil Nagar clearly mentioned that he as the HPSC deputy secretary was the custodian of all relevant records and there was no surety of the sanctity of the record kept by him, why didn’t the state government scrap all recruitments done during his tenure in the HPSC. Surjewala said the governor’s orders had further exposed the conspiratorial chinks and the modus operandi to bury this scam. “Despite the FIR and remand application of the Vigilance Bureau mentioning one Jasbir Singh Balhara of Safedot e-Solutions Private Limited as an accused, he was not at all questioned for recovering crucial pieces of evidence. The December 7 order by the Haryana governor regarding Anil Nagar’s dismissal has completely obliterated the role and participation of Jasbir, his employee Vijay Balhara and M/s Safedot E-Solutions Private Limited. Why this favour has been extended to protect the principal accused?’’ the Congress leader asked. Choudhry said it was quite surprising that the state government did not take further remand of three accused – Anil Nagar, Ashwani Sharma and Naveen – in the bribery case and did not file an appeal or revision against the court’s order rejecting the remand plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hpsc-recruitment-scam-congress-steps-up-attack-on-bjp-jjp-government-101638994825573.html
09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana rice millers up in arms against tender to private firm||Fortified Rice Kernels Manufacturers Association of Haryana on Wednesday said they will go on hunger strike if the government did not cancel its milling tenders to a private firm.At a meeting at a hotel in Karnal, the association members alleged that the government had changed the norms to allocate tenders to a private firm, causing huge loss to owners of rice mills of Haryana.They alleged that instead of promoting Haryana’s new micro-industries, the state government gave preference to industries of other states.Ram Niwas, president of the association, said the tender process was designed to allocate tenders to selected firms.“The government has given tenders to a firm which offered ₹59.64+GST per kg for fortified rice to the government, while the Haryana-based firms are even ready to give the same quality rice at ₹45-50 per kg,” said a member of the association, Ramesh Midha.He alleged that in the first advertisement, the government floated the tenders with a condition of ₹65-crore turnover of the interested firms and the newcomers were exempted, but the existing companies which installed machines of fortified rice were not exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-rice-millers-up-in-arms-against-tender-to-private-firm-101638994824065.html
09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Memorial dedicated to 58 farmers from Sangrur who died during stir against 3 laws inaugurated||A memorial dedicated to 58 farmers from Sangrur who died during the agitation against the Centre’s three agriculture laws in the district and on Delhi border was inaugurated at the district headquarters on Wednesday. Punjab public works department (PWD) minister Vijay Inder Singla inaugurated the memorial named ‘Yadgaar-e-Shaheedaan’ that was constructed by the department and the district administration. The minister, who was accompanied by the family members of some of the deceased farmers and deputy commissioner Ramvir, said, “Over 700 farmers, including 58 from Sangrur, sacrificed their lives while struggling against the black laws. We want to remember their sacrifice and build their memorial. As many as 26 families have received job letters and 27 cases are under verification.”The memorial has the farmers’ names written on it.“Punjabis have fought against injustice and participated in major movements in the past. This memorial is in the memory of the farmers who fought against the Narendra Modi-led regime at the Centre,” he added.Slamming the central government for informing Parliament that they had no data on farmers who died during the year-long protest, the PWD minister said, “The Congress government has identified all the deceased farmers and given them compensation. It is really shameful that a the government says that it has no data on deaths.”Taking potshots at the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), Singla said that communal politics of the right-wing organisations has only deepened the divisions in society.“The RSS has only ruptured the secular fabric of India’s pluralistic society. But the people of Punjab are wise enough to understand their destructive politics and give them a befitting reply for committing atrocities against the state,” he added.Amarinderpreet Kaur (24) of Ramnagar (Ghumand Singhwala) said that her father Rajinderpal Singh (51) died of pneumonia on March 18 while participating in the protest. “The loss cannot be filled but my brother got a job. I am proud of my father as he fought against the black laws,” Kaur added.

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Six mini islands set up in Sukhna Lake to draw more migratory birds||To attract more migratory birds to Sukhna Lake and provide them with space to feed, the UT forest and wildlife department has planned to set up six ‘mini islands’ in the waterbody. Five of these are already in place, while the sixth one will be developed within the next two to three days, said the department officials. Chandigarh chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai said, “With the water level of Sukhna being higher than previous years, the islands have been raised to make it easier for the birds to feed. Last year too, we had created an island this way for the birds, but the number has been increased to six this time.” The islands can be spotted when going to the lake from the regulator end and taking the forest path. After reaching the danger mark of 1,163 ft, the floodgates of Sukhna had to be opened four times in August and September, the last time being on September 30. On Tuesday, the water level of Sukhna was still at 1160.5 ft as compared to the usual 1155-1159 ft in winters. Joint director of the UT animal husbandry, Dr Kanwarjit Singh Bhangoo said, “When the water level is too high, it becomes difficult for the birds to feed as they have to dive deeper for food. Further, the islands also provide a space for birds to sit by the lake’s surface. However, any increase in the number of birds will be gradual and the number won’t shoot up in just a few days.” The number of migratory birds that have come to Sukhna Lake has been lower than normal till now, said Dalai, adding that the department was yet to carry out its own survey. The Chandigarh Bird Club (CBC) had carried out its annual census on November 14, where 335 waterfowls were found at Sukhna and Dhanas lakes. This number was the lowest since the group started conducting the census back in 2017 on the birth anniversary of Salim Ali, the ‘birdman of India’. The number of waterfowls identified has approximately cut into half in comparison with 717 such birds identified in 2017. The bird club will conduct another census in February to get a better picture of how many birds visited Sukhna Lake in the winters. Dalai also said that they were hopeful that more birds will flock to Sukhna Lake towards the end of December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-mini-islands-set-up-in-sukhna-lake-to-draw-more-migratory-birds-101638993445857.html

Meanwhile, efforts are on to trace and arrest the accused, who had slipped through rusted bars of the lockup in the wee hours of Tuesday.“Such kind of negligence in duty cannot be tolerated. The SHO (inspector Ashok Kumar) has been transferred and sent to the police lines, while the staff found negligent has been suspended,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. Those suspended are assistant sub-inspector Birmati, who was the night munshi, and constable Geeta, who was on the women desk.Sources said that the preliminary inquiry found the two women cops were missing from duty. However, a home guard volunteer, who was posted on guard duty at the entrance, was alert, they said. Meanwhile, inspector Juldan Singh, posted in the security wing, has been moved to the police station as the SHO.Escaped from rear doorDivesh Gupta, 27, was arrested on Monday for allegedly committing a string of thefts of costly bicycles in southern sectors. He was produced in court and remanded to one-day police custody, during which he was sent to the police station in Sector 39 for questioning.Sources privy to investigation said Gupta managed to slip through the rusted bars of the lockup past midnight. Two rods were bent and as the cement on the floor was loose, it facilitated his escape. Footage of the CCTV camera installed to keep an eye on the lockup is blurry, but footage of another camera shows the shadow of a person escaping from the rear door of the station, it is learnt.With both women cops missing from duty, and the home guard volunteer stationed at the entrance, Gupta managed to escape without being noticed, said a police official. There are about 10 cops deployed on duty at night. The escape came to light when an investigating officer returned to the police station along with a constable after visiting a night spot, and noticed that Gupta’s shoes were missing. On checking the lockup, they found him missing. Police teams are raiding various possible hideouts of the accused, but had failed to trace him till the filing of this report.

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC election: BJP, AAP enter hoarding war||The hoarding war has started in full earnest with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) taking advertisement sites all across the city ahead of the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections.Both parties have taken around 40 outdoor advertisement sites at markets, public toilets and bicycle docks on rent from the municipal corporation. Starting with banners, hoardings and glow display boards, both parties are next going to go for radio jingles to sway the city’s voters to their side. “The advertising strategy and style is the same as in Delhi, but we have localised the message for the city. Outdoor advertisement is one of the main ways to convey our message to the masses. Our focus is on highlighting the party’s successful Delhi model under Arvind Kejriwal and also to share with people our vision for Chandigarh,” said Chandigarh AAP convener Prem Garg.The advertisements have slogans such as “Chandigarh mein bhi Kejriwal... bhrashtachar-mukt corporation”. The advertisements also talk about the party’s “guarantees”, such as 20,000-litre free water every month.The BJP is planning to run its advertisement campaign in phases, and the message will evolve with every phase. Currently, the party’s slogan is “Kaho dil se BJP phir se”. “People of the city want the BJP to win the elections, that’s what we are highlighting now,” said Arun Sood, state president. In the next phase, the BJP’s advertisement will focus on its five-year achievements. The party has made a list of 50 successful projects and works that it claims it has done during its rule in the present MC House.“It will be followed by the party’s vision for the city. What is our plan and objectives for the city’s betterment in the next five years will be shared with the people through public advertisements,” said Sood. Closer to the polling day, the party will run an “appeal” campaign.AAP banners and hoardings having the photo of its supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and the party symbol, broom. The BJP has pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior local party leaders.Meanwhile, the Congress has decided against running a full-blown outdoor advertisement campaign. “The AAP does not have a grassroot connect in the city; so they have to advertise through these hoardings. The BJP has nothing to show for the past five years; so they also have to put up such advertisements. Congress will only depend on door-to-door connection with voters,” said state Congress president Subhash Chawla
09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drug trafficking ring busted in Canada, nine Punjab-origin gangsters arrested||Nine alleged gangsters of Indian-origin were among those arrested and charged by law enforcement and federal agencies in two Western provinces of Canada as they bust a major drug trafficking ring.The investigations that were part of the joint operation lasted 18 months and targeted a “violent drug trafficking network operating in Calgary and throughout Western Canada,” according to a statement issued by the Calgary Police Service (CPS).The CPS operation in Alberta resulted in the arrest of nine individuals while that undertaken by police in the province of Saskatchewan led to the nabbing of six more persons. Multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the operations, including CPS units, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Saskatoon Police Service, Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, Canada Border Services Agency, and Alberta Sheriffs.Investigators in Calgary alleged that the network “had been engaged in conflict with a rival drug trafficking network in the city, and that combined, the two groups were responsible for more than 20 violent events in Calgary that spanned just over a year, including a double homicide that occurred in April 2019”.The alleged gang members are mainly Indo-Canadians. Those arrested in Calgary were identified as Amandeep Saggu, 31, Ravneet Gill, 25, Prabhjyot Bhatti, 22, Jarmanjit Datewas, 23, Jaskaran Sidhu, 22, and Jasman Dhaliwal, 19. Also arrested in Calgary were Steven Whyte, 27, Safwan Riaz, 22 and Irkham Farooq, 23.Those arrested in Saskatoon included 26-year-old Japjee Minhas, 28-year-old Rajandeep Singh and 21-year-old Gurkeert Hehar. Also arrested were Ali Sarfraz, 26, Andrew Karamat, 23, and Rachel Kidd, 28.“From start to finish, this investigation required an incredible amount of coordination and patience from our investigators, who worked tirelessly to hold these individuals accountable. Though our work is not over, these charges are significant, and a major step towards protecting Calgarians put at risk by drug trafficking and the related violence that follows,” staff sergeant Greg Cooper of the CPS guns & gangs unit, said.Among the material recovered by CPS were six firearms, over 55,000 Canadian dollars worth of drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl pills and patches, crack cocaine, marijuana, phenacetin, benzodiazepine, and prescription pills, and over 300,000 in Canadian currency.Seizures in Saskatoon included 226,600 Canadian dollars, 4177.96 grams of cocaine, 166.99 grams of fentanyl, 67.06 grams of methamphetamine, 568.92 grams of marijuana and six vehicles.While Indo-Canadian gangs have a history going back decades of operating in the province of British Columbia, the results of the operation announced on Tuesday are the latest evidence of their area extending further into other provinces of Canada. Multiple arrests linked to drugs and violent gang activity were also reported in Ontario this year.

He added that the last time Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were seen in the state was in 2013 when Rahul was appointed as the party vice president.It is also for the first time that a national-level rally is happening outside Delhi.A second Congress leader said the state’s ministers, legislators and party leaders have been told to ensure the presence of a large number of people at the venue, Vidhyadhar Nagar Stadium, at what he said, will be a mega rally against inflation in Jaipur. AICC general secretary Ajay Maken and state party chief Govind Singh Dotasara who reviewed the preparations with state ministers a day earlier held another review meeting with state Congress leaders to prep for the rally.Ajay Maken told party workers and leaders to ensure that people who join the rally have received both Covid vaccine doses and tested negative to the coronavirus disease within 72 hours of the rally.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has claimed that the rally will mark the beginning of the NDA’s downfall and a win for the Congress in Rajasthan’s next assembly elections.Maken’s emphasis on vaccination and negative test for people who attend the rally is aimed at ensuring that the gathering of tens of thousands of people does not lead to the spread of Covid-19 infection.The Rajasthan High Court has rejected a petition that sought to stop the rally on the ground that it will pose a severe hazard but the court ruled that there was no law to ban such a gathering after restrictions were eased.The number of active Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan on Wednesday reached 236, with a maximum of 119 in Jaipur, followed by 22 in Bikaner, 18 in Ajmer, and 13 in Alwar.The call to put off the Congress rally received some support from former Jaipur mayor Jyoti Khandelwal who sent a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, suggesting that the party postpone the event in view of the increasing Covid-19 cases and in the remembrance of the chief of defence staff Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 other personnel of the armed forces.She said the Congress should treat public health as a priority and put off the rally, and use social media to power the party’s pitch against the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. Khandelwal, who was the party’s Lok Sabha candidate from Jaipur, said the party should postpone programmes for seven days as part of respect to the military personnel who died in the chopper crash.

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Will announce CM candidate in Punjab before Cong does: Sisodia||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will announce its chief ministerial candidate for Punjab before the Congress does, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday. In an interview to HT, Sisodia said the “freebies” announced by AAP supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in poll-bound Punjab would be achieved by ensuring efficient tax collection and ending corruption in the state. He also said Congress’ chief minister in Punjab Charanjit Singh Channi is only trying to “imitate” Kejriwal for his simplicity and honesty to achieve a greater “public appeal”, and alleged his involvement in illegal sand mining in his own constituency Chamkaur Sahib. Channi, however, has dismissed the AAP’s allegations as a “bundle of lies”.When asked about who will be AAP’s CM face in Punjab, Sisodia said, “We will announce, but so far even the Congress has not announced whether Channi will be their CM candidate or will it be someone else. But, let me assure you that AAP will announce its CM candidate for Punjab before the Congress does.” Kejriwal had in June announced that AAP’s chief ministerial candidate for Punjab will be from the Sikh community.In the recently concluded HT Leadership Summit, Channi repeated that Kejriwal was a “kala angrez” (dark-complexioned Englishman) as Kejriwal does not belong to Punjab and does not know anything about the issues in the northern state. Kejriwal’s AAP is the main opposition party in the Punjab assembly and is hoping to better its performance in the February-March assembly elections in the state. “People in Punjab don’t believe in Kejriwal,” Channi said at the HTLS on December 4. To this, Sisodia responded that it is not a hidden fact that Kejriwal is the chief minister of Delhi. “But if the people of Punjab want to adopt the politics and development model of Kejriwal and if they are fed up with the politics of the Congress, then what problem does Channi ji have in it? The people of Punjab want an honest government like the Kejriwal government in Delhi. It is known by now that Channi ji is having a problem with this because, otherwise, how will the sand mafia operate in that state. He will lose all the money,” Sisodia said. The senior AAP leader said the party’s internal survey suggests that AAP will have a comfortable victory in Punjab. “The farm laws being repealed exposed the secret alliance of the Congress and the BJP in Punjab. If at all, the people of Punjab are feeling betrayed because they trusted the Congress and their former CM Captain Amarinder Singh, who allied with the BJP instead and exposed himself. Captain had his personal agenda and played a dual role of telling one thing to the farmers and siding with the BJP-led Centre on the other hand. Ultimately, the Congress cheated and befooled the people of Punjab for five years. The same had happened with the Akali-BJP government prior to this and now I feel the Congress will have the same fate in Punjab. People will overthrow them,” Sisodia said. The AAP has promised 300 units of free electricity per month for each household in Punjab if it comes to power. It has also promised that 24/7 power in Punjab will be provided and pending electricity bills will be waived. On November 22, Kejriwal announced that all women above 18 years of age in Punjab will be given ₹1,000 if his party comes to power in the assembly elections schedule. On December 3, Kejriwal promised free and quality education in government schools to those born in Punjab and announced to give an ex-gratia of ₹1 crore to families of the soldiers or police jawans who die in line of duty if AAP comes to power in the state. When asked about how the AAP plans to roll out these schemes if voted to power, Sisodia said the party would follow the Delhi model. “The AAP’s promise is simple - the money of the people of Punjab should be used for and on the people of the state. The same model which the Kejriwal government has successfully implemented and showcased in Delhi. In Punjab, so far, be it the Congress or the BJP-Akali, these parties have been only siphoning off people’s taxes in some way or the other. Corruption is so rampant. The AAP when it comes to power will just ensure zero tolerance to corruption, timely tax collection and all this money will be rightfully deposited in the government’s kitty and it will be used for Punjab’s development only. This is how we changed Delhi’s governance and this is what we will do in Punjab too,” he said. Sisodia hinted that if voted to power, the AAP government in Punjab will also simplify the state’s tax structure. “At present, 65% of the traders’ time in Punjab is wasted in government compliances. All this needs to change, like we simplified Delhi’s tax structure when we came to power. Education for all and economic growth will remain our main motto,” he said.

He may contest Punjab assembly elections from Batala constituency as the SAD has not declared its candidate from this segment and its sitting MLA Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal has been shifted to the nearby Fatehgarh Churian seat.Chhotepur was appointed as state convener of the AAP by Arvind Kejriwal. He unsuccessfully contested 2014 Lok Sabha polls on the AAP ticket from Gurdaspur seat.Levelling corruption charges, Kejriwal removed Chhotepur as the Punjab convener in August 2016. After being sacked, Chhotepur floated his own party Aapna Punjab Party (APP) few weeks before the 2017 Punjab assembly elections. His party drew a lukewarm response. Prior to this, Chhotepur remained Punjab minister during the Surjit Singh Barnala-led Akali government.

09-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab registers second highest GST collection since rollout of central tax regime||The Punjab government on Wednesday said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) cash collection in November 2021 grew by 32% to ₹1,845 crore -- the second highest since the central tax regime came into force. An official spokesperson said the collection is second only to that in April 2021, but also the growth rate experienced is third highest in the country across the major states after Odisha and Kerala. The spokesperson said the GST revenue receipts for Punjab in November stood at ₹1,377.77 crore as against ₹1,067 crore for the corresponding period of previous year i.e. November 2020, registering a strong growth of 29%. This is in line with the trend in economic recovery. He said that the GST revenue up to November has witnessed a high growth of nearly 54% as compared to corresponding period last year. The government claimed the high growth in GST revenue can be attributed to compliance improvement on account of both policy and administrative measures undertaken by the state government as well as the strict enforcement measures adopted in coordination with the Central tax enforcement agencies. The deployment of effective data analysis based on machine learning and intelligent on-road detention has played an important role in detections of large tax evasion cases relating to fake invoices and enhanced compliance. The tax collection from VAT and CST during November 2021 is ₹949.44 crore and ₹20.19 crore, respectively. As compared to the same period last year, VAT and CST revenue collection have displayed respective growth of 28.73% and 11.49% this year. The robust growth in VAT revenue is predominantly attributable to increase in average tax rate in October, 2021 over October, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-registers-second-highest-gst-collection-since-rollout-of-central-tax-regime-101638991283190.html

09-12-2021||Noida||Authority starts construction work on new office in Greater Noida West||Heeding the numerous pleas of residents, the Greater Noida authority on Tuesday started the construction work on a new administrative office that will be dedicated to citizens of newly built group housing complexes in Greater Noida West (earlier known as Noida Extension).Chief executive officer Narendra Bhooshan and additional chief executive officer Deep Chand laid the foundation stone for the new office building in Sector Tech Zone-IV area. The new office will be built within six months, at a budget of ₹2.5 crore on a 1,200 square metre area, and will have the offices of CEO, ACEO and other supporting staff. The CEO will be present at this office two days a week and at the main office in Knowledge Park-IV for the remaining days.This new office will cater to the at least 30 lakh strong population in times to come as Greater Noida West is home to at least 4 lakh housing units, spread over an area of around 5,000 hectares. It is fast emerging as a destination for middle-class homebuyers, as per realty experts and builder groups. Around 20% of units are occupied and residents of these units have been demanding a dedicated office nearby as the main office of the authority in Knowledge Park-IV is around 20km from their area, making it rather difficult for citizens to approach the authority with civic or property related issues.“This office will immensely benefit residents of Greater Noida West as they do not need to travel to the main office. They may get their issues and grievances resolved at the new office more conveniently,” said Chand.The Greater Noida authority, in July this year, opened an additional administrative office at a government school, Balak Inter College, in Greater Noida West for the ease of residents and property buyers, but he need was felt for a permanent office.The UP government, in 1992, established Greater Noida on 38,000 hectares of agricultural land and divided it into two parts — Greater Noida West and Greater Noida East. The main administrative office, in Knowledge Park-IV, is located in Greater Noida East. Residents and property owners of Greater Noida West have been demanding an office in their area as well.“We have been demanding a separate office in Greater Noida West as travelling to the main office, even for small civic issues, is difficult for citizens. Once the new office comes up, we can easily meet officials and get our issues resolved,” said Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension flat owners welfare associations.
09-12-2021||Noida||Authority plans city bus service for Greater Noida||The Greater Noida authority on Wednesday said it has decided to start a city bus service for the convenience of commuters, who otherwise have to depend on private vehicles for travelling in the industrial town inthe absence of adequate public transport system.The authority wants some of the buses travelling from Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida towards Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Agra to travel via Greater Noida. Apart from this, the authority also wants some dedicated buses for the industrial town to provide last mile connectivity to commuters travelling within the city, said officials. CEO of Greater Noida authority Narendra Bhooshan and Navdeep Rainwa, managing director of Uttar Pradesh State Roadways Transport Corporation (UPSRTC), discussed the project at the main office of the authority in Sector Knowledge Park-IV on Wednesday. “We will submit a proposal to the authority to take this project forward so that the service benefits daily commuters,” said Rainwa.Spread on 38,000 hectares of land, Greater Noida has at least 8,000 factories, around 500 housing complexes, schools, hospitals, education hub, the collectorate and other government offices. The 29.7km Aqua Line of the Metro corridor enters the city from Noida’s Sector 144 and provides connectivity to Greater Noida’s Sector KP-II, Alpha-1, KP-IV and Delta 1 only. A large part of the city is yet to be connected by the Metro corridor, leaving daily commuters on the mercy of erratic auto-rickshaw drivers or other private players for last mile connectivity. “There are 124 villages in Greater Noida, where we intend to make the city bus service available. We want the bus service to cover all government offices, residential and industrial areas so that all types of commuters can use the service,” said Bhooshan. UPSRTC officials informed the authority that the ticket collection from passengers may not be adequate to run such a service and that it needs proper funding from the state government. The authority agreed to meet the shortfall in running the service because it wants the city to have the facility, said officials. However, the authority has not fixed a deadline by when it can make the city bus service available to the general public. “The authority and the state government have been promising the city bus service for a long time but nothing has happened on the ground. In the absence of public transport service in the city, we have to either depend on private auto-rickshaws or taxies, which are not economically viable for everyone. Let’s hope the authority is serious in starting the service,” said Rohit Chauhan, a resident of sector 1, Greater Noida West.
09-12-2021||Mumbai||‘No elections if OBC quota absent’||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to approach the Supreme Court (SC) today with an affidavit requesting it to allow polling on all seats in local bodies scheduled for December 21 or to postpone it completely, two days after the apex court stayed elections to seats reserved for candidates from Other Backward Class (OBC) communities. The decision was taken during the state cabinet’s weekly meeting held on Wednesday. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also a senior OBC leader has been entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the legal battle in the top court. “The [affidavit] will be submitted on Thursday. We are requesting the court to either allow us hold the election under quota with the condition of submitting the certificates after a few months or postpone all the polls. When other states are allowed to hold elections under a similar Ordinance, why has an exception been made only for Maharashtra? We expect the respite during next hearing on Monday. We will compile the empirical data in due course,” OBC welfare department minister Vijay Wadettiwar said. “The affidavit will be filed on Thursday. We are quoting a court order which says the elections cannot be held in a piecemeal manner. It leads to the unrest among communities. We are also requesting the top court to ask the Centre to give us Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data to ascertain quota. We expect a decision on it next week. We have consulted senior counsels like Mukul Rohatagi and Kapil Sibal. We are doing our level best to restore the quota,” Bhujbal said. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ashish Shelar on Wednesday asked the State Election Commission (SEC) to not go ahead with polls in local bodies scheduled later this month, saying conducting them will amount to doing injustice to OBCs. “The election (in local bodies) is not going to be conducted on some seats because the OBC data is not available. Holding elections on remaining seats by excluding some would be an injustice to the OBC community. Hence we requested the commissioner to put the elections on hold till this issue is resolved,” he said. The SEC on Tuesday stayed the polls to be conducted from OBC constituencies following the SC order. The development could snowball into a major political controversy as the upcoming local body elections are being seen as a test for the MVA government. A number of local body elections will take place on December 21, including in 104 district council seats and 210 panchayat samiti seats in Bhandara and Gondia, 1,802 seats in 106 nagar panchayats, and four seats in different municipal corporations across the state. Bypolls in 7000 seats in 4,500 gram panchayats across the state are also slated for that day. In all, at least 413 local body seats reserved for OBC candidates will be affected on that day’s polling. The state will also see local body polls between February and December 2022, including in 23 municipal corporations, 27 district councils, 298 panchayat samitis, 320 nagar panchayats and nagar councils. On March 4, the apex court struck down a legal provision that permitted 27% reservation in local body polls to OBC candidates on grounds that it breached the 50% ceiling on reservations when taken together with Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) quotas. It also directed the state to collect empirical evidence to fix the extent of OBC reservation. On Monday, the SC struck down the Ordinance passed by the state in September to ensure that the 50% cap isn’t breached. The apex court said on December 6 that the state should have conducted the survey first before passing the Ordinance. On Tuesday, HT reported that the state is going to amend the terms of reference (TOR) of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC) formed on June 29 with the mandate to conduct household surveys to collect data on OBC communities. MSBCC officials said the state was yet to take a decision on the state-wide census proposed by them, and has instead proposed a change in the original TOR, seeking to limit the exercise to a sample survey. Experts said that this could end up being a “quick-fix solution” instead of the “rigorous empirical data” of the socio-economic backwardness of the OBC communities sought by the apex court. “In its order on Monday, the SC stayed the Ordinance for the state government’s failure to comply with the triple test asked by the court while giving ruling in K Krishnamurthy case on March 4. The state has constituted the MSBCC but failed to kick start the work of collection of the data. It has not even been able to finalise its terms of reference (ToR) or allocate adequate funding. The court is also against postponement of the elections for the want of empirical data. Moving court with the request for respite is just a political move,” an official from OBC welfare department said. The officer said that the political reservations given to OBCs since 1994 was disproportionate in many local bodies are the quota was more than their actual population. He said that the SC has ordered the survey to avoid depriving eligible backward class citizens from reservation. The state is expected to engage senior counsels to represent it during the next hearing on December 13. “I do not think political reservation will be restored without empirical data. The SC has made it very clear and to my opinion the sample survey to collect such data or for that matter even caste based survey should be done. Various commissions including Mandal commission had recommended collection of such data. It helps in weeding out the caste-based inequality in the society and also throws light on the current status of the population. It is possible that a section of established politicians from reserved categories may oppose such attempt as there is fear that the progressive sections of the reserved category would lose the reservation if fresh surveys are conducted,” Balkrishna Renke, former chairman of the National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic and Semi Nomadic Tribes, said. “The only option before the state government is to submit fair empirical data based on the ground realities and seek the restoration of the quashed reservation for the OBCs. Holding the elections is the responsibility of the state, but court will not allow it if the fundamental principal of the reservation is breached,” legal expert Aseem Sarode said. “The law or even the Ordinance should be in conformity with the Constitution. The Ordinance does not fulfil this fundamental obligation and thus the court is unlikely to be reconsider its order,” constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat said.

It took the NCRTC about four months to erect and roll the steel structure, weighing about 850 tonnes, from one side to the other side without disturbing the rail traffic, the officials said. “The problem cropped up as we found that no pillars could be erected on the railway land due to presence of railway tracks. To overcome this, we completely bypassed the pillar structures and decided to install the framed streel structure to join the Sahibabad and city side of the RRTS project,” said an officer from NCRTC. The average distance between the two pillars of the ongoing RRTS project is about 34 metres, the officials said, adding that it would have required construction of two pillars to connect the two sides of the priority section. “After the successful installation of the steel structure, we will now install one more similar structure which will be about 150 metres long and likely to weigh twice than this structure. This needs to be installed as the RRTS alignment has to move over one flyover and the Metro tracks near New Bus Adda Metro station,” said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer of NCRTC. The 82km RRTS project is proposed to connect Delhi with Meerut via Ghaziabad with the help of high-speed trains. Of the 82km, a 17km stretch from Sahibabad to Duhai is getting developed in Ghaziabad. This stretch is likely to commence operations by March 2023, while the entire route is likely to get operational in 2025. The project is pegged at a cost of ₹30,274 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ncrtc-erects-73m-pillarless-steel-structure-on-priority-section-of-rrts-project-in-ghaziabad-101638990384769.html
09-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad traffic police start issuing e-challans for violations on expressways||Officials from the Ghaziabad traffic police said on Wednesday that they have started receiving data from the systems installed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) and the Eastern Peripheral Expressway for detecting traffic violations and have started issuing e-challans to those violating traffic rules on the expressways. The systems have paved the way for real-time tracking of traffic violations on the two expressways. Traffic officials said of the daily traffic violations detected during the trail run of the systems, about 90% were related to overspeeding with erring vehicles clocking a speed up to 130-140kmph and sometimes even more on both the expressways. The speed limit for cars/jeeps and other light vehicles is 100kmph while that for commercial vehicles is 80kmph in the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh. “In the past couple of months, there were some issues with linking the data recorded in the systems with the control rooms, which have now been resolved. Now, the e-challans will be generated instantly as soon as the violations are detected by the systems installed by NHAI. In November, we issued about 22,302 challans and another 3,100 during the first seven days of December for over speeding,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). “The e-challans will now be issued daily as the data of violations is being streamlined. Apart from this, we are continuing to take action against wrong side driving, driving without safety gears, not driving in lanes and on-road parking,” he added . The NHAI has covered the 19.8km stretch of phase 2 from UP-Gate to Dasna and the 32km stretch from Dasna to Meerut with CCTV cameras and automatic number plate readers (ANPRs), which will help detect violations and the registration number of erring vehicles. “The ANPRs have been installed at the six entry/exit points on the DME while CCTV cameras have been put in place at every kilometre of the stretch. We are sharing regular data of the violations on the expressways with the Ghaziabad traffic police,” said Arvind Kumar, project director of NHAI. Officials familiar with the working of the systems said the facilities can detect the registration number of the vehicles with 99% accuracy. About 5% of the vehicles were allegedly found violating traffic norms during the trial run of the systems on the DME. For the purpose of controlling the systems that will record traffic violations, the NHAI has come up with a control room each in phase 1, 2 and 4 of the DME while a master control room has been set up at Dasna in Ghaziabad. Currently, there is an estimated movement of about 120,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day on DME’s phase 1 from Akshardham in Delhi to UP-Gate while phase 2 has an estimated traffic of about 60,000 PCUs, besides about 40,000 PCU on phase 4. There are about 40,000 PCUs plying on the EPE per day.

09-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad sets up dedicated wards in two hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients||The district health department has dedicated a ward each with 20 beds for Covid-19 patients at the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital and Santosh Medical College in case a patient infected with the viral infection needs immediate admission. The Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital worked as a dedicated Covid facility in the L-2 category during the first and second waves of the Covid-19 pandemic while the Santosh Medical College was acquired by the government as a dedicated L-3 category facility. According to the Uttar Pradesh government’s three-tier setup, hospitals falling in the L-1 category deal with Covid patients having mild symptoms; those in the L-2 category treat patients with moderate symptoms while facilities falling under the L-3 category are dedicated to treatment of critical patients. “In line with our preparedness against any increase in Covid-19 cases, we have dedicated a ward each at Sanjay Nagar hospital and Santosh Medical College with 20 beds to treat Covid-19 patients. The two hospitals have been told to keep the wards ready along with the requisite equipment and manpower. The wards have been prepared so that any Covid patient requiring admission can be shifted to any of the two facilities depending on his/her condition,” said chief medical officer Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar. During the second wave of the pandemic, the district worked with about 50 hospitals, which were classified as dedicated Covid hospitals, to treat patients infected with the viral disease. According to official figures, the district had 3,292 patients against the availability of 3,469 beds at the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. “Communication has been passed on to the different hospitals to be ready to deal with a surge in Covid-19 cases. Hospitals, which played a crucial part during the first and the second waves, have been asked to keep the infrastructure and resources ready for treatment of Covid-19 cases in 24 to 72 hours, if the need arises. We will rope in hospitals for Covid treatment as per requirement,” said the chief medical officer. Eleven new oxygen plants were installed in different government healthcare facilities on the directions of the state government after the second wave. “There was a high demand for oxygen during the second wave. Our hospital has got two new oxygen plants with a capacity of 150 litres per minute (LPM) and another having 500 LPM capacity. We already have one more plant with a capacity of 150 LPM. So, our entire hospital is now equipped with centralised oxygen supply,”said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital. The hospital mostly depended on oxygen cylinders during the second wave of the pandemic. “On directions of the chief medical officer, we have come up with a Covid ward having 20 beds. Dedicated manpower and resources have also been assigned. Doctors too have been assigned 24-hour duty,” said Teotia. According to the state control room figures, currently there are nine active cases in the district. Till Wednesday, the overall Covid tally in the district stood at 55,689, which include 461 deaths.

The Uttarakhand government has approved the proposal of the CTR administration to refund the booking amount to tourists. As soon as the order is received by CTR, the booking amount will be refunded. Rahul (who goes by his first name), director CTR said, “Tourists who had made bookings to visit Corbett and couldn’t come due to the Covid-19 pandemic have a right to get their money back. So, we had sent a proposal to the state government for refunding their money. This proposal has been approved by the government.” He said around ₹1 crore will be refunded to the tourists. “We will start the process after getting the order from the government. The money will be transferred to the accounts of the tourists,” he said “With this process, along with CTR, tourists will also have confidence and faith in the Uttarakhand government as a whole,” he added According to officials, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, CTR was closed for tourists under the guidelines of the Centre. From May 1, CTR remained closed for day visits and overnight stays. Night stay in Bijrani, Jhirna, Dhela, Girija zones started on October 15 and night stay in Dhikuli zone started from November 15, while Bijrani Zone opened for day visits from October 15. Jhirna and Dhela tourism zones were opened for day visits from June 29. The Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is spread across 1,288 square km, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the state. The gates of Corbett open on November 15 every year for six months till mid-June. Corbett witnesses a footfall of around 300,000 tourists every year. There are 231 tigers inside CTR and 266 are using the reserve according to the latest report on tigers. This is the highest number of tigers across 50 tiger reserves in India. Corbett National Park remains closed every year from June 15 in the wake of the monsoon season. Forest roads get washed away or flooded in the rainy season and pose a danger to human life therefore it remains closed till October 15. This year it was closed from May 1 due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.

09-12-2021||Delhi||Indoor air pollution 20 times limit prescribed by WHO, shows study||New Delhi: The indoor air pollution levels in Delhi homes is more than 20 times the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, a study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC India) has shown.The study also highlighted that the levels of PM 2.5 (particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) was significantly higher than the levels reported by the nearest outdoor government monitors.The study released on Wednesday also showed that while high-income households were 13 times more likely to own air purifiers as compared to low-income households, its impact on indoor air pollution was only around 10%.The study further noted an 8.6% decline in indoor PM2.5 levels in homes with pollution monitors (usually with air purifiers), and said that such residents were likely to make “modest changes in inexpensive defensive practices and ventilation behaviours.”“In Delhi, the bottom line is, whether someone is rich or poor, no one gets to breathe clean air,” said Kenneth Lee, the lead author of the study.“It is a complex vicious cycle. When you do not know about the pollution levels inside your homes, you do not worry about it, and hence you are less likely to take corrective actions. Only with increased awareness, demand for clean air may gain momentum,” he added.The study surveyed thousands of Delhi households from varying socioeconomic strata between 2018 and 2020. and found that indoor PM2.5 levels tend to spike in the mornings and evenings when households were most likely to be cooking.Experts said that while there is growing awareness among people on the harmful impacts of outdoor pollution, people are still unaware about how the air inside their homes, offices and schools can also be highly polluted.“We need to create awareness among people. While there are a lot of studies about outdoor pollution and how severe it can be for your health, more studies are needed to assess the levels of indoor pollution and how they can impact people. At least you can gear yourself with masks outdoors but inside your homes, you tend to drop your guard,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-indoor-pollution-in-delhi-homes-finds-chicago-university-study-101638989606306.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Riots: Court frames attempt to murder charge against man who pointed gun at cop||A Delhi court has framed charges against Shahrukh Pathan, the man who allegedly pointed a gun at a policeman during the north-east Delhi riots in February 2020, saying the present case was not an “ordinary one”.Photographs of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya were widely circulated on social media soon after the incident on February 24. He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in Tihar jail.On Tuesday, additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat charged Pathan with attempt to murder, assault, rioting, unlawful assembly, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act. The court also observed that it hadn’t witnessed riots of this nature since the deadly anti-Sikh riots of 1984.The court said from the statement of the complainant Dahiya, it is quite apparent that Pathan led a group of rioters to unlawfully assembly on the 66 Foot Road on February 24, 2020, at around 2pm and, fully armed with deadly weapons, committed rioting, attempt on the life of Dahiya, obstructed a public servant in discharge of his public functions and assaulted or used criminal force on a public servant to deter the public servant from discharge of duty.The judge said the entire incident was also captured on camera by a journalist and hence not only is there a statement from the complainant, but there also exists additional electronic evidence in the form of video footage to nail the conduct of the accused. The footage was found to be correct, continuous and un-tampered with, the court said.The court noted that there was a prohibitory order under Section 144 CrPC, issued by the deputy commissioner of police (north-east) and there was a violation also of Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC.It said even though no injury was caused to Dahiya, that does not mean that attempt to murder is not made out.It depends on the facts of the case and, in the present case, injury is not material at all.“..even the video shows firing by accused Shahrukh Pathan from a pistol in daylight with an aim to kill HC Deepak Dahiya. This is enough for framing the charge against Pathan under Section 307 IPC,” the court said.The court also framed charges against Shamim and Abdul Shehzad, both co-accused, for being part of a mob, allegedly led by Pathan, saying they were rioting at the time of the gunpointing incident. It noted that both the accused have been identified through CCTV footage and by witnesses.The court also charged another accused, Ishtiyak Malik, saying even if there was no footage of him rioting, he cannot be absolved of the crime.The judge said Malik was in constant touch with Pathan, as evidenced by Malik’s call records, and Malik’s mobile phone location was the same as that of Pathan at the time of the incident.“This factum of the location or the presence of the accused Ishtiyak Malik @ Guddu at the place of riots where weapons are being brandished, and firing done at head constable Deepak Dahiya and others by accused Shahrukh Pathan with whom he was in continuous touch and shared the location of riots, is enough for framing charges against him, “ the court said.Additionally, the bench charged one Kaleem Ahmed for harbouring Pathan in Kairana, Uttar Pradesh, where he was hiding, following the incident.Pathan, through his counsel, had earlier argued that he only intended to scare the policeman and not kill him.Communal clashes broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020 after a tense standoff between supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and its critics went out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.
09-12-2021||Noida||Noida sees ‘moderate’ air, a first since Diwali a month ago||A day after favourable meteorological conditions helped disperse accumulated pollutants and improve the air quality of Greater Noida, the pollution levels in Noida also dropped on Wednesday, helping the city register the first “moderate” air quality day in 43 days. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s 4pm bulletin, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida was 186, in the “moderate category of the AQI scale. The last time Noida residents experienced “moderate” air quality was on October 26, before Diwali (November 4). Since October 26, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida had gone from bad to worse with levels ranging from “poor” to “severe” category, making it one of the most polluted cities on November 12 and 13 when AQI levels touched 488 and 464, respectively, in the severe category. Wednesday was the first day, post-Diwali, when Noida’s AQI improved to the “moderate” category. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered ”good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 ”moderate”, 201 and 300 ”poor”, 301 and 400 ”very poor”, and 401 and 500 ”severe”. “The wind speed has picked up during past two days and it has led to significant reduction in air pollution with increased dispersion of pollutants. However, the AQI on Tuesday and Wednesday were calculated on the basis of readings taken from only three monitoring stations. The fourth station, in Sector 62, is of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and it developed technical issues. The repair work is ongoing while its recalibration was done last week,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UP pollution control board, Noida. The monitoring station in Sector 62 has also been giving high pollution readings for past two weeks while the UPPCB officials during inspections found no major polluting sources nearby. However, officials of the IMD said the reduction in pollution is due to winds picking up speed to reach between 10-15kmph during past two days. “The wind speed and clear weather has resulted in dispersal and improvement in air quality. It is likely that the clear conditions will prevail for next two or three days after which the wind speed may reduce. For the next couple of days, there is no indication of foggy conditions as such,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. According to the CPCB bulletin on Wednesday, Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 154, in the “moderate” category, while Ghaziabad remained in the “poor” category with an AQI value of 229. “The AQI of Ghaziabad city is still ”poor” and that could be due to high volume of road traffic and other local factors. However, the conditions have improved much in the past one week. The Commission for Air Quality Management has directed the closure of industrial units that have not shifted to PNG or other clean fuel. We have about 421 such units and they will remain shut till December 12 as directed,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. “Once such units shut, the AQI is likely to improve further though our teams are regularly conducting inspections, including night inspections. The reduction in pollution levels has been a result of better wind speed,” he said. A forecast by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said the improvement in air quality was higher than expected. “For the next four days, from December 8 to 11, winds are likely to be moderate while increasing ventilation of pollutants. Minimum temperatures are likely to drop gradually leading to more stable boundary layer during nighttime that helps accumulation of pollutants,” the Safar forecast said. It added that for next four days, the air quality is likely to improve but within the “moderate” or lower end of “poor” category.

Communal slogans and provocative speeches are being made against Muslims, and the authorities are taking no action,” said Mohammad Adeeb, former Rajya MP and a member of Gurgaon Muslim Council, at a press conference organised by the two groups at the Constitution Club in New Delhi.The district administration said efforts were on resolve the sensitive issue, and the city police added that they were providing adequate security at all designated namaz sites.The presser was also attended by political and social activists such as Prof Apoorvanand and Dr Syeda Saiyidain Hameed.Hindu right wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram since 2018. The same year, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, in November this year, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing outfits continued to protest and disrupt prayers. The Muslims, however, have maintained that they were forced to use public spaces since there were not enough mosques in the city.On Wednesday, members of the two Muslim groups who have been raising the issue with the administration also demanded action against members of the Hindu groups against whom the Gurugram police were given complaints on November 30 for alleged provocative communal speeches.“The BJP backed by RSS is bent upon reducing the minorities to second-grade citizens and they plan to achieve this agenda through polarisation. The disruption in namaz is being carried out by the same 20 to 30 people but they are not being taken into preventive custody,” said Apoorvanand, a political commentator.The Haryana BJP, however, rejected the charge, saying the state government and its bodies were taking action as per the law, and added that some people were trying to politicise the issue.“The activities of some people show their intention to politicise this issue. They are creating a law and order situation and disharmony in the society at large,” said Raman Malik, Haryana BJP spokesperson.Mufti Saleem Qasmi, a Gurugram-based religious leader, said baseless allegations were being levelled by the right-wing groups such as by offering namaz at public spaces the Muslims were waging a land jihad, and that those performing prayers were Rohingya, Bangladeshis and not local residents. “There are only 13 mosques in the city, and several people don’t get space to perform namaz. We have approached the authorities to allocate land for establishing religious sites, but nothing has happened,” he said.Altaf Ahmad of the Gurgaon Muslim Council said the authorities should provide safety at the designated namaz sites and end the harassment by Hindu groups. “The right to perform namaz (freedom to practice one’s religion) is provided by the Constitution. The population of Muslims in the city is around five lakh, but there are only 13 small mosques. The government must provide us sites for building new mosques, and ensure safety at designated sites and stop this targeted harassment” Ahmad said.Dr Syeda Hameed, a former member of Planning Commission, said, “Efforts must be made to stop communal polarisation and bring people together for peaceful coexistence.”The Gurugram police said they have been providing adequate security at all designated sites to ensure safety of the worshippers and maintenance of law and order. “Police personnel are deployed in adequate strength at all designated sites as per directions of the administration. No untoward incident has been allowed to happen till date, and in future too nobody will be allowed to disturb law and order in the city,” Subash Boken, Gurugram police spokesperson, said.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said all steps were being taken to resolve the “sensitive” issue. “Concerns of all stakeholders will be taken into consideration and the issue will be resolved. No one will be allowed to disturb the communal harmony and take law and order into their hands,” he said.Reacting to the claims about availability of land for mosques, Malik said development agencies hold regular auctions of land for religious sites, and everyone is free to participate in it. “The waqf board too has acres of land in Gurugram district, which may be used for establishing mosques. Details of these properties are available in the public domain,” the BJP leader said.He added that roads and sites “under dispute” are not conducive for offering namaz, according to people aware of Islamic practices. “We will request everybody not to act beyond the ambit of the Constitution and the law of the land. Religion and it’s practice is meant to attain peace, not to the contrary,” said Malik.Rajiv Mittal, spokesperson, Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, which is campaigning against the Friday namaz said that they were not against the practise of namaz, but only wanted it to be performed inside mosques and religious places. “Followers of no religion are allowed to pray in public places. I want to ask why in Muslim countries namaz is not allowed in open spaces, and in fact penalties are levied if someone violates the rules,” he said, adding that certain vested interests are trying to politicise the issue.
09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Winds clean air, AQI inches towards moderate||Delhi’s air quality improved further on Wednesday, dropping down to 237 (poor) on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index to 237 on Wednesday from Tuesday’s 255, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data, with the fast winds continuing to flush out pollutants.According to data from the 39 stations were air quality is monitored in Delhi, at least eight city recorded air quality in the ‘moderate’ range (AQI value between 101-200). Delhi last reported a moderate air day (day’s average) on October 26.However, Union earth ministry’s forecasting agency, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), said air quality in Delhi on Wednesday was in the moderate range. Safar follows a different air quality index metric.“As predicted by Safar, the air quality has improved significantly. AQI slipped into the moderate category today, implying that (air pollution) control measures seem to be working. For the next three days days, (9th to 11th), wind speed is likely to be moderate and increased ventilation of pollutants is expected,” the Safar bulletin said on Wednesday.Gufran Beig, project director and founder, Safar, said better wind speed and a good mixing height are helping dispersal of local emissions. But, he cautioned that dipping temperatures may have a negative impact on the gains made in terms of air quality improvement in the next few days. “After 11 (December), wind speed will drop and by then, temperatures will drop too. AQI will start rising once again,” said Beig, adding that the impact of stubble burning was now over, with the pollution load now largely from the local sources.Mixing height is an invisible boundary layer of the atmosphere within which movement of air and particles can take place. The lower the mixing height, the lesser the room for pollutants to move or disperse.Delhi recorded a maximum of 24 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, while the minimum was recorded at 10.1 degrees Celsius. While the maximum temperature is expected to remain around 23-24 degrees Celsius until the weekend, the minimum could drop down to 7 degrees Celsius by Sunday. “With snowfall occurring in the higher reaches, its impact will soon be felt in Delhi with large parts in the northern plains recording a drop in minimum temperature by 3-4 degrees Celsius,” said an IMD official.IMD’s forecast shows shallow fog is expected on Thursday morning with the maximum and minimum expected to hover around 24 and 9 degrees Celsius respectively.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 24 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, and the minimum stayed at 10.1 degrees Celsius. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, the maximum temperature is expected to remain around 23-24 degrees Celsius till weekend, and the minimum could drop to 7 degrees Celsius by Sunday. “With snowfall occurring in the higher reaches, its impact will soon be felt in Delhi with large parts in the northern plains recording a drop in minimum temperature by 3-4 degrees Celsius,” said an IMD official.According to the forecast, shallow fog is expected on Thursday morning with the maximum and minimum expected to hover around 24 and 9 degrees Celsius respectively.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas held a review meeting on Wednesday with Delhi’s transport department to check compliance of the anti-pollution measures, and enquire about the measures taken to augment public transport.According to directions issued by the CAQM on December 3, schools, entry of trucks into Delhi is banned till further orders; construction activities remain suspended across NCR; and six out of 11 thermal power plants within a 300km radius also remains shut till further orders.“We have informed the CAQM about our plans to add more buses to the existing fleet. Already, 1,000 CNG buses were taken on rent, and more will be added. We also shared our long-term plan for augmenting public buses fleet in the capital,” said a Delhi government official, who asked not to be named.Santosh Harish, Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said there is a need to rely on a forecasting mechanism, which can allow resumption of schools, construction activities and the ban on entry of trucks when air quality is relatively cleaner. “If the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) needs to be followed, then the ban on these activities should have been lifted by now. It seems that we are neither following Grap, nor relying on any forecasting mechanism which allows these activities to resume during a relatively clean period,” he said, adding they cannot remain closed for a lengthy period as Delhi’s air will continue to fluctuate in the winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-winds-clean-air-aqi-inches-towards-moderate-101638989363158.html
09-12-2021||Noida||477 industries in NCR to remain shut till December 12 for not using cleaner fuel||The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on late Tuesday night passed an order to keep all industries in the National Capital Region (NCR), which have not switched to the usage of piped natural gas (PNG), shut till December 12. A total of 477 industries in Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida will remain closed for four days starting from Thursday. Ghaziabad has the maximum share of polluting industries. Of the 500 air polluting industries in Ghaziabad, about 80 have either switched to the usage of cleaner fuel like PNG or don’t have the infrastructure for the supply of the fuel in their area yet. The rest 421 industries are still using coal for their operations and hence, will remain closed. There are 10 such polluting industries in Noida, which will stay shut. In Greater Noida, there are 151 polluting industries and a power plant. Of these, 51 use PNG and another 54 use a combination of PNG and coal. There are still 46 industries in Greater Noida, which will stay closed. According to Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Ghaziabad, said the polluting industries in Noida are mostly related to textile and engineering as well as forging and metallurgy.“These are various types of industries in Greater Noida. Most of these industries deal with furnaces, paper, rice mills and textile. The information was conveyed through emails and Whatsapp groups today (Wednesday) and we are ensuring compliance,” said B P Yadav, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida.While the order came in late on Tuesday night, it was passed on to the concerned stakeholders on Wednesday, which leaves just four more days for authorities to implement the order and keep industries shut. The order does mention that it will be reviewed further, but four days still seems to be very little to have any major impact on the pollution levels. Experts and industries questioned the logic of implementing the extreme measure in just four days. According to industry owners, shutting industries even for four days takes a toll on both businesses and production worth thousands of crores.“All industries follow the pollution norms and file compliances regularly. However, shutting industries delays domestic supply as well as export orders and leads to non-productive man hours, which impacts the overall growth of the economy. Eventually, the entire production line is disturbed. Contacts in Faridabad’s textile industries said export orders worth thousands of crores are on hold,” said Rajiv Arora, general secretary, Industrial Area Manufacturers Association, Ghaziabad.Meanwhile, even before the non-compliant industries could be shut down, pollution levels reduced substantially since Tuesday. Experts said that this is mainly because of good wind speed in the past two days. The AQI across NCR has seen a decline since December 6.In Ghaziabad, the AQI of 293 recorded on December 6 fell to 235 on December 7 and further to 229 on December 8. In Greater Noida, the AQI drastically improved from 300 on December 6 to 174 on December 7 and fell further to 154 on December 8. The drop in pollution levels has been steeper in Noida where the AQI of 317 (‘very poor’ category) recorded on December 6 fell to 186 (moderate) on Wednesday. “The improvement in air quality is the result of better wind speed since Tuesday. The wind improved further on Wednesday morning, which helped improve the AQI across NCR. It is a natural environmental phenomenon and cannot be attributed to any of the steps we have taken locally,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/477-industries-in-ncr-to-remain-shut-till-december-12-for-not-using-cleaner-fuel-101638989303031.html
09-12-2021||Dehradun||General Rawat’s ancestral Uttarakhand village was waiting for him to return and settle down||A pall of gloom has descended on Uttarakhand’s Saina village in Pauri Garhwal district, the ancestral home of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, who was killed in a chopper crash on Wednesday.His uncle, Bharat Singh Rawat, who has retired from the Army said Gen Bipin Rawat was very attached to his roots in Uttarakhand and his native place in particular. “It is all surreal to me. How can it happen? I was praying that he has survived and wished that he and our bahu (daughter-in-law) get well soon. He wanted to settle here and had even identified a plot of land where he wanted to build his home,” said his uncle over the phone from Pauri. “He had come here in 2018 and told me that he wanted to build a house here. I said we have a lot of land and he can earmark a plot where wants to build his house. How could be leave us like this? He so wanted to live here again,” Singh said.Singh recalled that General Rawat had called him about a month ago and inquired about the road connectivity to the village. The village is still a kilometre’s walk from the nearest proper road.Ravindra Singh, Bharat Singh’s son said though the whole country is in mourning, the people in the village and surrounding areas are feeling a deep personal loss. “Today, we have lost a son of the soil, who made this village and Uttarakhand proud with his achievements. He made us all proud by becoming India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) in 2019 after serving the country as the army chief. His achievements were an inspiration to all of us here. Young men would look up to him and work hard to join the Indian Army. They too wanted to be like him,” he said. People in his maternal village, Thati in Uttarkashi, said he had visited them in 2019 along with his wife. Girveer Parmar, Gen Rawat’s maternal cousin from Thati village said the news of his death had devastated people in the village. “Last time when he had come here in 2019, he had told us that after retiring he would settle in the hills of his state and work for the development of the area with the help of the government.” Mansi Devi, gram pradhan of Birmoli, under which Saina village falls, said as the news of the chopper crash broke, shocked villagers started praying for his well-being. “We didn’t expect he will leave us suddenly like this. The news of his death is yet to sink in. The whole village and people in surrounding areas are mourning his loss and are deeply saddened. He will keep inspiring our youth who want to become like him. His legacy will keep motivating people of his ancestral place,” she said. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that CDS General Bipin Rawat was brought up in a small village in Uttarakhand’s Pauri district. “On the strength of his extraordinary talent, hard work and indomitable courage and bravery, he rose to the highest post of the army and gave a new direction to the security systems of the country and the Indian Army. Uttarakhand has also suffered a great loss due to his sudden demise. We all will always be proud of this great son of ours,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/general-rawat-s-ancestral-uttarakhand-village-was-waiting-for-him-to-return-and-settle-down-101638989184420.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Emergency patient services hit as resident doctors continue strike||Patient services at Delhi’s central government-run hospitals were severely affected as the strike by resident doctors’ entered 12th day, with medics at Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung, and Lady Hardinge Medical College withdrawing even from emergency services.For the last three days, patients from these hospitals are being referred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital. But, doctors from Lok Nayak hospital have also decided to boycott emergency work Thursday onwards.Lok Nayak is also the designated hospital for treatment and isolation of those suspected to have the new omicron variant infection.“Even after boycott by many institutions in Delhi, we continued to run emergency services, but the apathy of the government and the plight of overburdened residents have brought us to a total boycott of services including OPD, OT, ward, and emergency services from Thursday,” said a letter by the resident doctors’ association to the dean of Maulana Azad Medical College that is associated with Lok Nayak hospital.The doctors have been protesting delays in conducting NEET-PG counselling, which has left medical college-hospitals with only two-thirds the number of resident doctors -- considered the backbone of medical care at these hospitals. The doctors say that they have been overworked, and in addition over 42,000 medical students are losing out on a year of education.The counselling has been delayed due to the Supreme Court was hearing a bunch of petitions regarding economic reservation in the examination (NEET-PG).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiemergency-patient-services-hit-as-resident-doctors-continue-strike-101638989182932.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt play on Ambedkar purely patriotic, not political: Sisodia||The Delhi government’s plan to showcase the life of one of India’s founding fathers, Dr BR Ambedkar, in a play is not political but purely patriotic, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s art and culture and tourism minister, said the free show will begin on January 5, will be staged about 50 times throughout next month, and will feature renowned artistes, adding that the finer details of the project were still being worked out by the department.The announcement about the Delhi government organising a play on the Dalit icon and the architect of the Indian Constitution at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was made by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday.When asked about the timing of the programme in Delhi in the run-up to the assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, which have a Dalit population of 32% and 22% respectively, Sisodia said the move should not be seen through a political prism.The AAP is the principal opposition in the Punjab assembly.“This (the play) is not politics. It is not a political stunt. This is purely deshbhakti (patriotism). We had announced this plan during the beginning of this year itself, in my budget speech to be precise, because we are celebrating 75 years of Independence. It is part of the larger celebrations that are being held in Delhi under that itself,” Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, told HT in an interview.“In fact, let me remind you that the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi is probably the only city-state which has been running so many welfare schemes for Dalits ever since it came to power seven years ago. What the Dalits of this country have faced or are still facing for several decades -- the discrimination has still not been compensated for. But, this play that I am talking about is not merely to showcase Babasaheb as a Dalit leader. Our intention is to showcase him as the architect of modern India. Everyone should take home some inspiration after watching the play,” Sisodia said.Talking about poll promises made by Kejriwal in Punjab -- including free school education and coaching for higher studies to children from the scheduled caste community if his party comes to power -- the deputy CM said the AAP will simply replicate the “Delhi model” in Punjab.“The Delhi government is already running a host of schemes for the children and students from the SC community. We have just promised the same in Punjab too. What is wrong with that? Don’t the people of Punjab deserve the same benefits which the people in Delhi are enjoying? In Delhi, the AAP government is running the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana to extend quality education to the underprivileged,” Sisodia said.“Under this scheme, meritorious students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and EWS categories receive free coaching from private institutes for competitive exams such as JEE, NEET, CLAT, Civil Services, Banking, Railways, SSC, among others. If a kid from a family earning less than ₹8 lakh per annum is talented, they no longer have to face the hurdles of poverty. We also provide a stipend of ₹2,500 to the beneficiary students so that they do not face problems in their commute,” he added.
09-12-2021||Delhi||Covid cases spike slightly in Delhi, experts prescribe caution||Delhi on Wednesday reported 65 new cases of Covid-19, the most in a 24-hour period in over 100 days, as new infections continued to slowly inch up in the Capital amid fears of the heavily mutated Omicron variant spreading in the country.Experts have warned that while the increase in cases remains marginal for now, all Covid protocols must be followed strictly, and people should immediately get vaccinated.The seven-day average of new cases (a statistic that represents a region’s Covid-19) curve has now touched 52 infections a day in the past week – the highest since August 13, or 117 days ago. As little as 11 days ago (for the week ended November 27), this number was at 28 new cases a day, on average.To be sure, the number of tests – both RT-PCR and rapid antigen – has also increased during this period. The average daily samples tested in the past week were 57,412, compared to 52,532 for the week ended November 27, official government data shows.Meanwhile, another death was reported on Wednesday due to the disease, taking the total number of fatalities to the viral infection in the Capital to 25,100. This was the second death in the city reported in the month of December.There were seven deaths recorded in Delhi in the month of November, which was the highest since August this year. In October, the city recorded just four deaths — the fewest seen in any month since the start of the pandemic in the country in March last year.Another positive side for the city is that the daily positivity rate, the proportion of samples that returned positive, meanwhile, continues to remain low. On Wednesday, only 0.11% of all samples tested returned positive. While this number has inched up marginally from the 0.06% seen in the final week of November, it remains much below the 0.5% positivity rate at which the first phase of Delhi government’s graded response action plan kicks in.On Sunday, the first case of the Omicron variant, a heavily mutated variant of Sars-Cov-2 that was first detected in South Africa, was found in Delhi. As of Wednesday night, a total of 23 cases of Omicron have been detected in the country. The variant, which has already gained a foothold in Europe, Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe, has forced governments across the world to tighten travel rules again as scientists rush to establish if cases of this variant progress to the severe stage, or if vaccines would be need to be reworked to combat it.Meanwhile, experts said that people should just stick to existing Covid protocols.“Now that Omicron is in the country, it is quite infectious and will most likely spread. However, we don’t need to do anything different to protect against the virus -- those who have not been vaccinated, should get vaccinated; everyone should wear masks; and avoid crowded areas and large gatherings. Anyone who gets symptoms should immediately isolate themselves so that they do not spread the infection. Fortunately, a high proportion of people were exposed to the virus during the second wave -- probably 80% in Delhi as seen in unvaccinated children in the sero survey -- and they will have good protection against re-infection,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“We have to see how effective vaccines would be. During the Delta wave, we saw around 27% breakthrough infections in India. The vaccines will protect against this variant too but we have to see how much,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-cases-spike-slightly-in-delhi-experts-prescribe-caution-101638988952445.html
09-12-2021||Other||Lucknow: UK returnee who tested Covid positive, kept in home isolation||LUCKNOW: A 36-year-old international traveller, who came from UK and tested positive for Covid-19 at the Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport on Tuesday, was sent to home isolation from the Lok Bandhu hospital on Wednesday.“The man, a resident of Gomti Nagar, tested positive in the rapid RTPCR test at the airport. Later, in two other RTPCR test reports, where one was conducted with the same sample he gave at the airport, came negative and therefore he was allowed for home isolation. Third sample was taken at hospital. The man was asymptomatic when he had landed at the airport,” said Ajay Shankar Tripathi, chief medical superintendent of the Lok Bandhu hospital. The man was taken straight from the airport to the Lok Bandhu hospital, which had been declared as Covid facility for the international travellers who are coming from ‘at risk’ countries and test positive for Covid, he said. Passengers from ‘at risk’ countries leave airport only after RTPCR report comes while those coming from other countries leave the airport once they submit details about travel and stay, and give RTPCR samples for Covid test. At risk countries are those where cases of new variant of Covid ‘omicron’ have been reported. “Instructions have been given to the patient, an IT professional who works in UK, to stay in home isolation and follow all Covid protocol and guidelines. He will be in our contact for the next 10-days at least as the genome sequencing report is also awaited,” said Dr Tripathi. Every day the health status of the man will be taken by Covid command centre, he added. The genome sequencing is being done from the sample that was given at the airport and the sample will be tested in a lab in Lucknow. Another international traveller, a woman who had come from Canada few days ago and tested positive for Covid, is also in home isolation. The woman had come to attend a marriage ceremony, but when she gave her sample before returning back to Canada, the report stated that she was Covid positive. “She is in home isolation,” said a senior health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-uk-returnee-who-tested-covid-positive-kept-in-home-isolation-101638988944246.html
09-12-2021||Mumbai||Mayor files FIR against BJP MLA||Mumbai The Mumbai police on Wednesday night registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Ashish Shelar on the complaint of city’s mayor Kishori Pednekar for allegedly passing objectionable remarks against her during a press conference on November 30. The police have booked Shelar under Sections 354A (Sexual harassment) and 509 (words, sound or gesture, or exhibition of any object, intending to insult the modesty of any woman) of the Indian Penal Code. A senior police officer confirmed the development. On Twitter, Shelar termed the development as “manipulation of facts” and said that it is an outcome of pressure by ruling party elements to foist false cases against him.On November 30, a fire broke out after a gas cylinder exploded at BDD chawl number 03, Kamgar Vasahat, on Ganpatrao Jadhav Marg in Worli.Post the tragedy, Shelar, while addressing a press conference on December 4, slammed the mayor for visiting the site nearly 72-hours after the incident. Shelar allegedly remarked, “Where were you (the mayor) sleeping for these many hours?”Pednekar took exception to his mention of the word ‘sleeping’. In her letter to state home minister Dilip Walse Patil, she wrote, “The mayor of Mumbai is the first citizen and it is a very important post. The term used to describe me as a woman mayor is objectionable.”The letter stated that Shelar’s remark insulted not only Pednekar but other women as well.Hours before the FIR was filed Shelar on Wednesday night tweeted the letter his lawyer has written to Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale.Shelar tweeted, “I wrote to Mumbai Police CP Shri Hemant Nagrale ji to protest manipulation of facts & against pressure by ruling party elements to foist false case against me !”Shelar’s advocate Usha Andewar’s letter to police commissioner stated, “My clients’ political opponents presently ruling the Maharashtra government are blowing up his statement disproportionately by turning, twisting and distorting the plain meaning and understanding of language and words used in Marathi by him. My client denies that he has made any derogatory words in any form. The same is the brainstorm and imagination of the ruling party to implicate my client falsely. The press release itself is very clear and self-explanatory.”Earlier, the Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) had also taken the suo moto cognizance of the matter and had asked Mumbai police commissioner to submit a factual report about the alleged objectionable remark passed by Shelar about Pednekar.Responding to the matter, the BJP earlier had issued a statement that the party has filed a complaint with the Mumbai police as a few people having links with the Shiv Sena morphed Shelar’s video and deliberately insulted Pednekar in the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mayor-files-fir-against-bjp-mla-101638988822939.html
09-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi losing its trees due to lack of census, violation of rules||Delhi could be losing thousands of trees every year -- thanks to the absence of a tree census and faulty implementation of existing laws.The trees may not be marked in building plans approved by the corporations -- which means many of them can be cut down, usually without permission.The violations were recently detected by the south division of the forest department, which has since then written a letter to the three corporations, pointing out that according to the unified building bye laws (UBBL), 2016, it is mandatory to mark all features within the site plan of a house or a building, including drains, wells and trees.Yet, few mark trees, both within the boundary walls or just outside, and as a result, the forest department claimed, many trees are going missing -- being cut down without any permission being sought.In the letter, dated October 14, Amit Anand, the deputy conservator of forest (DCF), south, said corporations also need to avoid giving approval to multiple entrances or gates in a new construction as each entrance means trees around it need to be cut down. HT has seen a copy of the letter.If trees inside the plot are duly marked in the site plan (as expected to), the tree officer while looking at a tree felling application could effectively save some trees.“Hence, trees can be saved from unnecessary felling. Further, your esteemed organisation can also rationalise the number of trees to be affected by a project by realigning the design based on existing trees in the area,” he added in his letter.Anand said the problem was not limited to houses alone, but larger construction projects too. “We have had to send back a number of plans recently as they did not show the trees within and outside the boundary wall of the site. In order to decide how many trees can be saved, we first need to know how many trees exist in the first place.”In the absence of a government tree census, activists and environmentalists across the capital have so far been relying on smaller, local-level census of trees to keep track . Concretization and construction are the biggest obstacles in protection of trees. Vallari Sheel, an environmental scientist and urban ecologist who carried out a tree census in 2015-16 in Vasant Vihar, said 80% the trees in neighbourhood were heavily concretised (surrounded by concrete). Sheel counted a total of 4,993 trees, out of which 3,859 trees were found to be heavily concretised.This year, she is again revisiting those trees to get an updated count after a Delhi High Court order asked for trees to be deconcretised and a fresh census to be carried out. According to her, trees are missing at a number of places.“Concretization was the key issue highlighted in the first census and we have observed that each year, 10-15 trees can fall across neighbourhoods simply because they are heavily concretised and cannot withstand strong winds and heavy rain,” Sheel said. “We are also visiting trees that we marked during the 2016 census and we are finding them missing, particularly outside new constructions and houses that were renovated since 2016. Trees which could have been preserved inside are cut down to utilize maximum area and outside, the trees are cut down to maximize on parking space.” .Sarvodaya Enclave, which saw Delhi’s first tree census in 2012, also found 77 trees to be missing seven years later, when a fresh count was carried out in 2019. Padmavati Dwivedi, a tree activist who led the count, says it is not surprising that trees were found to be missing with no agency willing to follow the law.“The building design should be such that existing trees are protected and involved in the existing plan, but instead, almost all trees are being cut down,” said Dwivedi, adding that the government itself has not kept a track of Delhi’s trees. “A government tree census would have meant each tree numbered would be in its records, but this is not the case and the forest department has to rely on citizen efforts.”Others are relying on satellite imagery to identify trees that have possibly been cut down without permission. Verhaen Khanna, founder of the NGO New Delhi Nature Society (NDNS) has been comparing satellite images from Google maps to determine trees that are going missing in his neighbourhood of New Friends Colony.“Whenever there is a new construction happening, the tree is often cut down without permission and even when permission is sought, the tree is shown to be obstructing things in some manner and deemed dangerous, even when there is nothing dangerous about it. This way, even legally, a healthy tree can be cut down,” said Khanna.Residents keeping track of trees getting cut also say there have been instances of permission letters being forged or faked in order to remove a tree obstructing a possible parking space. In Defence colony, a local resident, Rajeev Suri, had to file a complaint with the Delhi Police after two trees – an Alstonia and an Ashoka tree were cut down with the help of a ‘permission letter’. However, after verifying the details with the forest department, he found out no such permission had been given. “This is another modus operandi that is emerging -- fake or forged permission letters are being used to cut perfectly healthy trees,”said environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari, another resident of Defence Colony.A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official associated with the layout and building plan approval process said the responsibility to mark trees lay with the forest department, with the UBBL not specifying a need to earmark trees either.“It is an offence to cut down trees without required sanction but the forest department is the primary agency responsible for its enforcement,” the official said.Despite repeated requests, senior officials from North and East MCD did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-losing-its-trees-due-to-lack-of-census-violation-of-rules-101638988705450.html

The purpose of the drive is to check the number of such violations before foggy conditions set in, officials said.Over 1,500 traffic police personnel will be deputed at 103 points, including Iffco Chowk, Mayfield Garden, Ghata T-point and Rajiv Chowk, said Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).The officials said they expect that the drive would reduce such violations and also bring down the total number of accidents and road fatalities recorded in December and January every year.“This can result in commuters across the city being cautious before committing any such violation as it could lead to the issuance of fines. We hope the drive will help reduce accidents and road fatalities,” said Tomar. He further said that after the drive is over on December 15, the traffic police will start a new drive against the violations that were the highest during this drive. According to the officials, the average monthly number of road fatalities in December and January is nearly double in comparison to the average monthly figures of rest of the year. Last year, Gurugram recorded 880 road accidents in which 375 people were killed, the traffic police officials said, adding that 236 people have been killed in accidents till August 31 this year. However, the officials did not provide monthly data of road accidents in the district.As per the five-day weather forecast for the National Capital Region (NCR) by the India Meteorological Department, the region will witness shallow to moderate fog on Thursday morning, and shallow fog during morning hours from Friday till Sunday.Tomar said that the traffic police have also constituted Fog Action Support Teams (FASTs). Each team constitutes a zonal officer, a constable, two home guards, and two road safety officers.“The FASTs have been given directions to put reflective tapes on heavy vehicles, cycles, tractors, auto-rickshaws, manually pulled rickshaws, trolleys, and carts, as well as on jersey barriers, concrete bollards, and on any other type of structure which can cause accidents in foggy conditions during December and January. The tapes will help commuters spot such structures and vehicles from a distance,” said Tomar.Overall, three such teams have been formed for this task, each deputed in traffic police districts of west, east, and highways, the officials said.In the east district, areas such as Old Gurgaon and newly developed sectors along the Dwarka Expressway come under its jurisdiction, stretches as national highway 48 from Sirhaul toll to Gurugram-Rewari border and the Gurugram section of Sohna Road come under the highways district, and the remaining parts of the city fall in the west district.

Also read: Covishield production to be halved; Adar Poonawalla says he’s in dilemmaHaryana governor Bandaru Dattatraya, who is the chancellor of the university, appointed Chauhan to the post for three years, according to a notification from the Haryana Raj Bhavan on Tuesday. With the appointment of Chauhan, who is known for his portrayal of Yudhishthira in the historical TV series Mahabharat, Maharshi Dayanand University vice-chancellor Rajbir Singh will be relieved of the additional charge of the V-C. Chauhan had a controversial stint as a chairman of the Pune-based Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in 2015. He was appointed to the post in June 2015 for three years, with retrospective effect from March 2014. However, following widespread protests against him by FTII students and alumni, who felt it was the government’s attempt to “saffronise the institute“, he could assume office only in January 2016, thereby getting only a 15-month tenure. He was replaced by actor Anupam Kher in October 2017. INLD slams government Indian National Lok Dal general secretary (INLD) and Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala slammed the Haryana government over Chauhan’s appointment. In a press statement, Chautala alleged that the government had changed educational and other criteria for appointing Chauhan as the vice-chancellor.“The BJP has been appointing unqualified people as vice-chancellors in Haryana universities. The students of FTII had forced unqualified Chauhan to resign from the chairman post in 2017 and he had always performed in C-grade movies, except TV series Mahabharat. The government should take back its decision to appoint Chauhan as SUPVA’s vice-chancellor,” the INLD general secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gajendra-chauhan-appointed-v-c-of-rohtak-s-varsity-of-performing-arts-101638946819000.html

An analysis by the New York Times has revealed that over 55,000 Covid-19 patients in the country are currently hospitalised. This figure is though a lot fewer than what it was in September, it saw a surge more than 15 per cent in the past two weeks.At the moment, the analysis showed, the US is witnessing about 121,300 Covid-19 cases per day - a rise of about 27 per cent from two weeks before. The rate of logged fatalities are up by 12 per cent, therefore averaging about 1,275 per day.The NYT report said that Michigan tops the chart in the country with most hospitalisations per capita. Cases and hospitalisations are also seeing a rapid increase in Connecticut that reported a 69 per cent rise in patients over the last two weeks.What remains concerning is that states with one of the highest vaccination rates are also struggling with hospitalisations. For instance, Maine has fully vaccinated about 73 per cent of its population, behind only Vermont and Rhode Island, as per New York Times database. However, coronavirus cases in Maine recently went up to its peak since the pandemic struck the US.One of Maine's largest hospital - Maine Medical Center, said in a statement on Wednesday that there had been times this week when they lacked even a single critical bed, thus forcing surgeries to be postponed. It also said that the hospital is looking after an overwhelming number of patients.Also Read | Omicron versus Delta: Fauci breaks down what is known and what's unknownMaine Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital, said in a statement on Wednesday that there had been times this week “when there were no critical care beds available,” forcing hospital leaders to postpone surgeries.Missouri's University Health hospital system's chief medical officer Dr Mark Steele told New York Times that at the moment, the Delta variant is overwhelmingly prominent and now there are Omicron-related concerns to think about as well.Delta variant of Covid-19, discovered in India in late 2020, caused hysteria across the world with several countries opting for fresh and stricter lockdowns to combat it.Meanwhile, as Omicron - classified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) similar to that of Delta, cases have already been reported in at least 30 nations, fear remains regarding its impact. The UN health agency, has however, said that there is no reason to assume that Omicron is going to be more severe than other variants of coronavirus, or that available vaccines will fail to render protection against it.WHO emergencies' director Michael Ryan told AFP that currently there is no indication to suggest that Omicron will be more dangerous than Delta, and existing vaccines should protect people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-omicron-us-still-battling-delta-variant-driven-hospitalisations-report-101639056419819.html

Around 4.7 million 16- and 17-year-olds in the United States are fully vaccinated and more than 2.5 million of them are six months past their second dose.Some scientists have raised concerns about additional shots for the age group because of the elevated risk of rare cases of heart inflammation in young men that have been linked to messenger RNA vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.All US adults are currently eligible for booster shots of the three authorized Covid-19 vaccines.The FDA's authorization comes a day after Pfizer and BioNTech released data suggesting that booster shots could be key to protection against infection from the newly identified Omicron variant of the coronavirus.The CDC has identified fewer than 100 cases of Omicron in the United States, but they are expected to increase in the coming weeks and months.Meanwhile, the dominant Delta variant, which is very transmissible and can be passed on by people who are fully vaccinated, has driven up infections. Regions where activities have moved indoors for winter, such as the Northeast, have seen some of the biggest increases in new cases, which now average close to 120,000 each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-booster-for-16-and-17yearolds-101639069641921.html
09-12-2021||World||Democratic principles should guide global governance: PM Modi at Summit for Democracy||The principles of democracy should guide global governance and technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday at the Summit for Democracy hosted by US President Joe Biden. Modi made the remarks at a virtual leaders’ plenary session that was hosted by Biden and held behind closed doors, according to people familiar with the matter. The prime minister is participating in the two-day event at Biden’s invitation and the plenary session witnessed interventions from leaders of only 12 countries. Democratic spirit, including respect for rule of law and pluralistic ethos, is ingrained in Indians, and the Indian diaspora carries it too, contributing to the economic well-being and social harmony of their adopted homes, Modi told the session, according to the people cited above. “The prime minister stressed that principles of democracy should guide global governance, and given technology’s ability to impact democracy positively or negatively, technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies,” one of the people cited above said. Modi emphasised the need for democratic countries to deliver on values enshrined in their constitutions, and outlined sensitivity, accountability, participation and reform orientation as the four pillars of Indian democratic governance. He also recalled India’s Constituent Assembly had held its first session on this same day 75 years ago. He highlighted India’s civilisational ethos as one of the original sources of democracy. Biden is hosting the virtual summit for leaders from government, civil society and the private sector to focus on challenges and opportunities facing democracies worldwide. The summit will provide a platform to the leaders to announce individual and collective commitments, reforms and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad, according to the US state department. “As the world’s largest democracy, India has commended this innovative initiative. India has always stood ready to share its experiences with fellow democracies,” another person said on condition of anonymity. A second closed-door leaders’ plenary session was hosted on Thursday by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Official interventions by leaders of numerous countries were also live streamed on the website of the Summit for Democracy. Modi will deliver India’s national statement on Friday. In his opening remarks at the summit, Biden highlighted the challenges being faced by democracy worldwide. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident, we have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said. “Because the data we are seeing is largely pointing in the wrong direction. Freedom House reports that 2020 marked the 15th consecutive year of global freedom in retreat. Another recent report from the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance noted more than half of all democracies have experienced a decline in at least one aspect of their democracy over the last 10 years, including the US,” he said. These trends are being exacerbated by global challenges that can be addressed by shared efforts, Biden said. Biden announced the establishment of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, for which the US will provide $424.4 million in 2020. Under this initiative, the US with likeminded partners to defend and sustain democratic resilience. These efforts will focus on the five areas – supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, advancing technology for democracy, and defending free and fair elections and political processes.

The global health body said the administration of booster doses might affect the supply to low-income countries.Initially several countries introduced a booster inoculation programme for older populations and those with underlying health issues. However, the emergence of the new variant has prompted some countries to expand the programme to all eligible beneficiaries.“As we head into whatever the omicron situation is going to be, there is a risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccines to protect — in a sense, in excess — their opportunity for vaccination, and a sort of ‘no-regrets’ kind of approach,” the Associated Press quoted WHO’s director of the department of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals Kate O’Brien as saying.Also read | EU agency says Omicron cases so far appear 'mostly mild'. Then cautions“What is going to shut down disease is for everybody who is especially at risk of disease to become vaccinated. We seem to be taking our eye off that ball in countries,” she further said.Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergencies director, briefed on the Omicron variant and said, “We don't fully understand the implications clinically or the implications for our vaccines... What we do in the coming days and weeks, both in terms of virus suppression, vaccination and equity will make a huge difference to the evolution of this pandemic in 2022.”The warning from WHO came even as the doses supplied to the global vaccine sharing programme COVAX had increased in the past few months due to the donations from wealthy nations and also due to the easing of export limits on vaccines by India, according to a report by Reuters.Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Union’s (EU) drug regulator, said Omicron cases so far appear to be “mostly mild” while cautioning that more evidence was needed to ascertain the severity of disease caused by the variant.As many as 57 countries have so far reported cases pertaining to the new variant, according to the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-covid-vaccine-hoarding-as-nations-begin-booster-doses-to-fight-omicron-101639062388454.html
09-12-2021||World||South Asia hostage to Kashmir issue, India mistook peace overtures for weakness: Imran Khan||The whole of South Asia is hostage to the issue of Kashmir and Islamabad’s overtures for peace were mistaken by New Delhi as a sign of weakness, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Thursday. Delivering the inaugural address at a conclave organised by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, Khan said several problems affecting South Asia, such as climate change, can be effectively tackled only if India and Pakistan work together. “There is only one big problem in South Asia. The whole of South Asia is hostage to the Kashmir issue,” he said, speaking in Urdu at the Islamabad Conclave 2021, the theme for which was “Peaceful and prosperous South Asia”. “It is with regret I have to say that we tried our best to have talks with India, I called [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. Despite all the overtures we made, I slowly realised that he thought this was our weakness. There was some other reaction to all our efforts for peace, they were thinking Pakistan is making efforts for peace since it is very weak,” he said. Khan contended it was “unfortunate that we were not interacting with the government of a normal India, we were competing with an ideology”. He further said: “Our problem is only Kashmir and that problem can’t be resolved through guns and bombs. It can be resolved only through dialogue, and its solution is political dialogue...Whatever India is trying through the use of guns, strong arm tactics and repression of Kashmiris will never succeed.” There was no immediate response to Khan’s remarks from the Indian side. Ties between India and Pakistan are currently at an all-time low following a string of high-profile terror attacks in recent years that were all blamed on Pakistan-based terror groups. India has said that terrorism and talks cannot go together. On the other hand, Pakistan has contended that India hasn’t provided evidence to back up its accusations. Khan pointed out that the whole of South Asia and the region’s problems were connected. “There are two problems in our region – trade is very low because of political differences and conflict, and we are also connected in climate change. For this, we pray that India will one day have such a government with which we can talk on the basis of logic and sanity and resolve our problems,” he said. “We hope there will be such a government in India that we can sit with at the table and solve the Kashmir problem, and then jointly we can fight several things, such as the pollution in Lahore. See the satellite images – they show a pollution cover over Delhi and [Pakistan’s] Punjab,” Khan said. “Till the two countries sit together, no matter what we do for Lahore, we will solve only half the problem.” Noting that India is very vulnerable to climate change as Himalayan glaciers are rapidly melting, Khan said the future of the two countries in this area is connected. “We should jointly work hard on climate change but till now, I’m not seeing the required seriousness among world leaders because their commercial interests clash with the steps needed to stop climate change,” he added. Khan described the situation in Afghanistan as Pakistan’s “other big worry”, but said things could have been worse. “We feared there could be civil war in Afghanistan and this was the biggest nightmare scenario for Pakistan,” he said. The freezing of Afghanistan’s assets around the world is having an impact on the Afghan people and any humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan would present problems for Pakistan and Iran, Khan said. Referring to the possibility of a Cold War-like situation and the creation of blocs, Khan said Pakistan will work to stop such blocs. “We should not become part of any bloc. The world lost a lot because of the earlier Cold War...Pakistan doesn’t want to get caught up like it did in the last Cold War,” he said. Amid a Cold War-like situation between the US and China, Pakistan will try to stop the gap between these two countries just as it brought them together in the 1970s, he said. Reports have suggested Pakistan pulled out of the Summit for Democracy convened by US President Joe Biden because of its close ties with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-asia-hostage-to-kashmir-issue-india-mistook-peace-overtures-for-weakness-imran-khan-101639060536154.html
09-12-2021||World||China may have played role in Pakistan’s withdrawal from US-led summit||A late night phone call from a top Chinese diplomat could have played a part in Pakistan’s withdrawal from the high-profile “Summit for Democracy” convened by President Joe Biden to be held on Thursday and Friday.Pakistan on Wednesday decided to skip the “Summit for Democracy” without giving any reason for doing so, giving rise to speculation whether China, which wasn’t invited to the international conference, convinced “iron brother” Islamabad, not to attend it.The Biden administration has invited leaders from over 100 countries and Pakistan was among the four south Asian countries invited besides India, Maldives and Nepal.The argument that China convinced Pakistan not to attend the summit is strengthened by the fact that Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had held a telephone conversation with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Friday night.During the phone conversation, Wang, according to the official news agency, Xinhua, “…expounded on China’s position on the so-called “Summit for Democracy” to be held by the US.”“What the US aims for is not democracy but hegemony,” Wang pointed out, adding the country is seeking to defend its dominant position in the world in the name of democracy.Wang said: “The US is trying to interfere with other countries’ internal affairs under the banner of democracy, abusing democratic values and creating divisions in the world”.“Many countries believe neither is the United States in a position to set tests and standards for others nor does it have the right to ask others to only follow its way of democracy,” Wang told Qureshi.“Wang stressed if democracy is to be discussed it should be discussed on the platform of the United Nations in the spirit of mutual respect and on an equal footing,” the Xinhua report said.Wang praised China’s system during the phone conversation, calling it the “whole-process people’s democracy”.China has full confidence in its democratic path and process, Wang said, adding that the “socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics is the whole-process people’s democracy, which has won wide endorsement and support from the Chinese people”.China, Wang said, is willing to conduct full exchanges with other countries on democracy and human rights in an open and inclusive manner, and jointly promote the cause of democracy and human rights around the world.China is also ready to work with all sides to uphold justice, reject the Cold War mentality, safeguard and develop true democracy, and earnestly defend the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of developing countries, he added. Unusually, no quotes were attributed to the Pakistani foreign minister, Qureshi, in the Xinhua report.Pakistan’s Express Tribune newspaper, quoting “official sources”, reported on Wednesday that Islamabad did consult Beijing on the issue.“One of the reasons includes the exclusion of China from the summit. The overall state of relations between the two countries is another major factor, compelling Islamabad to stay away from the summit,” the newspaper reported.China and Pakistan define their ties as “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” with Beijing currently the largest supplier of arms to Islamabad.President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, passes through PoK.In November, China delivered to Pakistan the largest and most advanced warship, a frigate with stealth capabilities, it has ever manufactured as Beijing and Islamabad continue to strengthen their military capabilities against regional rival, India.Chinese state media reported the commissioning of the warship, quoting local and Pakistani officials, listing the vessel’s advanced capabilities, and noting that the delivery highlights Sino-Pakistan “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-have-played-role-in-pakistan-s-withdrawal-from-us-led-summit-101639054236208.html

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has cautioned that it could fuel surges with “severe consequences”.However, a section of people still feel that the variant may only lead to only mild illness given a jump in cases in South Africa, where the variant was first detected, has not yet overwhelmed hospitals.The global health body recently said that early data indicates that Omicron may easily infect people who have either been infected earlier or vaccinated, but severity will be milder than what the Delta variant did or does.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have also said that a booster dose of their vaccine could fortify protection against the strain.The health community is trying to study the new variant, which is the most differentiated strain yet among the five variants of concern identified by the WHO since the pandemic began early last year.Cases in South Africa have rapidly increased to about 20,000 a day since the first infection related to Omicron was detected there two weeks ago. The number of Covid cases in the nation had remained low in the preceding weeks, despite only 26 per cent of the population being fully vaccinated, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-strain-4-2-times-more-transmissible-in-its-early-stage-than-delta-study-101639044033421.html

Warning the nations that they would “inevitably” regret launching the joint diplomatic boycott of the multi-sports event next winter, China said that using the Olympic platform for “political manipulation” is “unpopular and self-isolating”.China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, “The US, Australia, Britain, and Canada's use of the Olympic platform for political manipulation is unpopular and self-isolating, and they will inevitably pay the price for their wrongdoing.”Notably, Canada is the latest country to join the diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, first initiated by the United States. The two other countries are Australia and the United Kingdom.Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday cited repeated violation of human rights by the Chinese government as the reason for not sending any diplomatic representation to the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games this winter.Similar reasons have been cited by the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, too, as the allies fester a growing discord with China over a slew of issues that have plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The athletes from all these countries would still be able to participate in the 2022 Winter Olympics since the boycott is only limited to the level of diplomatic representation, according to the Olympic committees of the respective nations.Reacting to Australia's diplomatic boycott of the Olympics, a Chinese embassy spokesperson had earlier indicated that accountability for fixing the current predicament in diplomatic ties lies squarely with the Western side. “Mountains cannot stop the river from flowing into the sea,” the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Australia had said, noting that success at a multi-sports event such as the Olympics depends on the performance of athletes and not on the attendance of officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-launching-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-will-pay-the-price-china-101639037540405.html

The report further found that at least 293 reporters were imprisoned as of December 1 this year, said news agency Reuters.According to the CPJ's annual survey on press freedom and attacks on the media, 24 journalists were killed because of their coverage and 18 others died in circumstances that make it too difficult to determine whether they were targeted because of their work.The report by the US-based nonprofit further said that reasons for jailing reporters differed from one country to another but the record number was reflective of political upheaval around the world and a growing intolerance of independent reporting."This is the sixth year in a row that CPJ has documented record numbers of journalists imprisoned around the world," Reuters quoted CPJ executive director Joel Simon as saying in a statement."The number reflects two inextricable challenges – governments are determined to control and manage information, and they are increasingly brazen in their efforts to do so."Some of the journalists who were killed in 2021 include Danish Siddiqui, who died in a Taliban attack in Afghanistan in July, and Gustavo Sanchez Cabrera, who was shot and killed in Mexico in June.According to the CJP report cited by Reuters, China imprisoned the most number of journalists (50), followed by Myanmar (26), which arrested reporters as part of a crackdown after its February 1 military coup, then Egypt (25), Vietnam (23) and Belarus (19).For the first time, the CPJ's list includes journalists incarcerated in Hong Kong – a byproduct of the 2020 national security law, which makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.Mexico, where journalists are often targeted when their work upsets criminal gangs or corrupt officials, remains the Western hemisphere's deadliest country for reporters, according to the CPJ.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-of-journalists-jailed-reached-global-high-in-2021-cpj-report-101639030495409.html

Zheng allegedly “used his status as a CSA engineer to negotiate agreements for the installation of satellite station facilities in Iceland. He allegedly acted on behalf of a Chinese aerospace company”, the RCMP said.Zheng is scheduled to make a court appearance on December 15. Meanwhile, the CSA said that when “concerns about this individual’s private activities outside of their employment arose, the CSA took actions, including an internal inquiry and restricting access to information. As measures increased, the employment ceased, in 2019”.It brought its concerns to the RCMP and actively collaborated in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-police-charge-ex-staff-of-space-agency-for-illegal-activities-101639031491150.html
09-12-2021||World||Canada announces diplomatic boycott of 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that his country will follow others like the United States in undertaking a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Trudeau made the announcement in Ottawa and tweeted, “Canada remains deeply disturbed by reports of human rights violations in China. As a result, we won’t be sending diplomatic representatives to Beijing for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. We’ll continue to support our athletes who work hard to compete on the world stage.”The boycott was expected after Canada’s principal allies including the US, the United Kingdom and Australia already took such action.There was a vituperative reaction from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa. In a statement attributed to a spokesperson, it said Trudeau had “falsely claimed” there were human rights violations by the Chinese government and “based on this groundless accusation” decided on the diplomatic boycott.“The Chinese side expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to this, and has lodged stern representations with the Canadian side,” the statement said.It also accused Canada and other Western governments of “been flagrantly engaged in political manoeuvring” based on “ideological biases as well as lies and rumours” in an attempt to “to disrupt the smooth progress of Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games”. “The Canadian side’s hyping up a “diplomatic boycott” without even being invited to the Games is a pure self entertainment,” it added.“Canada must stop politicising sports, stop disrupting and undermining the Beijing Winter Olympics immediately, lest it should lead to self-inflicted humiliation,” it concluded.The Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Committees issued a statement on the decision and said they “understand and respect” it. “We also recognise how this announcement draws the important distinction between the participation of athletes and the participation of government officials at the Games,” the statement noted.Relations between Canada and China have deteriorated in recent times, since senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver in 2018 on charges of allegedly defrauding a financial institution to bypass sanctions upon the Iranian regime. Days later, two Canadians, including a former diplomat was arrested by China. Trudeau described that as “hostage diplomacy”. After more than 1,000 days in captivity and being charged with spying, the two were released in September this year in what was seen as an exchange of prisoners and Meng also flew back to China after agreeing to a plea deal with American prosecutors.A pending decision on blacklisting Huawei from Canada’s 5G infrastructure could further damage ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-announces-diplomatic-boycott-of-2022-winter-olympics-in-beijing-101639027828719.html

Children represented 22.4% of the weekly reported cases of Covid-19 in the US, the report further said, pointing out that the Covid-19 cases among children have been significantly high for the past few weeks.“For the 17th week in a row child Covid-19 cases are above 100,000.

It called on countries to vaccinate as fast as possible and keep measures in place to protect people from infection.“We can prevent omicron becoming a global crisis,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Wednesday. “This virus is changing, but our collective resolve must not.”The World Health Organization said the omicron variant of the coronavirus may change the course of the pandemic. It called on countries to vaccinate as fast as possible and keep measures in place to protect people from infection.“We can prevent omicron becoming a global crisis,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Wednesday. “This virus is changing, but our collective resolve must not.”|#+|The organization also said while there’s early evidence that omicron is milder than the delta strain, it’s too early to be definitive. “Certain features of omicron, including its global spread and large number of mutations, suggest it could have a major impact on the course of the pandemic,” Tedros said.Asked about a new study from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE on how their vaccine works against omicron, Kate O’Brien, director of immunization and vaccines, said the WHO is aware and will look at the findings.“We are still in a delta pandemic, so vaccinate with existing vaccines continues to be the top priority,” she said.Earlier on Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech said initial laboratory studies show a third dose of their vaccine may be needed to neutralize the omicron variant, an analysis that will accelerate booster-shot drives around the world.The WHO has been pushing for countries to hold off on boosters to make more vaccines available to poorer countries where inoculation rates are low. But governments may be less likely to do that if evidence from tests continues to show that third shots are needed to protect against omicron.The variant has now spread to 57 countries, and it appears to be more transmissible than previous virus strains. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s emergencies program, said while omicron appears to have higher transmissibility than delta, “that does not mean the virus is unstoppable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-change-course-of-covid-19-pandemic-who-warns-101639021422990.html
09-12-2021||World||In China, 127 journalists under detention for covering sensitive topics: Report||Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit organisation that aims to safeguard the right to information, dubbed China the "world's biggest captor of journalists" as it claimed that the country is holding over a score of media workers under detention. Those journalists have been detained for reporting and publishing content deemed "sensitive" by the ruling Communist Party, the watchdog also informed in its latest report titled 'An unprecedented RSF investigation: The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China'."At least 127 journalists (professional and non-professional) are currently detained by the regime," it said in the report. "The simple act of investigating a “sensitive” topic or publishing censored information can result in years of detention in unsanitary prisons, where ill-treatment can lead to death," the international body added.More than half of those include 71 Uyghur journalists, according to the report. Since 2016, in the name of the "fight against terrorism", the Beijing regime has been conducting a violent campaign against the Uyghurs.The report elucidated how the Chinese government is forcing journalists to become the mouthpiece of their regime. According to the report, journalists need to undergo 90-hour annual training partly focusing on Xi Jinping’s "Thought" in order to receive and renew their press cards.Journalists are already required to download the Study Xi, strengthen the country propaganda application that can collect their personal data, as per the report.In 2020, China’s intimidation of foreign reporters, based on surveillance and visa blackmail, forced 18 of them to leave the country, it also said.In the same year, the Chinese Communist Party also arrested "at least ten journalists and online commentators for the simple act of informing the public about the Covid-19 crisis in Wuhan," the Reporters Without Borders also said. To this date, two of them, Zhang Zhan and Fang Bin, are still under detention in China.The Chinese Communist Party has long kept a tight grip on its press and flow of information to its public. However, some press freedom groups say the ruling Chinese Communist Party has tightened control over media since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012.In February this year, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) said China used coronavirus prevention measures, intimidation and visa curbs to limit foreign reporting in 2020, citing responses to an annual survey of correspondents and interviews with bureau chiefs.The watchdog also stated that the government has increased the number of taboo topics for China. "Not only those typically deemed “sensitive” – such as Tibet, Taiwan or corruption – are subject to censorship, but also natural disasters, the #MeToo movement or even recognition of health professionals during the Covid-19 crisis," it said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-127-journalists-under-detention-for-covering-sensitive-topics-repor-101639021268979.html

But the disease will be milder than what the Delta variant led to, WHO said."Emerging data from South Africa suggests increased risk of reinfection with Omicron," World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters, adding that "there is also some evidence that Omicron causes milder disease than Delta".The new variant was found in the last week of November and since then it has now spread to around 57 countries. No death has been linked to this variant and patients are recovering without hospitalisation, without requiring oxygen support.10 things WHO confirms about Omicron1. Omicron cases have been reported in 57 countries across all WHO regions. While most of the cases identified in these countries are currently travel-related, this may change as more information becomes available, it said.2. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said the variant is efficiently transmitting and probably more efficiently transmitting than Delta, but that does not mean the virus is unstoppable.3. Even if it turns out to be less dangerous, it could still affect more people, overburden the health system, as it transmits rapidly, WHO said. 4. Even if vaccines prove less effective against Omicron, as some data indicates, they are still expected to provide significant protection against severe disease, it said.5. Regarding Omicron's impact on vaccines, WHO said, "There is a need for more data to assess whether the mutations present on the Omicron variant may result in reduced protection from vaccine-derived immunity and data on vaccine effectiveness, including the use of additional vaccination doses."6. In South Africa, seroprevalence is 60 to 80% while vaccination coverage is 35%. But Omicron has spread rapidly as it poses reinfection threats.7. On the severity of Omicron, WHO said even if the severity is equal or potentially even lower than for the Delta variant, it is expected that hospitalizations will increase if more people become infected and that there will be a time lag between an increase in the incidence of cases and an increase in the incidence of deaths.8. Providing data of 212 confirmed Omicron cases identified in 18 EU countries till December 6, WHO said all these were mild cases. South Africa saw an 82% increase in hospital admission between November 18 and December 4, but it is not known whether Omicron is the reason.9. WHO cited the forecast of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that if 1% of SARS-Cov-2 infections are due to the Omicron variant, it will become dominant in Europe by January 1, 2022.10. Though there has been no report of any severe disease from Onicrom, WHO said Interleukin-6 Receptor Blockers and corticosteroids are expected to continue to be effective in the management of patients with severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-have-higher-reinfection-risk-but-10-things-who-s-report-reveals-101639018760836.html

09-12-2021||World||Covid-19: In a first, US approves AstraZeneca antibody for cases reacting badly to vaccine||US health authorities on Wednesday authorized the use of synthetic antibodies developed by AstraZeneca to prevent Covid-19 infections in people who react badly to vaccines.It was the first time the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency authorization for such a purely preventative treatment.The FDA warned the drug Evusheld is "not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom Covid-19 vaccination is recommended" and can only be authorized for people who have a weakened immune system or those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such a strong allergic reaction.In those cases, the drug can be administered to people aged 12 and up.Evusheld combines two types of synthetic antibodies (tixagevimab and cilgavimab), and is given as two intramuscular injections, one straight after the other. These antibodies help the immune system fight off the virus by targeting its spike protein, which allows it to enter cells and infect them.The FDA said that the treatment "may be effective for pre-exposure prevention for six months."It cannot be administered to someone who is already infected with the virus, the FDA said, although AstraZeneca is testing it for such treatment.Side effects may include an allergic reaction, bleeding from the injection site, headache, and fatigue.The FDA authorization was based on a clinical trial carried out on unvaccinated people over 59 years of age, or with a chronic disease, or at high risk of infection.The drug was given to 3,500 people while 1,700 received a placebo. The trial showed that the treatment cut the risk of developing Covid-19 by 77 percent.Two cocktails of antibodies, made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, are currently authorized for prevention of infection in the United States, but only in people who have been exposed to the virus shortly before, or who have a strong chance of being exposed, such as employees of retirement homes or prisons.In addition to being immunocompromised or unvaccinated, these people must also be at high risk of developing a severe case of the disease.la/dax/jh/mdASTRAZENECAREGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-a-first-us-approves-astrazeneca-antibody-for-cases-reacting-badly-to-vaccine-101639014611916.html
09-12-2021||World||US Senate rejects Biden's Covid-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses||The Senate narrowly approved a resolution Wednesday to nullify the Biden administration's requirement that businesses with 100 or more workers have their employees be vaccinated against the coronavirus or submit to weekly testing.The vote was 52-48. The Democratic-led House is unlikely to take the measure up, which means the mandate would stand, though courts have put it on hold for now. Still, the vote gave senators a chance to voice opposition to a policy that they say has sparked fears back home from businesses and from unvaccinated constituents who worry about losing their jobs should the rule go into effect.“Every so often Washington D.C. does something that lights up the phone lines. This is one of these moments,” said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont. At home, he said, "this issue is what I hear about. This issue is a top-of-mind issue.”Lawmakers can invalidate certain federal agency regulations if a joint resolution is approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, or if Congress overrides a presidential veto. That's unlikely to happen in this case.Under the rule, private-sector companies with 100 or more workers must require their employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or be tested for the virus weekly and wear masks on the job. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it would work with companies on compliance but would fine them up to more than $13,000 for each violation, though implementation and enforcement is suspended as the litigation unfolds.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Americans who have refused to get vaccinated are the biggest impediment to ending the pandemic. He implied that some of the resistance to mandated vaccines is based on politics.“Some of the anti-vaxxers here in this chamber remind me of what happened 400 years ago when people were clinging to the fact that the sun revolved around the Earth. They just didn’t believe science. Or 500 years ago when they were sure the Earth was flat,” Schumer said.Schumer said social media has played a role in spreading falsehoods about the vaccine, and “so has the far right.” He urged senators to vote against the resolution, sponsored by Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind.Republicans said they are supportive of the vaccine, but that the mandate amounts to government overreach.“His mandates are under fire in the courts. Main Street job creators are complaining against it, and tonight, the U.S. Senate must send a clear message: back off this bad idea," Braun said.Some argued that the mandate may even contribute to people not getting vaccinated.“I think, actually, the mandate has made it worse in terms of hardening people who don’t want to be told what to do by the government,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said a telephone town hall she recently held with constituents made clear they are concerned about keeping their a job if the mandate goes into effect.“If you look at my state, 40% of my state's workforce stands to lose their job under this mandate," Capito said. “It will be a killer to our economy."In the end, two Democratic lawmakers voted with 50 Republicans to void the mandate, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. Manchin had said in a tweet that he does not support any federal vaccine mandate for private businesses. Tester's office said his opposition is based on conversations with Montana businesses who “expressed deep concerns about the negative effect on their bottom lines and our state's economy during this fragile recovery period."Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., sided with the Biden administration, noting that the pandemic is still raging and that deaths are overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated.“How on earth does it make sense right now to undercut one of the strongest tools that we have to get people vaccinated and stop this virus?” Murray said. “In what world is that a good idea?”The White House released a statement earlier this week stating that Biden's advisers would recommend he veto the resolution in the unlikely event it makes it to his desk.“The president wants to see Americans back on the job, and Americans back at work should not face risk from those who are not vaccinated and who refuse to be tested," the White House said.Deaths in the United States stemming from COVID-19 are running close to 1,600 a day on average. The overall U.S. death toll less than two years into the pandemic could soon reach 800,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-rejects-biden-s-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-private-businesses-101639013803054.html

It was found in a traveller who had arrived from South Africa and tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, he said.The new lineage has enough markers “to be able to classify it as Omicron, but we don’t know enough about it as to what that means then as far as clinical severity, vaccine effectiveness”, Aitken said. “We now have Omicron and Omicron-like.”The discovery comes as the World Health Organization said on Wednesday that the Omicron variant has been reported in 57 nations and the number of patients needing hospitalisation is likely to rise as it spreads.“Even if the severity is equal or potentially even lower than for Delta variant, it is expected that hospitalisations will increase if more people become infected and that there will be a time lag between an increase in the incidence of cases and an increase in the incidence of deaths,” the WHO, in its weekly epidemiological report, said.But WHO and US scientists separately told AFP that Omicron appears to be no worse than other coronavirus strains.While it is likely more transmissible than previous variants, “the preliminary data don’t indicate that this is more severe,” the World Health Organization’s second-in-command told AFP.“In fact, if anything, the direction is towards less severity,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in an interview on Tuesday, insisting though that more research was needed.Top US scientist Anthony Fauci echoed the WHO’s view.The new variant is “clearly highly transmissible,” very likely more so than Delta, the current dominant global strain, Fauci told AFP. “It almost certainly is not more severe than Delta,” he said. “There is some suggestion that it might even be less severe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queensland-detects-new-version-of-omicron-101639011646342.html

She then left office by motorcade for the last time as her staff looked on, applauding.Scholz led his Social Democrats from a deep poll deficit to victory in the September 26 election. The 63-year-old, who turned emulating Merkel in style and substance into a winning strategy, forged Germany’s first national “traffic light” coalition with the ecologist Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, nicknamed after the parties’ colours.Their four-year pact sealed late last month is called “Dare for More Progress”, a hat tip to Social Democratic chancellor Willy Brandt’s historic 1969 pledge to “Dare for More Democracy”.The alliance aims to slash carbon emissions, overhaul decrepit digital infrastructure, modernise citizenship laws, lift the minimum wage and have Germany join a handful of countries worldwide in legalising marijuana.Congratulations pour inFrench President Emmanuel Macron congratulated Scholz, pledging “we will write the next chapter together” while EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she looked forward to cooperation for a “strong Europe”.Scholz’s office announced his first official visit would take him to Paris and Brussels Friday for talks with Macron, von der Leyen and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg.Vladimir Putin said Russia was offering “constructive ties” with the new government, while China’s Xi Jinping said Beijing was willing to work with Scholz to “promote bilateral ties to a new level”.The new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has pledged a tougher line with authoritarian states such as Russia and China after the business-driven pragmatism of the Merkel years.Greens co-leader Baerbock is one of eight women in Germany’s first gender-balanced cabinet. “That corresponds to the society we live in - half of the power belongs to women,” Scholz, who describes himself as a “feminist”, said this week.Challenging road aheadScholz and his team promise stability just as France braces for a bitterly fought presidential election next year and Europe grapples with the enduring aftershocks of Brexit.However, a vicious fourth Covid wave has already put the incoming coalition to the test.“We have to make a fresh start while facing down the corona pandemic -- those are the circumstances the new government is up against,” Scholz told reporters Tuesday.More than 103,000 people have died with coronavirus in Germany while new infections have surged since the weather turned cold, filling intensive care units to breaking point.Scholz has thrown his weight behind making jabs mandatory to get the pandemic under control, as Austria has done, as experts say the worst is still to come for the country’s struggling clinics.Merkel, 67, Germany’s first woman chancellor, is retiring from politics after four consecutive terms, the first post-war leader to step aside of her own accord. She leaves big shoes to fill, with large majorities of Germans approving of her leadership to the end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scholz-takes-over-as-german-chancellor-101639010915764.html
09-12-2021||World||7 UN peacekeepers killed, 3 critically injured after IED blast in Mali||Seven UN peacekeepers were killed and three critically injured when their vehicle was blasted by an improvised explosive device in central Mali on Wednesday, bringing the death toll of UN soldiers in the troubled west African nation to 19 so far this year.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said all the peacekeepers killed and injured were from Togo, and the UN peacekeeping department said the seven deaths were the highest number from a malicious act against peacekeepers in Mali this year.Mali has struggled to contain an Islamic extremist insurgency since 2012. Extremist rebels were forced from power in Mali's northern cities with the help of a French-led military operation, but they regrouped in the desert and began launching attacks on the Malian army and its allies. Insecurity has worsened with attacks on civilians and U.N. peacekeepers.In June, Col. Assimi Goita was sworn in as president of a transitional government after carrying out his second coup in nine months. Mali faces increasing isolation from the international community over the junta's power grab. Elections are due to be held in February, though there are fears they could be delayed.Dujarric said the IED detonated in the Bandiagara region, hitting the vehicle carrying peacekeepers from Togo who were part of a U.N. logistics convoy traveling from Douentza to Sevare. The U.N. peacekeeping department said the soldiers were travelling in an armored personnel carrier.The 19 peacekeepers who have lost their lives in Mali this year include eight from Togo, three from Egypt including one who died Monday from injuries suffered in an attack in northern Mali last month, four from Ivory Coast and four from Chad, the U.N. said.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Malian authorities “to spare no effort in identifying the perpetrators of this attack so that they can be brought to justice swiftly,” Dujarric said.He said the U.N. chief sends condolences to the families, government and people of Togo and wishes a speedy recovery to the injured.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned the attack “in the strongest possible terms” and also called for those responsible to be held accountable.More than 87,000 peacekeepers from over 120 countries currently serve in 12 missions around the world, including about 16,600 in Mali.The attack took place as a U.N. peacekeeping ministerial summit was ending in Seoul, South Korea.U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the summit that over the last four years the U.N. has made notable progress in improving the safety and security of those serving in peacekeeping missions. But he reiterated that more needs to be done, including ensuring that missions have the required capabilities -- and more women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-un-peacekeepers-killed-3-critically-injured-after-ied-blast-in-mali-101639003687194.html
09-12-2021||World||Boris Johnson brings back ‘work from home’ guidance as Omicron tally reaches 131||U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tightened pandemic rules to curb the spread of the omicron variant, advising people to work from home and mandating the use of so-called vaccine passports in large venues.“It’s become increasingly clear that omicron is growing much faster than the previous delta variant,” Johnson said at a televised press conference on Wednesday, announcing the measures for England. It’s the “proportionate and responsible thing to do to move to Plan B,” he said.Johnson Apologizes Over Christmas Party as Covid Rules Loom (3)The activation of the so-called Plan B restrictions follows warnings that the new Covid-19 strain will overwhelm hospitals, given the U.K. has recorded a high daily caseload for months even before omicron emerged. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already had tighter restrictions in place before Johnson’s announcement.While the new rules fall far short of the lockdowns imposed previously, they still represent a significant change in approach and are politically risky for Johnson. The government had hoped an accelerated program of vaccine booster shots would mean no new restrictions would be needed over the Christmas period, after festivities were banned for many households last year.The timing is also sensitive as Johnson’s government struggles to handle the backlash over allegations his officials held a rule-breaking party in his Downing Street office last Christmas, which has provoked a public outcry. Johnson’s press secretary on Wednesday denied he attended the event last December, but the prime minister apologized in the House of Commons on Wednesday after a video emerged showing key aides joking about a party. One of them, Allegra Stratton, later offered her resignation in a tearful statement.The saga has angered even MPs in Johnson’s Conservative Party, one of whom accused him of using tougher Covid rules as a “diversionary tactic.”Johnson had previously said he would wait to see evidence of Omicron’s impact on hospitalizations and deaths before reviewing Britain’s pandemic rules. Wednesday’s announcement comes as the U.K. recorded 131 new confirmed cases of the omicron variant, bringing the total to 568. Neil Ferguson, a government scientific advisor whose modeling led to the first pandemic lockdown, said Wednesday that the incidence of the omicron strain is doubling every two to three days in Britain, meaning it will likely become the dominant variant before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-brings-back-work-from-home-guidance-as-omicron-tally-reaches-131-101638988872547.html
09-12-2021||World||Canada joins US, other countries in diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics||Canada said Wednesday it will join the United States and other countries in a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics in February."As many (of our) partners around the world, we are extremely concerned by the repeated human rights violations by the Chinese government," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference."That is why we are announcing today that we will not be sending any diplomatic representation to the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games this winter."Canadian athletes will compete in the Games, he said.The move follows the United States announcing Monday its diplomatic boycott, over what Washington termed China's "genocide" of the Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region and other human rights abuses.Australia and Britain also said Wednesday that their officials would stay away.The allies have a growing discord with China over a slew of issues that has plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.Canada in particular saw its relations with China plunge into a deep freeze over Beijing's detention of two Canadian nationals in response to Canada's arrest on a US warrant of Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder.All three were released and repatriated in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-joins-us-other-countries-in-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics-101638988976776.html
09-12-2021||India||In Muzaffarpur’s health care tragedy, the eyes don’t have it||The hospital records get his name wrong -- Mushul Darzi instead of Mohammad Muslim Darzi. The one word they get right is crucial to his identity -- Darzi means tailor. He is 60 years old, from the village of Mahant Maniyari, 15km away from the district headquarters of Muzaffarpur. On November 22, Darzi was one of 65 people that came to the Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital for a cataract surgery. Since then, he has had purulent discharge and pain in his left eye, and now fears that he will lose his vision, and his livelihood. Two weeks later, his sewing machine lies in a corner of his one-room Indira Awaas home, quietly gathering dust.Darzi is not alone in his suffering. The eye camp at the hospital has left 30 people suffering from endophthalmitis, which is an inflammation of the eye caused by a bacterial infection from a botched cataract surgery. At least 15 of them have had to get one of their eyes “eviscerated”, which is the surgical removal of the eye’s contents, leaving the scleral shell and extraocular muscles intact. Darzi is one of those under medication -- he has both eyes, for now.“All I want to do now is to stay home and stitch clothes with whatever vision I have left. I need to earn money so my family can eat two square meals a day,” said Darzi, the sole regular bread earner of the family with a 58-year-old wife Aisha Khatoon, a differently abled son Mohhamad Jalaluddin, 34, who works occasionally at a private tent house, daughter-in-law Sabrunnisha, 30, and four grandchildren.The tragedy in the last week of November has put the spotlight on Bihar’s health care apparatus, with ill-equipped government structures, a burgeoning private sector that is openly flouting norms of safety and care, and patients such as Darzi who are caught in between, often with dire consequences.At 77.6%, the share of households that do not use a government facility when sick was the second highest in Bihar -- it was the highest in Uttar Pradesh -- at the time of the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey. 60% of people who did not use government facilities reported ‘poor quality of care’ as a reason, the biggest reason for the state among five options given to respondents.TRUST DEFICITImmediately after the events in Muzaffarpur, the Bihar government offered Darzi and the other victims of endophthalmitis free treatment at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), a multi-discipline super specialty government health care centre in Patna. The risk to his eye and livelihood notwithstanding, Darzi does not want to go to a government centre. He does not believe he will come out alive.“I know any further delay can lead to loss of vision in one eye, but I am not going to any government health care centre where they may take out my eye, or anything else can happen. I am not sure if I will return. I have a responsibility to marry my granddaughter Roshan Khatoon, who has turned 17 years of age,” said Darzi.The fear comes from lived experience. The first time Darzi went to a heath care facility for treatment to his eye, it was a private institution, Lahan Eye Centre at Harisabha Chowk in Muzaffarpur in May 2020. The procedure, on his right eye, went smoothly but cost him ₹11,000. But Covid had hit business, and when Darzi wanted another cataract procedure, this time on his left eye, he went to what he believed was a “semi-government” centre.He had two reasons to believe that the Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital had government linkages. First, its website mentions the Tirhut divisional commissioner as the president of the hospital’s managing committee. Second, the government, until recently, reimbursed the hospital ₹2,000 for every cataract surgery done free of cost under the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCBVI) before the pact ended in March this year.In truth, the Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital was founded by Sant Shree Biragi Baba as a charitable institution in 1973 under the Societies Registration Act, and the hospital is managed by a committee headed by the commissioner of the Tirhut division as ex-officio president.On November 22, Darzi was charged only ₹50 for registration, and ₹30 for a blood sugar investigation. In less than a week, however, he and 30 others were battling for their eyesight.GOVERNMENT ACTION The government ordered the closure of the hospital OT on December 4, lodged an FIR against the hospital management, including the doctor who operated on the patients, and instituted government inquiries. The police complaint names 14 accused, but no arrests have been made yet.The government also instructed all districts on December 2 to refer those facing post-operation complications to IGIMS for further treatment. “We sent patient lists to districts and advised civil surgeons of Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Sheohar and Samastipur, to track the patients and promptly refer them to the IGIMS for free medical treatment, in case of any complications,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar.A government inquiry report, dated December 2, by a four-member district level committee headed by additional chief medical officer Dr Subhash Singh said that the cataract operations “prima facie” pointed to medical negligence. A subsequent swab culture report on December 3, a copy of which is with HT, isolated the presence of “Gram Negative bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa)”, indicating that the outbreak was linked to improper sterilisation of the OT, said a doctor at Muzaffarpur’s Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH), requesting anonymity. Based on the microbiology report, the committee in its final report to the civil surgeon on December 6, gave a clean chit to the operating surgeon and concluded that infected equipment in the operation theatre was the source of infection. HT has a copy of the inquiry report.The doctor conducting the surgeries, however, also broke protocol with the number of surgeries conducted in a day -- as high as 65. “As per the national guideline for doing eye camp surgeries, a doctor should not do more than 25-30 surgeries in a day,” said Dr Rajvardhan Azad, former chief of the Rajendra Prasad Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi.The inquiry headed by Dr Harish Chandra Ojha also found that there were no tiles inside the walls of OT, an important prerequisite, and that the hospital did not have any regular doctors on its rolls, and engaged doctors on a daily basis depending on the caseload at the eye camps. When patients returned to the hospital with complications in their eyes a couple of days after the cataract surgery, an optometrist examined the patients in the absence of regular doctors, the inquiry report said.Efforts to reach Tirhut divisional commissioner Mihir Kumar Singh were unsuccessful. While one of his official numbers was switched off, the other number, mentioned on the website of the Muzaffarpur district administration website, said: “Incoming call facility to the dialled number is currently not available.” HT also tried to reach the doctor that conducted the operations, but he was unavailable for comment as well.FAILING HEALTH CAREIt is not without reason that Darzi prefers a private centre for treatment. Just a kilometre away from Darzi’s residence is the additional primary health centre (APHC) at Mahant Maniyari village. The outdoor patient department (OPD) and in-patient department (IPD) facilities there are non-existent. Since the incident, an optometrist from a private hospital comes for around 90 minutes to check the vision of patients once a week.All the APHC has in the name of equipment are two weighing scales — one for adults and another for infants. It has all of 30 medicines, mostly antibiotics, pain killers and paracetamol tablets in its formulary. Despite the posting of three general duty medical officers, Dr Pooja Singh was the lone medical officer present around noon on December 4, when this reporter visited the two-room APHC. What was earlier the operation theatre (OT) of the Mahant Maniyari Darshan Das Hospital, a private health facility, which now houses the government APHC, is a junkyard. The ward where patients were once admitted is now a storehouse of wheat, cattle fodder, and hay.“The OT existed between 1982 and 1989-90. Doctors of SKMCH used to come to do post-mortem examination and surgery,” said Anand Gaurav, a local resident.The district hospital in Muzaffarpur, 15km away, is only a shade better. There is an OPD for eye patients, but no IPD. It is among 16 of 36 district hospitals in Bihar that does not have an operation theatre for eye surgeries, according to the state programme officer for blindness control Dr Harish Chandra Ojha.What passes off as equipment is a chart to check for vision, and a torch. The ophthalmoscope has not been functional for the last two years. It does not have basic tools such as an autorefractor which is a microscope used during eye examinations. The hospital does not have an OT even for minor surgical procedures either.In terms of manpower, it has only two doctors. Dr Nitu Kumari is a specialist eye surgeon, and Dr Vaidhehi Kumari is an MBBS with a one-year diploma in ophthalmology. In the absence of basic equipment, both are doing what is an optometrist’s job, the doctors admit. “We are in the process of making an eye OT and purchasing necessary equipment for management of eye complications at the district hospital. As of now, we refer all cases of cataract surgery to SKMCH,” said Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma, civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur.Despite being a tertiary care centre, SKMCH does not have the equipment for phacoemulsification or a Femto laser, which are advanced methods of doing cataract surgeries and require minimal incisions. At best, small incision cataract surgeries (SICS) are done at the hospital, said doctors at SKMCH, requesting anonymity.PRIVATE SECTOR PUSHGiven the poor infrastructure of government health care facilities, it is not surprising that private doctors and facilities, including NGOs, have conducted 95% of the total 67,224 cataract surgeries done in Bihar till October this year, as against a target of 345,600 surgeries as per the approved allocations under the National Health Mission for the financial year 2021-22.There are around 54 private facilities, including NGOs, empanelled with the government and eligible for reimbursement of ₹2,000 per cataract surgery under NPCBVI in Bihar.The Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital, which reported the botched cataract surgeries, was one such empanelled with the government till March 2021. The hospital performed 259,631 surgeries in its 48 years of existence, of which nearly 75% surgeries were through eye camps, says the hospital website.“The empanelment ended earlier this year. Moreover, the hospital did not take our permission before conducting the eye camp,” said Dr Sharma, the civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur.Experts want the state government to frame a common minimum standard for organising such camps. “The government should lay down the minimum infrastructure required in terms of manpower, infrastructure, material required, sterilisation of equipment, OT fumigation, etc. for organising eye camps,” said Dr Azad, who is the chairman of the Bihar State University Service Commission.He said that the government should constitute a high-power committee, comprising doctors and administrators, to check the quality of infrastructure before an eye camp. It should also be mandatory to take permission for eye camps from a district-level committee of doctors and administrators, he added.“The system of applying for permission to hold an eye camp should be online. The organiser should mention its track record and submit it online, along with a checklist of available infrastructure. The number of surgeries should be checked as well,” added Dr Azad.“We are examining the inquiry report threadbare and will try to put in place a system, having proper checks and balance, so that such incidents do not recur,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s the state’s additional chief secretary, health.
09-12-2021||India||Sudha Bharadwaj walks out of prison after 3 years||Activist Sudha Bharadwaj walked out of jail around noon on Thursday after spending three years and three months in prison on charges of allegedly fomenting violence in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village in 2018. Byculla jail superintendent Yashwant Phad said that they received court papers ordering the release of Bharadwaj on Thursday morning. After due verification of the court orders and completing subsequent formalities, she was allowed to leave the jail premises at about 12.15 pm. Dressed in blue salwar-kurta, Bhardwaj stepped in a car waiting for her outside the jail and left. “It is the first crack in the wholly fabricated case and it will only get wider,” said Payoshi Roy, advocate for Bharadwaj. She declined to comment further on the release. “We are extremely happy at Sudha’s release. But the HC order 1.12.21 overlooked the default bail applications filed at the same time by her co-accused. So HC should take suo-moto notice in the constitution of life and liberty that her 8 co-accused too are entitled to default bail,” said Civil Rights Activists and lawyer, Susan Abhraham.On Wednesday, the special National Investigation Agency court in Mumbai ordered Bharadwaj released on A cash bail of ₹50,000. She was lodged in the Byculla women’s prison on charges of terrorism and conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. A day before, the Supreme Court dismissed appeal filed by the NIA challenging the Bombay high court’s December 1 order that granted default bail plea of the 60-year-old trade unionist and lawyer. It was not clear where she will stay because the NIA court restrained her from leaving its jurisdiction in Mumbai. Her lawyers refused to divulge the location where the activist will be residing during the pendency of the trial. She had asked the court for permission to go back to Chhattisgarh or Delhi, but the request was turned down.On December 1, the Bombay HC allowed default bail to Bharadwaj, underlining that a Pune sessions judge, who granted police a 90-day extension on November 26, 2018, to file the charge sheet, did not have jurisdiction to do so as only a special NIA court could hear UAPA cases. The HC pointed out that the Pune sessions court was not notified as a special court under the NIA Act. Also, there was already a special NIA court in existence in Pune at the relevant time, it had noted.Bharadwaj is the first person in the high-profile case to be granted default bail. The high court rejected the bail applications of eight co-accused, all of whom face terrorism and conspiracy charges under the UAPA. One of the other accused, poet Varavara Rao, is out on medical bail, and a second accused, Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, died in July.The activists are accused of delivering inflammatory speeches during an event called Elgar Parishad organised in Pune on December 31, 2017. The activists have denied all charges and accused the prosecution of planting evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sudha-bharadwaj-walks-out-of-prison-after-3-years-101639074579975.html
09-12-2021||India||Democratic principles should guide global governance: PM Modi||The principles of democracy should guide global governance and technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday at the Summit for Democracy hosted by US President Joe Biden. Modi made the remarks at a virtual leaders’ plenary session that was hosted by Biden and held behind closed doors, according to people familiar with the matter. The prime minister is participating in the two-day event at Biden’s invitation and the plenary session witnessed interventions from leaders of only 12 countries. Democratic spirit, including respect for rule of law and pluralistic ethos, is ingrained in Indians, and the Indian diaspora carries it too, contributing to the economic well-being and social harmony of their adopted homes, Modi told the session, according to the people cited above. “The prime minister stressed that principles of democracy should guide global governance, and given technology’s ability to impact democracy positively or negatively, technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies,” one of the people cited above said. Modi emphasised the need for democratic countries to deliver on values enshrined in their constitutions, and outlined sensitivity, accountability, participation and reform orientation as the four pillars of Indian democratic governance. He also recalled India’s Constituent Assembly had held its first session on this same day 75 years ago. He highlighted India’s civilisational ethos as one of the original sources of democracy. Biden is hosting the virtual summit for leaders from government, civil society and the private sector to focus on challenges and opportunities facing democracies worldwide. The summit will provide a platform to the leaders to announce individual and collective commitments, reforms and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad, according to the US state department. “As the world’s largest democracy, India has commended this innovative initiative. India has always stood ready to share its experiences with fellow democracies,” another person said on condition of anonymity. A second closed-door leaders’ plenary session was hosted on Thursday by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Official interventions by leaders of numerous countries were also live streamed on the website of the Summit for Democracy. Modi will deliver India’s national statement on Friday. In his opening remarks at the summit, Biden highlighted the challenges being faced by democracy worldwide. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident, we have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said. “Because the data we are seeing is largely pointing in the wrong direction. Freedom House reports that 2020 marked the 15th consecutive year of global freedom in retreat. Another recent report from the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance noted more than half of all democracies have experienced a decline in at least one aspect of their democracy over the last 10 years, including the US,” he said. These trends are being exacerbated by global challenges that can be addressed by shared efforts, Biden said. Biden announced the establishment of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, for which the US will provide $424.4 million in 2020. Under this initiative, the US with like-minded partners to defend and sustain democratic resilience. These efforts will focus on the five areas – supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, advancing technology for democracy, and defending free and fair elections and political processes. 
09-12-2021||India||Expert panel to meet over booster shot today||The national drugs regulator’s subject expert committee is likely to meet on Friday to consider the application of Serum Institute of India , to use its Covishield vaccine as a booster dose, and an application from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, for a Phase 3- trial to evaluate the Sputnik-V vaccine’s efficacy as a booster, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.“When the subject expert committee meets, the applicants are provided an opportunity to present their case; there may not be a decision on it just as yet,” an official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. The meeting comes even as preliminary data on the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus shows a reduction in the quantum of antibodies produced, suggesting the need for a booster – although the strength of an immune reaction depends not just on antibodies but also on T-cells. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which has a partnership with RDIF, for Suptnik-V, has sought permission from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to conduct a phase-3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sputnik Light vaccine as a booster dose. Earlier, Serum Institute of India sought approval for Covishield as a booster dose from India’s drugs regulator citing adequate stock of the vaccine in the country and a demand for a booster shot due to the emergence of new coronavirus variants. In its application, the companythat the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has already approved the booster dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Covishield is the India-made version of this vaccine. Serum Institute of India, as part of its partnership deal with RDIF, will also be manufacturing Sputnik Light in India. The World Health Organisation’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) that met on Tuesday to evaluate the need for a booster dose against Covid-19, also recommended that people who are immunocompromised or have received an inactivated vaccine should be prioritized to receive a booster dose.The chairman, SAGE, Alejandro Cravioto, said in a briefing on Thursday that emerging data showed Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially among the older population group.India’s expert panel on immunisation, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), is currently deliberating the issue of allowing booster dose in the national immunization programme.“The decision will take place based on the scientific evidence before the panel and what they recommend,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.
09-12-2021||India||Reopening of Guj riots probe to affect trial in cases already decided: SIT to SC||Any attempt to reopen the “larger conspiracy” probe into the 2002 Gujarat riots will affect trials in cases already decided, and impact appeals pending before the higher courts, the special investigation team (SIT) told the Supreme Court on Thursday as the top court reserved its judgment challenging a closure report in which the SIT gave a clean chit to 63 people. One of the people exonerated was Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat.The SIT, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said, “If this court is to direct the magistrate to again start off the complaint, imagine what impact it will have on the trial and appeals pending in Supreme Court and Gujarat high court. People will have to be retried and convictions will have to be set aside.”Rohatgi was responding to a petition -- filed by Zakia Jafri, the widow of slain Congress MP Ahsan Jafri, and social activist Teesta Setalvad -- accusing the SIT of not probing evidence into an alleged larger conspiracy involving politicians, bureaucrats, police officials, public prosecutors, and members of religious outfits. Jafri made a complaint in this regard in 2006, and the Supreme Court directed the SIT to examine the allegations. In February 2012, the SIT filed a closure report on the complaint that was challenged by the petitioners.Reserving orders on the petition after a hearing that extended for 14 days, a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar allowed the parties to file any additional notes within a week.Rohatgi said, “What does the petitioner think SIT is? I do not go around with a farmaan (diktat) arresting people. To say I should have arrested those named in the sting tapes (run by Tehelka magazine at the time) is completely unfounded. What is the probative value of these tapes is a different thing. But in the eyes of law, it is only an extra-judicial confession... The trump card of the sting (operation) has actually no sting in it.”Out of the 18 persons named in the sting tapes, the SIT took statements of 13 persons, and the material contained in the sting was found to be unreliable, Rohatgi added.He also alleged that the petitioner conveniently chose to add the names of some accused and deleted some by relying on subsequent statements, which resulted in 50 names being added to the original complaint containing 63 names. The SIT also accused the petitioner of presenting a “doctored” copy of the original complaint in the Supreme Court and said, “They have not replied to the doctoring of complaint. If this is not answered, they cannot get a hearing in this court.”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioners, said that the SIT has made several new disclosures before the top court that were not made before the Gujarat high court, which had dismissed Jafri’s petition in October 2017.Over 1000 people were killed in the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, according to a statement issued by the Central government to Parliament in May 2005.The court did not indicate when a verdict will be delivered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reopening-of-gujarat-riots-probe-will-affect-trial-in-cases-already-decided-sit-to-supreme-court-101639073619469.html
09-12-2021||India||PM leads last respects as India mourns its soldiers, their chief||: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid his last respects to the 13 people killed in a Mi-17V5 helicopter crash near Coonoor a day earlier --- including chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, and his defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder --- after an Indian Air Force C-130J special operations aircraft flew their mortal remains from Sulur to the Palam air base in Delhi, in a sombre ceremony attended by the close relatives of those who perished, defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, and the three service chiefs. The PM arrived at the Palam technical area shortly before 9pm, paid floral tributes on each of the 13 coffins with folded hands and a bowed head and interacted with the kin of the deceased, including Rawat’s daughters Kritika and Tarini. The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, is battling for his life at a military hospital in Bengaluru. Earlier in the day, defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament that a top three-star officer is heading an inquiry into the crash. The chopper took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am and lost contact with the air traffic control (ATC) at Sulur at 12.08pm, seven minutes before it was scheduled to land in Wellington. Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers there. The last rites of Rawat, Madhulika and Lidder will be performed at the Brar Square in Delhi Cantonment on Friday. The schedule for the last rites of the remaining nine people has not been finalised yet as the “process for positive identification of their mortal remains is still on”, a senior officer said. “Their mortal remains will be kept at the mortuary of Army Base Hospital till the completion of positive identification formalities,” the officer said, adding appropriate military funerals of all deceased are being planned in consultation with their family members. The Coonoor crash is of one of the worst air accidents involving India’s top military brass, and a setback to the ongoing military reforms in the country, the biggest since Independence. Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. He took over as the CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as the army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years. Rawat survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur in February 3, 2015. He was a lieutenant general at that time. PROBE BEGINSThe tri-service inquiry into the crash under Air Marshal Manavendra Singh has already begun its work, Rajnath told Parliament. Air Marshal Manavendra Singh is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Training Command in Bengaluru. “With profound grief and heavy heart, I stand to convey the unfortunate news of the crash of the military helicopter in the noon of December 8, 2021, with India’s first Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat onboard,” Singh said. In his statement, the defence minister gave out the timeline of the developments before the crash. The helicopter took off from Sulur at 11:48am and was expected to land at Wellington by 12:15pm but the ATC at Sulur lost contact with the helicopter at 12:08pm, he said. After the crash, the minister said some locals spotted a fire in the forest near Coonoor and rushed to the spot where they sighted the helicopter’s wreckage engulfed in flames. Rescue teams from the local administration reached the site and attempted to recover the survivors from the crash site, he said. “All those recovered from the wreckage were rushed to the Military Hospital, Wellington. Out of the total 14 persons onboard the ill-fated helicopter, 13 succumbed to their injuries,” he said, reading out the names of all the people killed in the crash --- the CDS, Madhulika Rawat, Brig Lidder, Lt Col Harjinder Singh, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan (pilot), Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh (co-pilot), Junior Warrant Officers Rana Pratap Das and Arakkal Pradeep, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitendra Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja. The minister said Group Captain Varun Singh was on life support at the Military Hospital in Wellington and all efforts are being made to save him. The group captain was moved to the IAF Command Hospital in Bengaluru later in the day. The CDS will be cremated with full military honours, the minister said. “I, on behalf of the august House, pay homage to the deceased persons and express condolences to the bereaved families,” said an emotional Singh.

This restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA,” the circular said.“However, international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on case to case basis,” it added.Scheduled international passenger services have been suspended since March 23, 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May 2020 and under bilateral air bubble arrangements since July 2020.India has air bubble pacts with 31 countries, including the US, UK, UAE and France. However, passengers arriving from 12 “at risk” regions (countries in Europe including the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Ghana, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Hong Kong, Israel) have to be mandatorily tested even after their arrivals, wait for their report at the airport and home quarantine for seven days if they test negative on arrival. These passengers are also asked to watch their health from the eighth till the 14th day.Singapore, which was part of the list, was removed on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-extends-international-flight-ban-till-january-end-amid-omicron-scare-101639073381027.html
09-12-2021||India||Calcutta HC quashes ‘hate speech’ charges against actor Mithun Chakraborty||Six months after the Kolkata Police booked him for allegedly inciting violence by repeating certain lines from the script of a popular action film while campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the March-April Bengal assembly polls, actor Mithun Chakraborty on Thursday was pronounced innocent by a single judge bench of the Calcutta high court. Chakraborty, who joined the BJP on March 7, was virtually questioned by the police several times after a complaint was lodged on May 6 by Mrityunjay Pal, a Kolkata resident. Pal alleged that Chakraborty used a monologue from one of his popular Bengali movies in which his character described himself as a cobra whose bite could kill anyone. In June, Chakraborty moved the high court, seeking quashing of the charges. He was represented by seven lawyers headed by Mahesh Jethmalani. In Thursday’s order, Justice Kausik Chanda said: “Needless to mention that if allegations made in the first information report (FIR), even if taken at the face value do not, prima facie, constitute any offence justifying an investigation by the police, the High Court in the exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal procedure, 1973, can quash the investigation to prevent the abuse of the process of law. The law in this regard has been settled by the judgment of the Supreme Court in a number of cases.” “I am of the view that since the petitioner does not deny the fact that he uttered the said dialogues and the context in which he said (the) dialogues were delivered is also not denied, any further police investigation of the present case will be an unnecessary and vexatious exercise,” said the order. Treated as an icon in Bengal, the former superstar of Hindi cinema joined the BJP at the party’s first election rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a mammoth crowd. He picked up the BJP flag from top leaders an hour before Modi arrived. Chakraborty used the controversial monologue in his speech on that day. It was heard again in the districts. Chakraborty campaigned extensively, leading as many as three roadshows on some days. The BJP allotted a chopper for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-quashes-hate-speech-charges-against-actor-mithun-chakraborty-101639073259892.html
09-12-2021||India||Retd brigadier says CDS Rawat's death will impact restructuring of armed forces||The death of chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat is a tragedy and going to lay an impact on the restructuring of India's armed forces, said a retired brigadier as he remembered the CDS as a very considerate and freely moving general.Brigadier (retired) V Mahalingan said he had met General Rawat, who died along with his wife Madhulika and 11 others belonging to the armed forces in a helicopter crash on Wednesday, several times.“My wife was teaching both of his daughters in the Army Public School. We have met several times…his demise is damaging and upsetting," Mahalingam was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.CDS Rawat was known for working towards tying the three services of the country - the Army, Navy and Air Force - into a digitised structure. Mahalingam said the late general was “very much involved” in the process.
09-12-2021||India||Sole survivor of Coonoor crash Group Captain Varun Singh battles for life||Group Captain Varun Singh, the sole survivor of the Mi-17 Coonoor crash in which 13 people including CDS General Bipin Rawat were killed, is battling for his life at a military hospital in Bengaluru, officials familiar with the matter said on Thursday. He is maintaining vital signs but remains critical, it is learnt. Singh was awarded a Shaurya Chakra for gallantry earlier this year for displaying outstanding courage and presence of mind while handling a rare mid-air emergency involving the light combat aircraft (LCA) he was flying last year. The decorated fighter pilot was moved from the Military Hospital at Wellington to the Indian Air Force Command Hospital in Bengaluru on Thursday, the officials said. Two doctors from the command hospital accompanied the group captain to Bengaluru. “My thoughts are with Gp Capt Varun Singh who has survived the tragic chopper crash. I pray for his speedy recovery and long life,” President Ram Nath Kovind wrote on Twitter. An inquiry has been ordered into the crash. President Kovind conferred Shaurya Chakra, India’s third-highest peacetime gallantry medal, on Singh four months ago. Singh was a wing commander at that time. On October 12, 2020, he was flying a test sortie in the LCA when an emergency developed due to the failure of cockpit pressurisation at high altitude. This was an unprecedented catastrophic failure that had never occurred.“There was rapid loss of altitude, with the aircraft pitching up and down viciously. Despite being in extreme physical and mental stress in an extreme life-threatening situation, he maintained exemplary composure and regained control of the aircraft, thereby exhibiting exceptional flying skills,” Singh’s citation said. “He displayed extraordinary courage and skill to safely land the fighter aircraft. The pilot went beyond the call of duty and landed the aircraft taking calculated risks. This allowed an accurate analysis of the fault on the indigenously designed fighter and further institution of preventive measures against recurrence,” it added. Singh wrote an emotional letter to the principal of his alma mater, Army Public School in Chandimandir, months before the accident, thanking the school and his teachers for their mentorship in his formative years which resulted in him receiving the Shaurya Chakra. “I credit this prestigious award to all those I have been associated with over the years in school, National Defence Academy and thereafter the Indian Air Force, as I firmly believe that my actions that day were a result of the grooming and mentoring by my teachers, instructors and peers over the years.” Varun wrote. “I was faced with a grave and critical failure in my aircraft. The standard operation procedure (SOP) required me to eject and abandon the aircraft. However, I took a few calculated risks and managed to land the aircraft without any damage to either the aircraft or civilians,” he wrote. He concluded his letter by writing an inspiring message for the children at school. He said he was a mediocre student in school but found his passion for aviation at a later stage. “It is ok to be mediocre… Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best... Never lose hope, never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be,” Singh wrote. He added, “I was mediocre, and today I have reached difficult milestones in my career.” He wrote the letter on September 18.Singh is directing staff (air) at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington. He wrote the letter in Wellington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sole-survivor-of-coonoor-crash-group-captain-varun-singh-battles-for-life-101639072722902.html
09-12-2021||India||‘Will be good if Congress, TMC approaches converge’: P Chidambaram in Goa||PANAJI: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Thursday said it is important that all parties including Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress come together to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The former home minister’s call for convergence in approach comes amid tension between the two opposition parties after the Trinamool Congress continued to poach leaders and legislators from the Congress in Haryana, Goa and Meghalaya to expand its footprint.At her meetings in Mumbai last month, she also floated the idea of an opposition front minus the Congress. “What is UPA? There is no UPA,” Banerjee told reporters after meeting Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. The Congress brushed aside the remark, underlining that Banerjee didn’t have a locus standi to speak on UPA since she wasn’t a part of the grouping.Asked to respond to Banerjee’s multiple jabs at the Congress in recent weeks, Chidambaram said Banerjee was a friend of his and hoped the parties could come together.Also Read: Can the Trinamool Congress replace the Congress as the main opposition party?“She is a friend of mine. I have known her for over 20-25 years now. She has got a particular approach, we have an approach, it would be good for the country if the two approaches can converge,” said Chidambaram, also the Congress’s senior political observer for Goa said.Banerjee’s party has announced that it will contest the Goa elections and has been working to build alliances with local regional parties and civil society groups ahead of assembly elections early next year. Among those seen as a potential Trinamool ally was Goa Forward Party’s Vijay Sardesai. But Sardesai sprung a surprise on Banerjee’s party last week when he tweeted photos of his meeting with Congres leader Rahul Gandhi and pledged his party’s support for the Congress.Chidambaram said he felt that Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s statement that all the erstwhile UPA parties must come together again and Congress should take initiative is “the correct statement”.“I think he has made a very responsible statement. What he says is, we need a non-BJP opposition in the country and the Congress party must take the lead and bring together all the UPA parties. I think that is a very sensible statement. I fully agree with Sanjay Raut,” said Chidambaram, who is in the state to oversee the Congress’s electoral preparedness.Asked about the alliance between the Goa Forward Party and the Congress for the 2022 Assembly polls in the coastal state, Chidambaram said “The word alliance is used indiscriminately... So far, we had one party leader (GFP chief) Vijai Sardesai who came to Delhi and said, “in order to defeat the BJP, my party offers support to the Congress’. Rahul Gandhi said we accept the support. All other details have to be discussed further,” Chidambaram said.“We think that the Congress party is strong enough to defeat the BJP (in Goa). If other parties want to support the Congress, they are welcome to support the Congress. But the Congress party is strong enough to defeat the BJP in 2022,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-be-good-if-congress-tmc-approaches-converge-p-chidambaram-in-goa-101639072238659.html

09-12-2021||India||Coonoor crash 2nd high-profile accident involving Mi-17V5||The December 8 Mi-17V5 crash near Coonoor was the second high-profile accident involving the Indian Air Force’s latest helicopter inducted in 2012, and the air force currently operates around 145 such Russian-origin choppers that are known to be advanced, reliable and safe, IAF officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The twin-engine Mi-17V5 is the latest version of Mi-17 helicopter operated by the IAF. India contracted a total of 151 Mi-17V5 helicopters from Russia in two separate deals. At least six Mi-17V5s have been lost in accidents since their induction began around a decade ago.On February 27, 2019, a day after the IAF bombed a terror base in Pakistan’s Balakot, an air force unit shot down a Mi-17V5 helicopter in friendly fire near Srinagar. The helicopter was shot down the day Pakistan launched its fighter jets to target Indian installations in Jammu and Kashmir in response to the Balakot airstrike.A surface-to-air missile brought down the utility helicopter, killing six IAF personnel on-board and a civilian on ground and raising questions about whether the ground crew, including air traffic controllers, had followed standard operating procedures.The IAF was on its highest alert levels that day as it expected Pakistan to respond to the unprecedented peace-time cross-border airstrike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot on February 26.The reliability of the Mi-17V5 helicopters cannot be doubted, said Air Chief Marshal Fali Major (retd), a former IAF chief and helicopter pilot. He had commissioned the first squadron of the air force’s older Mi-17 helicopters.“I have flown thousands of hours on the Mi-17 helicopters. Its latest version, the Mi-17V5, is a rugged, reliable and advanced platform. I have great respect for the helicopter. I am amazed how it went down. The inquiry ordered will look into every possible aspect of the crash,” the Major said. He said the Mi-17V5 had the best safety record in IAF service.Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, who is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, has logged close to 7,000 flying hours in his 39-year career and operated in challenging sectors such as Siachen, the North-east, Uttarakhand, the western sector and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is one of the most competent officers in the IAF to head the tri-services inquiry, officials said.Developed by Russian Helicopters, the Mi-17V5 is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment. The Mi-17V5 can carry a load of around four tonne in a full cargo role. It can also insert assault forces behind the enemy lines, a role frequently demonstrated by the IAF during military exercises.The helicopter is equipped with modern avionics, a self-defence system and other advanced features that enhance its survivability. The Mi-17V5, which has an armoured cockpit, can be fitted with rockets, cannons and small arms for carrying out offensive roles. It has a service ceiling of 6,000 metre, top speed of 250 kmph and a maximum range of around 1,180 km with additional fuel tanks.“Any aircraft accident is shocking. The Mi-17V5 has a good flight safety record, it’s a reliable machine and pilots swear by it,” Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), former additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies, said on Wednesday.The helicopter, capable of day and night missions in adverse weather conditions, has been extensively used in the Ladakh sector where India and China have been locked in a lingering border standoff since May 2020.

Tejashwi, RJD supremo Lalu Yadav's younger son and Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly, tied the knot with Rachel Godinho in a low-key event very few had knowledge about till yesterday. Dozens of close friends and relatives, including Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, were present at the wedding. Akhilesh's and Tejashwi's families are related as Lalu Yadav's youngest daughter got married to Mulayam Singh Yadav's grandnephew in 2015."Blessings to "Arjun" for starting a new inning of life.

09-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 10, 1971 – Navy deals more deadly blows||- Prized submarine Ghazi sunk- Another daring raid on Karachi port- Pak intrusions across Tawi nipped in bud- Dacca awaits its doomNew Delhi -The Indian Navy has had another field day. Hell bent on destroying the enemy’s naval might, it conducted two daring raids today in the Arabian Sea, one on the Makran coast near the Pakistan-Iran border and the other on the naval installations in Karachi harbour where, only few days ago, three Pakistani Destroyers were sent to the bottom of the sea.The sinking of the second and the biggest Pakistani submarine, the U.S. built ‘Ghazi’ off Visakhapatnam by Indian Destroyers on the night of Dec. 3, the day Pakistan declared war on India, was confirmed by the Eastern Naval Command on the basis of tell-tale, evidence -and the Defence Minister, Mr Jagjivan Ram, hastened to share the good news with cheering ‘members of the two Houses of Parliament.While details of the damage inflicted on the enemy by the Western fleet today are awaited four ships are believed to have been either sunk or heavily damaged. Karachi reports said that in one of their heaviest raids last night, the Indian Air Force sank one merchant ship and damaged two others in Karachi harbour.The myth of the impregnability of the Karachi naval base has thus been destroyed. As Vice Admiral Kohli, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Fleet stated: "The Indian Navy is in command of the high seas and we can go wherever we want. The entire coast of Pakistan right up to the border of Iran is now vulnerable to the guns of the Indian Naval ships.Having liberated the strategic inland river port of Chandpur on the Meghna, 64 kilometers south of Dacca and Daudkandi, about 33 kilometers east, the Indian Army is tightening the noose round the city. Combined columns of the Army and Mukti Bahini are now poised for a thrust towards the Bangla Desh Capital. A few rivers have to be crossed before the advancing forces contact the city's outer defences. The possibility of a last ditch battle by the fleeing enemy troops there is not ruled out.While Comilla town was freed yesterday, remnants of Pakistani troops were still in the Nainamati Cantonment, which is under siege with all escape routes plugged. Indian troops have also captured Ashugunj, east of Meghna in the north, and taken 300 razakars. The Army formations proceeding from Jessore have contacted the outer defences of Kushtia and are marching in the northern sector towards Rangpur and Dinajpur, where bitter fighting is reported. Another stronghold of the occupation forces, Chaudanga, has fallen. The advancing forces captured nearly 1,000 tonnes of ammunition near Jhaneda in the Jessore sector left behind by the retreating enemy. On the Western Front Indian troops eliminated the solitary surviving Pakistani post on the east bank of Mannawar Tawi in the Chhamb sector and established a screen of their own on the west bank. Thus, repeated enemy attempts to crash through our defences on the east bank have been frustrated. In the Kargil area, the Army repeated its 1965 performance by capturing a 13,620 feet high hill feature, the fifth in the line, ensuring the safety of the Srinagar-Leh road. In the Kutch sector, Nagarparker town in Hyderabad-Sind divis1on has fallen after a night-long battle. In mopping-up operations in the Jaisalmer sector, four Pak1stani Sherman tanks were found destroyed in an area 11 kilometers west of Longewala. In the Barmer sector, our troops are in contact with the enemy near Nayachor and are also proceeding towards Umarkot. Another enemy attack on Dera Babananak Bridge in the Amritsar sector has been repulsed. With the destruction of 73 aircraft, Pakistan Air Force has lost nearly one-fourth of its strength in the six days of war. Today, the IAF raided Pakistani airbases at Chander, Nawabshah. Jacobabad, and Hyderabad and also carried out interdiction and close support sorties in the Jaffarwal sector in the area opposite Samba, Nayachor and Chhamb sectors. The enemy aircraft attacked Srinagar, Pathankot and Amritsar airfield inflicting minor damage. A few villages in Kashmir and near Jullundur were bombed resulting in the death of many civilians. No Indian aircraft was lost in today's operations, but a Pakistani 7-104 fighter was knocked out of the skies at Okha port. Pakistani reports that the IAF had bombed civilian targets were officially denied here. Carrier-borne aircraft raided Barisal from where the retreating Pakistani troops are trying to escape. According to an agency reports the IAF sank nearly a hundred steamers, gun boats and motor boats carrying retreating enemy troops in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-dec-10-1971-navy-deals-more-deadly-blows-101639063075050.html

It was Diwali when I saw him for the last time. When he came home he said he would retire and start a business. I have lost my husband but I am proud of him. He died for the country,” said Mandira Rai.The soldier’s father, Bahadur Singh Rai, was also in the army. Satpal’s brother, Bickal Rai, is also serving with the 5/11 Gorkha Rifles.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote a long condolence message for the family.“I sincerely express my deepest condolence for the unfortunate and sudden demise of Late Havildar Satpal Rai at the age of only 40 years.

The helicopter was seven minutes from its destination.Gen Bipin Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers undergoing a one-year course there. The staff course at the tri-services institution is known to further career progression of young officers from the army, air force and the navy.WATCH: Air Force finds chopper black box, critical tech during crash cause probeDSSC commandant Lieutenant General Manmohan Jeet Singh Kahlon, who was commissioned in the armoured corps and has also flown army helicopters, and his staff were waiting at the helipad to receive Gen Bipin Rawat.There were tense moments at the Wellington helipad when the Russian-origin Mi-17V5 helicopter, a reliable flying machine, did not land at its scheduled time or even minutes later, the officials said.Also Read: ‘Will retire together’: What CDS Gen Bipin Rawat told his PSO who wanted to quitAt this point, it is not clear what went wrong with the helicopter in the final moments of the crash though the weather in the area where it went down did not have good visibility. A short video clip, shot by tourists in the area, captured the last moments.The video showed the low-flying helicopter penetrate dense mist over a hill. It did not capture the crash but the audio recorded a loud bang.A three-star IAF officer Air Marshal Manavendra Singh is heading the inquiry into the horrific crash. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament that he has already begun work.A C-130J flew the mortal remains of the crash victims from Sulur to Palam on Thursday evening.Search crews on Thursday recovered the helicopter’s black box that could give vital clues about what went wrong. The black box, which consists of the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), is a crash survivable unit.While the FDR records vital information including altitude, speed, vertical acceleration and other technical data including instrument readings, the CVR contains crew communications.The focus of the team investigating the crash will be on decrypting the black box data, a labourious exercise that could take days, the officials said.Accessing the data held in the black box will depend on its condition, said Air Chief Marshal Fali Major (retd), a former IAF chief and helicopter pilot.“If the black box is not damaged, decrypting it may not take much time. It could be done in a few days. But if it was damaged in the crash, the IAF may have to send it to Russia to decrypt the data and piece together what happened. It will give vital information on all technical parameters,” Major said.The IAF had to send the damaged black box of a C-130J special operations aircraft that crashed near Gwalior in March 2014 to the US as it did not have the means to retrieve the data within the country.Major cautioned against speculating on the reasons behind the helicopter crash, and said it is best to wait for the investigators to come out with their findings.The chopper was flown by Wing Commander PS Chauhan, the commanding officer of Sulur-based 109 Helicopter Unit, and his co-pilot Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh. Chauhan was commissioned in the IAF in June 2002, while Chauhan joined service in June 2015. The other two IAF personnel on board were junior warrant officers Rana Pratap Das and A Pradeep, who had joined the air force in June 2006 and January 2004, respectively.

09-12-2021||India||Fresh cases of bird flu detected in Kerala’s Alappuzha district||An alert has been sounded in Alappuzha district in Kerala on Thursday after the state animal husbandry department confirmed bird flu (H5N1 influenza) in some samples sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal. Many ducks and local birds perished in the district last week forcing authorities to rush samples to the Bhopal lab. Veterinary officials said culling of ducks will start in affected areas on Friday and farmers will be compensated according to government norms. “The government has instructed the district collector to take necessary measures,” said Animal Husbandry Minister J Cinchu Rani in the state capital. Endowed with many backwaters and water bodies, farmers rear ducks in the district and bird flu regularly hits the area. Migratory birds from other countries are reported to be the main carriers of the virus. In Alappuzha and neighbouring Kottayam, duck rearing is an important business and there is high demand for eggs and meat of the bird, normally priced higher than poultry. Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by air-borne virus in birds. It can spread to humans rarely and if it happens it can trigger person to person transmission, experts say. There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered dangerous among them, they say. According to the World Health Organization, there are many subtypes of the avian influenza virus and only some of them are dangerous for humans. Last year also the district reported the viral outbreak but it was localised and contained. In 2016, at least 5 lakh chicken and ducks were culled in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts to control the outbreak. A highly contagious disease, experts say all rearing birds in the vicinity will have to be culled to contain the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-cases-of-bird-flu-detected-in-kerala-s-alappuzha-district-101639057776721.html

In 2012, General Rawat had served as the GoC of the division. During his tenure, he had developed friendship with many of the locals as well as police officers and administration officials. He was in touch with many of them after becoming the Army chief and later the CDS.Soon after Wednesday’s deadly air crash in Coonoor, many locals started sharing on social media photographs with CDS Rawat.“A sad day for our country. A gentleman officer and a courageous commander with mettle. Fond memories of him leading from the front. We would often see him at the forefront with joint teams of special forces in counterterror ops. The nation owes you gratitude for your selfless service. RIP, sir,” wrote Senior Superintendent of Police Imtiyaz Hussain, who shared a photo showing him along with General Rawat in Baramulla.Both the officers remained in touch until the tragic death of the CDS on Wednesday.Nisar Ahmad, a journalist from Binner village in Baramulla, had family relations with General Rawat. “I knew his family. His father, who was also a senior army officer in Baramulla, knew my father since the 1980s. General Rawat had attended my wedding in 2005 when he was sector commander and posted in Sopore,” said Nisar, adding that he was planning to meet him next week in New Delhi. “For me, he was a family friend. I will miss him.”Another young police officer from Baramulla, Sheikh Adil, shared a couple of photos that he had taken with the CDS. “In the passing away of General Bipin Rawat, the country has lost a great leader in uniform. It’s a colossal loss. Some fond memories,” Adil wrote as he shared the images.A former principal of Baramulla Degree College, Harbajan Singh Bali, posted a photograph of himself with the CDS that was taken during his spell in Baramulla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locals-officers-recall-fond-memories-of-bipin-rawat-s-tenure-in-baramulla-101639055376171.html
09-12-2021||India||Farm unions clinch deal with Centre, call off protests||The Union government and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions, on Thursday reached a deal on a raft of demands that had sparked year-long protests by peasants in a major political challenge to the Modi regime. The SKM accepted a slew of proposals from the Centre, contained in a letter signed by Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal, towards resolving key agrarian issues raised by it. This paved the way for SKM to call off one of the largest demonstrations by farmers the country has seen in decades. The SKM will meet next on January 15, its leaders said. Protestors will take out victory processions from their camps on Delhi’s borders on December 11 on the way back to their villages, it was announced. The compromise between the Centre and protesting farm unions came after two days of back-channel negotiations that saw proposals being sent back and forth, and 11 rounds of tenuous negotiations that hit a deadlock on January 22, 2021. Tens of thousands of farmers had opposed three agricultural reform laws enacted by the Modi government in September 2020, hunkering down on highways across several states for nearly 14 months. Thousands had also set up virtual protest townships at five sites along Delhi’s borders, choking traffic. Prime Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that his government would abandon the contentious laws and Parliament repealed them on November 29. The scrapping of the laws created an opportunity for farmers to re-engage with the government. On December 7, the Centre had sent draft proposals to resolve the stand-off, to which the farm body proposed amendments. The SKM signed off on a final letter from the Centre on Thursday that contained key steps forward. “Today is victory day for farmers, who launched the biggest movement in the country after the freedom movement. Victory to those who feed the nation,” said Daljit Randhawa, a wheat-grower from Punjab’s Sangrur, who has been camping at a protest site on the outskirts of the national capital for months. The proposals contained in the letter from the agriculture secretary were unanimously accepted by the five-member team of farm leaders authorized to take decisions on behalf of the SKM. In the letter, the Centre said it would set up a committee mandated to “ensure how all farmers can get minimum support prices (MSP)”. It also assured that the current levels of federal procurement of farm produce at assured prices would not be pared. “This has allayed a major fear of farmers that the government could reduce or stop buying farm produce at MSP,” said Yogendra Yadav, the leader of Swaraj India, and a member of the SKM’s coordination committee. Farmers have demanded a law to guarantee minimum prices for 22-odd commodities. Distress selling of farm produce and price volatility in non-cereals have been a major gripe among cultivators. The Union government’s letter also stated that the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana had agreed to withdraw all cases registered against farmers and their supporters during the course of their agitation with immediate effect, a major demand of the SKM. Cases against farmers registered by central law-enforcement agencies and in Union Territories as well as by Delhi police would also be withdrawn immediately, the Centre stated. According to SKM leaders, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh alone have pressed over 45,000 cases against farmers. Accepting another major demand, the Centre stated the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments would grant compensation to the families of nearly 700 farmers who died of heat, cold and exhaustion during the year-long sit-in demonstrations. The government also proposed that it would not move an amendment to India’s Electricity Act without consulting the SKM. The SKM has objected to certain provisions in the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020, saying the changes would increase energy costs for agriculturists. Farmers would also not be criminally liable for burning crop residue after harvests, a major cause of air pollution in the national capital. Peasants would be exempt from prosecution under Sections 15 and 15 of an anti-pollution law currently in force, the Centre said. During back-channel negotiations with the home ministry, the Centre however told SKM that it had no powers to exempt fines on farmers for stubble burning imposed by the Supreme Court. The farmers had also wanted the sacking and arrest of Union minister of home Ajay Mishra Teni. Teni’s son was arrested after a car owned by him rammed into farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. The SKM eventually didn’t pursue this. “The issue of investigation into Teni and his son is currently being monitored the Supreme Court. So, we have decided not to interfere in this,” said Shiv Kumar Kakkaji, one of the five members of the SKM empowered to take decisions. The Modi government’s move to address key issues of farmers come as the Bharatiya Janata Party prepared to fight crucial state polls, especially in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, where farmers are an influential voting bloc. “It now remains to be seen how whether the government will deliver on assurances on MSP. If farmers are not satisfied, they are likely to restart their agitation. The farm laws were repealed because of farmers represent a significant political constituency and polls are due in states,” said Sudhir Panwar, who teaches political science at Lucknow University.

The government has announced several measures to contain the spread of Omicron.Travellers from countries 'at risk' have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCT testing post-arrival and have to home quarantine for seven days if the results are negative. They have to further take a re-test on the eighth day and monitor their health for the next seven days if the test results are negative again.In case the passengers test positive for Covid-19, the samples will be sent for genome testing and the patients will be admitted to a separate isolation facility. They will be treated as per the standard Covid protocol and discharged at the discretion of the physician if the genomic testing is negative for the Omicron variant.Here’s the list of ‘at-risk’ countries from where travellers would need to follow additional measures on arrival in India:1.

The bench, led by Justice Kaushik Chanda, also stayed further investigation into the matter.The former Trinamool Congress MP was facing a trial for “preaching violence” in his speeches while campaigning for the BJP ahead of the March-April polls.The complaint was lodged by one Mrityunjay Pal, a resident of Kolkata, against Chakraborty on May 6. It said the actor-turned-politician used a monologue from one of his popular Bengali movies in which his character describes himself as a cobra whose bite can kill anyone.The complainant said Chakraborty, who joined the BJP in the run-up to the polls, had incited violence through his speeches.The hotly contested Bengal elections where the BJP campaign was led by home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi Modi brought the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) back to power for the third time with a thumping majority.After results of the election were announced on May 2, incidents of violence were reported at various places in the state prompting a visit by a four-member team deputed by the ministry of home affairs in affected areas.The BJP has accused the TMC workers of their involvement in post-poll violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-junks-fir-against-mithun-chakraborty-over-his-controversial-speech-101639046504733.html

He was CDS General Rawat’s personal security officer“He used to speak to his wife and kids – Mokshagna (5) and Dakshini (2) regularly. On Wednesday morning, too, he called up his wife and told her that he wanted to see his daughter on the video call. It was a short call, as he was in a hurry to accompany his boss to Tamil Nadu,” Teja’s uncle B Sudarshan told Hindustan Times.Teja’s demise in the tragic helicopter crash sent shock waves through his native village Eguva Regada of Kurabalakota block in Chittoor. His father Boggala Mohan, a farmer and mother Bhuvaneshwari, a former block parishad member, are inconsolable, while Shyamala is still in a state of shock.“It was only a few months ago that Teja shifted his wife and children to SBI Colony in Madanapalle town, about 15 km away from the village, to get his son admitted to a pre-primary school. The last time he visited the family was for Ganesh Chaturthi in the month of September. He was expected to come for a visit again during the Sankranti festival,” Sudershan, who works in the local village secretariat, said.The family got to know about the crash of the army helicopter with General Rawat on board only in the evening. “We were not sure whether Teja was also in the same chopper or not. We were only praying that he should be safe. It was only at around 8 pm his commanding officer from New Delhi called up Shyamala’s brother and conveyed the tragic news,” Sudershan said.Teja’s family do not know when his mortal remains will be brought to the village. “Nobody from New Delhi spoke to us after the incident and told us what to do. Even the local authorities are not aware of what is likely to be the next step,” he said.When contacted, Chittoor superintendent of police S Senthil Kumar said Teja’s mortal remains are expected to arrive on Thursday evening or Friday morning after the ceremonial tribute at New Delhi. “We are making all arrangements for his last rites,” he said.According to Sudershan, Teja joined the Indian Army as a sepoy in Bengaluru Regiment in 2013 and climbed up in ranks because of his hard work. He was appointed as personal security officer to General Rawat only seven months ago.“He got married to Shyamala of Siddhareddypally village in 2015. His younger brother B Mahesh Babu is also a soldier posted in Sikkim at present. He is also flying down this evening to join the last rites,” Sudershan added.Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan expressed grief over the death of Lance Naik Sai Teja in the helicopter crash near Coonoor on Wednesday.Harichandan said it was a great loss for the family of Sai Teja. He offered his condolences to the bereaved family.

But they were up in arms in the Rajya Sabha for not being allowed to pay tribute to the deceased.Soon after union defence minister Rajnath Singh made a statement in the Upper House, the leader of the Opposition, Mallikarjun Kharge, requested that all floor leaders should be given a few minutes to speak.The request from the Opposition leaders to be able to pay tribute to the deceased was, however, turned down by deputy chairperson Harivansh Narayan Singh, who was in the chair. He said the defence minister has spoken and condolences have been offered collectively.As Opposition leaders pressed the chair to allow them to speak, members of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) walked out of the House in protest.Speaking outside the House, TMC lawmaker Sushmita Dev said, “ The suspended MPs observed a minute’s silence as the nation is in mourning, and today is not the day to protest. In Parliament, there was no disruption. All that we wanted was that every party should be given a chance to condole the deaths and express solidarity, so that the right message goes out. But we were bulldozed and we chose to walk out in protest against yet another move to suppress us.”Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Manoj Jha said the Opposition leaders should have been given a chance to pay tribute to the deceased, which is the standard practice in Parliament.“I’m told that with such national tragedies, every floor leader makes a reference. An obituary binds the House and it should have been allowed. But if the obituary is seen from a partisan perspective, then things are not good,” Jha told HT outside the House.

This comes in the wake of the Centre accepting all demands put forward by the protesting farmers, including the withdrawal of all agitation-related cases and compensation to the families of farmers who had died during the course of the movement against the contentious agriculture laws.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) – the umbrella body of farmers' unions spearheading the protests – had said last evening that their 14-month agitation will be called off at 12pm on Thursday, but only after they receive the final copy of the government’s revised proposal accepting their demands.The following were the demands of the protesting farmers:1. Withdrawal of all the agitation-related cases registered during this protest in all states and Union territories, or under central government agencies, etc.2. Compensation to all the families of the agitating farmers who died during the course of agitation.3. No criminal liability to farmers in the cases of stubble burning.4. The government has to discuss the Electricity Amendment Bill with the SKM or with other farmers' unions before bringing it up in Parliament.5. A committee to discuss minimum support price (MSP) is to be formed; the SKM will list out their members in the panel and provide it to the farmers.6. The ongoing policy on MSP and its procurement in the country will continue as it is.Memorial dedicated to 58 farmers from Sangrur who died during stir against 3 laws inauguratedThe consensus to call off the farmers' protests was reached after the central government agreed to take back all cases registered during the farm agitation and for stubble burning. According to the protesting farmers, the government has also assured that it will table the Electricity Amendment Bill only after consultation with the SKM or relevant farmers' unions.Moreover, the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh state governments, along the lines of Punjab, have also agreed to provide a compensation of ₹5 lakh and a job to the kin of deceased farmers. Finally, the demand to include only SKM leaders in the MSP committee – apart from officials from the states, Centre, and agricultural experts – has also been met.Earlier, the farmers were also demanding that Union minister Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish has been tried in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, be sacked. However, judging by the last demand proposal sent to the Centre, the SKM's five-member panel had removed that point.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that the central government will bring necessary bills in the winter session of Parliament to repeal the farm laws. He had also assured that the government will be constituting a committee to work on a new framework for MSP.Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha passed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill on the first day of the winter session on November 29. President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bill, which completed the process of repealing the three farm laws.The farmers had been protesting against the farm laws on various borders of Delhi since November 26, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-end-year-long-protest-as-govt-agrees-to-all-demands-of-protesters-101639032007473.html

There was a rapid loss of altitude while in usual attitude, with the aircraft pitching up and down viciously… Despite being in extreme physical and mental stress in an extreme life-threatening situation, he maintained exemplary composure and regained control of the aircraft, thereby exhibiting exceptional flying skills,” Singh’s citation had said.“He displayed extraordinary courage and skill to safely land the fighter aircraft. The pilot went beyond the call of duty and landed the aircraft taking calculated risks.

The committee was formed on March 25 and was required to submit its report within a month.With the report still awaited eight months later, the Centre represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta urged the top court on Wednesday to call for the report as several state and central projects remained stalled for this reason.“Finding out a methodology for valuation of trees cannot go on for months together. By the very nature of work they are supposed to do, nine months is a pretty long time. We want a direction to expedite the report. Based on this recommendation, project proponents have to make payment,” Mehta said. He was appearing for Rail Vikas Nigam Limited in the MC Mehta case dealing with tree felling in relation to construction activities around the iconic Taj Mahal.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati representing the Uttar Pradesh government also made a similar request citing a long list of state government projects held up due to payment of compensatory afforestation charges to be determined by the committee.The bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna said, “The committee shall submit its report in four weeks. List the matters in January.” The court also sought a list of public projects pending on account of the report by the tree valuation committee. ASG Bhati agreed to compile the list.This committee, which has seven experts, is headed by wildlife expert MK Ranjitsinh and has a joint secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) as its member secretary. The task of the committee was to fix the value of trees taking into account the intrinsic and instrumental value of trees based not on their timber worth but their age, girth and environmental contribution.Also Read:  ₹1.20 crore fine imposed on tribal man for cutting 2 trees in MP’s RaisenThe other members of the committee are Arun Singh Rawat, director-general, Indian Council for Forestry Research, Sandeep Tambe, Professor of Forestry at the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, Gopal Singh Rawat, former dean and director, Wildlife Institute of India, Nilanjan Ghosh, director, Observer Research Foundation, Kolkata, and an expert in ecological economics, and environmentalist Pradeep Krishen.Besides the valuation of trees, the committee was also required to lay down rules mandating the project proponents to study alternate routes of transport such as railways or waterways instead of felling of trees to construct road projects.Photos: Delhi’s iconic trees in the wake of SC’s report on “valuation of trees”The order constituting the committee was passed while considering a petition filed by the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights that opposed the felling of old trees, some aged over 150 trees, for construction of five road-over-bridges (ROB) as part of a road-widening project of the West Bengal government.The court sought the opinion of a group of experts on valuing ornamental trees who suggested that a tree’s worth could be calculated by setting a multiplier of ₹74,500 to the age of the tree. A heritage tree with a lifespan of over 100 years could even be worth over ₹1 crore, it submitted in a report given to Court.

Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan flying the chopper. The exact reason for the crash is not yet known though many reports have ruled out a technical glitch and blamed bad weather for the crash. The IAF has constituted a probe and no official word is out on what led to the fatal crash.Here is all you need to know about Mi17V5 chopper1. Mi17V5 is an advanced transport helicopter which is with the Indian Air Force since 2012.2. Russian Helicopters' subsidiary Kazan manufacture Mi17V5. These choppers are equipped with the latest general of night vision devised. They also have weather radar.3. India had in 2008 signed a deal with Russia to induct 80 Mi17V5 medium-lift helicopters for strengthening its chopper fleet for humanitarian and disaster relief missions and transport operations.4. The contract was later expanded for the delivery of 151 Mi17V5 helicopters. The first batch of these helicopters came to India in September 2011.5. According to the Russian government's defence exports company Rosoboronexport, Mi-17V-5 military transport helicopter is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment inside the cargo cabin or on an external sling, drop tactical air assault forces and reconnaissance and sabotage groups, destroy ground targets and carry the wounded.6. According to the company, the helicopter can achieve a maximum speed of 250 km per hour.7. The helicopter is fitted with advanced TV3-117VM engines.8.

09-12-2021||India||With China and Pak borders active, merit will be the criteria for new CDS appointment||On December 17, 2016, the Narendra Modi government appointed Bipin Rawat as India’s 27th Chief of Army Staff after superseding the then Eastern and Southern Army Commanders on grounds of merit, track record and vision. He went on to become the first Chief of Defence Staff on January 1, 2020, as well as Secretary of the newly created Department of Military Affairs (DMA). He lost his life in a Mi-17 V 5 helicopter crash in Conoor hills on Wednesday afternoon.Now that the government has a task of appointing a new CDS from the Indian Army, being by far the largest of the military service, and possibly a new Chief of Army Staff, the Modi government is expected to follow the same pattern of overall merit-cum-seniority in deciding the senior-most defence officer of the country.Given that the situation with China is tense on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with PLA troops, tanks, rockets and missiles deployed in the Western Theatre, India will need a CDS who not only will forcefully push for the creation of military theatre commands, given the concerns in some service headquarters, as well as a General who can provide a sound single-point military advice to the government. As per rule, all the commanders in chief of the Army can be considered for the job of the CDS and seniority is not the only criteria. Simply upgrading each commander to the next step is not the way that the Modi government works as the careers of all officers under consideration will be looked at from 360 degrees and their performance during the ongoing stand-off with PLA in Ladakh. As General Rawat used to say that India is facing threat from 2.5 fronts.Also Read | Gen Rawat to be accorded full military honours; tri-service probe ordered into chopper crashWhile PM Modi will find it very difficult to match the qualities of Gen Rawat in his successor, the national security establishment will have to keep in mind the threat coming from Af-Pak region with Kabul under the military occupation of Taliban and Islamabad facing its worst economic and governance crisis with Prime Minister Imran Khan trying a leg-up on Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. It is quite evident from events in Pakistan that PM Khan has turned more aggressive towards India in Kashmir and is supportive of the Taliban in Afghanistan, which appears contrary to what Gen Bajwa thinks as he fears worst radicalization in Pakistan with both Deobandi (Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan) and Barelvi (Tehreek-e-Labbaik) Sunni sects up in arms.The decision of new appointments to the post of CDS and Army Chief will also have to be taken in light of the fact that 21st-century warfare is all about cyber and information warfare with Beijing not averse to spending huge sums of money and dole out stupendous freebies to get intelligence or spread misinformation. Gone are the days of infantry maneuvers and tank battles, the era of stand-off weapons has dawned with armed drones, ballistic missiles and long-range air defence systems. The situation has got more complicated with Beijing glaring at Taiwan, Australia, Japan, the US, India and even Lithuania with junior diplomats issuing threats to sovereign nations as part of wolf warrior diplomacy. The task of appointment of the new CDS or even the Army chief is not easy lest the Modi government takes a deep dive in selection. And perhaps it will.

Describing the four-star general's sudden death as an “irreparable loss” to the nation, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that this state will always be proud of its son.General Bipin Laxman Singh Rawat was born in Pauri, modern-day Uttarakhand, on 16 March 1958. He belonged to the Saina village in the district, growing up in a family that had been serving in the Indian Army for multiple generations. His father, Laxman Singh Rawat was from Sainj village of the Pauri Garhwal district and rose to the rank of lieutenant-general.Bipin Rawat, too, graduated from the National Defence Academy in Khadakwasla and the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun, where he was awarded the ‘Sword of Honour’. He would, of course, later go on to become the much-venerated general of the Indian Army that he was known as, serving in various divisions of the armed forces across multiple postings before being promoted to the office of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and finally, India's first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) – a post he served diligently till the time of his tragic death.General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika, and 11 other officials of the Indian armed forces were killed in a helicopter crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, the Indian Air Force said.In doleful remembrance of General Rawat's personality, Uttarakhand will be observing the three days of state mourning from December 9 to 12. In an official condolence message issued at state capital Lucknow, chief minister Dhami prayed for peace to all the departed souls who lost their lives in the accident.“The country will always remember the courageous decisions taken by him [General Bipin Rawat] for the security of the borders and the contribution made by him to keep the morale of the armed forces always high,” the Uttarakhand chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/general-bipin-rawat-s-death-uttarakhand-declares-3-day-state-mourning-101639018471396.html

While there is an overall global list displaying the international search trends throughout this year, there are also specific nation-based lists that shed a light on the regional trends which took the internet by storm in 2021. Unsurprisingly, the top three search trends in India were – Indian Premier League, CoWIN, and ICC T20 World Cup – all of which were major talking points this year. The movies which were searched for the most in the country included Jai Bhim, Shershaah, and Radhe.Coming to news events, the Google list showed that Indians were most interested in the Tokyo Olympics, Afghanistan news, and updates on black fungus. Meanwhile, personalities such as Neeraj Chopra, Aryan Khan, and Shehnaaz Gill hogged the headlines and thus reflected as the most searched for people on Google this year.-Here are the overall top trends in India:1.

Meanwhile, Aryan Khan secured a place in most-searched-for actors worldwide (presumably a result of the high-profile Mumbai cruise raid case earlier this year), along with personalities such as Alec Baldwin, Pete Davidson, Gina Carano, and Armie Hammer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-year-in-search-2021-here-s-what-india-browsed-on-the-internet-this-year-101639016028945.html

09-12-2021||India||‘Shouldn’t have been on bench that heard harassment charge’: Gogoi||Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi said on Wednesday that he should have ideally avoided sitting in the Supreme Court bench which initiated the suo motu (on its own motion) proceedings in the wake of sexual harassment allegations levelled against him.“In hindsight, my presence in the bench could have been avoided... I should not have been a judge on that bench. I accept it,” justice Gogoi, now a Rajya Sabha MP, told HT as he spoke on the sidelines of launch of his memoir ‘Justice for the Judge’.The former CJI added: “But one must also realise that the situation was unprecedented. For the first time in the history of the Supreme Court of India, such allegations had been levelled against a CJI. A reputation built over nearly 45 years in the Bar and on the Bench was sought to be destroyed.Then I was told that petition was to be filed to stop me from attending to any judicial or administrative work.”A controversy had erupted after justice Gogoi presided over a three-judge bench on April 20, 2019 after the accusations of sexual harassment surfaced against him. Although he chose not to sign the order of the day, his very presence on the bench was questioned on the premise of conflict of interest since the matter involved him directly.After the first hearing on April 20, the case titled as “In Re: Matter of great public importance touching upon the independence of judiciary” was heard by a different bench in the top court. The case was wrapped up by the court this February.Justice Gogoi said that he could come up with little options but to be assertive in his actions following the tirade against him. “However, in hindsight, I acknowledge that it might have been better If I was not part of the bench,” said the former CJI.“We all make mistakes. We often think we could have done something in a more appropriate way. Even the judges are human and they can make mistakes. There is no harm in accepting it. At least, I have no qualms accepting that I could have avoided being a part of that bench,” said justice Gogoi. At the same time, he added that there was no order passed by the bench on that day affecting the case on merits.In his book, reviewed by HT, the former CJI has written: “My presence in the bench, which in hindsight could have been avoided, was the expression of indignation roused on the spur of the moment by an accusation which was beyond belief and comprehension. Though I was on the bench, I did not sign the order. In fact, no effective judicial order was passed on that day.”About the morning of April 20, justice Gogoi has written that he had rung up attorney general KK Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta, besides the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association after coming to know that there was a plan to stop him from working as a CJI until he was cleared of the allegations. It was S-G Tushar Mehta who requested that a bench be constituted to decide whether judicial orders should be passed.“I reflected upon the matter and soon concluded that aggression would be the best form of defence in the circumstances. I had no options,” reads the book.

Officials said they got clinching evidence in this regard during the raids. But the organization has stoutly denied these charges. “It is a cheap harassment tactic carried out by the central agency at the behest Sangh Parivar outfits. Our struggle will continue to uphold human and minority rights. The BJP and Parivar outfits are using central agencies to stifle dissent,” said PFI general secretary Anis Ahmed. “The PFI has been co-operating well with all ED investigations, but nothing has been found so far. But it is still harassing our members with arbitrary raids. We condemn this,” said PFI chairman O M A Salam. The PFI said raids were conducted at four locations, Kannur, Muvattupuzha, Malappuram and Idukki, officials in the know of the development said. At some locations, angry workers raised slogans against the ED officials but dispersed after local police intervened. The central probe agency has been investigating the PFI’s alleged “financial links” on charges of fuelling the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in the country, the Delhi riots that took place in February last year and a few other instancesThe controversial outfit was in the news two weeks back in connection with the murder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader A Sanjith in Palakkad. Four workers of the Social Democratic Party of India, political wing of PFI, were arrested. He was waylaid and stabbed to death before his wife. Five are absconding. The PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after merging three Muslim outfits, the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of Tamil Nadu, floated after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, and now claims to have units in 22 states. The party’s early leaders were ex-cadres of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-kerala-pfi-offices-leaders-houses-over-money-laundering-charges-101638991223832.html
09-12-2021||India||Kerala gymnast breaks barriers, sets sight on 2024 Olympics||Six years ago, when Mehrain S Saj visited a private gymnasium here with her younger brother, she instantly fell in love with the sport. In November, the 15-year-old turned her dreams into reality when she became the overall champion with two golds and a bronze at the 56th National Artistic Gymnastic Championship in Jammu. She is Kerala’s first gymnast to achieve this feat.Trained by D Jayakumar, a former national champion and Railways coach, Mehrain has now set her sights on the 2024 Paris Olympics and aims to win the country’s first medal in the sport. She estimates that she will be training for 9,000 hours in the run-up to the Games. “Gymnastics was never in my mind. When I went with my father to enrol my brother I saw boys and girls rolling like rubber dolls. I fell in love with the sport instantly. Once my parents agreed, I started training and took more interest in the artistic version,” says Mehrain, who idolises Russian legend Aliya Mustafina and American gymnast Shawn Johnson. “The national event was challenging as many seasoned players were there. My coach’s words came to my mind, ‘give your best, unmindful of challenges’. The big surprise was I won gold in the vault table,” she adds. A Class 10 student at Cotton Hills Girls High School in the state capital, Mehrain trains for five hours six days a week and follows a strict diet.“Her attitude towards the sport is good, and she is hard-working, and grasps techniques and nuances quickly. Usually in gymnastics people with short stature will do well, and her body is tuned for this. If she gets proper exposure and training she can become a world-class gymnast,” says Jayakumar. “I expected a single gold, but when she got the overall championship, I was thrilled. She is the best gymnast in the country now,” he adds. Mehrain’s father Sajjudin, a revenue inspector with the state government, said that at first, many eyebrows were raised in the community when she took to gymnastics. “I told them sport is a sport, and you can’t mix it with belief. Gymnastics has become a passion for my daughter, and we encourage her.” “A promising gymnast, she came up through hard work and determination. The government will do everything possible to help her scale new highs,” said state sportsminister V Abdul Rehman. Wedded to sport, Mehrain’s coach Jayakumar sold his property to start a gymnastic school, DJ Sports Club in Vayalikada in the state capital. He chargesonly those who can afford it. Others get free lessons. Now, 50 students train at his academy, which has produced 10 national level sportspeople. Equipped with basic training equipment, he has been trying to get support from the government and private sponsors for help, but to no avail. 
09-12-2021||India||Over 9,000 social media accounts blocked in 2020, Parliament told||As many as 9,849 accounts across social media platforms were blocked in 2020, almost a three-fold increase than those blocked in 2019, the Centre told Parliament on Wednesday.The information was shared by the ministry of electronics and information technology in Lok Sabha after Congress MP, Mohammad Faizal P.P sought to know year-wise details of the number of blocked accounts on social media platforms under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act since 2014.“...Government has directed for blocking of 471, 500, 633, 1,385, 2,799, 3,635 and 9,849 number of Accounts/URLs during the years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively,” the minisry said. Section 69A of the IT Act allows the Centre to block public access to an intermediary “in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to above”. “Over 9,000 accounts were blocked in a year when things were particularly less active in terms of public demonstrations, which are legitimate and allowed in our democracy,” Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and the Asia Pacific Policy director at Access Now, a think-tank, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-9-000-social-media-accounts-blocked-in-2020-parliament-told-101638991045010.html
09-12-2021||India||Housing scheme to benefit 4mn: Andhra CM Jagan||Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday said the state’s Jaganna Sampoorna Gruha Hakku scheme, which will come into effect from December 21, would benefit more than four million people, who mortgaged their houses with the state housing board for home loans.Under the scheme, those who had obtained loans from the state housing board, and those who constructed houses in the plots allotted by the previous governments between 1983 and August 15, 2011, can get their houses regularised by paying a prescribed fee under one-time-settlement (OTS) plan.At a review meeting on Wednesday, the chief minister said, “The total outstanding principal and interest of these loans amount to around ₹14,400 crores. Under the OTS, the state government will waive around ₹10,000 crores. The beneficiaries can have full rights on their house by paying a stipulated nominal amount – ₹10,000 in villages, ₹15,000 in municipalities, and ₹20,000 in municipal corporations. The government will waive the entire loan dues and register the houses in their names.”State officials told the chief minister that orders have been issued for waiving off the stamp duty, transfer duty, and user charges for the beneficiaries under the OTS scheme. “The registration process is done at the village and ward secretariats and the registration document, field sketch, and loan clearance certificates are being issued to the beneficiaries of the OTS scheme,” they said.The opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) described the scheme as a big scam being played on the people, who had been allotted houses under the “weaker section housing scheme.”Stating that the OTS scheme exposed ‘bankruptcy’ of the Jagan-led government, TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said instead of fulfilling the pre-poll promise of providing free registrations for the weaker sections, the chief minister was using coercive methods to collect money from the poor in the form of OTS. “The district collectors and Mandal level officials are fixing targets for the village and ward secretariats,” he said.He asked the beneficiaries not to pay the OTS amount for regularisation and assured them that if the TDP returned to power in the next assembly elections in 2024, he would regularise the houses free of cost.Naidu said the property registrations would be legal and valid in a court of law only when they would be registered in the registrars’ offices. The OTS registrations for millions of poor beneficiaries at the level of ‘grama sachivalayas’ would be illegal, he said.However, Jagan said at Wednesday’s meeting that the OTS scheme was completely voluntary, and only those who want to get their registered documents back could opt for the scheme.State municipal administration and urban development minister Botsa Satyanarayana alleged that Naidu had become a big hurdle for any welfare scheme introduced by the Jagan government. “He is anti-poor. He has the habit of stalling every scheme of the government by moving the courts,” the minister alleged.
09-12-2021||India||57 dogs’ death in IIT-M due to lack of hygiene: Tamil Nadu tells Madras high court||The Tamil Nadu government has informed the Madras high court that 57 dogs have died on the IIT-Madras campus since last September and the deaths could have been avoided if proper sanitation and hygiene was maintained. Making a submission to the high court on Tuesday during an on-going case, the state described the situation as alarming. A government team inspected the premises after the People for Cattle in India moved the court alleging ill-treatment of dogs on the campus.Taking note of the submissions, the first bench of acting chief justice MN Bhandari and justice PD Audikesavalu said the issue has to be resolved and posted the matter to be heard on December 9. IIT-M has been keeping stray dogs in shelters on campus. A team comprising officials from the Tamil Nadu animal husbandry department, the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS) and the Greater Chennai Corporation and the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) inspected the shelters on November 29 and 30. The committee studied the management and health of the 62 dogs in these shelters present during their inspection. The state government’s report says that IIT-M has refused to give details of 34 individuals who have adopted dogs from the shelter. They pursued death records that showed 57 dogs had died from the day of the inception of the shelters -- September 2020 until the past 13 months. “The committee feels that (the) NGO (assigned as caretakers for the dogs) had failed to take care of the welfare of dogs,” the state’s report read.The committee says that from the treatment register they found “major clinical conditions” such as wounds, respiratory diseases and helminthiasis. “These conditions directly point to the poor sanitation and hygiene within the shelters,” the report said. They added that cracks on the shelter’s flood also shows poor management. “A few dogs have overgrown nails and some dogs had lacerations on the body which shows poor management of dogs,” the report added. The state recommended that dogs be released from the shelters and enlarged with the IIT-M campus.IIT-M did not comment on the issue despite repeated attempts.

The strategy may be worked out at Thursday’s meeting,” the party leader said on condition of anonymity. TRS Parliamentary Party leader Kesava Rao said on Tuesday that the TRS will now adopt an aggressive approach towards the Narendra Modi government and oppose its every decision. “Aaj se hamara nara, Modi ko hatana” (From today, our slogan is to pull down Modi) . “We shall oppose the BJP in the forthcoming Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections, though we extended support in the past,” he added. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is preparing to launch a series of agitations against the TRS government in the coming days. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay announced that the “million march” of the unemployed and second phase of his foot march , “Praja Sangrama Yatra” will be launched soon after the model code of conduct for the MLC elections comes to an end. The polling for the MLC elections is scheduled to be held on December 10 and the results will be declared on December 14. Four BJP MPs and three MLAs from Telangana are expected to meet with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday, a party leader said on condition of anonymity.The BJP is focussing on attracting hardcore Telangana activists who played a major role in the Telangana movement but have been neglected by the TRS in the last seven years. The TRS has traditionally supported the BJP in Parliament, but in recent months, as the latter has grown its presence in Telangana, the former has changed its tune.In December 2018 assembly elections, the BJP had won just one seat in the 119-member assembly and lost deposits in 106 seats. In the subsequent local body elections, too, the BJP fared very poorly -- it could not win even a single block or zilla parishad. However, in the 2019 general elections, the BJP bounced back by winning four Lok Sabha seats out of 17. In the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections held in December 2020, the BJP won 48 out of 150 divisions, as against 56 of the TRS. On Tuesday, a popular Telangana activist Teenmaar Mallanna and former employees’ union leader Ch Vittal joined the BJP in New Delhi in the presence of the party’s Telangana in-charge Tarun Chugh. “BJP is the right platform for all those who fought for a separate Telangana, as there is no place for genuine Telangana lovers in the TRS,” Sanjay said. The state BJP president said his party would go all out to end what he termed KCR’s dictatorial, dynastic and corrupt rule.

This step will give unbridled access to private players to supply power to select consumers and enable them to use the already laid out distribution network of the Public Sector Power Companies,” he told Modi in a letter. While the State PSUs carry the burden of investment in such networks, these private companies were being allowed to use the same without any investment or responsibility to maintain it, he added.Further, such new private distribution companies would be able to selectively access all the high value customers in commercially viable areas and “this would amount to granting them a right to cherry pick profitable ventures without any social obligations,” while State public sector utilities were left with the obligation of power supply to subsidised categories of consumers and servicing the economically backward/ rural areas, he added.Flagging other proposed amendments to certain sections of the Act, by giving powers to the National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) such as integrated operation of the power system and optimum scheduling of electricity across different States, he said these would amount to indirectly controlling many significant functionalities of the SLDCs/Discoms/State Governments.The penalty leviable under Sec.142 for contravening provisions of the Act/directions or order of the Commission is also high, the chief minister said.“In view of the above, I request your personal intervention to withdraw the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and allow the State owned distribution licensees to continue to supply quality power at affordable rates to the people,” he urged Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-writes-to-modi-on-proposed-changes-in-electricity-act-2003-101638990923242.html
09-12-2021||India||Kerala CM requests PM to sanction Silver Line project||The Silver Line semi-high speed rail from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod will not only benefit the state of Kerala, but also the nation, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said in his letter sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to sanction the project.In his letter dated December 6, 2021, the CM has said that the Kerala government has already agreed to meet the entire land acquisition cost of ₹13,700 crore.The state government has also agreed in-principle to meet the liability arising from any default on external debt obligation undertaken by the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (K-Rail) for the project, Vijayan has said.His letter states that the project was discussed in July with Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw who had expressed concern in sanctioning the same due to the present financial position of the Indian Railways.In this background, Vijayan has said that without the land acquisition cost, the project’s equity internal rate of return was 13.55 per cent and hence, it was viable as per the agreement between the Ministry of Railways and Government of Kerala.“I request your kind personal intervention to kindly accord the sanction for this key project, which will be a milestone in the progress of Kerala,” he said in the letter.“The project will not only benefit the state of Kerala, but also the nation, contributing both to the economy and the environment,” it has said.The letter has been sent in the wake of strong criticism by the Congress-led opposition to the ambitious project of the Left government.Besides that, a plea has been moved in the Kerala High Court alleging that the state was carrying out land acquisition proceedings for the Silver Line project without sanction of the Centre or other appropriate authorities.The high court has issued notice to the state government and K-Rail, seeking their stand on the petition, which seeks contempt action against them for violating the assurance given to the court in January that they will proceed with the project only after getting the concurrence from the Centre, Railway Board and other statutory authorities.The Silver Line project, which is expected to reduce travel time from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod to around four hours, is being opposed by the Congress-led UDF opposition, which has been alleging that it was “unscientific and impractical” and will put a huge financial burden on the state.The 532-kilometre stretch from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod would be developed by K-Rail -- a joint venture of the Kerala government and the Railway Ministry for developing railway infrastructure in the southern state.Starting from the state capital, Silver Line trains will have stoppages at Kollam, Chengannur, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Tirur, Kozhikode and Kannur before reaching Kasaragod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-requests-pm-to-sanction-silver-line-project-101638990805978.html
09-12-2021||India||Must expand fleet to counter China, Pakistan: IAF chief||China poses a significant challenge to the realisation of India’s strategic goals, while Pakistan has upgraded its combat aircraft fleet and forward airbases, the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief said on Wednesday, outlining key threats facing the country.To counter these challenges, the IAF needs to rapidly modernise, expand its fleet and improve indigenous manufacturing capability, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said while addressing an event organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies.“In my assessment, China possesses a more significant and long-term challenge to the realisation of India’s strategic goals,” he said.China continues to display its economic and military might and its assertiveness is bound to grow, he said, adding this will increase “contestation and competition” in the economic domain. China will also try to tie India down by keeping the country engaged on the unsettled border, he said.Beijing’s aggressive intent is most visible in the rapid enhancement of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s operational infrastructure, such as additional airfields in the Tibet Autonomous Region. China has also deployed air defence units, advanced aircraft and drones at these facilities, he said.Force multipliers such as rocket and strategic forces are “redefining the contours of future warfare”, Chaudhari noted.At the same time, India continues to be in a “no war no peace” situation on the border with Pakistan, which is unlikely to ditch its Kashmir-oriented strategy for the foreseeable future, the IAF chief said.The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is equipping itself with advanced aircraft and upgrading air defence capabilities. It has also built up 24 main and forward operating bases and six satellite bases, and this provides it with greater flexibility to “influence battles across a large spectrum and larger volume of areas”, he said.The Pakistani military has formulated a new concept of war fighting called “triple R” or rearticulate, reorganise and relocate. “Strategically, they are making a transition from fighting a predominantly defensive war to adapting a more aggressive approach for an offensive defence under the nuclear umbrella,” Chaudhari said.For the IAF, all of this translates into a need for a higher counter-air effort to ensure minimum interference from the Pakistani side and to gain requisite control of the airspace, he contended.The IAF needs to rapidly modernise, expand its fleet of combat aircraft and improve indigenous manufacturing capability, Chaudhari said. While budget will remain a constraint, the prioritisation of procurements for key combat elements becomes very critical. Training and equipment is needed to fight and win tomorrow’s war and India must not lose focus in attempt to distribute finances for the defence sector evenly, he said.“There is a need to brainstorm and find solutions to further our national interests in this constantly evolving regional and global security environment,” Chaudhari said.“In an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous geo-political environment, there is a strong linkage between security and development and this is where the armed forces come in,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-expand-fleet-to-counter-china-pakistan-iaf-chief-101638990804607.html
09-12-2021||India||Karnataka: Applications for government colleges log rise||The Karnataka higher education department has decided to increase the number of admissions in government colleges after getting more than 165,000 applications for 430 colleges in the state this year, officials said on Wednesday. The government has also ordered the appointment of 14,000 guest lecturers to meet the shortage of teaching staff, the officials added.The officials said that the government-run colleges have a vacancy for around 200,000 students per year, out of which around 80,000 seats are filled every year on an average. “This year we have more than 1.65 lakh students joining government colleges, which is a big jump, of more than 50,000 students, compared to last year. We expect these numbers to increase as the results of diploma examinations are still awaited,” said the official.While the department is yet to provide exact statistics on the admissions this year, an education department official said the demand has been high for commerce subjects, with more than 60% applications. The official said that the higher number of graduates this year is one of the reasons for the higher numbers at the government colleges.Due to the pandemic, the Karnataka government had decided to pass all students registered for the Pre-University Degree (10+2). A decision was made to allocate marks based on the performance in standards 10 and 11. The State government said that it would promote regular and freshers of 2nd year PU courses by giving 45% weightage for their SSLC marks, 45% for IPU marks and 10% for the internal assessment marks of II PU.This year, about 540,992 students had registered for the Karnataka II PUC 2021 exams and all of them have been promoted to the next stage. In total, 251,686 students registered in the commerce stream, 219,777 in the science stream, and 69,529 in the arts stream, according to government data.As many as 195,650 students also achieved distinction. The results this year witnessed an increase of 30% in the first-class students, 50% increase in second class and 20% increase in third class results as compared to last year. In addition to this, the government also decided to give grace marks to repeaters and pass them.“This year, every student who appeared for the PU examination passed. The number is close to 6 lakhs this year. In a normal situation, at least 2 lakh students fail in these examinations, but because there was a grace mark system and no examination, we have more students passing PUC and coming for degree examinations,” said the official.Amid new Covid-19 clusters in the state, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai Monday said the government is closely monitoring the situation and will decide on further containment measures, including closing down schools, colleges and hostels, after consulting experts. “All our concerns will be placed before the Covid-19 technical advisory committee, and we’ll make a decision based on their suggestions,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakaapplications-for-government-colleges-log-rise-101638990744438.html

Police said the bodies of the 30-year-old, his 26-year-old wife, their eight-year-old daughter and four-year-old son, were found in their house. Officials said that the man sent a voice note to the assistant sub-inspector of Mangaluru South police station around 10.45am, saying he died by suicide. “In the voice note, the man said a woman was trying to get this wife to convert her religion. He told the officer that the woman was responsible for the suicide. He also sent a photo of death note with the same information,” said an officer in the know of the development. Soon after, a team was dispatched to the man’s house and the team discovered the bodies.Mangaluru Police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that Mangaluru South Police had suo motu registered a case under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (abetment to suicide) against the woman mentioned in the voice note and she was taken into custody. Police said the couple had marital troubles and the man, who had a drinking problem, had been accused of domestic violence by the wife over a period of time. In October this year, she left home, prompting her husband to file a missing persons complaint. During the investigation, the woman said she was living with a female acquaintance -- the same person the husband said was trying to convert his wife, said a senior Mangaluru police officer. In October, the wife appeared in a police station and said she was going back to her husband. “It is unclear what happened after that, but it seems that the man suspects that his wife will change her religion and the problems between the couple surfaced again,” said a Mangaluru police official, requesting anonymity.

The body was dumped under a heap of sand in a construction site which was discovered by workers, people aware of the development said.Though a preliminary investigation has revealed that the boy had sustained injuries to the head, police officials have said that they are probing all angles to the murder, including the possibility of Black magic.“All we can say now is that he has sustained injuries to the head and that it is not a natural death,” a police official from the district said. He added that the possibility of it being a case of black magic would be ascertained after any arrests are made in the case. A case has been booked under Section 174 (C).Though Karnataka is considered one of the most industrious states in the country, there have been instances of practising black magic by fraudsters who promise fortunes and convince those in distress to even make human sacrifices.In early November, nearly 12 people were arrested in connection with black magic cases and even rescued a four-year-old girl allegedly going to be sacrificed, IANS reported.A two-year-old girl was found with burnt marks in the border district of Belagavi in September who was suspected to be subjected to black magic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twoyearold-found-murdered-in-karnataka-s-kalaburagi-101638990685496.html

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with officers on Covid management, Bommai said that he obtained details on the Covid situation in various districts, Covid clusters, primary and secondary contacts of Omicron patients, whether standard protocol are being followed for management and treatment of Omicron cases in other countries. “Today (Wednesday), I will collect details about Covid-19 in November from our officials, which will be presented before the cabinet tomorrow (Thursday). Whatever is happening regarding the Omicron variant and the developments taking place in Covid-19 clusters will be placed before the cabinet. Accordingly, a decision will be taken on issuing a fresh set of guidelines,” he said. The CM also said that the fresh Covid guidelines, if come into effect, will be for the entire state, not for ‘selected’ districts. “Controlling Covid cases in December and January and the need for fresh guidelines will be discussed elaborately in the cabinet meeting,” Bommai said today. He added that he has also obtained details on financial needs to tackle Covid till March 2022. “The expenditure incurred by BBMP, Health, Revenue departments for oxygen units, labs and other essentials for Covid management during the second wave and clearance of pending payments were also discussed at the meeting,” he said. On Wednesday, Karnataka reported 399 new cases of coronavirus and six deaths. The state’s Covid-19 caseload has climbed to 2,999,098 and the death toll to 38,249. Bengaluru Urban has continued to head the list of cases with 244 new cases as the city saw 100 discharges and three deaths. The total number of active cases in the state is now 7,255. This week, 101 students tested positive for Covid-19 in the Chikkamagaluru district, including 90 students and 11 staff. Before that, 29 students were found Covid positive at a private nursing school in Shivamogga. Bommai had earlier this week said that places with three or more cases of Covid-19 would be declared as a ‘cluster’. Meanwhile, the chief minister urged parents not to panic though cases were emerging in the schools and hostels. Children have to be cautious, and the schools and colleges have to strictly abide by the Covid-19 norms, he said. The CM appealed to parents and teachers to take a double dose of the Covid-19 vaccine if they had not done it yet. After a rise in Covid testing at the airport, the state government capped the prices for various testing methods. While the conventional RT-PCR test, which takes the most time (nearly five hours to obtain results), is priced at ₹500, the Cepheid Gene Expert test (results expected in 25 minutes) costs ₹2,750 per sample. The other testing methods available for international arrivals are the Abbott ID test ( ₹3,000), Thermo-Fisher Accula test ( ₹1,500), and Tata MD3 Gene fast/Tata MDXF test ( ₹1,200).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-bommai-hints-at-fresh-covid-19-curbs-across-state-101638990623137.html
09-12-2021||India||Odisha police plea against re-investigating 2 local BJP leaders’ murder rejected||BHUBANESWAR: An Odisha court on Wednesday rejected the state police’s plea challenging a magisterial court’s decision to order a re-investigation into the murder of two local Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in a Cuttack village and require the police to produce the call data records, or CDR, of three persons considered to be close to law minister Pratap Jena.In August, the court of judicial magistrate first class in Salipur area of Cuttack district ordered a fresh probe into the case. Three months later, in November, the court also asked the police to submit the call detail records of Mahanga panchayat samiti chairman Sarat Nayak, Bapi Biswal, a representative of law minister Pratap Jena and Prafulla Biswal, the main accused who died in a road accident in February, a month after the two murders.Additional district cum sessions judge in Salipur, Dhanurdhar Senapati, on Wednesday rejected the revision petition filed by police against the magistrate’s order.Kulamani Baral, 75, in charge of Salipur mandal of BJP and a former chairman of Mahanga panchayat samiti and his 80-year-old associate Dibyasingh Baral were killed on January 2 near Cuttack’s Jankoti village on their way home on a motorcycle.While Kulamani died on the spot, Dibyasingh Baral died the following morning at Cuttack’s SCB Medical College and Hospital.Kulamani Baral’s family alleged that the murder was linked to his campaign against local leaders of the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leaders over alleged irregularities related to PMAY houses meant for poor people.The first information report (FIR) registered by the police on the statement of Kulamani Baral’s son blamed law minister Pratap Jena and 12 others for the murder. Investigators, however, could not find any evidence to link the minister and did not name him in the charge sheet.Baral’s son asked judicial magistrate to get the murders reinvestigated, alleging that the police shielded him during their probe and kept his name out.As Mahanga police station inspector Nihar Mohanty did not submit the CDR or the reinvestigation report, the judicial magistrate court last week issued a show-cause notice to him asking him to explain as to why coercive and punitive action will not be taken against him for not appearing before the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-police-plea-against-re-investigating-2-local-bjp-leaders-murder-rejected-101638990443127.html

Alwar, who is in-charge of Assam, alleged that he and his colleagues were released only after five hours and allowed to return only in government vehicles. “Detained at Jorhat along with AICC delegation, Assam Police has orders to hold us in Jorhat , Assam and prevent us from travelling to Mon district, Nagaland. Why are we not being allowed to meet the families of the victims @AmitShah @himantabiswa?” Alwar posted on Twitter.Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi and Congress general secretary Ajoy Kumar were also among those detained at the airport.Jorhat superintendent of police Ankur Jain told HT: “The delegation was trying to go to the Nagaland border area which is sensitive. Problems could arise if they went there. We stopped them for a while and released them later.”Fourteen civilians were shot dead by security personnel during a botched ambush and a subsequent confrontation with local villagers on Saturday and Sunday. Union home minister Amit Shah told Parliament on Monday that the firing was a consequence of “mistaken identity” and that a special investigation team has been directed to complete the probe within a month.(With inputs from Biswa Kalyan Purukayastha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-killings-congress-delegates-en-route-to-mon-district-stopped-at-jorhat-airport-101638990324762.html

He was commissioned into the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles. Lidder had served as India’s defence attache to Kazakhstan and was a counterterrorism specialist.His daughter Aashna Lidder’s book ‘In Search of a Title: Musings of a Teenager’ was released on November 27. He was very proud of his daughter’s achievement and fondly talked about her book. The CDS’s wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat had attended the book launch.“We trained together at #NDA. We fought terrorists together in #Kashmir. In the loss of Brig LS Lidder, SM, VSM today, India has lost one of its brightest & bravest officers & I have lost a friend. A decorated soldier, caring husband & doting father, you will be missed, Tony,” MP Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said in a tweet.Rawat’s staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, who was also killed in the crash, was known to be a thorough professional. “Col Harjinder Singh was commissioned under my command. He was my Adjutant and a fabulous officer. I will miss you, my ever-smiling Harry. May you Rest in Peace,” Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan (retd) wrote on Twitter.The chopper was flown by Wing Commander PS Chauhan, the commanding officer of 109 Helicopter Unit at Sulur, and his co-pilot Squadron Leader K Singh. The other two IAF personnel on board were junior warrant officers -- Rana Pratap Das and Pradeep A.The army identified the others killed as Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitender Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik BS Teja.The only survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, is under treatment at the Military Hospital in Wellington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counterterror-specialist-among-victims-of-coonoor-crash-101638990150790.html
09-12-2021||India||After CDS Rawat’s demise, Centre faces critical succession question||The shocking demise of India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash on Wednesday will have direct implications for the country’s top military hierarchy and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan at a time India is locked in a border standoff with China, top officials said.“The situation is unprecedented as General Rawat was the country’s first CDS. The government will have to select a top officer and appoint him as CDS. The succession line-up in the three services is broadly known but not so in the case of CDS as it’s a new appointment,” said one of the officials cited above.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane has become the most senior military officer in the country after Rawat’s demise. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him.There is a strong possibility of Naravane being named as the next CDS if the government follows the seniority principle, said a second official.“If Naravane is named the next CDS, the post of army chief will fall vacant. The government will have to appoint a new army chief. Rawat’s death will have a cascading effect on the succession line-up of the armed forces,” he added.Army vice chief Lieutenant General CP Mohanty and Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi, who are both course mates, are the most senior officers in the army after General Naravane.According to a key recommendation made by the Shekatkar committee on enhancing the military’s combat potential, the government should choose the CDS from among the three service chiefs. Naravane will be the front-runner for the top job if the government goes by that recommendation made by an 11-member expert panel, headed by Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd) in 2016.“The government will have to appoint the new CDS as soon as possible keeping in mind the security challenges India faces from China and Pakistan,” Shekatkar said.Naravane is due for retirement next April but that may not happen in the changed circumstances. Many in the security establishment believe that the first two or three CDS appointments should be from the army as the security challenges the country faces are along the borders with the two adversaries.However, making top appointments is the government’s prerogative. The possibility of deep selection cannot be ruled out as was done when Rawat was appointed army chief almost five years back, said a third official.The National Democratic Alliance government superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz — to appoint Rawat army chief on December 31, 2016. Rawat’s experience in Jammu & Kashmir and the Northeast tipped the scales in his favour.Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years, making him the longest serving four-star general in India.As CDS, Rawat wore multiple hats -- he was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), headed the department of military affairs (DMA), and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar last week said the creation of DMA and the post of CDS two years ago was “the single most important” higher defence organisation reform since Independence.The appointment of a CDS was backed by a group of ministers after recommendations made by the K Subrahmanyam-led Kargil Review Committee (KRC) that was constituted in the immediate aftermath of the 1999 Kargil war to examine lapses that allowed Pakistani soldiers to occupy strategic heights, the initial sluggish Indian response, and suggest measures to strengthen national security.
09-12-2021||India||Parliament: Opposition corners govt over commitments at Glasgow climate meet||The climate crisis took centre stage in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday as opposition parties raised questions on how India plans to meet its commitments made at the recent climate conference in Glasgow and why states weren’t consulted before announcing that the country will achieve net-zero emissions before 2070.On November 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at the Glasgow climate change conference (COP26) that India’s non-fossil energy capacity will reach 500 GW by 2030, meeting 50% of the country’s energy requirements by 2030.He said India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes between now and 2030; reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030, over 2005 levels, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. PM Modi had also flagged that the ambitious action will be impossible without adequate climate finance from developed nations.In the Lok Sabha, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi said the youth were facing uncertainty and anxiety due to the climate crisis and cited analysis that says India needs 5630 GW of total installed solar energy to transition to net zero emissions.“India has only 46.25 GW of grid connected solar power. I want to know how can we achieve so much? What we have done is nothing compared to what we have promised to the world,” she said.Kanimozhi said the PM’s Council on Climate Change last met in 2015 and asked how the PM announced national climate goals without consulting the council. “He also did not consult the states and chief ministers,” she added, asking for details on what has the Centre done under the national action plan on climate change.Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar of the Trinamool Congress, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury of the Congress and Rahul Ramesh Shewale of the Shiv Sena raised issues like vulnerability of coastal areas, polluted air from north India moving towards the east during stubble fire episodes, and poor national performance on environmental parameters in the environmental performance index 2020.India ranked 168th out of 180 countries in the index released by Yale University last year.A senior official of the Union environment ministry said the climate crisis debate broke new ground. “I do not remember any Lok Sabha debate on climate crisis being held before. This is perhaps the first big one. It’s particular important because this shows that climate is an important issue for people. Environment minister Bhupender Yadav will respond to all these concerns and queries at the end of the debate under rule 193 of Lok Sabha.”Sunita Narain, director general at Centre for Science and Environment, said, "Extreme weather events are showing us how urgent the crisis is, and this is what is also reflected in the debate."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-opposition-corners-govt-over-commitments-at-glasgow-climate-meet-101638990025612.html
09-12-2021||India||Coonoor crash turns spotlight on high-profile military air accidents||The horrific Mi-17V5 chopper crash near Coonoor on Wednesday, that resulted in the deaths of chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika , defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder, and 10 others has turned the spotlight on previous air accidents involving top military officials.The Coonoor crash came 58 years after top military officials were killed in an Indian Air Force Alouette chopper crash near Poonch on November 22, 1963. The officers killed were Lieutenant General Daulat Singh, Lieutenant General Bikram Singh, Air Vice Marshal EW Pinto, Major General KND Nanavati, Brigadier SR Oberoi and Flight Lieutenant SS SodhiMaking a statement in Parliament on the crash, then defence minister YB Chavan said, “In the death of these officers, our defence forces have lost very distinguished, able and promising leaders. Their great qualities of leadership have contributed greatly in the past, particularly of Lieutenant General Daulat Singh and Lieutenant General Bikram Singh, and particularly Air Vice Marshal EW Pinto did great work in the last air exercises.”“In their death, we feel that we have lost something very valuable,” he said.The CDS chopper crash is also a reminder of the February 1952 Devon crash that almost wiped out the Indian Army’s top brass, including two future chiefs. Lieutenant General SM Shrinagesh and Major General KS Thimayya, both of whom went on to become army chiefs, survived the crash. Miraculously, there were no casualties in the crash.Major General SPP Thorat, later Eastern Army commander, Major General Sardanand Singh, Major General Mohinder Singh Chopra and Brig Ajaib Singh also on board the Devon aircraft. “Each survivor of the Devon crash was presented a salvaged chair from the crash as a souvenir. General Chopra’s chair is still there in the family home in Kasauli,” said defence analyst and Chopra’s great grandnephew Angad Singh.Shrinagesh’s ADC Captain K Sundarji, who later became army chief, gave up his seat at the last moment to accommodate Brigadier Singh.Flight Lieutenant Suhas Biswas, the pilot, was awarded the country’s highest peacetime gallantry award, Ashoka Chakra, for his heroics and outstanding presence of mind that saved the lives of all the people on board. It was the IAF’s first Ashok Chakra. Biswas died in a Dakota crash in the Nilgiri hills a few years later.The generals were later invited to spend the night at the residence of Major Gen BS Chimney, UP Area commander. At dinner, Chimney’s wife asked them how they came out of the burning aircraft. The witty Shrinagesh replied, “In the same order as we went in.”In his personal notes, Shrinagesh wrote, “Just when the brave pilot had regained control of the aircraft, my eyes shot back to the engine. It had by now disappeared, leaving a gap without any trace of flames.”In a letter to Shrinagesh, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said, “As it’s all over now, one can look upon it with composure. It is perhaps a good thing to face such contingencies provided one survives.”Eight senior military officials were killed in a Mi-8 chopper crash in Bhutan in May 1993, including then Eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Jameel Mahmood.Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh and eight others were injured in a Dhruv advanced light helicopter crash in the Poonch sector in October 2019.

09-12-2021||India||Parliament approves bills on ART, surrogacy||Parliament passed on Wednesday a bill to regulate assisted reproductive technology (ART) services such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) centres, sperm or egg banks and curb unethical practices related to issues such as sex selection.The Rajya Sabha passed the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill 2021 by a voice vote, a week after the Lok Sabha cleared the draft legislation. The Upper House also approved the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2020, which will regulate the booming surrogacy practice in India.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya introduced both bills in the Upper House on Tuesday, but discussions were disrupted by Opposition protests over the suspension of 12 lawmakers. The bills were introduced together because they were closely related.The minister said that the ART bill was brought after due consultations and such services needed regulation to protect women and children from exploitation.“Many such ART clinics have been running in the country without regulation. A need was felt for regulation of such clinics as there are implications on the health of those who undertake the procedure,” the minister told the Lower House on December 2. “If there is no regulation, the unethical practices will increase,” he added.The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on December 1 despite some Opposition members criticising provisions that kept single men and members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) communities from accessing these services.The ART Bill proposes the constitution of a national board to set minimum standards of physical infrastructure, laboratory and diagnostic equipment and expert manpower to be employed by clinics and banks.Authorities will set up a national registry and registration authority to maintain a central database and assist the national board. The bill also proposes stringent punishment for those practising sex selection, sale of human embryos or gametes, running agencies, rackets, and organisations violating the law.The surrogacy bill aims to ensure effective regulation of the practice, asking states to form a state surrogacy board for regulatory purposes, within three months after the Centre notifies the law .The bill allows any willing woman to act as a surrogate, and also lets widows and divorcees to opt for surrogacy to have children. To safeguard the rights of a surrogate, the bill proposes an increase in the insurance cover timeline for surrogate mothers to 36 months from 16 months provided in the earlier version.Once the act comes into effect, commercial surrogacy will be banned and illegal in India, including sale and purchase of human embryo and gametes. The bill was controversial and underwent several improvisations because in the first draft, tabled in 2019, the government intended to allow only altruistic surrogacy with the surrogate being a near relative.The bill was earlier passed by the Lok Sabha, but the Rajya Sabha referred it to a select committee in 2019. It will now go back to the Lok Sabha for approval. Mandaviya said that most of the recommendations of the select committee were incorporated in the bill.“We still need to see what are the amendments that have been approved in both the Bills or whether it is the original version that has been passed. There isn’t enough clarity at the moment. But the issue of excessive paperwork remains the same, for which they’ve proposed severe punishment. We don’t know how the clinics will run in the future,” Dr Shivani Sachdev Gour, senior gynaecologist and obstetrician, and IVF expert, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-approves-bills-on-art-surrogacy-101638989784437.html
09-12-2021||India||Never heard a blast like that: Eyewitnesses on Coonoor crash||Chennai: Shortly after noon, 55-year-old K Raja was preparing to attend a wedding in Coonoor town when he heard a loud explosion. He ran out of his home in the village of Kattery and saw a helicopter engulfed in flames crashed on the ground.“I’ve never heard a blast like that,” said Raja, who lives among the 100-odd families in the hilly village in Nanjappa Chatram, four kilometres from Coonoor.Raja’s daughter, Sangeeta, 24, was outside their home when she heard a loud sound and saw a helicopter flying very low. She said she saw the helicopter crash into a tree, resulting in an explosion and flames.“It was at this point that my father rushed out of the house, and we saw the chopper fall to the ground, engulfed in flames and parts falling off. It was misty but there was no rain at the time. When the chopper fell, the fire was so intense that it lit up the sky, cutting through the mist,” Sangeeta said.At first, there was a sense of shock among the residents of the village. Then they understood the gravity of the situation and rushed to the spot where the Mi-17V5 helicopter had come down to begin rescue operations.Sangeeta was among the first to reach the burning wreckage and joined others who were attempting to douse the flames with buckets of water. “The crash was so close to our homes and I heard someone calling out for help,” she said.Her added: “Everyone stopped whatever they were doing. They were screaming.” Many people ran to the crash site to help put out the fire. “There were more blasts and the helicopter kept burning. We carried large pots and kept pouring water, but we couldn’t go too close. It was too hot,” said Raja, a sanitation worker with the Coonoor panchayat.At the time, the villagers didn’t know that the helicopter was carrying the Chief of Defence Staff(CDS), General Bipin Rawat,and 13 others, and that it had crashed about 10km from the spot where it was meant to land. Rawat, his wife Madhulika and 11 others died in the crash, and the only survivor -- Group Captain Varun Singh -- was taken to the Military Hospital in Wellington.A labourer, also named Raja, said his friend called him from Kattery and he reached the spot in 10 minutes. “We pulled out and carried the first body,” he said.Rescue operations were hampered as the crash site was 6 km from the closest road. “It was deep in the forest, full of thorny plants and when we ran to the spot, we saw a person who was on fire,” Raja said. “But he was alive, he waved his hand like he was calling for help. So my friends and I used a bedsheet to carry him up the hill to the road.”All emergency services, including the police and fire services, and military personnel reached the spot soon after the crash and the rescue operations lasted more than three hours. “It was the public that first went and began carrying bodies though,” Raja, the labourer, said. Larger fire engines couldn’t access the route to the crash site and even smaller vehicles took time to reach the spot because there was a traffic jam, he said.Officials said the crash occurred around 12.20pm. Rescue teams were seen pulling out people with severe burn injuries from the site. “The rescue operations finished between 3.45pm and 4pm,” said Tamil Nadu forest minister K Ramachandran. Eight ambulances were and six medical teams from Coimbatore’s government and private hospitals were sent to the site, said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan.Local residents are used to seeing army helicopters flying over the area as there is a military helipad and the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington, where Rawat was to address students on Wednesday. “But this is the first time something so terrible happened,” said Raja.The entire settlement was traumatised after witnessing or learning about the horrific crash, he added.Another witness, Krishnaswamy, told reporters that the occupants of the helicopter were badly burnt. “They (rescuers) took them out and then I left because I got scared looking at the people who were burnt,” he said. Another witness said he had seen the helicopter flying at a very low level when it abruptly fell, hitting a tree with a loud noise.(With inputs from C Hamza in Coonoor)
09-12-2021||India||Supreme Court panel on charges against me was cleared by all judges, says Gogoi||“Why Gogoi? Why only Gogoi all the time? Is it because Gogoi comes from the North-East and not from mainstream India?” asked former Chief Justice of India and currently a Rajya Sabha MP, Ranjan Gogoi, as he talked about his memoir – Justice for the Judge.Launched on Wednesday, the former CJI’s book contains 14 chapters setting down various known and unknown details about his childhood, his journey to judgeship, and the spate of controversies that he got embroiled in during his 13-month tenure as the head of judiciary between October 2018 and November 2019.In an interview , justice Gogoi said that the decision to set up in-house committee to enquire into sexual harassment charges against him was approved by all the judges of the Supreme Court, and that the complainant woman employee was reinstated not after his retirement but during his tenure as the CJI.You are the first former CJI who has come out with a memoir. What prompted you to write the autobiography? I am the also the only CJI who needed to place correct facts for people to know. The peaceful life that I had anticipated after my retirement in November 2019 did not materialise. There were half-truths, untruths and incorrect statements floating around. I thought the correct facts need to be placed before the country. But I am not in the people’s court. I am very clear in my mind that whatever I did as a judge, on the judicial side or on the administrative side, they were correct decisions in my wisdom and in my conscience. I don’t need sympathy of anyone. I don’t need recognition. But I need people to know what are the correct facts.There is a perception that you were the judge in your own cause when you constituted a committee that eventually gave a clean chit to you in the sexual harassment case. In the book, you say that the committee was set up after approval of all the judges. In respect of the person against whom the allegations were enquired into by the committee, I could have no role in any step of decision-making. The whole matter was entrusted by me to justice Bobde. So, it really was for justice Bobde and the other judges to decide whether the fact that the committee was constituted by the full court of the Supreme Court should be put out in the public domain. It was their decision not to make this information public. Therefore, it has now come in my book.The book says that the complainant was reinstated during your tenure by justice Bobde on humanitarian grounds. At the time the allegations in April 2019, you called it a serious attack on independence of judiciary. How do you view her reinstatement?The employee wrote to justice Bobde, who was the senior most judge, requesting for her reinstatement on humanitarian ground. Justice Bobde placed that letter before me because only the CJI can pass such administrative orders. I requested justice Bobde to deal with the matters since the CJI could not function in this matter. Justice Bobde, in his discretion, thought that reinstatement should happen. Compassion is an integral part of administration. If justice Bobde wanted to show compassion, its fine. I must have all respect to his decision since the power was delegated to him by me.At one point in the book, you say: “Some of my colleagues, while putting up a facade of support and sympathy which I did not seek, actually worked against me behind my back.” Do you believe that some of your colleagues were either behind the controversy or stoking it? \Yes. This is a fact. I have written this book for truths to emerge. Every sentence of the book is correct. I have not speculated about anything. But I would not speculate on who had what in mind; who works with what motive, one cannot fathom. What I have said in the book is that there was a brother judge who tried to be kind on face of it but behind my back, he was no kind.You write in your book that the then CJI, justice Dipak Misra, threatened “to resign if justice KM Joseph was not appointed” to the Supreme Court by the government. He was finally appointed in August 2018.For one reason or another, justice Jospeh’s elevation was not coming through. As the CJI, justice Misra had to put his foot down. I came to know that he had to apply a greater degree of pressure on the government. Full marks to justice Misra for doing this! He performed the true role of a CJI. Eventually, the ultimate word lies with the judiciary in matters of judicial appointments. When the judiciary is right and fair but the executive is obstinate, the judiciary must have its way.What do you have to say about joining the January 2018 press conference with three other senior judges?The judges at that point in time felt there was no alternative since justice Misra was not inclined to listen to the senior judges about the issues relating to listing of matters etc. At that time, the press conference was certainly required. And it did produce certain positive results. Hopefully, such occasions do no arise in future. But it is an experience from which the institution has learnt something.You were often criticised as the innovator of sealed cover envelopes in the Supreme Court. Even the hearings of the PIL in Jain Hawala Diary case was conducted by the Supreme Court in-camera (confidentially) in 1990s. Forget the materials produced, even the hearings were done minus everybody. Sealed cover has been adopted in 2G, coal block allocation cases; all investigation reports are submitted in sealed cover. Even an activist lawyer submitted his own report in Shaheen Bagh protest case in a sealed cover. Why Gogoi? Why? Justice SK Kaul writes an order (in Rafale) but it becomes Gogoi’s judgment. Sealed covers have been there in the Supreme Court since 1990s but Gogoi becomes the innovator of sealed cover. Why Gogoi? Is it because Gogoi comes from North-East and not from mainstream India?You belong to Assam. It is said that you could not have heard the case of National Register for Citizens (NRC) dispassionately and therefore, you should not have passed orders for rolling out NRC in Assam? I have said it in my book that the incapacity to hear a case must be felt by the judge himself. Is it that because I am from Assam, I should not take cases from Assam? And these cases from Assam affect the nation is what the Supreme Court said in Sarbananda Sonowal Case (2005). There is a case which has come before me that concerns Assam but touches India. Is Assam not a part of India? Should I ignore national interest just because I am from Assam? Is that the meaning of the oath I have taken as a judge? I refuse to understand the meaning of my oath in this manner. Do you know that I also had to apply for NRC, prove my linkage to my ancestors, give supporting documents like everybody else?
09-12-2021||India||Cabinet clears Ken-Betwa river linking project||The Union Cabinet led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved the interlinking of the Ken and Betwa rivers at a cost of ₹44,605 crore, which will be completed in eight years. A massive infrastructure project, the linking of the two rivers will be bring water to the perennially drought-hit and impoverished Bundelkhand region, spread across the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The Cabinet approved a special purpose vehicle called the Ken-Betwa Link Project Authority to be set up to implement the project, which will generate 103 MW of hydro power as well as 27 MW solar energy, an official statement said. The Ken-Betwa project involves building a dam on river Ken, a major river of the Bundelkhand region, with a 221-km canal to transfer “surplus” water to the Betwa basin. It was first mooted during the tenure of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. This project will provide water to the districts of Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Damoh, Datia, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen in Madhya Pradesh, besides Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh. The Madhya Pradesh government has approved mandatory alternative land to compensate habitat loss in swathes of the Panna Tiger Reserve due to the river-linking project. According to the statement, this project involves transfer of water from the Ken to the Betwa through the construction of the Daudhan Dam and a canal linking the two rivers. The canal will provide drinking water to an estimated 6.2 million people, according to the project’s plan and bring 10.62 lakh hectare under annual irrigation. Thanking the Prime Minister for approving the project, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said: “This project will prove to be a boon for Bundelkhand. The project will provide irrigation and drinking water to drought-prone areas of Chhatarpur, Panna and Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and generate 103 MW of hydropower and 27 MW of solar power. This project will bring prosperity in Bundelkhand.” “This project will particularly benefit Uttar Pradesh as well as up to Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Damoh, Datia, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen of Madhya Pradesh. This project, which is slated to be completed in eight years, will change the lives of people Bundelkhand,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-ken-betwa-river-linking-project-101638989605087.html
09-12-2021||India||First among Generals: CDS Rawat was a fauji to the core||India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, 63, was an outspoken military leader who took pride in his convictions, took hard decisions at the cost of becoming unpopular in certain circles, thought outside the box, and was known to challenge status quo, people who have known him for decades said.He was also a dog lover, a rare general who didn’t play golf, and a commander whose leadership and courage were acknowledged on foreign soil too.General Rawat epitomised military professionalism like no one else, said a retired three-star general who was among Rawat’s best friends. “He was driven by his own convictions. He took strong decisions even if they were not popular. The organisation’s interests were always topmost for him and he didn’t really care about his own popularity,” said Lieutenant General BS Sandhu (retd), who knew Rawat for more than 45 years and was his course mate at the Khadakwasla-based National Defence Academy.Rawat’s previous appointments included those of the army chief, army vice chief, Southern Army commander, corps commander in the North-east and division commander in Kashmir.But the assignment he really loved talking about most was his tenure as the commander of United Nations’ North Kivu Brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the late 2000s. “It was one of my most memorable assignments. I am glad I could make a difference there,” Rawat told HT a few years ago.When he took charge of the brigade, things weren’t going too well for the world’s costliest peacekeeping mission, known by its French acronym MONUC. The locals were contemptuous of UN peacekeepers, questioning what difference they had made and accusing the mission of doing little to protect them. Angry crowds would often hurl stones at UN vehicles on the streets of Goma, the capital of North Kivu and where the Indian brigade is based.“We were not fighting with our equipment, despite Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorising the use of force in some scenarios. We have decided to fight with our equipment,” Rawat said during the conflict in eastern Congo in 2008.Rawat reworked the velvet-glove strategy to an iron fist within a month of his arrival, frequently authorising the use of attack helicopters to strafe positions held by rebel groups responsible for civilian deaths, recruiting child soldiers and displacing millions of people. He was able to control the situation quickly.Under Rawat’s leadership, the Indian brigade saved a key Congolese province from being overrun by rebels. Lieutenant General Babacar Gaye, then Force Commander of the UN mission in the Congo, wrote in the commendation awarded to Rawat that it was due to his “leadership, courage and experience” that North Kivu’s capital Goma never fell, the country’s eastern region was stabilised and the main rebel group was forced to come to the negotiating table.General Rawat was a man with tremendous moral courage, said Lieutenant General Ajai Singh, who heads the Andaman & Nicobar Command and reported directly to the CDS. “He was an exceptional military leader, with a rare, larger vision for integrated warfighting,” Singh said.From changing the face of UN peacekeeping to closely supervising India’s two publicly acknowledged surgical strikes on foreign soil, Rawat brought enormous experience to the table as India’s first CDS, something acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.Son of a three-star general, Rawat was commissioned into the army in December 1978 after graduating from the Dehradun-based Indian Military Academy where he was awarded the Sword of Honour. He was commissioned into the 5/11 Gorkha Rifles.The National Democratic Alliance government superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz — to appoint him army chief in 2016.In a statement, the Indian Army said Rawat was a visionary who initiated far reaching reforms in the military’s higher defence organisation, and was instrumental in creating the foundation of India’s joint theatre commands and giving impetus to the increased indigenisation of military equipment, a legacy which will be carried on and strengthened by successive generations.
09-12-2021||India||Treat Omicron cases in separate facilities: Centre to states, UTs||The Centre on Wednesday directed all states and Union territories to treat patients infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in designated facilities with separate isolation areas to avoid cross-transmission.In a letter to the states and UTs, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “All omicron positive cases have to be treated in designated Covid facilities with separate isolation areas earmarked for Omicron positive patients. It has to be ensured that no cross infection takes place and adequate precautions are taken by health care workers in these facilities to prevent transmission among other patients and health care workers.”The health secretary also asked the state governments to ensure that samples of positive cases of international travelers and their contacts as well as from emerging hot spots are promptly submitted to INSACOG labs for genome sequencing, as per protocols.All states will also have to ensure that all international travellers who have arrived in India from any of the “at risk” countries, get tested for Coronavirus disease on the eighth day, Bhushan said.As many as 23 cases of Omicron variant were reported in the country till Wednesday night. Several states have already stepped up checks and restrictions in the wake of the potential threat from the Covid variant that has now spread to over 50 countries.“Further to contain the spread, it is imperative that states may follow a mission mode and focused approach of quickly tracking the primary and secondary contacts of the positive cases and facilitate testing for them as per the protocol. It is critical to track all contacts of such cases, quarantine them without delay and test them as per the guidelines,” the letter said.Community surveillance should be prioritised to follow up positive cases as well as contacts on a daily basis to monitor their clinical status and to keep a check on symptoms. Further, with the onset of winter and increased pollution in some states, prevalence of influenza like illness, severe acute respiratory infection and respiratory distress symptoms should also be closely monitored, Bhushan said.Experts said tracking, testing and treating is crucial to contain the spread of the new variant.“These are the key measures needed to both control or prevent the spread. India has taken several aggressive measures such as strict screening of international passengers on arrival, that should work well,” Dr Amita Jain, head of Microbiology department, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, said.
09-12-2021||India||December 8: What we know about Omicron variant so far||The findings from the first lab studies to estimate how resistant the Omicron variant could be were published early on Wednesday, unanimously predicting what could be the biggest hit yet to the protection offered by coronavirus vaccines, although experts said fully vaccinated people may still have a substantially better chance of averting severe disease.The findings are based on lab tests in which researchers expose a live virus or an engineered virus expressing the same mutations as the Omicron variant to antibodies drawn from people who were given doses or had a past infection, or both.The first was from researchers in South Africa, where the variant of concern (VOC) has spread rapidly, leading to an unprecedented explosion in new cases. The scientists found there was a 41.4-fold drop in neutralisation ability overall, to the point that variant almost completely escaped the antibodies from most fully vaccinated samples. But, crucially, five out of six samples of antibodies from people who were fully vaccinated and had a past disease could neutralise the virus.Two other studies, by separate teams of researchers based in Sweden and Germany, made similar findings, including a massive drop in neutralisation titers, which is calculated on the basis of concentration required for antibodies to neutralise the virus – the more concentration, therefore more antibodies, needed, the sharper is the drop in the titer.A fourth study conducted by Pfizer and its subsidiary BioNTech too recorded a 25-fold drop in titers when antibodies from people with two doses were exposed to Omicron, but the deficit disappeared when antibodies from people with a third booster dose was used.What does this mean?The studies confirm what immunologists were hypothesising seeing the unprecedented number of mutations in Omicron: the ability of past immunity, elicited either solely by vaccination or only by history of disease is likely to be significantly hampered in staving off an Omicron infection.But crucially, the immune escape is only partial, not total, and that those with hybrid immunity – vaccinated as well as recovered from Covid-19 – are likely to have substantial protection. Hybrid immunity has long been regarded as a sort of gold standard of protection against the Sars-Cov-2.Pfizer, in its statement, contends that its third shot offers significantly higher protection, although the study from Frankfurt university researchers appears to conclude that even with boosters, neutralisation titers show a significant drop.Scientists also said that vaccine efficacy against severe disease and death is likely to remain reasonably high among all groups – those with a past infection, full vaccination, vaccination and infection, and boosted vaccination.This is likely due to the activation of memory cells, particularly T cells, which can recognise the pathogen more broadly and are less affected by mutations in Omicron – something Pfizer alluded to in its statement.“Although two doses of the vaccine may still offer protection against severe disease caused by the Omicron strain, it’s clear from these preliminary data that protection is improved with a third dose of our vaccine,” said Albert Bourla, chief executive of Pfizer. “Ensuring as many people as possible are fully vaccinated with the first two dose series and a booster remains the best course of action to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”The four lab tests are still using small numbers of samples and must be seen as preliminary, and they do not signal whether the drop in vaccine efficacy will be in similar measure. Measuring neutralisation in lab setting is not a proxy for vaccine efficacy, but they do act as a correlate.Implication for IndiaThe high transmissibility of Omicron variant is a cause for concern for India as it is globally. India’s mainstay vaccines have also demonstrated lower efficacy across the board when compared to mRNA vaccines.In late July, the Indian Council of Medical Research estimated that two out of every three Indians may have been exposed to the virus, translating to a high proportion of the general public likely exposed to an infection. As on December 8, the country has also delivered at least one dose to 86% of the adult population.India, therefore, likely has a different immune profile to other countries, especially those where vaccine coverage and case rates have been low. A sizeable number of people may even have hybrid immunity.But the findings from the studies published in the last 24 hours reinforce the need for a booster dose strategy in the country, particularly for the elderly population that was mostly covered in the first half of 2021. How Omicron spreads among children will also be of crucial implication for India, where no one under the age of 18 is eligible for a dose yet.
09-12-2021||India||Farmers set to call off stir as govt agrees to demands||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of protesting farm unions, said on Wednesday that it was close to sealing a deal with the Union government after the two sides settled on a set of revised draft proposals to resolve the pending demands of the cultivators. The SKM is likely to ask tens of thousands of its farmer activists across states to call off a 14-month-long movement against the Modi government on Thursday. However, an end to the agitation was still contingent upon an officially signed letter from the Union government based on the agreed draft proposals, SKM leaders said. “The government has taken two steps forward. We are in agreement to all the revised proposals. The government must now convert these proposals into an official letter, which we are ready to sign,” Gurnam Singh Charuni, a farm leader said after the breakthrough meetingThe apparent compromise between the Centre and protesting farm unions arrived after two days of back-channel negotiations that saw proposals being sent back and forth between a five-member negotiating team of the SKM and the Union government. A crucial meeting of the SKM’s team at the Singhu protest site on the capital’s outskirts on Wednesday began with a two-minute silence to mourn the death of the country’s top military general, chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat, and 12 others in a helicopter crash on Wednesday in Tamil Nadu. The five members, who were authorised by the SKM to take decisions on behalf of all farm unions, unanimously accepted the Centre’s revised draft after a two-hour-long meeting. The SKM, on December 4 named five of its senior-most members to negotiate with the Centre: Ashok Dhawale, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, Shiv Kumar Kakkaji and Yudhvir Singh. Earlier on Tuesday, the five-member panel raised various points of contention on draft proposals sent by the Centre, sending them back to the home ministry seeking revisions. The Centre then reworked the proposals, paving the way for an imminent agreement. Charuni said the farmers’ team would not divulge the specifics of the proposals agreed by it until a formal letter was received from the Centre. The SKM will meet again at noon on Thursday. “The government’s letter should reach us by noon tomorrow. Only then, we will take a decision on calling off the agitation,” he addedOn November 19, the Union government gave in to a major demand of the farmers when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government would abandon three farm-reform laws that had sparked the year-long protests. On November 29, Parliament repealed the laws that farmers say were against their interests. The revised draft proposals, which was agreed upon by the SKM’s team, provide for a committee “mandated to ensure Minimum Support Price can be granted to all farmers”, an SKM leader from Haryana said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak. The Centre has also given a written assurance that it would not reduce the current level of procurement of farm produce at assured prices, a second farm leader said, also asking not to be named. The key proposal that clinched the deal relates to withdrawal of all police cases registered against farmers during the course of the protests. In its earlier proposal, the government said it would ensure cases against farmers would be taken back once the farmers called off their protests. The five-member team of farm leaders objected to this conditionality. “In its revised proposal, the government has said it would ensure cases are taken back with immediate effect,” the farm leader quoted in the first instance said. A third farm leader, who asked not to be named said there were still a few sticking points. One, the SKM doesn’t want farm organisations other than its affiliates to be part of the proposed committee to be formed to look into farm-produce prices. Second, the revised draft still did not mention a law guaranteeing minimum support prices, a key demand of the farmers. Third, although the Union government has assured in writing there would be no criminal liability on farmers for burning crop residue, a key source of air pollution, the SKM wants the Centre to free farmers from even civil liabilities, such as fines for stubble burning. The farm protests, which first started in Punjab before spreading across states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, have posed a major challenge for the Modi government. Farmers first held demonstrations in Punjab in October 2020, soon after Parliament passed the three contentious agricultural laws by a voice vote and without discussion, as India was battling the Covid-19 pandemic. The laws seek to open up the country’s food markets to greater corporate participation. While Modi argued that the laws would have widened markets for cultivators, farm unions said they legislation would have allowed big corporations and supermarket chains to dictate low prices, hurting their livelihood. The Union government’s decision to scrap the laws came as the Bharatiya Janata Party, Modi’s party, prepares to fight upcoming state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand, where farmers are an influential voting bloc. “The acceptance of farmers’ demands after a year-long protests is a great victory for the farmers. It demonstrates that the farming community has reclaimed their political space through a peaceful agitation,” said Sudhir Panwar, a professor with Lucknow University. 
09-12-2021||India||Cabinet clears extension of rural housing scheme||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the continuation of the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) till March 2024, saying the flagship national programme to provide financial assistance for building houses in rural regions needed another three years to meet targets. The original deadline of the scheme was 2022.Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur told reporters that the central government will provide financial support for constructing the remaining 15.5 million houses, out of the targeted 29.5 million “pucca houses”. The number of houses pending completion was 15.5 million as on March 31, 2021.“The continuation of scheme till March 2024 ensures that the remaining 155.75 lakh (15.575 million) households within overall target of 2.95 crore (29.5 million) houses under PMAY-G would be provided assistance for construction of pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” in rural areas,” said a government statement, released after the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Till November 29, 16.5 million PMAY-G houses had been constructed, said the government. By August 2022, the original deadline of the scheme, 20.2 million houses will be ready.The government said that in order to complete the remaining houses, PMAY-G will continue till March 2024 as per existing norms.“The total financial implication for construction of the remaining 155.75 lakh (15.575 million) houses is Rs. 2,17,257 crore (central share ₹1,25,106 crore and state share Rs.73,475 crores) for achieving cumulative targets of 2.95 crore (29.5 million) houses in rural areas under the PMAY-G and an additional requirement of Rs.18,676 crore towards the interest repayment to NABARD,” said the statement.The expenditure for the scheme is shared 60:40 between the Centre and the states for all states other than Himalayan states and those in the north-east, for whom the split is 90:10. The split is also 90:10 for union territories.The government also said that an additional ₹45 lakh administrative funds (to manage the scheme) will be given to each smaller state every year. These are Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Goa, Punjab, Uttarakhand, the North-East states except Assam and Tripura, and all Union Territories except Jammu & Kashmir . This amount will be over and above 1.7 % administrative funds (1.7% of the funds given for the scheme) released.The aim of the scheme, launched in 2016 was to provide a proper house to all houseless individuals or to those families living in so-called kutcha houses. Households are selected on the basis of the socia economic and caste census of 2011, and verified by local authorities.“I don’t see an extension, unless they have or had a plan to close the scheme. This scheme has always existed. Hence the word ‘extension’ doesn’t mean anything. The government is basically just saying that the program is going to continue. I don’t see any announcement of extension in this.” said Himangshu, professor, Jawahar Lal Nehru University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-extension-of-rural-housing-scheme-101638988583372.html
09-12-2021||India||Chopper crash kills CDS Rawat, 12 others||India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, and 11 others were killed on Wednesday when an Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper crashed near Cooonor in Tamil Nadu in an air tragedy that shocked the three services and came as a huge setback to the country’s biggest military reforms since Independence.The only survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, is under medical treatment at the Military Hospital in Wellington.Rawat, 63, the country’s most senior military officer and longest serving four-star general, had survived a chopper crash in February 2015 in Nagaland.“With deep regret, it has now been ascertained that Gen Bipin Rawat, Mrs Madhulika Rawat and 11 other persons on board have died in the unfortunate accident,” IAF said in a statement on Twitter.The dead include Rawat’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder and the CDS’s staff officer Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, it is learnt. Fourteen people, including the chopper’s crew, were on board the Russian-origin Mi-17V5, a modern and reliable military helicopter that was being flown by Wing Commander PS Chauhan, the commanding officer of 109 Helicopter Unit, and his co-pilot Squadron Leader K Singh. The other two IAF personnel on board were junior warrant officers Rana Pratap Das and Pradeep A.The army identified the others killed as Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitender Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik BS Teja.“Gen Bipin Rawat was an outstanding soldier. A true patriot, he greatly contributed to modernising our armed forces and security apparatus. His insights and perspectives on strategic matters were exceptional. His passing away has saddened me deeply. Om Shanti,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter.The PM added that, as India’s first CDS, Rawat worked on diverse aspects relating to the armed forces including higher defence reforms and brought with him rich experience of serving in the army. “India will never forget his exceptional service.”IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari rushed to the crash site to take stock of the situation. An inquiry has been ordered into the crash, the air force said.An eyewitness said he heard a loud explosion when the helicopter hit the ground. “I’ve never heard a blast like that,” said K Raja, who lives among the 100-odd families in the hilly village in Nanjappa Chatram, 4km from Coonoor. His daughter, Sangeeta, said that while the air was “misty” when the crash happened, there was no rain in the area.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who visited Rawat’s residence shortly after news of the crash broke, later tweeted: “General Rawat had served the country with exceptional courage and diligence. As the first Chief of Defence Staff he had prepared plans for jointness of our Armed Forces... His untimely death is an irreparable loss to our Armed Forces and the country.”Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers there, officials said. Singh, the sole survivor of the crash and a decorated fighter pilot, is directing staff at DSSC.The chopper was on its way from the Sulur air base to DSSC when it went down near Coonoor. The CDS, his wife and seven others had flown to Sulur from New Delhi in an Embraer jet of the IAF’s VVIP communication squadron.The helicopter’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, if undamaged, will give clues to what went wrong during the last moments before the crash, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan (retd), former additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Any aircraft accident is shocking. The Mi-17V5 has a good flight safety record, it’s a reliable machine and pilots swear by it,” Bahadur added.The Mi-17V5 can carry a load of around four tonnes in a cargo role. It can fly at extremely low altitudes and insert troops behind the enemy lines.THEATERISATION DRIVERThe CDS’s shocking demise will have implications for the ongoing military reforms, including theaterisation, and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan. Rawat survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur in February 3, 2015. He was a lieutenant general at that time.Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years.“General Rawat epitomised military professionalism like no one else. He was driven by his own convictions. He took strong decisions even if they were not popular. The organisation’s interest was topmost for him and he didn’t really care about his own popularity,” said Lieutenant General BS Sandhu (retd), who knew Rawat for more than 45 years and was his course mate at the Khadakwasla-based National Defence Academy.Sandhu’s wife Kuka and Madhulika Rawat attended Daulat Ram College in Delhi together.As CDS, Rawat wore multiple hats --- he was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), headed the department of military affairs (DMA), and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.The National Democratic Alliance government superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz — to appoint him army chief in 2016. Rawat’s experience in Jammu & Kashmir and the North-East tipped the scales in his favour.Those who have known the general for several decades say Rawat always thought outside the box, took hard decisions and was not afraid of challenging status quo, qualities he drew on while working out the broad structures on India’s proposed theatre commands.SWORD OF HONOURSon of a three-star general, Rawat was commissioned into the army in December 1978 after graduating from the Dehradun-based Indian Military Academy, where he was awarded the coveted Sword of Honour for exceptional performance. He was commissioned into the 5/11 Gorkha Rifles.From changing the face of United Nations peacekeeping in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and initiating the biggest exercise to restructure the army to closely supervising India’s two publicly acknowledged surgical strikes on foreign soil, Rawat, a rare general who did not play golf, brought enormous experience to the table as India’s first CDS.The Rawats were planning to construct a house in Dehradun and wanted to settle there after the completion of his term as CDS, family friends said. They have two daughters, Kritika and Tarini.In a statement, the Indian Army said Rawat was a visionary who initiated far reaching reforms in the military’s higher defence organisation. “He was instrumental in creating the foundation of India’s joint theatre commands and giving impetus to the increased indigenisation of military equipment, a legacy which will be carried on and strengthened by successive generations,” the army added.The horrific Mi-17 crash near Coonoor came 58 years after six top military officials were killed in a chopper crash near Poonch on November 22, 1963 --- Lieutenant General Daulat Singh, Lieutenant General Bikram Singh, Air Vice Marshal EW Pinto, Major Gen KND Nanavati, Brigadier SR Oberoi and Flight Lieutenant SS Sodhi.
09-12-2021||India||2002 riots case of larger conspiracy, not limited to one person, SC told||The petitioners seeking an investigation into the larger conspiracy behind the Gujarat riots told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that they do not wish to contest the closure report against the then chief minister Narendra Modi submitted by the special investigation team (SIT) as there is no “undisputed” material to show that the larger conspiracy emanated from the meeting called by the CM on February 27, 2002.The submission was made by senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for the two petitioners , Zakia Ahsan Jafri, the widow of former Congress MP Ashan Jafri, and activist Teesta Setalvad. Reading out a statement prepared by the petitioners, Sibal said, “Our case is of larger conspiracy, not emanating from the February 27, 2002 meeting alone, but involving other persons such as bureaucrats, politicians, public prosecutors, police, VHP, Bajrang Dal and state functionaries, that is based on undisputed documents and facts that should have been investigated by SIT.”Sibal said, “My allegation of conspiracy is not limited to a person, but if the SIT would have investigated the Tehelka tapes and other material that we provided, you could have found out the larger conspiracy.” He said that a statement clarifying this aspect would be filed and should be taken on record. The statement said: “ SIT did not investigate the larger conspiracy, but limited itself to matters in dispute relating to a meeting of February 27, 2002. Qua that meeting, SIT has come to a certain conclusion which is part of the closure report. Since the petitioner has not made any submissions on disputed facts, the petitioner did not contend before this Court that a larger conspiracy emanated from the meeting of February 27, 2002 alone. In fact, during the course of submissions, no reference was made by the petitioner to this meeting at all.” During the hearing earlier in the day, the Court wished to know if the petitioners wished to press the allegations against the then chief minister who was named by Jafri in her June 2006 complaint as one out of 63 persons who needed to be probed for their involvement in failing to prevent the riots.The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar said, “It was your allegation that at the highest level, the first person (in the state) was also involved….The SIT produced contemporaneous material to show there is no basis in the allegation that instructions came from the top. Charge sheet cannot be filed against persons without any material. If you have something more, tell us.”Sibal said that the allegation in the complaint was based on the statement made by suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhat who claimed to be present in the February 27 meeting. Later, it was revealed by SIT that he was not present at the meeting. “On day one I said that Bhat was not present. There was no other way to confirm the indication that a direction was issued by the chief minister. We have accepted that. At no stage did I try to implicate the ex-CM and I have not argued that even. The Court may accept the closure report to that extent. I have nothing to say on that.”The bench said, “The SIT has dealt with the larger conspiracy. The purpose of their investigation is to collate material, form an opinion and submit the report to the court. Now, according to you, conspiracy remains at the local level.”Sibal said, “A larger conspiracy involving individuals whose undisputed extra-judicial confessions are on tape, read along with inactions of officials demonstrated by undisputed documents, should have been investigated by the SIT….The extent of the conspiracy, the identity and number of individuals involved, the preparatory acts committed and the time, place and manner in which the meeting of minds for purposes of such conspiracy took place can only fully emerge on investigation.” He then showed the Court those portions in the Tehelka tapes and official documents which he claimed SIT failed to investigate. He also defended Setalvad on the allegations made by SIT that she tutored witnesses. “She has worked with NHRC, filed applications and even appeared before this court all along. SIT took no objection then and now her reputation is besmirched,” he said. “Victims in this country are not in a position to challenge the power of the state which is a monolith. It is difficult for them to challenge the mighty state. So, there are persons like the NHRC, citizens tribunal and Setalvad who help organize the victims,” Sibal added. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for SIT told the Court that he required some time to reply to the petitioners’ submission. The court posted the matter for Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2002-riots-case-of-larger-conspiracy-not-limited-to-one-person-sc-told-101638988582818.html
09-12-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi condemns action on Rajya Sabha MPs, attacks govt on prices||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday lashed out at the Narendra Modi government over the price rise and the economic situation, dubbed the suspension of 12 Opposition MPs “outrageous” and “unprecedented”, demanded a “full-fledged discussion on the border situation and relations with our neighbours” and also sought justice for families of victims in the Nagaland killings. Addressing the Congress Parliamentary Party at the Central Hall of Parliament, Gandhi hailed the farm organisations for their 13 month-long protests and said, “It is the solidarity and tenacity, of the farmers, their discipline and dedication that has forced an arrogant government to climbdown.” She reiterated the commitment “to stand by the farmers” to demand a legally guaranteed minimum support prices (MSP), remunerative prices and compensation to the bereaved families. While the government has already passed the repeal bill in both Houses of Parliament, Gandhi slammed its hasty passage. “In this government’s usual style, the repeal was done undemocratically just as their passage last year was pushed through without discussion,” she said.Her comments came on Wednesday morning, before the apex body representing farmers said it reached an agreement with the government. Gandhi’s political attack on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government was centered on the plank of the common people. “I cannot understand how and why the Modi government is so insensitive and continues to deny the seriousness of the problem (price rise). It seems impervious to the suffering of the people.” The Congress president, who addressed the party’s parliamentary wing for the first time in the stormy winter session, said the prices of edible oils, pulses and vegetables are “burning a hole in the monthly budget of every household” while the spiraling price of cement, steel and other basic industrial commodities “does not bode well for economic recovery.” She questioned the government’s claims of economic recovery and said, “But recovery for whom is the real question?” reiterating the allegation that the government works for a chosen few. “It means nothing to those millions who have lost their livelihoods, and to those MSMEs whose businesses have been crippled—not just by Covid19 pandemic but also by the combined effects of notebandi (demonetisation) and the hasty implementation of a flawed GST (goods and services tax),” she said. Gandhi blamed the Centre’s “half-hearted and ill-advised responses” to tackle the economy and maintained the recent cut in the excise rates on fuel “totally insufficient and inadequate.” “And all this while, the Centre persists with huge public expenditure on vainglorious projects!” Gandhi added, in an indirect reference to the Central Vista project. The Opposition had earlier demanded that the Central Vista redevelopment must stop and the funds should to diverted for health infrastructure and other social welfare expenses. Minutes before the entire Opposition in the Rajya Sabha joined the sit-in stir at the Mahatma Gandhi statue, the Congress president said the suspension of 12 MPs was “outrageous” and “unprecedented” and said, “it shook us all”. She added that the suspension from the entire session “violates both the Constitution and the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Council of states.” The MPs were suspended for unruly scenes seen in the previous session of Parliament.She maintained the government’s regret for the Nagaland killings is “not enough” and demanded “credible steps” to prevent any future occurrence of such “ghastly tragedies”. In a botched operation on Saturday, security forces killed 14 civilians in Nagaland’s Mon district.The Congress president disapproved the government’s monetisation plan as “disastrous” and said, “The Modi government is busy selling off precious national assets like banks, insurance companies, public sector enterprises, railways and airports. First, the Prime Minister destroyed the economy with his demonetisation move of November 2016. He is continuing on that disastrous path, but calling it monetisation.” She wondered what would happen to employment of scheduled castes and tribes if public sector companies and institutions continue to be privatised. “Already lakhs upon lakhs of people, mostly young, have joined and continue to join the ranks of the unemployed,” Gandhi told the lawmakers. Private-sector firms are not bound by the government’s reservation rules, which set aside a number of positions for members of the scheduled castes and tribes.Gandhi found it “extraordinary” that no discussion has been held on the continuing challenges faced on our borders. “Such a discussion would have also been an opportunity to demonstrate a collective will and resolve. The government may not want to answer difficult questions but it is the right and duty of the Opposition to seek clarifications and explanations.” HT reached out to Bharatiya Janata Party leaders for a comment but could not get one immediately.
09-12-2021||India||General Bipin Rawat loved sweets, fauj and was wary of China||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat was often politically incorrect, much to the chagrin of the straightjacketed military and diplomatic establishment on Raisina Hill — but he was the man that they decided would lead India in the worst-case scenario. Blunt, outspoken and with integrity of the highest order, Rawat was not afraid of speaking his mind to either politicians or the three service chiefs when it came to military reform and the defence of the country. He was a fighter and a nationalist to the core.Wednesday’s accident, which took his life, was not the first time Rawat was in a helicopter crash. On February 3, 2015, when he was III Corps Commander, he cheated death when his Cheetah helicopter crashed at Dimapur. Indeed, he took off to meet the Eastern Army Commander in Arunachal Pradesh in the next available helicopter before being medically grounded on account of a spinal injury. He had his ankle mangled after a huge stone hit him while on an operation against the Pakistanis on the Line of Control (LoC) in the Uri sector in Kashmir and had a wound medal — but he never claimed disability allowance by lowering his medical category.CDS Rawat chopper crash: PM Modi chairs CCS meet, Rajnath, NSA in attendanceThe General from Pauri Garhwal came to the notice of the Narendra Modi government after he, as Dimapur Corps Commander, supervised a strike against NSCN (K) insurgents on and across the Indo-Myanmar border by Special Forces in June 2015. Prior to that he performed exceptionally as the 19 Division commander in the Uri sector against the Pakistanis. Gen. Rawat came into his own as a military commander when he took on the Chinese PLA at Doklam Plateau on the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction in June 2017. Despite all odds, Rawat, with the full support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval stopped the PLA from building a road to the Jhampheri Ridge, which would have made India vulnerable in the Siliguri corridor. History will record the stubbornness and resolve of the Indian Army even as Beijing issued daily verbal and physical military threats to force them to back off. Gen Rawat not only prepared his army for vertical escalation but also had the confidence of his political bosses, national security planners and intelligence chiefs.Rawat, who had a huge sweet tooth, had the rare ability to reach out across the ranks of not just the Indian Army, but the two other services as well when he became India's first CDS on January 1, 2020. He had very little time for military pomp, show and regalia and was happiest amongst his troops. He was a leader of men and abhorred the paraphernalia associated with army generals. He stopped playing golf just to set an example to other officers.When the Chinese PLA transgressed across the Ladakh LAC in April 2020, the Modi government turned to Gen Rawat and the present Army Chief Gen M N Naravane to handle the show.General Rawat along with the NSA and External Affairs Minister formed the core group for diplomatically and militarily tackling the aggressive PLA. National security planners vividly remember that Gen Rawat knew each and every hill feature and track on the south bank of Pangong Tso and the Kailash Ranges during the planning of the offensive on August 29-31, 2020. It was ultimately this offensive on the south bank that forced the PLA to restore status quo ante on the north bank of the lake. He was totally focused on the Chinese activity along the LAC and knew that the real threat to India came from Beijing. And to that extent he never took the Chinese word on its face value.As a military administrator in-charge of military affairs, PM Modi tasked Gen Rawat to create theatre commands and modernize the army with rationalization of forces and equipment. Even though many within the military, particularly the Air Force, did not like the move as it led to loss of power for the service chief, Gen Rawat was relentless in his pursuit. He prepared the full draft proposal for the military theatre commands last November and gave it to the three service chiefs for comments till June 2022. Gen Rawat used to say that this was a mandate that PM Modi had given to him, and he would complete it during the 75th year of Indian independence regardless.Gen Rawat is no more, and it is for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that all the work already done on jointmanship is not shelved by the military-civilian bureaucracy of the day.When, as Army Chief General Rawat and his men confronted the PLA at Doklam Plateau in June 2017 at Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction, a top functionary recalls, he used to say, “When in doubt, one should pray”.Today, we pray for the fearless CDS.
09-12-2021||India||NIA court orders Bharadwaj’s release on ₹50,000 cash surety||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai on Wednesday ordered activist Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case, be released from jail after furnishing a surety amount of ₹50,000. Special NIA judge Dinesh Kothalikar rejected the 60-year-old activist’s plea to let her stay in Chhattisgarh and Delhi, where she worked before, and prohibited her from leaving the jurisdiction of the special NIA court in Mumbai, also ordering her to surrender her passport. The court restrained her from speaking to the media on the case though her counsel, advocate Yug Chaudhry, opposed the condition and said it was “an infringement of her freedom of speech”.The court allowed her plea for furnishing a cash bond of ₹50,000 for three months, so as to enable her to arrange sureties. “We have completed all formalities by Wednesday evening around 6.30 pm and have even dropped her released bond in the bail box at Byculla Women’s prison. The box will be opened on Thursday morning around 5 am so Bharadwaj should walk out of jail on Thursday,” said Chandni Chawla, counsel for Bharadwaj.Bharadwaj, who was arrested in 2018, is currently at the Byculla women’s prison in Mumbai The development came a day after the Supreme Court dismissed the NIA’s petition against the bail granted by the Bombay high court to Bharadwaj, who is facing charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly participating in a purported Maoist conspiracy to trigger violence on January 1, 2018, in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village.On December 1, the Bombay HC allowed default bail to Bharadwaj, underlining that a Pune sessions judge, who granted police a 90-day extension on November 26, 2018, to file the charge sheet, did not have jurisdiction to do so as only a special NIA court could hear UAPA cases.
