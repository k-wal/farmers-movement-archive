According to a press statement issued by ED, the agency initiated investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after taking cognizance of several FIRs lodged against him in different police stations, related to murder, extortion, cheating, forgery, land grabbing and crimes of similar nature. “During investigation under PMLA it was found that Atiq Ahmad through the criminal activities used to earn black money in cash and the same was deposited in several bank accounts of Atiq, his kin and close associates. It has been noticed by the ED that these funds are being credited in their accounts from various firms and companies of his aides. These funds have been further utilized for buying land in the name of his wife at the consideration price far below the government’s value,” the press statement said. “The ED has gathered data from IT department and other agencies related to the companies being run by Atiq’s aides. The agency is taking statements of the persons concerned and carrying out inquiry to ascertain the source of funds invested in these companies. Money trail of proceeds of crime is also being established,” reads the press statement. “In this provisional attachment, land property situated at mauza Katka, Paragana Jhunsi, Tehsil Phulpur, in name of Shaista Parveen, wife of Atiq Ahmad has been attached. This was acquired by Atiq Ahmad for only ₹4.5 crore which is far below the government’s value of ₹6.86 crore. In addition, the ED has also attached bank account balance of ₹1.28 crore lying in 10 bank accounts of Atiq Ahmad and one account of Shaista Parveen.” This was the first attachment by ED and further investigation was under progress, and more assets of Atiq Ahmad and his aides were likely to be attached in due course, said ED officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-ed-attaches-properties-worth-rs-8-14-cr-of-atiq-ahmad-wife-101639419909938.html

In order to construct the Mumbai- Ahmedabad high speed train corridor, 432.67 hectares of land in Maharashtra is required. Of this, 174.77 hectares has been acquired so far according to the NHSRCL. As per the latest information by the NHSRCL in Maharashtra — 82.31 hectares of land of the required 287.53 hectares has been acquired in Palghar, 92.46 hectares of land in Thane of the required 140.32 hectares. However, no land so far has been acquired in Mumbai suburban of the required 4.82 hectares. In the Mumbai suburban area, land is required for the construction of the Mumbai underground high speed train terminal at the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), which has not been acquired yet. The NHSRCL recently deferred the bid submission for construction of the station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) till April 2022 due to delay in land acquisition.In order to begin the on-ground construction in Maharashtra for the project, 80 to 90% land will be acquired. The land acquisition has been at a slow pace in Maharashtra because of the reluctance from the state government. The Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had earlier questioned if the bullet train project of any benefit to the state and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had appeared non- committal on the project after coming to power. On ground construction work for the corridor has started in Gujarat. In October, NHSRCL had acquired 33 percent of land in Maharashtra for the project. The construction work of the bullet train corridor project has started in Gujarat and the first phase between Surat and Bilimora is expected to open by 2026. The 508.17 km of the Mumbai project, 155.76 km is in Maharashtra, 384.04 km in Gujarat and 4.3 km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The estimated cost of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project is ₹1,10,000 crore of which ₹88,000 crore will be funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nhsrcl-acquires-40-39-land-in-maharashtra-for-mumbai-ahmedabad-train-corridor-101639417930111.html
13-12-2021||Other||Activists write to Bhupesh Baghel to reconsider move to expand mining in Hasdeo Arand forest||Wildlife activists and researchers wrote a letter to Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Monday, requesting him to reconsider the state government’s decision to pursue proposals for the opening up and expansion of mining operations in the Hasdeo Arand forest. The letter stated that despite the Chhattisgarh government’s assurance recorded in the 2012 forest clearance for the Parsa (East) and Kete Basan (PEKB) coal mine, wherein it has been stated that “the State Government will not come up for opening up of the main Hasdeo-Arand”, the permission has been given. “We believe this to be an ill-considered decision, one that will have devastating long-term consequences for the natural heritage of Chhattisgarh and the lives and livelihoods of millions. It is, furthermore, a decision that lacks both scientific legitimacy and popular mandate, since it neither accurately represents the will of the indigenous communities that reside in the Hasdeo Arand forest, nor follows the recommendations of the expert study that was conducted to evaluate the environmental and biodiversity conservation impacts of mining in the region,” the letter stated. The letter also mentioned the study of Forestry Research (ICFRE) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) which was submitted to the Chhattisgarh government in October 2021. Notably, the report stated that the Hasdeo Arand forest in which the HACF lies is one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forest in Central India, spanning 170,000 hectares. The forest is also the catchment of the Hasdeo River, the Mahanadi’s largest tributary, and is therefore critical for perennial river flow. It is also the watershed for the Hasdeo Bango reservoir, which is critical for the irrigation of 300,000 hectares of double-cropped land in Chhattisgarh. Through camera traps and sign surveys, the WII report has recorded the presence of over 25 species of mammals in the study area – including nine species listed under Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and thereby accorded the highest protection under Indian law,” the letter stated. The WII report also claimed that the surrounding landscape is an integral part of the elephant range in northern Chhattisgarh, with a “conservative minimal estimate” of 40 to 50 elephants using the area at different times of the year. “The report recommends that ‘mining operations may only be permitted in the already operational PEKB mine of the block’, and that other areas in HACF and landscape surrounding it should be declared ‘no-go area’ and no mining should be carried out considering the irreplaceable, rich biodiversity and socio-cultural values,” it stated. “We urge you to overturn your government’s recommendations to the MoEFCC regarding the opening up and expansion of further mining operations in Hasdeo Arand forest. In doing so, you would only be fulfilling the mandate you have received to safeguard the natural heritage of Chhattisgarh and the lives, livelihoods and rights of indigenous communities,” the activists requested in the letter. Sudeip Shrivastva, an environment lawyer based in Chhattisgarh, responding to the letter, said, that the state government should withdraw the proposal of mining in the Hasdeo forest. “Ideally, after getting the WII reports, the state government ought not to process any further clearance of mining in this area and should withdraw the diversion of forest in Phase-2 clearance of PEKB mining area and Parsa and Kete Extension,” Shrivastava added.

The entire team is working on a war footing. A trial run of water supply is going on in many areas. In a few days, we will be able to start the water supply completely,” said principal secretary, Namami Gange, and rural water supply department Anurag Srivastava. On Saturday, the PM had also said that his government had cleared the nearly ₹45000 crore Ken-Betwa river linking project which would rid the Bundelkhand region of water crisis. “We are working tirelessly to ensure that pure water is supplied to the people of Bundelkhand and the Vindhya region so that they can get rid of a majority of illnesses caused by contaminated water including diarrhoea, jaundice, cholera, and other gastro diseases,” Srivastava said. Medical experts agree that with a tap water supply, 60 percent of stomach-related diseases will be cured. “’Har Ghar Nal Yojana’ will prove to be a boon for the people of Bundelkhand who have been struggling for years to obtain safe drinking water,” said Dr PK Gupta, a member of UP Medical Council and former president of IMA, Lucknow Chapter. The central government has provided water supply in 43 percent of rural areas in the last two years under the “Jal Jeevan Mission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-steps-up-efforts-to-ensure-tap-water-in-each-b-khand-house-101639417329759.html

Now PM Modi has built a grand corridor, he said.Yogi also said Kashi faced adverse circumstances for 1000 years just like the country and every Indian.Though Indore’s queen Rani Ahalyabai Holkar had got the Kashi Vishwanath temple reconstructed between 1778 and 1780, now a grand Kashi Vishwanath Dham has been built after many years just because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said.Yogi also said every Indian is delighted and those who love Indian culture and tradition are thanking the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/construction-of-kv-corridor-was-possible-just-because-of-pm-modi-yogi-101639417210837.html

13-12-2021||Mumbai||After HC rap, state to remove landfill in Uran mangroves, notify area as forest||MUMBAI: After being reprimanded by the Bombay high court (HC) last week, the state government on December 9 convened a meeting of officials led by the cabinet minister for environment and drew up a plan to remove a 15-year-old unsanitary landfill from amid the mangrove swamps at Bori Pakhadi – about two km from the heart of Uran city in Raigad district.The development comes just five days after the HC sought the direct intervention of Aaditya Thackeray in this ‘long standing issue’. Dumping of municipal waste in the area has now been stopped from December 10, and the area will be cleaned up and notified as a ‘reserve forest’ in line with an HC order from a separate matter related to mangrove conservation.Last week, the HC pulled up both the Raigad district collector and Uran municipal corporation (UMC) for non-compliance with its own order from three years ago, prohibiting the dumping of municipal waste from Uran city in the mangroves on a 4 hectare plot at Bori Pakhadi. “We want the environment minister to intervene in this and sort it out,” the court subsequently added.The UMC has been dumping nearly two metric tonne of city waste in the area for at least 15 years, leading to the creation of a four hectare large garbage dump in the middle of the mangrove swamps, according to a December 2018 petition filed by the Uran-based Shri Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Sanstha (a fisheries co-operative).In response to this petition, the HC had on December 19, 2018, passed an order directing the UMC to divert its waste to an alternative site. The December 19, 2018 HC order stated, “The learned counsel appearing for the UMC submits that they have identified a plot where solid waste will be dumped. The learned counsel submits that the municipal council will not dump the solid waste in the restricted area till the alternate arrangement is made.”In an affidavit submitted to the HC subsequently on February 19, 2019, the district collector had stated that the alternative land for dumping solid waste is yet to be identified and allotted. This plan, however, has now been scrapped entirely. As per the minutes of the high-level meeting chaired by the environment minister on December 9 (that were submitted to the HC on Monday), the UMC will no longer require any allocation of land to stop dumping its waste at Bori Pakhadi.Instead, “the UMC will segregate wet waste from dry waste. Segregated organic waste will be processed at its existing bio-methanation plant at Sarvodayawadi, Tal, Uran,” as per the minutes. Dry waste, on the other hand, will be segregated at a nearby material recovery facility which is also operated by the UMC, while dry waste that cannot be recycled will be dumped at the City Industrial Development Corporation’s (CIDCO’s) solid waste facility some 40km away in Chal village, Panvel taluka. “UMC will pay the processing charges to CIDCO,” on similar lines as they have already been doing with the Panvel municipal corporation, according to the minutes.CIDCO has already started accepting the segregated waste since December 10. “In view of this, the UMC affirmed that the land for processing and disposal of solid waste is not required,” as per the minutes of the December 9 meeting. The UMC has also been directed by the environment minister to draw up an eco-restoration plan for the affected area at Bori Pakhadi in consultation with the forest department, according to the minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-hc-rap-state-to-remove-landfill-in-uran-mangroves-notify-area-as-forest-101639416849690.html

Delighted that Hon’ble PM Narendra Modi Ji is wearing our traditional ‘Leirum’ on such a historic day at Kashi.”Manipur’s traditional ‘Leirum Phee’ designed as an official ‘Lengyan’ (muffler) has cultural, historical, and emotional importance for the people of Manipur.Considering its importance, the state’s directorate of handloom had started the process of acquiring a geographical indication (GI) tag for ‘phee’, which means cloth in Manipur’s Meitei language.In June last year, the directorate had also written to the Union Ministry of Textiles, urging it to stop production of an indigenous cloth of the north-eastern state that is purportedly being manufactured on a mass scale and under a different brand name in Uttar Pradesh (UP) in a bid to safeguard local weavers’ interests following a video which started doing the rounds on social media.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already publicised the cloth after he wore it during his address to the nation on April 14 in 2020 on extending the lockdown restrictions due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The PM also wore it during his address to the nation on the occasion of Independence Day on August 15, 2019.‘Leirum Phee’ has been used as a symbol in Manipur on every sociocultural occasion since 2004 considering its cultural and economic significance, according to officials. The production of traditional ‘Leirum Phee’ had started during the reign of the Manipuri king Loyumba in 1074-1112 AD, according to official reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/manipur-cm-expresses-pride-in-pm-modi-wearing-traditional-lengyan-in-varanasi-101639416010389.html

For us, it was once in a lifetime occasion.” Devotees will get a taste of spirituality and comfort when they visit the Kashi Vishwanath temple through the spacious corridor which has been dedicated to the devotees, said Pandey and added that the corridor will help increase the income of the boatmen as now many devotees were most likely to visit Kashi Vishwanath Dham by boat since the corridor has connected Kashi Vishwanath temple and the Ganga. Devotees may board a boat any of the ghats and reach Kashi Vishwanath Dham while enjoying the scenic view of ghats and Ganga flowing calmly. The pilgrimage to Kashi will be an entirely new experience, he said. 
13-12-2021||Lucknow||UPTET-2021 now likely on Jan 23, ERA sends proposal to state govt||The Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test (UPTET)-2021, which was cancelled on November 28 due to paper leak, was now proposed to be held on January 23, 2022, said a senior education department official while requesting anonymity.A proposal in this regard had been sent to the state government on behalf of the office of the Examination Regulatory Authority (ERA), Prayagraj, the official added. UPTET is a state-level exam conducted once a year to enable candidates to gain eligibility to teach primary (classes 1-5) and upper primary (classes 6-8) classes in schools of UP government. The responsibility of conducting the exam lies with the ERA. Refraining from commenting on the proposal sent to the state government in this regard, secretary, ERA, Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi said, “Conducting the UPTET-2021 at the earliest in a transparent and fair manner is the top priority of ERA and efforts in this regard are well under way.”With this, the speculations over UPTET being conducted in December itself have ended. St the time cancellation of UPTET-2021, the state government had said that the examination would be conducted in a month’s time.However, officials say that conducting the exam again will take time as the ERA would need to again decide the printing press for printing of the question papers and OMR sheets (answer sheets) and also get the examination centres rechecked.After that, fresh admit cards will have to be sent to the candidates. However, the date proposed for re-conducting UPTET-2021 by ERA is expected to be approved by the state government as the emphasis is on getting the exam finally conducted as soon as possible.ERA officials say the number of TET centres is expected to come down by around 15 per cent after they are finalised. The state government has directed respective district magistrates to get the centres checked from their level. Only schools of good repute have to be made centres. In the centres that were set up for the November 28 examination, a large number of private schools of UP Board were also given the responsibility.There are about a dozen districts, including Prayagraj, where such schools were made centres where there was no arrangement to seat even 500 examinees at a time and due to which the count of exam centres had also increased.At the same time, fewer examinees were allotted in some of the bigger schools. However, now with inclusion of degree colleges, universities and even schools of other educational boards as exam centres, the total number of centres is expected to be reduced by 15 percent as compared to the centres made for the November 28 exam, officials said.UPTET for the primary level was to be held at 2,554 centres across UP between 10am and 12.30pm followed by test for upper primary level from 2.30pm to 5pm at 1,754 centres on November 28. A total of 12,91,628 candidates were registered to appear in the test in the first shift in the state while 8,73,553 were registered to appear in the second shift. However, the state government cancelled the exam after the recovery of question papers from 26 people arrested in five districts of the state hours before the exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uptet2021-now-likely-on-jan-23-era-sends-proposal-to-state-govt-101639415951260.html
13-12-2021||Mumbai||Domestically produced wine in Maharashtra set to get costlier||Mumbai: As two-decade long tax holiday for Maharashtra’s wine makers comes to an end on December 31, the state is contemplating imposing excise duty starting from the new year, which means that wine consumers might have to pay more for domestically produced wine in Maharashtra. The state is working on a new policy for wine made from grapes produced in the state, as the present one will expire by the end of the year. It is expected to be tabled before the state cabinet this month. “We may impose a marginal excise duty at around 5 to 10% of the manufacturing cost. This will be a nominal rate as the wine industry is yet to stand on its feet. So, instead of a 100% tax waiver, it may be between 90 to 95%,” a senior state government official who did not wish to be quoted said. A senior state government official said that a marginal rate of excise duty, which may be around ₹10 per bulk liter, may be levied. “If this rate is finalized, it will translate into a nominal rise in the MRP at an average of ₹10 per bottle containing 750 ml wine,” said a senior state government official. Alternatively, the producers could also absorb the tax without increasing the selling prices. However, the decision about the tax slab will be taken by the cabinet. The official added that while levying excise duty at around 5 to 10 percent of the manufacturing cost was also being considered, this alternate formula would lead to the retail prices shooting up by a steeper ₹25 to 30 per bottle, depending on the manufacturing cost declared by the wineries. Hence, a softer tax regime based on every liter of wine produced was likely to be adopted, considering that the industry is yet to establish a firm foothold. A wine producer too opined that a bulk liter-based system would be beneficial for the industry vis-à-vis one based on manufacturing cost. Wineries are also charged value added tax (VAT) of 20 per cent, of which 16 per cent is refunded to them. Currently wine from wineries outside Maharashtra are charged 100 percent of the manufacturing cost. While wine produced in wineries outside Maharashtra are charged duty at 100% of the manufacturing cost, those like Sula or Grover which have wineries in the state and make wine out of grapes grown here, are not charged any excise duty. The state also imposes a value added tax (VAT) of 20% on this domestic wine (produced from grapes grown in Maharashtra), of which 16% is refunded to them. Maharashtra has between 40 and 45 operational wineries. Of these, between 15 and 20 units directly market products, while the rest are only manufacturers. The wine industry has a turnover of around ₹1,000 crore in India, of which 65% in Maharashtra. Most wineries are located in Nashik — which produces around 80% of India’s wine, and is called the country’s wine capital —followed by Sangli, Pune, Solapur, Buldhana and Ahmednagar. Country liquor (CL), which is consumed more by working class drinkers because it is cheaper, has an excise duty. Wine, consumed by the elite, has a tax holiday. However, despite the concession, state excise department officials said that wine consumption has not shown a healthy growth. They attributed this to a lack of marketing channels besides liquor shops, which prefer to retail established brands. In 2020-21, wine consumption in Maharashtra was just around 70 lakh litres compared to country liquor (32 crore litres), beer (30 crore litres) and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) (20 crore litres). Jagdish Holkar, President, All India Wine Producers Association (AIWPA), said they expected the policy to ensure that wine was easily available to consumers, sans hurdles. “Wine must not be treated as liquor. Abroad, it is treated as a health drink,” he said, adding that a growth in wine production could boost the agro-economy, and ensure remunerative prices to farmers. Holkar also sought online licensing and ease of doing business. Rajesh Jadhav, former state secretary, AIWPA, urged the state government to extend their tax holiday for at least another decade. The state must allow wineries to sell their products directly to consumers to pull down prices and ensure smaller wineries were operational. India sees around 4 million cases of domestically produced and imported wine (one case includes 12 bottles of 750 ml each) being consumed. Maharashtra’s share hovers around 40%. BOX: India lags in wine consumption with per capita consumption estimated at just 10ml compared to 4 litres in China India sees around 4 million cases of domestically produced and imported wine (one case includes 12 bottles of 750 ml each) being consumed. Maharashtra’s share hovers around 40% Maharashtra is said to have the right soil, topography, mineral content, weather and water for growing grapes. One of the leading producers of table grapes, Maharashtra grows wine grapes on just 5,000-acre land, compared to 2.5 to 3 lakh-acre for table grapes On an average, one kilo of grapes can be used to produce around 600 ml wine||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/domestically-produced-wine-in-maharashtra-set-to-get-costlier-101639415949591.html

With offices resuming, these routes are noticing heavy rush causing traffic snarls everyday.With flyover and metro work going on at Chandni chowk, the service road from Kothrud which connects to Satara road has been closed. People coming from Bhugaon, NDA and Kothrud have to take the highway for daily commuting, causing a severe inconvenience.The alternate route near Sus-Pashan under construction flyover bridge is no less than a bumpy ride with the road riddled with potholes, thus causing overcrowing of vehicles. The alternate route is from the Hyundai showroom, Sus road via Supreme HQ building to Nanawre subway.When both of these routes were finalised , partial restrictions of Covid-19 were still in place, so commuters did not face trouble while commuting but now things are very different. The work of Sus-Pashan highway was expected to be completed by November 2021, however due to the pandemic, the deadline has been extended and now it is expected to be completed by April 2022.“We have informed the city traffic police, regarding the daily traffic jams which have increased in the last one month after Diwali break on both the alternate routes. At few places traffic police are deployed, while they will be increasing the bandobast to streamline the traffic,” said an official from the PMC’s project department. Bharat Bharambe who travels between Pune to Satara every day, said,“The highway gets overcrowded while coming back to Satara every evening. The traffic jam starts at Warje. On Sunday my car was stuck for more than an hour near Chandini chowk. It takes nearly 40-50 minutes every day to cover that stretch.”Sachin Vani who stays at Pashan said “Regional traffic police officials need to be there to maintain the traffic on road as two-wheelers are crossing speed limit and overtaking from the wrong sides. Currently traffic discipline is missing from this alternate route which is causing more jams.”More traffic diversionWith slab work of Sus-Pashan flyover set to commence in January, Pune Municipal Corporation’s project official and city traffic police are finalising a plan to divert the traffic. “It will be a difficult task again as traffic movement will need to stop completely, like we did when the pillar was demolished, the work will only start after the plan is finalised,” said the official from the city traffic police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traffic-congestion-on-new-alternate-routes-irks-chandni-chowk-and-sus-pashan-commuters-101639415650102.html

13-12-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Hemant government plans law against lynching||The Jharkhand government is planning to introduce a bill to curb the growing cases of lynching. The draft, Prevention of Mob Violence and Mob Lynching Bill,2021, which is yet to be cleared by the state Cabinet, proposes varying degree of jail term ranging from anywhere between three years to life imprisonment; apart from fines and attachment of properties for those found guilty of lynching. Two other states, Rajasthan and West Bengal have already enforced anti-lynching laws.According to the proposed draft bill, “...where the act leads to the victim suffering grievous hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and with fine which shall not be less than ₹3 lakh and may extend up to ₹5 lakh...where the act leads to the death of the victim, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for life and with fine which shall not be less than ₹25 lakh, and the movable and immovable properties shall be attached.”Additionally, besides strict punishment, the draft bill also allows punishment for conspiracy or abetment or aides or attempts to lynch; punishment for obstructing legal process; punishment for dissemination of offensive material, and punishment for enforcing a hostile environment.“...Whoever contributes or enforces a hostile environment on a person or a group of persons shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to a fine which shall not be less than ₹1 lakh and may extend up to ₹3 lakh,” the draft bill further reads.The bill also aims to put in place a top to bottom mechanism, with an Inspector General (IG) rank police officer to be appointed as nodal officers, with clearly laid out powers and duties and district magistrates ‘to prevent acts of lynching’ and ‘exercise authority against mobs’.Lynching became a major issue in the state ahead of the assembly polls in December 2019 after a series of such incidents were registered in Jharkhand, and the current dispensation, then in opposition, had made a poll promise to bring a law against the growing crime.The cases of lynching made national headlines when on June 17, 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari was allegedly tied to a pole and beaten to death by a mob at Dhatkidih village in Seraikela Kharsawan district on suspicion of theft. Ansari was purportedly seen in a video being forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Jai Hanuman’. On June 22, he had succumbed to his injuries in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jharkhand-hement-government-plans-law-against-lynching-101639412649679.html

According to police, the incident took place when the boy found tiffin box comprising three steel containers from a garbage dump while playing. The bomb exploded as soon as the boy picked up the tiffin box; killing him on the spot. Prima facie evidence suggests that miscreants kept the bomb at a secluded place to ensure police did not discover it during a search operation conducted during the Panchayat election. A bomb disposal squad team reached the spot to collect residues of the explosive for investigation and defused more bombs kept inside tiffin boxes. The nature of the explosives is yet to be ascertained, police said. “The bomb exploded when the boy picked up the tiffin box and he died on the spot”, said Bhagalpur senior SP Nitasha Guriya, adding that police have lodged a case and have started a probe against a suspect. Bhagalpur SSP told HT that a criminal recently released from the jail could be involved in the incident and police conducted raids at his hideout. On December 9, an unidentified ragpicker was killed in an explosion near Nathnagar railway station between Bhagalpur-Patna railway sections. Superintendent of railway police (Jamalpur) Aamir Jawed constituted an SIT to crack the case. On December 11, two schoolchildren received minor injuries in crude bomb explosions which occurred at Momin Tola locality barely 500 metres from the Nathnagar railway station. Police said three children found an abandoned canister near the trash while playing there. When they tried to open the canister, it exploded, injuring the two..

We have received intelligence inputs that molasses is used to make country-made liquor in some areas and hence we want to attack the supply chain,” Hasan said, adding, “Besides, keeping a tab on the sale of molasses, we have made a special team of officials and civilians to keep a watch over manufacturing of country-made liquor in rural areas.”He also cautioned the grocers against selling molasses without an aadhaar card and mobile number. “If caught selling molasses without aadhaar card and mobile number, stern action would be taken against them,” he said while instructing the marketing officer (MO) to monitor its sale and also asked them to hold a review meeting monthly with grocery shop owners.MO Shubham said, “We have report that country liquor is being prepared with molasses, white rice, and ammonium chloride (Nausadar). We hope that this directive will help check illegal trade.Kosi and Seemanchal areas are infamous for manufacturing country-made liquor as it is cheaper in comparison to Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and a large number of migrant populations living in the two regions can afford it.Country-made liquor is still easily available in rural areas even after transportation and sale of mahua is banned after the total prohibition was enforced in Bihar in 2016.Prof Naresh Kumar Srivasatava who has conducted research on tribes in Seemanchal and Kosi regions said, “You can’t enforce a total ban by using force. Tribal people are honest to their tradition of manufacturing liquor from rice and molasses and they won’t give up easily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/customers-need-to-produce-aadhaar-to-buy-molasses-in-bihar-s-supaul-distt-101639411929553.html

Hearing is expected in the matter on Tuesday.The Congress is a constituent of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state. Deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar had said if cases of the Omicron variant of Convid-19 continued to rise, the government would have to think about allowing the upcoming rally.According to a PTI report, Jagtap said an application was submitted to the state government in October 2021, seeking permission to hold the rally where Congress leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have been invited to address the gathering. However, till date no decision has been taken on the application, the petition said.He later said, “We do not understand why permission is not given to us? If they are concerned about Covid-19, we have already told them in our letter that we will adhere to guidelines. Since there is not much time left, we had to approach the court for permission,” the Mumbai Congress chief was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.We don't understand why permission is not given to us?

Since there's not much time left, we had to approach the court for permission:Bhai Jagtap, Mumbai Congress chief pic.twitter.com/pWdMV4C0UPThe plea has sought the HC to direct the state government to grant it permission to hold the public meeting and erect a temporary stage on one portion of the sprawling ground in central Mumbai. Jagtap's advocate Pradeep Thorat said the party has sought permission to use the park ground from December 22 to December 28 to hold a public meeting on the occasion of the 137th Foundation Day of the Indian National Congress.The plea said December 28 is a very important day in the history of the Congress as it is the party's foundation day.In 2010, the HC had declared the Shivaji Park area located in Dadar as a silence zone after a public interest litigation was filed by an NGO. The court had then said programmes can be held at the park only on select occasions - December 6 (death anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar), May 1 (Maharashtra foundation day) and January 26 (Republic Day).However, the state government and the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) later carved out 45 days in a year to permit non-sporting activities in the iconic ground.It was further reported, the BMC has submitted its report to the state government on its recommendation on whether or not the Congress rally could be held at the venue."Since, the state government is the competent authority, the final decision has to be taken by it (government). Out of the 45 days marked for non-sporting activities, 11 days are kept for miscellaneous activities,” Thorat said. “The quota of 11 days is still pending this year,” Thorat said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-congress-moves-hc-against-seeking-govt-nod-to-rahul-gandhi-s-dec-28-rally-101639411474711.html

13-12-2021||Mumbai||Respond to PIL for removal of national signs from PM CARES Fund: HC to Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday has sought a response from the Centre to the public interest litigation (PIL) seeking the removal of the title of Prime Minister, the national emblem and the national flag from the PM CARES Fund, as it is a private trust and the amount collected by it does not go to the Consolidated Fund of India. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice M S Karnik was hearing a PIL filed by Vikrant Chavan, Thane district president of the Indian National Congress, which sought to remove national emblems from the title and logo of the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (CARES) Fund as it was a private trust. The bench was informed that the trust was formed on March 27, 2020 and though the PM and other ministers were trustees, it was not a government trust. The PIL stated that the usage violated the laws and rules governing the symbols and sought directions for removal of the same. The bench was informed that the trust had been soliciting and collecting funds and had collected ₹3,076.62 crore for relief work by using the emblems and title of the prime minister. “The respondent No.1 Trust undisputedly does not discharge any regal, governmental or sovereign functions. The Respondent No.1 Trust is not the offspring or the blood and bones or the voice and hands of the Government of India. In fact, it has been admitted position that Respondent No.1 is not Government of India fund and the amount collected by it does not go to the Consolidated Fund of India,” the petition stated. The petition also states that relevant provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Rules,1982, The State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper use) Act, 2005 and The State Emblem of India (Regulation of Use) Rules, 2007 were being violated. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought two weeks time to take instructions to respond to the concerns raised in the PIL. However, the bench observed that it was an important matter and hence needed a reply on affidavit. Conjoint reading of the Act of 1950 with Rules of 1982 clearly indicates that use of names and emblems set out in the Schedule of the Act of 1950 is prohibited except in such cases and under such conditions prescribed by the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/respond-to-pil-for-removal-of-national-signs-from-pm-cares-fund-hc-to-centre-101639411629298.html

Hindustan Times had reported on December 9 that lack of funds to buy reagents have forced IGIMS to stop next-generation sequencing (NGS), amid the Omicron threat.Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that genome sequencing for the Omicron variant is currently being done out of Bihar, due to which the reports are taking time to come. “We will start the genome sequencing in Bihar and for this IGIMS has been identified,” he said.Sharing information on the steps being taken amid the possibility of a third Covid wave in the state, the CM said, “The health department has been instructed to keep a close watch. Very few residents in the state are testing Covid positive, but people entering the state from other countries are testing Covid postive. Bihar government is on alert; amid the possibility of a third wave and proper arrangements have been made in all the hospitals. Meanwhile, common people also need to be alert.” Currently, the samples are being sent to the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, the nearest mapped Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomics consortium (INSACOG) laboratory, for genomic sequencing to ascertain the strain of the Covid-19 virus.

13-12-2021||Patna||Using Niti Aayog report, Bihar pitches for special status again||Highlighting the Niti Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, released last month, which adjudged Bihar as the worst performer and a backward state, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday once again made a fresh plea for a special status to the state. In the latest SDG index report, which uses parameters of health, education, environment and overall human development index, Bihar is ranked last.Addressing the media after his weekly Janata Darbar programme, Kumar said, “There is no harm in accepting that Bihar is a backward state. A lot has been done for the development of the state. The state has made progress in the last few years. Women have developed. Rioting has stopped. Niti Aayog says that Bihar is a backward state. That is why we are saying that Bihar should get a special status.”“We have done a lot of work for the development of Bihar since 2005. The state budget in 2004-05 was ₹23,875 crore and in 2020-21 it is 2,18,000 crore. The per capita income has increased to ₹7,914 in 2004-05 and to ₹50,735 per person by 2019-20. Area wise, Bihar is at number 12 among other states of the country, while population wise it is at number three in the country,” he added.Seeking Niti Aayog’s support to help Bihar get special status, the chief minister said,“If Niti Aayog says that Bihar is backward, then only the backward should be taken forward. If Bihar gets special status, then many problems will end. Niti Aayog means National Institute for Transforming India. You need to work for the upliftment of the poor in the state.”On Sunday, Bihar minister for planning and implementation, Bijendra Yadav wrote a fresh letter to Niti Aayog vice-chairman asserting that Bihar “fulfilled all the criteria” set for grant of special status.The minister’s letter follows Aayog’s recent report on multidimensional poverty index in which Bihar was placed at the bottom in the country. In his letter, the minister admitted that Bihar stood way below the national average when it came to indicators like per capita income, ease of living and human development.Yadav blamed the state of affairs on “peculiar problems” of “landlocked” Bihar which had a high density of population with scarce natural resources and was plagued by vicissitudes like drought and flood that affected more than half of its districts.In a special category state, the Centre-state funding of Centrally-sponsored schemes has a ratio of 90:10, unlike a share of 60:40 or 80:20 in other states.Former Bihar deputy CM and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi had also expressed his displeasure over the Aayog’s report. “The Niti Aayog somehow prepared reports pertaining to education, health, road infrastructures and placed Bihar at the bottom. Its officials have opted for an old mechanism to evaluate things that are incorrect. They should consult the respective s. state governments and evaluate facilities by keeping in mind the development of the last 10 to 15 years,” said Modi.

Both have mild symptoms and are quarantined at home, according to information from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body said that Kapoor and Arora – both residents of Bandra – recently attended a private gathering organised by a friend following which they developed mild symptoms.Vinayak Vispute, assistant commissioner of the H/west ward (Bandra west area), said Monday afternoon, “Both actors underwent an RT-PCR test after they developed mild symptoms. They had recently attended a private gathering organised by another friend. We gathered information that this was a small gathering, and lasted for a little over two hours. All other guests have been asked to take the test for Covid-19. The actors have shown full cooperation with the BMC.”After Kapoor and Arora tested positive on Sunday, the civic body sealed their homes as per protocol. The RT-PCR tests of both actors were carried out on Saturday. Approximately 15 high-risk contacts and 15 close contacts of the actors have been traced, and their RT-PCR tests are being carried out. Tracing of further contacts is underway.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “Both actors had already taken both doses of their Covid-19 vaccine.”The BMC will monitor the actors’ health conditions routinely to check if both need to be hospitalised. “At present, we have asked them to be in home quarantine,” said an officer.He added, “As per the information with the civic body, there is no history of travel in both cases. The BMC will go through all their contacts and check if anyone has any international travel history. In that case, the respective samples will be collected and sent for genome sequencing to check for Omicron.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bollywood-actors-kareena-kapoor-khan-and-amrita-arora-test-positive-for-covid19-101639410069245.html
13-12-2021||Mumbai||Defamation case: Javed Akhtar seeks non-bailable warrant against Kangana Ranaut||Mumbai: Lyricist Javed Akhtar moved an application before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court (CMM) at Andheri for issuing a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Kangana Ranaut, as the actor failed to appear before the court. Akhtar has filed the defamation case against Ranaut in November 2020, alleging that she made defamatory and baseless comments about him in a television interview. Javed Akhtar’s lawyer Jay Bharadwaj pointed out to the court that while Kangana claimed to be unwell, the updates on her Instagram handle on November 15 clearly shows that she was actively involved in the shootings of her upcoming films. He handed out printouts from the actress’s Instagram handle. He added that in the last few hearings, Ranaut sought exemption from appearing in person on two grounds. One was that she was unwell and suffering from high temperature and body ache and the other ground was that she was in the process of challenging before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court, the order by which her application of transfer of the case from 10th court in Andheri to some other court was rejected. It added that on basis of the statements made by the actress’ counsel, the court adjourned the matter in the last hearings to December 13, for framing of charges. The plea said, “Kangana has not filed any appeal challenging the order passed by the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court.” The plea further states that “it can be clearly deciphered from the conduct of the accused that from the time of issuance of process, the accused has been deploying all possible tactics to cause inordinate delays in the matter and at the same time been making false and incorrect statements before this court. In other words, the present case could not proceed further after the issuance of the process owing to the wilful and deliberate absence of the accused solely designed to derail the proceedings and to cause incalculable hardships to Akhtar.” Akhtar further contended that the magistrate court had already accommodated Ranaut on the last three dates and urged the court to issue a non-bailable warrant against her “in the interest of justice” to secure her presence before the court. Metropolitan magistrate R R Khan adjourned the matter to January 4 for hearing the parties, after Ranaut’s counsel filed a reply to the plea. The court has also directed her counsel to keep Ranaut present before the court on the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamation-case-javed-akhtar-seeks-non-bailable-warrant-against-kangana-ranaut-101639406288913.html

The HC also praised the efforts of the Maharashtra government to control the second wave. “We have no hesitation that Maharashtra was a pioneer in tackling Covid-19. Several courts in some states are still not open (for physical hearings). Our collective efforts have succeeded,” said the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice M S Karnik. This was done as part of the hearing of a bunch of Public Interest Litigations (PIL) related to streamlining the vaccination process, provision of certificates and providing medical help for senior citizens, persons with disabilities. The court urged everyone to remain cautious, “Last year, we had limited knowledge about Covid-19, but during the second wave, we saw it become deadlier. However, we let our guard down and witnessed a difficult time. We don’t want a repeat of the dark days. We must not let our guard down. The union and state, everyone has to act hand in hand. We hope the new year brings in a new beginning and we never see a repeat of April 2021.”In the PIL filed by activist Feroze Mithiborwala and Yohan Tengra wherein they challenged the state government’s decision to permit only fully vaccinated persons to travel on local trains and visit public places, the court was informed that the decision violated the fundamental rights of the citizens and hence directions should be issued to permit all citizens to move unconditionally.

A total of 1,250 workers of the 4,200 workers in Pune division have resumed work. This has affected bus operations as most staff who have rejoined are from the workshops and administrative departments. Parab had warned protesting workers of action under Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) and other legal norms. Workers rejoining were assured that suspension orders will be revoked, however, workers on strike in the Pune division have remained resolute. For over a month MSRTC workers and unions are protesting various demands. A Kruti Samiti of unions was formed to have a conversation with the state government. The main demand of merging the MSRTC into he state government was compromised and hence the srike. Private tourist bus associations have come forward to support the state government with 2,000 off their buses on the roads, operating from ST stands. “Around 1,250 workers have joined work in Pune division and most of them are from workshop and administrative departments. Pf the 11 depots in Pune division, the ST bus operations from Daund, Indapur, Baramati and Bhor have started to some extent and from Swargate and Wakdewadi ST stands contractor-operated buses are running. Until now, we have suspended 488 workers of which 66 workers rejoined. The number is less to start bus operations in Pune division,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Ramakant Gaikwad.

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Reminiscing unforgettable moments of nature’s bounty||The other day, I was passing by my native place, Ropar, while travelling to Amritsar on official duty. Overwhelmed by nostalgia to catch a glimpse of the outskirts of the nondescript town, I asked my driver to head straight instead of turning left to the bypass that touches Aasron, circumventing the town. I migrated to Chandigarh in 1985 with my wife as we had joined government service. Thereafter, we settled down in Mohali after constructing a house and my connection with our family roots drifted into oblivion. Our ancestral house was merely a documentary proof of domicile. The house, once our permanent residence, was built by my grandfather after the family was uprooted from Rawalpindi during the turmoil of the Partition in 1947. After the death of my grandparents in the late ’80s, visiting our native town, being my birthplace also, became a distant dream. Our grandparent’s house, which still holds their legacy of values, started crumbling with every passing day as most of the time it remained shut. A few years ago, I convinced my father to get it repaired as it beholds the saga of our forefathers’ harrowing ordeal in the post-Partition era. Finally, I got it refurbished with basic amenities to make it livable, after realising its monumental value to act as a link between the past and the present progeny. Several childhood memories are still etched afresh on my mind about this historic town, being the first sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation. I am reminded of the good old days when we as kids played cricket on the mound amid ruins in Ropar, one of the Harappan sites. Today, it is in sheer neglect as cow dung cake pathis stuck on the walls is a common sight. The wetland hosts a vibrant natural habitat, particularly at the Ropar headworks on the Sutlej river, where thousands of migratory birds flock together from Central Asia as the winter chill sets in. Unmindful of the stress during student life, we were a group of four friends, Ravi, Bali, Kirpal and me. We would take refuge on the banks of the Sutlej to study for the exams. Being in the lap of nature was an exhilarating yet tranquilising experience in itself for us. It helped us tide over the examination jitters. Going down memory lane, I recall how a stroll early in the morning or late in the evening in summer and winter along the Sirhind Canal was a popular pastime of local residents of all ages. A cursory look at the precincts of the local government college still reminds me of the time spent there while pursuing graduation in arts in the company of my class fellows, including the late Punjabi folk singer Surjit Bindrakhia, who often offered us tea and samosas in the college canteen to seek our audience for his favourite Punjabi hit songs in typical long Hek, which would leave us spellbound. Unfortunately, most of my friends and acquaintances have already left this place with the passage of time to pursue their goals and careers. A few went abroad in search of greener pastures. The handful left here are not accessible for want of their whereabouts despite digital platforms, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in vogue nowadays. Alas! Not much has changed since I left this blissful town almost four decades ago except its panoramic beauty with diverse fauna and flora along the Sutlej river that still bewitches one and all. In the heart of hearts, I still yearn to visit this place blessed with nature’s bounty, far from the madding crowd and indeed a panacea for all ills. opinder.lamba@gmail.com The writer is the additional director, information and public relations, Punjab||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/reminiscing-unforgettable-moments-of-nature-s-bounty-101639403648815.html
13-12-2021||Pune||Covid: Pune ZP sets up 2nd-dose drive to reach pending rural beneficiaries||PUNE After deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar warned against deliberately delaying the second dose of the anti-Covid vaccine, the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has devised a plan to trace eligible citizens due for a second dose, but wwho haven’t taken it yet. Officials are planning to adopt personal communication, home visits and awareness campaigns by local public representatives to encourage eligible citizens to take the second dose. Four tehsils - Baramati, Daund, Indapur, and Bhor have administered second doses to less than 50% of the eligible population. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that if people don’t cooperate and take the second dose then a “strict decision” will be taken. “In rural parts 400,000-500,000 are due for second dose. As per our observation, 90% of people get the second dose within 84-91 days from the first. Also, we had conducted special vaccination drives through CSR between August 15 and September 15. The supply of government vaccination had also improved. So naturally, now the number of people due for the second dose is higher,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO Pune ZP. Now, ZP is going to focus on those who haven’t got a second dose post 91 days of the first dose. Explaining the five step-plan the ZP CEO said: “The list of beneficiaries will be drawn from CoWin. They will be contacted on phone. If they are not reachable then ASHA workers will be sent to their homes. Community Health Officers will also be sent for visits and awareness will be created through local public representatives such as sarpanches. Media is also playing a crucial role as coverage related to the Omicron variant is widely given publicity.” A total of 76% of the eligible population in Pune Municipal Corporation limits has received the second dose; 66% of the eligible population in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits has received the second dose; and 59% of the eligible population in the rural parts has got the second dose. Earlier, while speaking after the weekly Covid review meeting last Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had expressed disappointment over laxity among citizens in taking the second dose of the Covid vaccine. He had warned if people don’t cooperate in a week then strict decisions would be taken against those deliberately delaying the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-pune-zp-sets-up-2nd-dose-drive-to-reach-pending-rural-beneficiaries-101639403469976.html

Rai said the Delhi government will be continuing the ban on entry of diesel and petrol trucks into Delhi until further directions are issued, however, it will be holding a review meeting for the ban on construction activities on December 16 to hear pleas from agencies for possible exemptions to be given before submitting a list to CAQM. “Delhi’s air quality has started to improve and the situation is not as severe as it was post-Diwali. Delhi’s air quality levels between December 1 and December 12 have been hovering between 250 and 300 and therefore, a review meeting with all the departments was held today (Monday) to analyse the possible measures that can be taken around the restrictions imposed to curb air pollution,” said Rai, while addressing a press conference on Monday.The minister said a proposal was sent by the education department, which will be sent to CAQM through Delhi’s environment department. The Commission is expected to hold a review meeting later this week to decide when and how to lift the existing curbs on air pollution that have been imposed across NCR, including the closure of schools and colleges, ban on construction activities and the closure of some thermal power plants, among other restrictions.On Friday, the Supreme Court directed the CAQM to decide on relaxing the restrictions imposed within a week time, noting that air quality had ‘started improving’ in the region. A CAQM official, however, said they too were listening to applications for possible exemptions to be given to various industries, with a meeting to decide relaxation to be taken later in the week. “All such applications will be analysed and the Supreme Court has given us a week’s time to look at the best way to reopen. A decision will be taken accordingly,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. For construction activities, Rai said the government met several construction agencies on Monday as well, however, the decision to exempt them will also lie with the Commission. “We have asked these agencies to write to CAQM, but we will also be holding a detailed review on December 16 at 12 pm, where agencies can submit reasons for a possible exemption to resume construction work. We will then be sharing this with CAQM,” Rai added.The minister said other campaigns to control pollution locally will continue in Delhi, with 6,953 inspections carried out so far as part of the anti-dust campaign. Out of these, 597 locations were issued a notice, with fines of ₹1.65 crore imposed so far. “As part of the open-burning campaign too, we have inspected 16,580 sites so far, with 2,490 notices and a total fine of ₹46.96 lakh issued so far,” the minister said, adding that agencies in Delhi will also continue to sprinkle water on roads.Rai said as part of the Green Delhi app, 6,975 complaints had been received so far by the Delhi government since its launch on October 5, with 5,686 (81 percent) resolved. “Our campaign against polluting cars has meant 19.5 lakh cars have been inspected this winter season and around 49,000 cars have also been fined for not having a valid PUC certificate,” he added....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-suggests-reopening-schools-colleges-101639398969499.html
13-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra readies policy to compensate fishers affected by development projects||Mumbai: The state government has prepared a draft policy for compensation of fisherfolk affected by development projects with six broad recommendations including directing project proponents (state or private organisations in charge of a project) to pay 2% of their total project cost toward compensation to fishers affected by the project.This comes in response to a petition filed in the Bombay high court (HC) by the Mariaayi Machhimaar Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit – a registered fishworkers cooperative based in Vashi – on behalf of the fishing community from Vashi, Juhu, Koparkhairane, Ghansoli and Diva villages. The petitioner had claimed compensation for the fishermen, contending that they were inhabitants of the Thane creek area and their customary right to fish in the creek was adversely affected by the construction of the third Thane Creek bridge (TCB-3), a proposed six-lane bridge on the Sion-Panvel highway which will connect Mumbai with the mainland at Navi Mumbai. The policy document prepared by a committee under the department of fisheries includes providing “unique smart identification cards” renewable every three years (in addition to the already existing IDs provided by the fisheries department) and creating a fresh database of subsistence fishers in the state. Hindustan Times has seen a copy of the draft policy.“The state has a database of commercial fishers to some extent and traditional fishers to certain extent, however there is complete lack of data on subsistence fishers who are poor and unorganised fishers who need more care due to their fragility,” the document stated and recommended that all the proponents of infrastructure projects deposit a sum equal to 2% of the total project cost with the fisheries department for rehabilitation of fisherfolk. Details around this proposed regulation are presently unclear and “will be decided later”, the draft policy stated.A division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav of the Bombay HC on August 12 directed the Maharashtra government to frame a general policy for compensation “not only for fishermen, but for compensating any community whose customary rights to carry out an activity for their livelihood is impacted by government infrastructure projects.”Subsequently, on October 11 the state constituted a 23-member committee to look into the matter. In the preface of the policy document, dated November 29, the committee wrote, “There are a lot of projects going on in Maharashtra state being implemented by the government or other agencies like MMRDA, MSRDC, MCGM, CIDCO, MMRC, JNPT, NHAI, Railways, MMB, ONGC etc… All these projects demand to mitigate the risk of affecting fishing activities, therefore affecting the livelihood of the fishers.”The draft policy also recommended including a fresh census of shipping vessels, mandatory prior social and technical impact assessment exercises before commencement of development projects, setting up a standard operation procedure (SOP) to mitigate its impact and setting up grievance redressal committees (at the regional, district and state level) for fishers, and mandatory baseline surveys on quality and quantity of fishing catch in a project affected area prior to construction work.Fisherfolk said that stressing on a provision of compensation instead of safeguarding their intergenerational right to carry out a traditional livelihood is disappointing. Devendra Tandel, president of the Akhil Maharashtra Machhimaar Kruti Samiti (AMMKS), said such a move would not adequately address the community’s concerns.“This policy is not acceptable to us, because it does not consult us. There is not even a single member of the fishing community who has been taken into the deliberations, let alone members who represent a good cross section of the community. There are also several aspects of this policy which are contrary to what it sets out to do. For example, social impact studies have been mandated by the project proponents themselves, which is a huge conflict of interest. Second, the method to calculate compensation for project affected fisherfolk assumes that only one member of each family earns an income, which is not true,” Tandel said.“In Palghar district’s Kopran and Akkarpatti villages, fishers have been displaced by the Tarapur power station and in Raigad’s Uran, people have been displaced by the JNPT port. Whole generations have been kept from practicing their traditional livelihoods, on the backs of promises of modernity and better living which were never received. If the committee is unwilling to learn from the state’s past mistakes, where does that leave us?” Tandel asked.A senior officer in the fisheries department seeking anonymity, however, said, “The High Court will decide whether or not the draft policy is suitable. Besides, this is only a draft and will be further revised based on Cabinet discussions. The draft policy has not yet been cleared by the state government. As far as consulting the community goes, we have invited, received and considered all the comments we have received from fishing societies and fisherfolk.”The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation began constructing the new TCB-3 in December 2020, with a deadline of three years. It will help ease traffic volume on the existing TCB-2, built in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-readies-policy-to-compensate-fishers-affected-by-development-projects-101639397289048.html

One of the suspects was arrested later, police said, adding that the suspects also fired in the air in order to flee from the spot. According to police, one of the suspects was caught by the people present on the spot while he was trying to flee after firing two rounds of gunshots. The suspect was identified as Ashok Kumar, a resident of Hasanpur village in Bilaspur.The egg seller, Pawan Kumar, a resident of Pathredi, said that on Saturday around 7pm, two men attacked him for demanding money for four eggs. “I just asked the two men to pay for the eggs they ate, following which they started arguing with me and threatening me for life.

13-12-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Another examination but with the same script||PUNE The original script is the same with a bit of tweaking. Government plans to fill up various posts in Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA). More than 2.75 lakh candidates aspire to appear for the exam originally scheduled on December 12, 15, 19 and 20 for the jobs under class A, B and C.The state government outsource work to a private firm. However, an individual for the same firm along with two others is found to be involved in the paper leak. This forces government – at the last moment – to defer the examination.For the past two years, this story is being repeated with changes only in the jobs and the department they come under. Instead of winning praise to initiate massive exercises to fill up a large number of posts, the government has come under fire from aspirants for the mess it has created. But the lessons seem to have not been learnt.In the latest case, the examination was to be held all over Maharashtra and the private firm GA Software Technologies Private Limited was assigned the work of conducting the test by organising logistical support.Hours before the candidates were to reach the exam centre, it was cancelled after police suspected that the paper had been leaked.The director of GA Software Technologies Pritesh Deshmukh and two agents Santosh Harkle and Ankush Harkle had come to Vishrantwadi in Pune last night to deliver exam papers. Police caught them red-handed, according to Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta.Outsourcing the work related to conducting exams to private agencies isn’t uncommon at the government level. The main aim of any government is to hold such exercises smoothly, maintain integrity, and ensure fair evaluation without any interference. However, neither of these is being achieved.In an earlier case, the state government had to reschedule the health department examination at the eleventh hour as the private company assigned with conducting the job expressed it was not fully prepared. When the exam was rearranged, many aspirants faced issues that threatened to bar them from appearing for it.When the exam was finally conducted, it turned out that the question paper was already leaked with senior officials of the health department suspected to be involved. The police arrested 14 persons including the joint director, National Health Mission, and Latur health department’s chief admin officer.The government in both cases have faced an embarrassing situation. But more importantly, the entire process in both instances, have caused immense mental trauma to aspirants who have been preparing for these posts. Such instances have only diminished their hope in the entire process when jobs are shrinking in the government sector and unemployment is increasing.The interesting part is youth wings or of various political parties’ students, outfits have been silent on the issue. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in opposition has accused the government of mismanagement while holding the exam. However, its youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha or Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) are missing on the ground even if the issue is of concern to hundreds of thousands of youngsters from Maharashtra. At a time when these youth wing workers of political parties hold marches for various non-issues, their silence is conspicuous. It also indicates their ground-level connection is weak.Yogesh Joshi can be contacted at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com

Police was lucky to find Poonam Pal’s purse a few meters away from the lodge and recover a prescription from it. “The prescription was issued from a clinic in Goregaon, where the girl’s parents stay. With the help of the CCTV footage which had captured the couple’s masked faces and the prescription, the girl was finally identified and later our team nabbed her husband from their Khanda Colony house,” Dudhe added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-man-who-beheaded-wife-nabbed-101639394408049.html
13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Time to scrap land ceiling laws in Punjab?||The Charanjit Singh Channi government’s latest decision of seeking information from deputy commissioners regarding landowners having more than the permissible area under the land ceiling laws in Punjab has stirred up a new controversy. Though the contentious circular was withdrawn the very next day, it has brought into focus the content and administration of the surplus area laws that were once regarded a vanguard of socio-economic justice in the state. Land reforms after Partition In pre-Partition Punjab, big and absentee landlords were common. Partition, accompanied by an unprecedented influx of displaced persons, led to land reform laws in the erstwhile states of East Punjab and Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). These included the abolition of superior landowner titles, vesting of proprietary rights with occupancy tenants and consolidation of holdings. This was followed by far-reaching tenancy reforms and both the states enacted laws that, apart from providing security of land tenure as to the tenants-at-will, also had significant provisions dedicated to imposing a ceiling on landholdings. This process was continued and made more stringent with the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972, with Indira Gandhi winning the general election in 1971, the liberation of Bangladesh, when Giani Zail Singh became the chief minister. New Surplus Area Law of 1973 The new law came into force retrospectively with effect from January 24, 1971, and placed a ceiling of 18 standard acres of first quality land in the hands of, not just the individual, but rather the family as a unit. No doubt, some small additional fractions of land were allowed to accommodate the adult sons, as on the appointed date but the overall land ceiling, even for unirrigated or semi-irrigated land was 25 acres. There were barely any exceptions such as garden colonies and compact orchards, which had been grossly misutilised under the old laws. The determination of the surplus area was left to the revenue officers at the level of collector, with appeal to the commissioner and revision petition to the financial commissioner. Thereafter, the aggrieved party, whether the land owner or the state, could invoke the jurisdiction of the high court or the Supreme Court. The law, being a major of agrarian land reform, was placed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, so that it could not be struck down as being in conflict with the fundamental rights. Its constitutional validity was upheld conclusively. Lacunae in the law A number of surplus area cases were initiated. However, the actual surplus area that was finally utilised was exceedingly limited. This was on account of the following lacunae in the Act. 1. According to Section 8 of the Act, the surplus area vested in the state only when the collector took over possession. Normally, in the appeal or revisional stage, stay orders were granted and given the normal time-frame for a final judicial adjudication right up to the apex court, the big landowners would have perhaps died and thus the surplus area read determined, as on the date of death, afresh in the hands of the legal hairs. Owing to division of land, usually no surplus area would remain. 2. The Act (section 7(4)) merely stated that transactions such as sale, gift decrees that operated to reduce the land in the hands of the big landowner were to be ignored in the determination of the surplus area. It did not explicitly state that these were null and void ab initio. Thus, alienation by sale etc. to third parties continued and they subsequently not only sought benefit as bonafide vendees but also became parties to the litigation. This also led to litigation inter se big landowners and the transferees and legal disputes arose as to which particular parcel of land should be declared surplus. 3. The Act and the statutory scheme framed under it provided that before the surplus land was redistributed to landless persons belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) landless residing in the village, the rights of the sitting tenant had to be determined. Many big landowners set up collusive tenants and when the area was finally declared surplus, it ended up being allotted to their own, collusive tenant, thereby defeating the purpose of the entire proceedings. 4. In rare cases, where the land was allotted to landless SC persons, the Act provided that they could not alienate for 15 years, after the issuance of the conveyance deed. Usually, no such entry regarding bar on alienation was made in the revenue record, as a result of which most of these people ended up prematurely selling the allotted land, often to the nominees of the original landowner, at throwaway prices. Impediment to development? Decades later, when promoters began to assemble/purchase huge parcels of land for urban development or institutional purposes such as integrated townships and private universities, this ceiling law posed a major hindrance. Some of them incorporated separate legal entities to circumvent the provisions. The instructions regarding change of land use (CLU) provided that ownership had to vest in the applicant, before the application could be allowed, thus creating a Catch-22 situation. In December 2017, this Act was retrospectively amended to provide for an exemption where land in excess of the permissible area had been or was to be accumulated by a single legal entity, for purposes other than agricultural, such as industrial, institutional or commercial. An easy self-certification and intimation to the collector process was provided. Thus, for all intents and purposes, agricultural land that was sought to be converted to non-agricultural use came out of the purview of the ceiling law. Utilisation of surplus area The utilisation of the surplus area, if any, finally declared is expected to be effected in accordance with the Punjab Utilisation of Surplus Area Scheme, 1973. This provides for the allotment of the land declared to be surplus to the sitting tenants (as on the appointed date) and thereafter to persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and being residents of the village. The condition is that they should not own more than two hectares and their overall holding, after allotment, should not exceed two hectares. In many cases, the surplus land, though agricultural in nature in narrow legal terms, is situated in the periphery of major cities, including Chandigarh and in case of Haryana, which has a similar law/scheme in the NCR. The Punjab scheme does not permit utilisation of this land for any public purpose by the state government. It is felt that this scheme should be amended to permit this, otherwise, ultra-valuable land shall be frittered away to allottees, who will still technically claim to be marginal farmers. New Land Leasing Bill In 2018-19, the Punjab Government was toying with the idea of bringing about the Punjab Land Leasing Bill, 2018. Inter alia, it provided that companies taking huge chunks of land on 30-year lease from small farmers would not be hit by the provisions of the ceiling laws. Otherwise, even a tenant cannot hold more than the permissible area under the extant provisions of the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972. Owing to Covid restrictions and subsequently the farmers’ agitation, this Bill did not see the light of the day, though it is still alive on the Punjab Government website. Big landowners who have managed separate units for their sons and adult grandsons are using devious devices such as registered/unregistered wills from grandparents to other nominees outside the immediate family. Thus, in spite of all safeguards, you have kinnow orchards held by influential families, running into hundreds of acres. Time to give it a decent burialIt does not seem politically correct for any political party to state that the land ceiling law needs to be scrapped. However, I feel it is merely a fig-leaf and it can potentially become an instrument of harassment in the hands of entrepreneurs who want to buy land in Punjab for bonafide non-agricultural purposes. It also does not deter people with deep pockets from incorporating different private limited companies and setting up units, owning agricultural land. The surplus area proceedings of agro-forestry firms that had bought huge tracts of land using public deposits are still locked up in litigation. Without prejudice to the pending proceedings, I think time has come for us to give this law a decent burial so that at least prospectively larger holdings can be created for efficient use of scarce agricultural land in Punjab. kbs.sidhu@gmail.com The writer is a retired Punjab IAS officer.

First, we didn’t get special permissions to seat 45 people in the venue which can seat more. Secondly, threats have been made to shut down the venue if I were to ever perform there.

The ABVP members were protesting the cancellation of Maharashtra’s Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) recruitment examinations which were scheduled for December 12. The clashes were brought under control after the police intervened and detained the protesters. The protest started around 11 in the morning when the ABVP protesters gathered outside the minister’s bungalow near the Eastern Express Highway in Thane and shouted slogans against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. They refused to leave the area despite repeated warnings by the police. The NCP party workers reached the venue and there were clashes between the two parties. The police removed 100s of protesters from the venue and got the situation under control. An officer from Vartak Nagar Police station in Thane said, “We have mobilized a large force at the spot and the situation is under control. We will release a statement on the number of protesters detained later in the day.” The ABVP alleged that the NCP workers tried to resort to violence in their silent protest while the police merely stood as mute spectators. Shankar Sankpal, office bearer of the ABVP said, “The MVA government has set a pattern, first the papers are leaked and then examinations are cancelled, the future of youngsters is in dark due to this repeated cancellation of various examinations. We tried to protest silently, however, NCP thugs came and got aggressive. The police did not take any action against them and instead arrested our own people.” Minister Jitendra Awhad, added, “I was trying to be fair with all the students, as the paper was leaked I was the one to take initiative to inquire in the leak issue and took a fair decision for all of them. The MHADA will now take its own exam instead of involving private institutions. There are messages circulated on social media platforms about the protest against me, my followers and NCP workers obviously will be there to stop such acts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/clashes-between-abvp-ncp-outside-minister-s-bungalow-in-thane-101639391768542.html

Nationalisation has stymied the growth of several sectors. Look at IT sector, it is successful in India because the government has no role to play. If I take list of unicorns, almost none of them have taken the government's support to become unicorns," he added."Wherever the government got involved and we saw the nationalisation of so many different businesses and sectors in the past years has stymied the growth of those sectors," he emphasised.The Union Minister further said, "If we allow entrepreneurs to flourish, with the least amount of government interference, they can scale in their operation and come up with affordable and cost-effective solutions. They will improve their design and quality. If we really want this ecosystem to survive then we have to let it work its own.""If I make a list of unicorns, almost none of them have taken government support to become unicorns," he added.He also said that 46 per cent of start-ups registered with DPIIT have women as part of the ecosystem. He hoped that women will lead the Start-up culture in Maharashtra.He further said, today we have a startup ecosystem across the length and breadth of India. "More than 50000 start-ups have been registered in India. It is the third-largest ecosystem in the world."Informing that as per DPIIT registrations, Pune has 3200 Start-ups whereas Mumbai 3274 Start-ups, Minister suggested that this healthy competition between Pune and Mumbai should continue.Recalling the contribution of social reformer and educationist Savitribal Phule, he said that Savitribai had started the first girls school in Pune, so it is befitting that women entrepreneurs showcase their work in this Science Technology Park in Pune.Comparing incubators with parents, the minister added that they are like guides and supporters that start-ups need. Describing Pune's unique position to support start-ups due to the presence of industry, IT and finest academic institutions, Goyal added that it is time to increase international collaboration in start-up ecosystem.He expressed the need for collaboration of Academia, industry and research for the thriving of Startups.He concluded that India may have a billion problems but it also has brilliant billion entrepreneurs to solve these problems with extremely cost-effective solutions for farmers, Divyang and the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chances-of-start-up-ecosystem-getting-successful-higher-with-less-govt-interference-says-piyush-goyal-101639390726930.html

13-12-2021||Mumbai||Instagram row: No action against Kangana Ranaut for the time being||In a relief for Kangana Ranaut, the Maharashtra government on Monday assured the Bombay high court that it will not take any coercive action against the actor in connection with an FIR registered against her at Khar police station for allegedly hurting the sentiments of the Sikh community.The state government gave the assurance after Ranaut agreed to show up at Khar police station on December 22 to record her statement with regard to an Instagram post she had made in connection with the farmers’ protest.The FIR was registered on November 23 at the behest of Mulund resident Amarjeetsingh Sandhu, 47, along with the leaders of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). They had alleged that an Instagram post by the Bollywood actor on November 21 hurt the religious feelings and beliefs of Sikhs.On the basis of the complaint, Khar police booked Ranaut under section 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which pertains to deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class of people by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.Ranaut has moved the high court, seeking that the FIR be quashed. On Friday, her lawyer argued before the division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal that like every other Indian citizen, Ranaut has fundamental freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution to express her views freely, and since no case was made out against her, the FIR should be quashed.

13-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The man with many stories||Each person is an anthology of stories. So is S. Kumar. “My life is full of unfortunate incidents,” he says in fluent English, in these very words.In his early 30s, Mr Kumar, a History (Hons.) graduate, describes himself as a kabadiwalla. In fact, this afternoon he is walking by the Gurugram roadside, carrying a huge white sack on his shoulders filled with empty water bottles, discarded chips packets and other pavement detritus. Stopping by a pile of bricks, Mr Kumar gives a sense of his previous life. These are his own words, with some identifying details omitted at his request—“I was born and brought up in Delhi only. I used to live in —Nagar. I worked as a medical record keeper in — Hospital. Life was satisfying. I also got married. I have a son. We all lived happily with my parents. And then I started to drink. It became a habit. I quit my job. My family had to give up on me. It wasn’t their fault.”Circumstances propelled him to move to neighbouring Gurugram where “I found work as a kabadiwalla… this helps me earn some amount of money for basic expenses, and I get to sleep in the warehouse of the recycler, near Atul Kataria Chowk, to whom I give my day’s collection every evening.”Mr Kumar seems sober as he discusses the hurts he has caused to the people who love him “and probably still care for me.” Can’t he make a new start, and contact them. He smiles sarcastically. “I haven’t taken a shower since a week…”Mr Kumar resumes walking. “I’ll now leave my bag at some stall and go for the afternoon show at Raj,” he says, referring to a single-screen cinema, nearby.Few minutes later, after paying 30 rupees for a ticket, he is ensconced inside the theatre, on his favroite seat—he’s a regular. The movie is still to begin. Mr Kumar starts talking loudly, his voice echoing in the empty hall—“I really want someone to write a book on me. Because life is a story for me, and I have so many stories in my life. Not a single story is yet complete. They all are incomplete. So someone must write down those stories.” Next moment the movie begins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-man-with-many-stories-101639353231085.html

13-12-2021||Delhi||Tale of wilted fines: Space tough to come by for saplings in Maafi Bagh||The sight of thousands of fresh saplings greets visitors to Delhi’s Central Ridge – a notified forest area adjacent to Sardar Patel Marg – thanks to court orders to assorted offenders to help the forests and wildlife department plant trees using fine amounts imposed on them.The cluster that houses several native plant varieties has come to be commonly known as Maafi Bagh – garden of forgiveness – as part of the forestation has been undertaken as court-ordained penance by those falling foul of the law. But, a spot check reveals operational constraints have overshadowed the novel garden. Congested plantation has led to saplings wilting away for lack of sunlight, left stunted with no space to grow.In March 2019, justice Najmi Waziri of the Delhi high court imposed a fine of ₹80 lakh on a pharmaceutical company for breach of court orders, ordering it to use the amount for the “larger public good” and create a green area of 140,000 saplings in the Central Ridge.Complying with the orders, the department of forests and wildlife said in its submission that it could plant just 3,500 saplings in the area, citing lack of space in the ridge’s rocky terrain. But, with the court warning of contempt proceedings, the department scaled up the number to over 15,000 saplings in that case, and also carried out compensatory plantation in nearly 50 more such matters since then. To be sure, since March 2019, over 45,000 saplings have been planted in the cluster.To compensate for the poor living conditions for the plants and lack of space, a similar area for compensatory plantation was created in Delhi’s Southern Ridge, called Insaaf Bagh (garden of justice).The new site has reignited hopes of a green revival as a close look at the saplings planted in the original Maafi Bagh showed that nearly half of those are in bad shape. Each tree has been meticulously numbered and tagged, but with the saplings growing too close to each other, there isn’t adequate sunlight, forest officials say.Officials working in the area say efforts are made to find spots where there are openings in a larger tree canopy, but with the invasive Vilayati Kikar variety covering large patches of the Central Ridge sunlight doesn’t percolate down.“These are two Kadamb trees, both planted at the same time. While one of them now stands at a height of nearly 12 feet, the other has barely touched 4 feet. The former receives plenty of sunlight but the latter is growing in a shaded area under a Vilayati Kikar and is finding it tough to spread out or grow,” explains a forest official watering a patch of 26,000 saplings planted as part of the Aparna Bhat vs Sakshi Singh case in the Delhi high court.To create room for fresh saplings to be planted in each new case, the ground vegetation is the first to be cleared, before pits are dug at gaps of four to 10 feet to accommodate them. Another forest official, who does not want to be named, says the mortality rate is around 20%, largely due to plants not receiving enough nutrients and sunlight despite earnest efforts.“We are watering each patch using borewells and STP (sewage treatment plant) water. Plenty of manure is provided to the plants, but some are simply unable to grow,” says the official, adding that it is difficult to prune the Kikars to allow passage of sunlight as the area is a notified forest.“The rules for a notified forest are more stringent and permissions are required under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Therefore, we have not carried out any pruning.”Navneet Srivastava, deputy conservator of forests (west), says efforts are being made to comply with all court orders, with different soil and moisture conservation techniques put into use.“We have created check dams in the area, where saplings are being grown. A water body has also been revived. We are trying our best to comply with all court orders, which have resulted in a lot of good work done in the Central Ridge,” he said.However, experts believe not only is the lack of ground vegetation damaging to the overall ecology of the forest, but not all trees are likely to survive the plantation process.Environmentalist Pradip Krishen, author of Trees of Delhi, says only a few species will be able to grow on their own once irrigation is withdrawn, stressing the need to have adequate spacing between saplings and ground-level flora.“A lot of saplings are unable to grow properly as they are growing close to each other. Other species will dry out as soon as they stop receiving water as the Ridge’s rocky, thin top-soil ecology only supports a fixed number of species. While it is good to plant more saplings, it needs to be done with adequate spacing and without removing the ground vegetation,” he says.Vijay Dhasmana, ecologist and a curator at the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram, says species such as Bargad, Peepul, Neem or Pilkhan cannot grow if they are planted at a distance of five to six feet.“The exercise may not yield any ecological benefits if they are being planted too close or are not receiving enough sunlight. Most trees will not survive and if one has to be bring about restorative change, then the Vilayati Kikars need to be removed systematically alongside the plantation being done,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tale-of-wilted-fines-space-tough-to-come-by-for-saplings-in-maafi-bagh-101639347605636.html

Her husband died a few years ago, and she lived alone. She is survived by two daughters, one of whom lives in south Delhi, while the other lives in Switzerland.DCP Chauhan said on Saturday afternoon, one of Singhal’s daughters was not able to get in touch with her over the phone, and contacted Singhal’s neighbour. The police did not reveal which daughter made the call.Around 2.10pm, the neighbour went to Singhal’s house and saw that the main door was ajar.

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||50 years of 1971 Indo-Pak war: When the Army evacuated an injured Pak Havildar||Around 5pm on December 5, 1971, just as the sun was setting, Colonel Kuldev Nand, then Captain and part of the 23 Mountain Artillery Brigade, received orders to cross the India-Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) border.His unit, 197 Mountain Regiment, which was to support the 301 Mountain Brigade, immediately started advancing towards Mudafarganj, more than 100 kilometres from Dhaka. Around 9am the next day, they reached Mudafarganj and were greeted by enemy fire. “Luckily, the bullets were at a higher level than the ground, so the fire was ineffective. I was told the fire upon the enemy forces and with the support of a company led by Major Narpat Singh Shekhawat, we killed eight Pak soldiers and captured two. Our company commander’s operator got hit in the arm,” recalls the veteran.But amid death and destruction, acts of kindness and compassion don’t aren’t rare. Col Nand recalls how the Army helped evacuate a Pak havildar who was found critically injured in a wheat field. “He was injured during mopping-up operations. When we found him, he was in severe pain and was pleading to be shot dead. He would have succumbed to his injuries, but in no time, a chopper of the GOC 23 Mountain Division evacuated him,” recalls Col Nand. “Later we came to know that the havildar was among those repatriated. This is the Indian Army for you,” he says proudly. After capturing Mudafarganj, the company moved towards Hajiganj. On reaching there, the Army occupied a school building for night halt. Around 8pm, the enemy forces open fire on them but the Company retaliated in equal measure. By the time, the Company reached Chandpur the next morning, over 10,000 Pak soldiers had surrendered. The Colonel also recalls a close shave when he managed to save another Officiating Company Commander’s life. “When we were on the western side of Lakhiya River, we faced heavy mortar shelling from the rival camp. As an artillery soldier, I immediately sensed an enemy mortar that had been dropped metres away from us. I managed to pull Captain Patnaik out of the way before the mortar went off,” recalls the veteran.Just as the soldiers were crossing Lakhiya river on December 16, they received a radio message that a ceasefire had been declared and Pak forces had surrendered in front of the Indian Army.“But we did not rest till we captured the Adamji Mills in Narayanganj, one of the largest jute mills operated by a rich Pakistani industrialist Adamji. Dhaka had been captured by then but the enemy forces were refusing to give up. They surrendered only after the first raging round landed on the mills,” Col Nand recalls.The colonel has also written a chapter “Liberation of Bangladesh” in a book “In Quest of Freedom – The war of 1971” that shares personal accounts of soldiers from India and Bangladesh. A compilation of first-hand accounts, the book is edited by a celebrated soldier, Major General Ian Cardozo.Col Nand retired in 1997 from Headquarter 2 Core Artillery Brigade in Ambala Cantt. He now lives with his wife in Defence Colony and plays golf with his friends in free time. His son and daughter are settled abroad.

This, even as the daily Covid tally has been consistently rising in the tricity. The campaigning for Chandigarh municipal corporation elections will end on December 21, and thereafter 72 hours have been designated as “silence period” by the state election commission (SEC) till the voting ends on December 24. In view of the pandemic, the SEC, in addition to the standard model code of conduct for elections, also issued separate Covid guidelines on November 26.Most of the violations are taking place when candidates go for door-to-door campaigning. While the guidelines state that not more than five people can go for door-to-door campaigning, in some cases, it is seen that there is a sizeable crowd tagging along with candidates.Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said, “All candidates, not only from Congress but other parties too, generally start with only five people. But as they move along the constituency, their supporters start joining them. It becomes very difficult for them to stop these supporters.”In public meetings too, crowds are being gathered in excess of the permissible limits. In the public meetings, Covid norms, including social distancing and use of masks, sanitisers, thermal scanners, face shields, hand gloves, etc, are not being followed.In case, a candidate or a political party violates any of the guidelines, no more permission will be given to the candidate/party concerned for rallies, meetings etc. “If any star campaigner violates Covid protocols, he/she shall not be allowed to campaign further in that constituency/ district,” stipulates the SEC guidelines.District magistrate Vinay Pratap Singh, said, “This has come to my notice too. We will issue fresh instructions to the political parties on Monday. Returning officers (ROs) have also been instructed to strictly enforce these guidelines. A review meeting will be held on December 15.”After the review, the administration will decide if any new directions and measures should be taken in this regard.“In the light of advisory issued by the health ministry of Gol, SEC will keep a close watch on the evolving situation and may further tighten the guidelines for the upcoming elections,” said a SEC spokesperson.

The farm labourers were protesting against the Punjab government over their demands for complete waiver of outstanding electricity bills and allotment of five marla plots to the needy. They stated that their meeting last month with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had remained inconclusive. Trains that got stuck in Ludhiana were Shane Punjab train, Sarbat Da Bhala train, Lal Kuan express and Dadar express. Even though there were no cancellations, a total of 19 trains were affected in Ferozpur division. As many as 14 were delayed while five had to be rescheduled. The farmers also blocked railway tracks in Phillaur, Moga, Ajitwal, Jagraon, Beas and Manawala near Amritsar. However, as per officials, not many trains were affected. “Traffic from mainly Amritsar to Ludhiana and Ferozpur to Ajitwal-Jagroan rail lines were affected. Luckily, not many trains ply during the time chosen for the protest,” said a senior railway official. Meanwhile, passengers were left irate, stating that trains have become a soft target for the protestors in Punjab. “If they have issues with the state government, why do they halt trains which ferry passengers from other states as well. This has become an unfortunate trend here in Punjab which leads to the harassment for the public,” said Salil Bansal, a passenger. A few passengers were even forced to hire taxis and other public transport available to reach their destinations. “Such incidents need to be curbed, or else, there will a huge law-and-order situation in the country soon,” said another passenger, Anil Tyagi. Meanwhile, station director Tarun Kumar ordered the rail staff to continuously serve water in the stranded trains and clean the toilets repeatedly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-labourers-protest-passengers-stranded-for-4-hours-as-railways-services-hit-101639342205749.html

However, many migrated students will now have to suffer ignominy of taking their first-term board exams at their former schools, the authorities of which are still loath to issue transfer certificates to these students, citing non clearance of dues.In marking an external exam centre to migrated students, the education department has acted against orders of Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) chairperson Yograj Sharma, who had issued an order last month saying that students enrolled in board classes of government, government-aided and PSEB-affiliated private schools in the state would now take final exams in their own schools.The PSEB order had read, “Students of Classes 8, 10 and 12 will have their board centres in their own respective schools like the students of Class 5.”The parents of migrated students, whose centres have been marked at their old schools, have approached the school authorities, seeking change of exam centre. A government senior secondary school teacher said, “Parents are worried that their children might face harassment at the exam centres, which have been marked as their previous schools, amid the ongoing tussle over non-issuance of transfer certificates and pending dues.” Around 200 students, who had migrated to government schools, have been denied transfer documents by their previous schools. Many students have moved court over the matter so much so that the district education department has formed a special committee to deal with such complaints.The students, who were unable to furnish a transfer certificate, were admitted to government schools after an order was released by the former education secretary (schools) on August 7, 2020, saying that in case a private school refuses to issue a transfer certificate to a student, heads of the government schools can admit the pupil after self-verification.Later, another order was issued directing government schools to admit students only after receiving all documents from them, including the transfer certificate, leaving students admitted on the basis of the previous order in a lurch. The PSEB chairperson said that most schools are self-centres, but schools with less enrolment cannot be centres. “Since the exams for Classes 10 and 12 are to start from December 13, it is too late to change the centres. However, students of Class 8 can contact us and get their centres changed.”

The accused, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Lakhbir Singh, inspector Inderjit Singh, and assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) Tarsem Singh and Surinder Pal, allegedly misplaced a CD with a video of the graft-accused ASI, Harjit Singh, taking a bribe. An FIR was registered against the accused under Sections 166A (public servant disobeying directions under law) and 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture) of the Indian Penal Code, following a court order. In 2017, the additional session judge had ordered the commissioner of police to conduct an inquiry in the matter, after the court had to let the graft-accused ASI go scot-free as the video recording of the incident had been misplaced. The commissioner of police had marked an inquiry to joint commissioner of police (JCP, city) J Elanchezhian, and a case has been registered on the basis of the findings. Joint commissioner of police (JCP, headquarters) Dayama Harish Omparkash said that no departmental action had been initiated against the four cops so far, “but appropriate action will be taken.” What was the case? Assistant sub-inspector Harjit Singh, who was posted at the Meharban police station, was booked for graft on September 21, 2012 after an accused in a cheating case filmed the cop accepting ₹5,000 for dismissing the case against him. The complainant, Baldev Singh, had produced the video showing the ASI accepting graft to senior police officials, after which a case was registered against Harjit Singh and he was dismissed from the force. However, the ASI was later acquitted as the CD containing the video recording had been misplaced from the case file.During the case, Lakhbir Singh was deputed as the assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Sahnewal) and inspector Inderjit Singh was the Meharban station house officer. The two ASIs were also posted at Meharban, and were probing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/graft-case-dsp-among-four-cops-booked-for-misplacing-proof-in-ludhiana-101639341543972.html

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | ‘From water cannons to showers of petals, farmers’ movement has come a full circle’||“When we proceeded towards Delhi a year ago, we were welcomed with water cannons in the chilling winter, now we are being welcomed with rose petals wherever we go. What better ending to a non-violent protest!” exclaims Khanna-based farmer leader Rajinder Singh Benipal, who was among the farmers returning from the Singhu and Tikri borders where farmers had been demanding revocation of the three farm laws for a year. Benipal, who is affiliated with the Bharatiya Kisan Union, says, “The authorities had dug trenches on the highways to stop us. Many of my friends, who were in their 70s, were cane-charged. Some of them even died. However, in the end we emerged victorious.” Indeed, celebrations and festivities, followed the farmers as they returned home after laying a long a long siege on the borders of New Delhi. People were seen dancing to the dhol and distributing sweets to celebrate the farmers’homecoming. Sitting outside MBD Mall on Ferozepur Road where the farmers had pitched tents on the roadside as a temporary shelter, elderly farmers could be heard sharing tales of hardships and grit, audible even over the vigorous beats of the dhols.It was all worth it in the end, say farmers The end of a year-long struggle was a poignant moment for the farmers, and while they were happy to return home to their families, they were heartbroken over parting with their brothers-in-arms from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Gurpreet Singh of Dakha said, “It was an emotional moment for us. For nearly a year we were together. We had faced tough times, and also partied together. We suffered the vagaries of the weather, and also endured the barbs of those who branded us as terrorists, but in the end, it was all worth it. We do not know when he developed such a strong bond with each other,” said Gurpreet.Massive traffic jam at Ladhowal, PhillaurA huge traffic jam was seen at Ladhowal and Phillaur as different farmer unions, including one from Kadian group, who were returning from Delhi reached Jalandhar Bypass. Incidentally, road construction work was also underway at the NH-44, which compounded the problem. Serpentine queues of vehicles were seen on both sides of the road and anxious commuters were seen helplessly waiting in their vehicles.Finally, the Phillaur police led by station house officer Sanjiv Kapoor intervened and managed to streamline the traffic flow. “Farmers were scheduled to return from Delhi today, but at the same time road repair work was taking place on the NH-44 in Phillaur, which resulted in a traffic jam,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-from-water-canons-to-showers-of-petals-farmers-movement-has-come-a-full-circle-101639341004729.html
13-12-2021||Chandigarh||All eyes on ‘triumphant’ farmer unions ahead of Punjab polls||With the farmer unions emerging triumphant against the central government’s three contentious agriculture laws and their morale at an all-time high, it remains to be seen which political parties they will extend their support to in the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections. But interestingly, it will not be a single party as different unions have divergent political views even as they put up a united face during the year-long agitation against the farm laws. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) faction president Balbir Singh Rajewal, who emerged as a key leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), said on Sunday that their organisation will support a party in the polls. “We have supported different parties during the elections in the past. We will take a decision as whom to lend support once the polls are declared,” he said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is learnt to be in touch with Rajewal and has offered him a key position in the government if the party comes to power in the state. Rajewal, however, denied of such offer from the AAP which is also believed to have reached out to the leaders of other farmer unions. The Majha-based BKU (Qadian) is expected to go with the faction led by Rajewal who in the past has supported the Akalis and the Congress. On the other hand, BKU (Lakhowal) head Ajmer Singh Lakhowal is close to the Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal. He remained chairman of the state agricultural development board from 2007 to 2017 when the Akali Dal was in power. His son Harinder Lakhowal, who is general secretary of the organisation and also took active part in the farm agitation, said the SKM constituents can support any party of their choice. Jagjit Singh Dalewal-led BKU (Sidhupur), which has a stronghold in Bathinda district, is with the Lakhowal faction. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) head Joginder Singh Ugrahan has asked members of the faction to support political parties or candidates of their choice in the upcoming polls. The left-leaning organisation has the largest support base in the state, particularly in the Malwa belt. BKU (Dakounda), which claims itself to be politically neutral, is not supporting any party. Union general secretary Jagmohan Singh said attempts were being made to bring different farm bodies on a common platform and contest the polls as independent candidates. BKU (Haryana) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni has already been advocating for the farm bodies to take plunge in the polls in Punjab and has also toured the state to gather feedback on the ground. Channi to meet farm leaders on Dec 17 Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has invited representatives of farmer unions for a meeting on December 17. In the meeting, discussion is likely to be held on complete farm loan waiver. In a meeting with farmers a fortnight back, the CM had promised to come up with a proposal and later wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to jointly work out a formula for debt waiver.

Last year we had just 6,000 tourists in November,” he said.“Overall more than 5.49 lakh tourists came to Kashmir this year till December first week,” he said.Early snowfall in the Valley, particularly in Gulmarg, has also prompted more people to make way towards the ski resort with advance bookings in most of the hotels.“We are seeing a footfall of 4,000-5,000 every day this month. Up to December 6, we received 26,000 visitors,” he said.“Snow was a blessing in disguise. The December outlook is looking good. There is a full house at Gulmarg. There is hardly any hotel which is not booked,” Khan said.The month of October witnessed a record footfall of 91,000 – which is otherwise considered a lean month.On Saturday, on International Mountain Day- 2021, the tourism department released trekking maps of offbeat destinations and organised mountain biking and cycling events at Zabarwan, Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Naranag, Nowgam and other locations.“Kashmir valley is registering impressive tourist arrivals which have been the result of sustained efforts by the department in terms of sustained capacity-building of stakeholders, vaccination drives and promotions across markets in the country,” said adviser to lieutenant-governor, Farooq Khan during a tourism function held in Srinagar on Saturday.

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Namaz row: Khattar’s remarks clearly targeted one religion, says Omar Abdullah||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Sunday lambasted Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s remarks that offering namaz in public places cannot be tolerated. Abdullah claimed that the target was a single religion. “The statement of Haryana chief minister and his decision is absolutely wrong. In our country, it is allowed to follow one’s religion publicly. I would have accepted if this prohibition (on namaz in public places) would have been followed for every religion. This is being done on a pick-and-choose basis and it indicates that the target is a single religion,” Abdullah told reporters on the sidelines of a rally in Anantnag. Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said offering namaz in public places cannot be tolerated, even as the Gurugram administration withdrew permission for Friday prayers at 20 designated sites amid protests by members of Hindu outfits.The National Conference vice-president said that the country’s Constitution doesn’t allow this. “This is not that India with which J&K had acceded. J&K had acceded to a secular and tolerant India. The statement of the Haryana chief minister is highly condemnable, “ Omar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/namaz-row-khattar-s-remarks-clearly-targeted-one-religion-says-omar-abdullah-101639340227496.html

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Condition of govt schools in Punjab abysmal, distressing: Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday issued a video message, calling the state of government schools in Punjab “abysmal and distressing”. Kejriwal alleged that the future of over 24 lakh underprivileged and scheduled caste (SC) students was in the dark because the Punjab government did not want them to excel. “The teachers of Punjab are very good but they have been harassed to such an extent that they have lost all hope in the system,” he claimed. The Delhi CM said his government had completely revolutionised schools and changed the face of government education in the national capital. “Like Delhi, we will transform the education system and build world-class schools in Punjab,” he said in the message addressed to government school teachers and students from the poll-bound state. He also talked about the fragility of Punjab’s education system and the state government’s false claims regarding it and expressed deep concern for the future of the children. AAP MLAs Aman Arora and Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer also welcomed and accepted the debate challenge given by Punjab deputy CM and health minister OP Soni. In a statement, the two accused Soni of “trying to mislead people” by claiming that Punjab is ahead of Delhi in every aspect on health front. “In a hurry to compare Punjab and Delhi healthcare systems, the minister forgot that Punjab actually needs a healthcare system according to nationally set norms and WHO standards,” they said. The AAP MLAs said that according to national norms in rural Punjab, there should be 700 plus public health centres (PHCs), but there were only 416. Similarly, around 200 community health centres (CHCs) were required in rural areas according to the population, but the state had only 87, they added. Arora said that 80% of the CHCs were without any specialist. He also challenged Soni to name one CHC in rural area that was providing the “perfect services” according to the national norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/condition-of-govt-schools-in-punjab-abysmal-distressing-arvind-kejriwal-101639340164012.html

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Srinagar: Citing Covid concerns, authorities bar Mehbooba Mufti from holding youth convention||People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday accused the Jammu and Kashmir administration of sabotaging her youth convention at her residence in Srinagar in the name of Covid protocols and roughing up her workers. The police responded saying the local administration had advised the PDP to apply for holding this convention in a more open area in view of Covid-19 and security reasons.In a series of video messages on Twitter and then a press conference, Mehbooba said the administration remembers Covid-19 only when she decides to meet the youth of the Valley.“From the past one week, all the leaders and parties have been organising meetings and rallies in every corner of the Valley and when the PDP decided to do the same in my own home why were we stopped,” she said.“They are sabotaging (us). New ways are found to usurp the rights of youth here to take them away from democracy and push them towards violence,” she said.Later at a press conference, Mehbooba said they were preparing for the youth convention as all political parties were organising rallies in the Valley these days.“Congress, National Conference, Apni Party or People’s Conference –all are conducting meetings and we had also made a programme,” she said.She said they had written to the deputy commissioner for some space for organising the youth convention some time back. “But we got no response to that. Even Covid was not that much at that time,” she said.She said that when she decided to go for a youth convention the administration stopped her and sent her a communication citing Covid.“The youths were not only stopped but they were assaulted and roughed up. Their clothes were torn and their mobiles were snatched at places. A few were put in police stations,” she alleged. “Even today Omar Abdullah is holding a rally at Anantnag and two days ago, Apni Party had a joining programme,” she said.A police spokesman said in the convention a gathering of at least 1,000 people was expected.“Given the prevalent Covid situation and larger security implications resulting from allowing such a large number of people and accompanying cars and vehicles into a high-security zone, it was not advisable to allow such a large flow of people and unchecked vehicles,” the spokesman said.“There are credible inputs of vehicle-bound IEDs being used to target civilians and high-security installations. The Gupkar Road houses high-security buildings of various organisations and security-sensitive establishments and intelligence agencies.

In the ensuing encounter, the trapped terrorist was killed,” the spokesman said.Army spokesperson Lt Col Emron Musavi said a joint operation was launched early morning on Sunday based on the Jammu Kashmir Police inputs.“The area was cordoned and contact established. The firefight resulted in one terrorist being killed and warlike stores were recovered,” he said.The body retrieved from the site of the encounter was identified as Sameer Ahmad Tantray, a resident of Bargam Awantipora.The police spokesman claimed that the slain militant was a categorised terrorist linked with proscribed terror outfit JeM and was part of groups involved in several terror crime cases.“Before joining terror folds, he was working as a terrorist associate and involved in providing logistic support to the active terrorists in the area. He was also involved in pasting threatening posters of proscribed terror outfits in Awantipora and adjoining areas to threaten the law-abiding citizens and keep them away from democratic activities,” the spokesman said.The police have registered a case under relevant Sections of law and an investigation has been initiated.“People are requested to cooperate with police till the area at the encounter site is completely sanitised and cleared of all explosive materials, if any,” said the spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jaish-militant-killed-in-encounter-in-kashmir-s-pulwama-101639340046174.html
13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Inviting Haryana CM for campaigning has shown BJP’s anti-farmer mindset: Chandigarh Congress chief||The BJP has again shown its anti-farmers mindset by inviting Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal to campaign in the city ahead of the municipal corporation elections, Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said on Sunday“How can BJP ask the Haryana CM to campaign in the city, as it’s the same leader who ordered that the farmers’ stir be crushed with muscle power by advising party cadres to take tit-for-tat action, pick up lathis and not to worry about the bail,” Chawla said.The Chandigarh Congress also lashed out at the Saffron Party over its claims to have made the UT safe for women. “The BJP has run out of ideas and is in total confusion and utter distress, which is leading them to make baseless statements,” said Congress spokesperson Rajesh Sharma.BJP Mahila Morcha National president Vanathi Srinivasan had stated a day earlier that the city has become safe for women during the party’s six-year tenure.“However, as per the official data available with National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), the crime rate against women in Chandigarh has gone up in the recent years as 453 cases of crime against women were reported in 2017, 442 in 2018 and 515 in 2019. Even during the period of Covid lockdown in 2020, 301 such cases were reported,” said Sharma.“The BJP-led MC had made a three-fold increase in water tariff and also burdened the residents with new taxes and cess. But, the residents have now made up their mind to throw out the BJP from power and will choose Congress in the upcoming corporation elections,” he said.Cong campaign gets shot in the armThe Congress party’s campaign got a shot in the arm, when hundreds of AAP leaders and workers from ward no. 15 led by Rajesh Kumar Azad, chairman of Azad Jan Seva, Society Small Flats, Dhanas; Jaivinder Singh, president; Kiran Pal, general secretary; Ramesh, adviser; Mahavir Chauhan, secretary and Sulekh, Som Pak, Summari, Pramod Kumar, Sharief, Akbar and Chander Pal, all executive members, entered the Congress fold on Sunday.Rajesh Kumar and Jaivinder alleged that the genuine workers of AAP are being ignored and sidelined in Chandigarh by the party. “The manipulators and opportunists have hijacked the party. This is leading to suffocation of hard-working workers of AAP, who are leaving the party in hoards,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/inviting-haryana-cm-for-campaigning-has-shown-bjp-s-anti-farmer-mindset-chandigarh-congress-chief-101639339865329.html
13-12-2021||Chandigarh||CM Channi, Randhawa, Sidhu coercing cops to implicate me, Majithia in false cases: Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday accused Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of coercing senior police officers to register false cases against him and his party MLA Bikram Singh Majithia.Talking to mediapersons after addressing rallies in support of party candidate Harinderpal Singh Chandumarja in Sanaur, Sukhbir said the Congress had taken over the police department to act against senior SAD leaders. “Conscientious police officers have refused to obey these extra-constitutional orders and this is why two officers of the Bureau of Investigation – Arpit Shukla and Varinder Kumar — have been changed in quick succession while incumbent director SK Asthana has proceeded on leave,” he said. Claiming that the Congress was resorting to vendetta to divert attention from its failures, the SAD leader said attempts were being made to implicate Majithia in a false case days before the imposition of the model code of conduct. “We had earlier exposed a conspiracy to implicate me in a false case through a former party worker. It was proved when the said worker made the same allegations we had referred to beforehand,” he added.Instead of resolving the grievances of people, the CM is playing politics on the drug issue after having failed miserably to contain the menace even, he alleged. Sukhbir also slammed the CM for raking up the land ceiling issue “which was settled decades ago”. “A government missive to revenue department officials to verify surplus land would only result in harassment of land owners and encourage corruption. This is another example of ways and means by which the Congress government is trying to divert attention from its failures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cm-channi-randhawa-sidhu-coercing-cops-to-implicate-me-majithia-in-false-cases-sukhbir-badal-101639339864046.html
13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Train services hit as labour unions block tracks in Punjab for 4 hours||Train services were affected in Punjab on Sunday after thousands of members of labour unions blocked the railway tracks for nearly four hours in support of their demands. A Ferozepur railway division spokesperson said of a total of 19 trains affected, 14 were delayed and five were rescheduled. The movement of trains in Punjab under the Ambala and Delhi divisions was also affected.Union leaders said their demands included seeking plots for the homeless, reinstallation of electricity meters, punishing those committing atrocities on scheduled castes (SCs) and 25 per cent reservation for workers for ₹50,000 loan in co-operative societies. The protesters staged dharnas at Mananwala in Amritsar, Dhilwan in Kapurthala, Sunam in Sangrur, Gidderbaha in Muktsar and Ajitwal in Moga district besides Phillaur, Bathinda, Mansa and Faridkot district headquarters from 12 noon to 4pm. The Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, an affiliate of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ughrahan), had given a call to suspend rail services to register their opposition to the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Punjab government. Union general secretary Lachman Singh Sewewala said, “Homeless and needy continue to remain without residential plots. The Channi government has failed to initiate any step to bring justice in cases of atrocities on Dalits. The government has failed to work on the demands raised by us.”In a joint statement, leaders of the Sanjha Mazdoor Morcha comprising various labour unions said that if the government does not implement their demands they will intensify their agitation. “We will plan our future course of action in a meeting on December 15,” they added. The morcha leaders alleged that the Congress high command changed its chief minister in Punjab to cover up its failures of four-and-a-half years. Even the present dispensation continues with its anti-labour policies, they said. “CM Charanjit Singh Channi is refusing to provide plots and reinstall electricity meters which were removed due to non-payment of bills. Channi is making big announcements ahead of state assembly elections to misguide the people but nothing is being implemented on the ground,” they added. They also demanded suspension of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) from the CM’s security detail who lathicharged unemployed youths in Mansa a few days back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/train-services-hit-as-labour-unions-block-tracks-in-punjab-for-4-hours-101639339745519.html

Bains had filed an application with the bureau director seeking re-investigation of the matter and the inquiry was marked to DIG, Faridkot.The court in the orders said that as the police have already filed a charge-sheet in the case and the court has already issued multiple non-bailable as well as bailable warrants against Bains and others, no further investigation can be carried out without the permission of the court. The court said that the two officers had “committed gross and blatant violation of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. As such, necessary intimation in this regard be given to deputy inspector general police (Faridkot Range) as it would amount to contempt of Court.Counsel for the complainant argued that the accused are well aware of the proceedings pending against them. “Bains is openly conducting his political rallies and enjoying police security. The police are hand in glove with the accused and are not arresting them deliberately. Therefore, coercive methods are adopted and proclamations are issued against all the accused,” the complainant’s counsel said. The magistrate said that the court has “failed to appreciate” that the officers were conducting further investigation into the matter without permission of the Court particularly when a challan has already been filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rape-allegations-against-bains-contempt-notice-to-bureau-director-dig-for-re-investigating-case-101639339743983.html

Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson for the Gurgaon Muslim Council, said a delegation will meet the deputy commissioner on Monday since the chief minister on Friday said that the Muslims need to discuss alternative sites for Friday prayers with the district administration. “Around five lakh Muslims stay or work in Gurugram, while there are only two mosques in new Gurugram and 11 in the old city with a total capacity of 15,000 people even if offer the Juma namaz in several jamaats (shifts). Hence, it’s extremely important that alternative sites are assigned to the Muslims until the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) approves land for building multi-story mosques,” he said. “The state Waqf Board and the administration have not been able to get waqf properties vacated from encroachers. Who is being held responsible for the same,” he said, referring to suggestions that the Muslims should use waqf properties to offer namaz or build mosques. When contacted, a senior district administration official said they were waiting for “new orders from the state government”, based on which they will discuss the issue with both parties (Hindus and Muslims).Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police, said they have not received the new plan of action, and added that the “new orders are expected to come by Monday”. “The deployment (for Friday prayers) will be decided on Monday after fresh directions are received,” he said. The protest against Friday namaz in open public spaces has been taking place in Gurugram since 2018. The same year, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, in November this year, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing outfits continued to protest and disrupt prayers. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said offering namaz in public places cannot be tolerated, even as the district administration withdrew permission for Friday prayers at 20 designated sites. “Such programmes (namaz) should not be held in the open. This practice of offering namaz at public spaces will not be tolerated as it is leading to controversies and confrontations. We have given directions to the police and administration to resolve the issue amicably. We will not allow any confrontation, and try to resolve it,” the chief minister said Hindu outfits on Sunday said the issue has been resolved, according to them, after the CM made it clear that namaz will not be performed in open spaces. They said they will protest only if people still try to pray in public spaces. Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor for Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, a Hindu umbrella body leading protests against namaz, said, “Since the government has taken a decision that a no namaz will be offered in the open, the matter is resolved. We will only protest if anyone tried to violate the order and start offering prayers in open,” he said. Praveen Yadav, a Samiti member, said they will deploy people at a few sites. “We can’t leave the situation to police or administration. We will have to ensure that all public spaces are protected and Hindu groups are deployed to stop Muslims from performing namaz,” he said.

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Military Literature Festival: Veterans revisit tales of valour||From crossing the Meghna River to heli-borne operations, the war veterans who fought during the 1971 Indo-Pak war shared tales of valour and experiences on the second day of Military Literature Festival 2021 on Sunday.The 1971 war is a glorious chapter of independent India’s history and for soldiers who fought on the frontline, it is still fresh in their memory. Speaking at the festival that is themed around the confrontation, Major Chanderkant Singh, VrC, said, “At some point during the day on November 20, we were told that we were to go across the border to capture Akhaura and not return thereafter, but instead turn south. So, I think the high command was well aware that a war will start in a few days’ time.”“Akhaura had a formidable defence and I think they had around 800 to 1000 troops here. For some reasons the Pakistanis could not visualize that we would get behind them and also attack from the south,” he continued.Shifting focus to the heli-borne operations, Squadron leader PK Vaid (VrC) said, “During the war, we were using the Mi4 which was a very basic helicopter and we could carry thirteen to fourteen passengers but we were going around 50% over capacity. On December 7, it was decided that we were to go to Sylhet, which was the first special heli-borne operation where we inducted troops behind the enemy lines,”“I briefed all my pilots that as soon as the troops arrive, we load them onto the helicopter and go airborne. Each of us made three trips each. When I went the second time, the Pakistan army had started surrounding the field and they were firing at us from all directions but our army was keeping them at bay,” he further recalled, stressing on the extremity of the entire situation.The troops underwent rigorous training to try and learn to execute elaborate operations on the battlefront. Speaking of the same, CS Sandhu, group captain commanding the 110 Helicopter Unit of the Indian Air Force, which was carrying out the heli-borne operations, said, “When I met General Sagat Singh, PVSM, for a briefing, he desired that we induct troops into the enemy territory during the night. I explained to him that this was the first time that the Air Force was to conduct such an operation during the night. After intense training, however, the troops were ready for the task by the end of October.”The 110 Helicopter Unit was later bestowed with the President’s Standard, the highest honour awarded by the President to an Air Force unit or Squadron. Recalling the moment, Sandhu said, “Later, we had the honour of receiving the president’s standard, following which the ward air chief visited the unit, complimenting them for their outstanding effort,” he added.Former governor of Jammu and Kashmir, NN Vohra, who was also in attendance at the event, joined the discussion, saying, “This war was not just a military event but this particular engagement had a very significant background. The authorities in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) were indulging in ruthless hegemony, eliminating a population of one community. The military generals ruling from Islamabad had given strict orders not to spare anyone and enforce the law.”“As a result of ruthless carnage in East Pakistan, millions of Bangladeshis started entering India from early winters in 1971, with the number going up. The Indian government at that time tried all means to persuade the leadership of Pakistan to take back these people but they did not do it,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/military-literature-festival-veterans-revisit-tales-of-valour-101639338425835.html

It is 40 feet high with double bed and bathroom facilities. Sal and teak wood have been used in the tree house,” said BS Shahi, divisional forest officer (DFO), Terai-west forest division in Kumaon. To attract tourists to the Fato range of forests in Ramnagar, a jungle safari is also on the anvil. It was to be inaugurated on Sunday but was postponed and now it is likely to be inaugurated on December 24. The tree house is located in the middle of lush green forests. This concept was conceived at the beginning of this year. Booking and staying facilities are likely to be provided from January. “We haven’t fixed the tariff for staying in the tree house; a committee of the forest department will fix the tariff. But a person will be provided a staying facility for not more than a week so that maximum number of tourists can enjoy the tree house experience,” said Shahi. Food for tourists staying in the tree house will be provided from the forest rest house, he added. “The tree house concept is a good idea to attract tourists in remote places of the forests. Hope more tree houses will come up in the future and will fetch revenue for the state government,” said Vikas Jindal, an industrialist and social activist belonging to Ramnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhands-first-ever-tree-house-to-welcome-tourists-in-kumaon-from-next-month-101639337823818.html
13-12-2021||Lucknow||2022 polls: Battle for east UP hots up as BSP, BJP MLAs join SP||The battle for 2022 assembly elections in eastern region of Uttar Pradesh (UP) is getting interesting. Influential Bahujan Samaj Party’s (BSP) Brahmin leaders from east UP Vinay Shankar Tiwari (sitting MLA) Kushal Tiwari (ex-MP) and Ganesh Shankar Pandey (former chairperson of UP Legislative Council) along with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Khalilabad seat in Sant Kabir Nagar Digvijay Narain Chaubey joined the Samajwadi Party in the presence of the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at the SP state headquarters in Lucknow on Sunday. The BSP had already expelled Vinay, Kushal, and Ganesh last week after it was clear that the three were set to join the SP. Through these leaders the SP is expecting consolidation of Brahmin votes in east UP. Vinay Shankar Tiwari, son of Hari Shankar Tiwari, is an MLA from Chillupar constituency, Kushal is a former MP from Sant Kabir Nagar, whereas Ganesh Shankar Pandey was the chairman of the Legislative Council at the time of the BSP government. Vinay and Kushal are the sons of influential eastern UP leaders from Gorakhpur, Harishankar Tiwari while Ganesh is a nephew of Hari Shankar Tiwari. Speculation is rife that Harishankar too would join the SP soon. Hari Shankar Tiwari was the first public figure in Indian political history to be elected to the legislature from prison. Elected from Chillupar for the first time in 1985, he remained a member of the legislative assembly for 23 years uninterrupted. Tiwari is known face of brahmin politics in UP. He had been a cabinet minister in UP in BJP, BSP, and SP governments. Earlier in October, six suspended BSP MLAs joined Samajwadi Party in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. These MLAs include Hargovind Bhargav, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel and Aslam Chaudhary. Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to go for Assembly polls in 2022. Previously, in the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP bagged 312 seats out of the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh Assembly while the SP bagged 47 seats, BSP won 19 and Congress could manage to win only seven seats. The rest of the seats were bagged by other candidates.

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||After meeting Vij, Haryana doctors postpone Monday’s strike||A day before over 1,000 doctors from across the state under the banner of the Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) Association were scheduled to go on strike, state health minister Anil Vij on Sunday assured that all their issues will be resolved and the strike was postponed.The doctors held a meeting with the minister and director general of health services Veena Singh at the PWD rest house in Ambala Cantonment for more than an hour, where the chair was informed about all the demands.After the meeting, Vij said, “I’ve listened to the issues and will try to resolve all of them at the earliest. There is no need for a strike.”Doctors of government hospitals in state had last week announced that they will go on a strike from December 13 – out-patient departments (OPDs) of all government hospitals will be closed for the whole day, and emergency and postmortem services will also be shut from December 14 – if the demands are not met.State HCMS president Dr Jasbir Singh Parmar said Vij was informed about the three demands on which he assured action at the earliest.“We have postponed the strike and I believe there will be no need for it if the demands are met by December 31. We are compelled to announce such strikes due to insensitive bureaucracy who are sitting on our files for a long time,” Dr Parmar told the media after the meeting.The three demands include stopping direct recruitment of senior medical officers (SMOs), hiring of specialist doctors, and revision of the postgraduate policy.A member of the association said recently, additional chief secretary (ACS, health) Rajeev Arora had called a delegation of the aggrieved doctors for a meeting, who had later walked out “because of his misbehaviour”.“Vij was informed about this incident at the meeting. We believe due to direct recruitment, promotions of many officers in the department get affected. Moreover, nearly one-third of the specialists (700 against 2,000 posts) treat around 300 patients each daily against the required strength in acute mental pressure. Also, we are demanding a 40% quota for government doctors in medical colleges as per the Supreme Court guidelines,” the member said, pleading anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-meeting-vij-haryana-doctors-postpone-monday-s-strike-101639337165607.html

13-12-2021||Delhi||Weekly Covid vaccinations in Delhi highest since early October||The pace of Covid-19 inoculations in the capital increased to almost 860,000 jabs in the week ended Sunday, the highest over a seven-day period since October 3, an uptick that comes amid persisting concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Delhi administered 859,426 shots of Covid-19 vaccines between December 6 and 12, data collated from the CoWin dashboard showed, the most in seven days since the week ended October 3, when just over 1.05 million people were vaccinated. The city’s weekly vaccinations peaked the week before that, with over 1.16 million shots administered in the seven days to September 26, the official data showed.Over 14.4 million people in Delhi have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as of Sunday evening, which translates to around 97% of the city’s population. Of these, over 9.7 million have received both doses.Daily vaccinations in the capital have picked up in the past few weeks, especially since news of the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 emerged globally on November 25.In the seven days ended November 25, Delhi administered an average of 87,309 vaccines every day, according to the CoWin dashboard. A week later, on December 2, this number had shot up to 100,476 jabs a day. On December 9, it went up further to 128,120 doses a day.The seven-day average of jabs also peaked in the week to September 26, when 166,544 Covid-19 vaccines were administered on an average everyday.Two cases of the Omicron variant have been detected so far in the capital – the first was a person who returned from Tanzania, and the second was a man who landed in the city from Zimbabwe – while there have been 38 Omicron infections detected across the country.To be sure, the caseload in Delhi has remained very low and mostly stable since the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the city between April and May began to die down. As on Saturday, Delhi recorded an average of 52 fresh cases per day over the past week.Since the new variant appeared, the state government has made increased vaccination rates among the city’s population a priority. During an address on November 30, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, while detailing the city’s preparedness to tackle any surge in cases, urged eligible residents to get their second vaccine doses soon.A Delhi government spokesperson attributed the jump in vaccinations to the state’s efforts.“Recently, CM Kejriwal issued strict directions to officers to ramp up awareness campaigns and reach out to each and every resident of the state and motivate them to get their doses. The Delhi government will continue to rapidly vaccinate eligible citizens and protect them from the spread of the virus,” the spokesperson said.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said that the vaccination rates increased after the April-May wave of Covid-19, but started dipping again later on“In the last month, very few people came to get vaccinated. Even at the three centres that we have in Safdarjung hospital, the vaccination rates were very low. Now, due to the Omicron variant, people are once again realising the importance of vaccines. The rate of second doses have increased. Human psychology is such that fear drives action and compels people to take preventive measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekly-covid-vaccinations-in-delhi-highest-since-early-october-101639335306429.html

Jail officials said the undertrial, identified as Bhim Singh Raghav from Roz Ka Meo in Nuh, climbed on to the closet in the washroom, tied a bedsheet to the ventilator and hung himself. The incident came to the fore when the jail warder was conducting his routine checking. The jail warder and security guards rushed him to the hospital, where he was declared brought dead, said police. A board of doctors conducted the post-mortem of Raghav’s body, following which it was handed over to his family members. Superintendent of Bhondsi jail Harinder Singh said, “The undertrial died by suicide early Monday morning. A judicial probe has been ordered in the case.” Raghav, who lived in a rented room in Sohna before his imprisonment, was lodged in the jail since February after he allegedly shot dead Rohit Sharma of Jalandhar in Punjab, who was working with an infrastructure company, which was awarded the contract of constructing an expressway connecting Gurugram and Mumbai. On February 23, Sharma was working at the site when Raghav reached the spot in his i20 car. When Sharma asked the purpose of his visit, Raghav pulled out a gun and allegedly shot Sharma, who died on the spot. Raghav allegedly confessed to the murder and revealed that he used to sell stolen materials to a supplier. He used to visit the company’s site office thrice a week, said police. Police said Raghav lost his job during the Covid-19 outbreak and was unable to make ends meet, due to which he took to stealing iron and steel from construction sites. The jail superintendent said they are trying to ascertain the reasons why Raghav took his life. “They have accessed the CCTV footage of the area and a special team was formed on Sunday to analyse the footage,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-inmate-of-bhondsi-jail-dies-by-suicide-probe-ordered-101639335243947.html

Jain said corruption and bribery will be eradicated immediately after the AAP forms government in Punjab and development works will be taken up for the benefit of common people. “In Delhi, any officer or employee found taking bribe is immediately sacked. In Punjab, too, we will establish a transparent and honest government like in Delhi,” he said.Taking a dig at both SAD and Congress, he said their leaders were afraid of AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “They are always worried that if the AAP forms the government in Punjab, then their ‘loot business’ will stop and all their files (of corruption) will be opened,” he said.Assuring the traders that the AAP government would provide them financial security and facilities, he said the commission system or Inspector Raj will be completely abolished.

13-12-2021||Delhi||DDA seeks simpler process for property rights at unauthorised colonies||About 11,500 people in Delhi’s 1,731 unauthorised colonies have got ownership rights under the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri - Unauthorised Colony in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojna (PM-UDAY) that was launched in December 2019, a senior DDA official said.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the nodal agency for the implementation of the scheme, has written to the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) requesting modifications in the list of documents needed for processing the applications to further simplify the process so that people can be covered or benefit from the scheme.Till December 3, the DDA has received 90,700 applications of which approximately 21,000 were rejected as the applicants were found to be ineligible and 11,500 were given ownership documents (either conveyance deed to properties on private land or authorisation slip to properties on government land).DDA officials admit that the numbers are low as compared to the number of properties (approximately one million) in these unauthorised colonies that have close to four million residents.A senior DDA official said that a lot of applicants don’t have a registered Will, which is one of the main documents needed to get ownership rights under the scheme. “We can’t process the application without the Will even if the applicant has all the other necessary documents related to sale-purchase of the property. We have written to the ministry for permission to process cases without the Will document and also recognise registered gift deeds. We are yet to get a response from the ministry in this regard,” said a senior DDA official who asked not to be named.When contacted, there was no response from the ministry. DDA officials said the Covid-19 pandemic also impacted the pace of the work, as physical verifications couldn’t be done during the lockdown.To increase the number of applicants, the DDA in July this year started holding camps in unauthorised colonies, hired a public relations firm to aggressively advertise the scheme, and set up centres to assist people in the documentation work.“An important reason for the low response is that it is an open-ended scheme. There is no sense of urgency among people, as there is no cut-off date. We are internally examining this matter and might take it up with the ministry,” the DDA official said.Residents of unauthorised colonies say that there is a need to relax the norms and simplify the process. Brij Mohan Somani, a resident of Badli, said, “The process is cumbersome. People living in these colonies are not well-educated. There is a need to simplify the method and process the applications in a time-bound manner.”Naresh Kumar, a resident of Raja Vihar in Rohini, said one of the reasons why not many people are eager to get the ownership is because one of the main concerns of not getting a bank loan remains even after they get the rights.Kumar, who was among the first 20 property owners to get the ownership of his property under PM-UDAY in January 2020, said, “I had applied for a loan of ₹10 lakh to carry out construction work. The banks have refused to give me a loan against my property. They say that the building plan should be approved by the municipal corporations, which is not possible. The government should do something about it.”Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner in-charge at DDA, said, “The building plans in these colonies can’t be sanctioned as the layouts are not ready, and a majority of the buildings don’t meet the building byelaws criteria.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddaseeks-simpler-process-for-property-rights-at-unauthorised-colonies-101639335064137.html
13-12-2021||Delhi||North MCD staff to strike today to protest against non-payment of dues||At least 10,000 employees of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation including teachers, nurses and sanitation workers will go on a 24-hour strikeon Monday against delay in payment of salaries, dearness allowance and other dues, an umbrella organisation of the several staff unions of the civic body said on Sunday. AP Khan, convener of the Confederation of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Employees Union (CMCDEU), said the protest will take place outside the north MCD headquarters, Civic Centre, in central Delhi from 10am on Monday. “Since all rounds of talks between the union and the civic body over the payment of salaries and dues have failed to yield any result, we have no option but to protest to press our demands. Office-bearers of the north MCD have so far made only false promises, and are not willing to give us any assurance in writing. If the civic body remains indifferent to our demands, we will go on an indefinite strike,” he said.Employees said they have not been paid salaries for several months, and the dearness allowance is pending since July.Khan said the delay in disbursing the salaries and pensions has become a “routine affair”. “Since trifurcation of the municipal body appears to be the root cause of this financial distress, it should be unified; at least the finance wings of the three corporations should be brought together,” he said. The three civic bodies have been in a financial mess ever since the MCD was trifurcated, and have struggled to implement new projects and pay salaries to their staff leading to strikes. In the build-up to the 2022 municipal elections, the BJP, which has been ruling the three civic bodies for the past 15 years, has come under severe attack from the opposition which has blamed the crisis on the mismanagement and rampant corruption in the civic bodies. The North MCD maintains the largest area in the city (604.54 sq km out of 1484 sq km) among the three municipal bodies, and according to the civic body commissioner the liabilities of the corporation ( ₹8,800 crore) are more than its entire budget for the next financial year ( ₹5,808 crore).The paramedical staff of Hindu Rao Hospital, the biggest civic bodies-run health facility in Delhi, have said that they will join the doctors in the strike. ““We have received salaries till October, but our demand for clearing outstanding dues with increased allowances is pending. We have so far compromised keeping in mind the problems that the patients face due to strike. But now, we will support the confederation’s call for protest on Monday and our members will work only if there is an emergency,” said Tajender Kumar, one of the leaders of the paramedical staff union of the hospital. Category C and D workers at hospitals under the north MCD have also decided to go on a 24-hour strike on Monday. “Laboratory technicians, sweepers and other workers from Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals will take part in the 24-hour strike. Nurses from Girdhari Lal Hospital will also join us,” said Vinod Kumar Parcha, the president of the Hospital Employees’ Union. Kuldeep Singh Khatri, president of Shikshak Nyay Manch, an association of MCD teachers, said over 3,000 teachers will demonstrate outside the BJP’s national office if their salaries are not paid by Monday. “We had protested outside the BJP’s Delhi office over the non-payment of salaries on October 8, but none of the state BJP leaders approached us for the resolution of the issue. Our agitation has already entered the 14th day and nearly 7,000 teachers have stopped online classes. We have not received our salaries for last four months. Our dearness allowance too has not been paid since July,” he said. North MCD’s standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said the representatives of the CMCDEU were not ready to accept the assurances by the civic body. “Civic officials have also approached the Union ministry of finance to discuss a possible solution to the existing fund crisis. Unless we get the funds, we cannot disburse regular salaries to the civic employees,” he said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the salary bills and other expenses of the civic bodies have gone up after the latest Pay Commission recommendation for 2021, but the Delhi government continues to release funds fixed in 2012-13 . “Due to this, three municipal corporations are facing an extreme financial crisis. If municipal employees go on strike, the people of Delhi will hold the Kejriwal government responsible,” he said.Senior AAP councillor Mukesh Goyal accused the BJP for adapting a dilly-dallying approach in dealing with the problems of the employees. “Instead of generating resources and getting special package from the central government to overcome the financial distress, they always play blame-game. To hide their failures, the BJP councillors always try to create ruckus, to suspend the House,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-staff-to-strike-today-to-protest-against-non-payment-of-dues-101639335003942.html
13-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi records coldest day of season on Sunday at 6.4 degrees Celsius||The minimum temperature in Delhi on Sunday fell by two degrees from the previous day, as the mercury fell to 6.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest so far this season, with cold winds from northern states bringing the chill to the national capital.Prior to this, the lowest minimum so far this winter season was 8.3°C on Saturday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts temperatures to remain between six and eight degrees Celsius in the next five days as well, as it added that the maximum temperature could drop 2-3°C by the end of the week. Delhi on Saturday recorded a maximum temperature of 23.9°C — a notch above normal. RK Jenamani, IMD scientist, said temperatures across the northern plains have dropped over the past 48 hours, and added that he expected the mercury to remain in a similar range through the week.“Temperatures are dipping as cold northwesterly winds are blowing in from the snow-covered mountains. Clear skies also mean the night-time temperature can go fairly low,” he said.Temperatures in several parts of Jammu & Kashmir, for instance, have dipped to sub-zero levels. The mercury in south Kashmir’s Pahalgam fell to minus 6.4°C on Saturday.IMD’s forecast shows while the maximum temperature will remain around 24°C till Wednesday. It will start dipping from Thursday, and touch 21 degrees Celsius by Saturday.Meanwhile, Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) at 4pm on Sunday remained in the ‘poor’ category, improving marginally compared to the previous day. The AQI dipped to 254, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, down from 281 on Saturday. An AQI between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and over 400 is ‘severe’ as per CPCB’s index. Gufran Beig, project director and founder at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a government forecasting body, says the air could hover between the ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ levels over the next two days. “While light to moderate winds and a good mixing height will keep air quality within the poor range during the day, it can could hit very poor at night, when temperatures dip,” he said.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory says Delhi tends to see another spell of ‘severe’ air towards the end of December as temperatures start to dip, with colder air generally heavier and more difficult to disperse. “Conditions become calm and wind speeds drop. There is also moderate to dense fog towards the end of December, which along with low temperatures, making it difficult for local emissions to disperse,” he said.IMD’s forecast shows the maximum and minimum are expected to hover around 24 and 8 degrees Celsius on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-coldest-day-of-season-on-sunday-at-6-4-degrees-celsius-101639334823760.html
13-12-2021||Delhi||Blocked highway sections at Singhu, Ghaziabad may reopen in Jan: NHAI||The portions of Delhi-Meerut Expressway (NH9 аnd NH24) at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border and National Highway 44 at Singhu border that were shut for over a year due to the farmer’s protest will be opened for public from next month (January 2022), senior officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said on Sunday.Officials said inspection on both the stretches of NH-24, NH-9 аnd NH-44 will be conducted after December 15 – the time by which the farmers’ unions have said both sites will be cleared. It would take at least two weeks from then to complete all the repair works, they added.“We will start work once the farmers have fully retreated from sites. They (farmers) have said they will clear their temporary structures by this week. Immediately after the sites are cleared, our teams will conduct an inspection to assess the damage. After that repair and other maintenance works will be undertaken. People will definitely get to use those stretches of the highways from the New Year,” said one senior NHAI official asking not to be named.After over an year of agitation against the three farm laws enacted by the Union government in September last year, thousands of farmers who were camping on the borders of Delhi have started wrapping up the makeshift structures they called home away from their villages after Parliament scrapped the laws on November 29. The three contentious laws deregulated farm trade. A second senior NHAI official, who also asked to remain anonymous and handles both the highways, said a lot will also depend on the ongoing ban on construction activities in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution in Delhi. In case the permissions are not granted, opening of the stretches could be delayed further, he added.“We would open it quickly once the inspection is done. It may take about two weeks, subject to the permission of work being granted to us as currently there’s a construction ban in the city as part of anti-pollution measures,” the second official said.In their preliminary assessment, teams of NHAI found that the structural safety of the elevated portion of NH-24 may have been affected as minor cracks were identified at some portions. “Usually, we have dedicated teams for regular highway maintenance. But, no such routine activity has happened on highways along Ghazipur аnd Singhu for more than a year now because of the farmers’ protest. Our latest preliminary report suggests repair works will be needed,” the official said.Dependra Pathak, special commissioner of police (law and order, north zone), said the Delhi Traffic Police has started removing barricades and blockades from all the points that were used for the protests. “We have started the process of removing the barricades and blockades that were placed on the Delhi side. Agencies such as NHAI have also been informed about it. Opening of the borders for traffic will be done as early as possible,” he said.“At many places, roads were dug and filled with concrete to install iron spikes. The farmers built concrete structures on the roads, and at several places holes were dug in the roads to erect iron pipes to set up tents. All these issues need to be addressed by the agencies concerned,” said a senior police officer who asked not to be named.The Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Meerut Expressway has been shut since December 3 last year when farmers erected the dais at the site, hampering the movement of thousands of vehicles. The protest also resulted in the closure of the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Hindon elevated road which ends at UP-Gate. As a result, people are having to spend an additional 40-50 minutes on the road to reach their destinations.“Either we take a 3-km detour from Anand Vihar while moving from UP to Delhi, or go through a narrow road passing through Ghazipur poultry market and Khoda Colony. A checkpoint at Khoda adds 30 minutes to one hour during peak traffic hours,” said Ankita Kumar, who has to commute for work to Central Delhi.Up north, with the city’s main exit towards Punjab blocked at the Singhu border for over a year, commuters were taking a detour through the colony roads on either side of the main highway. These included narrow single-lane roads that took commuters around the Guru Tegh Bahadur memorial, while similar routes on the other side of the road through Narela were opening up directly in Sonipat. These detours were largely causing a delay of around 45-60 minutes, depending on the traffic volume, several commuters said.The first NHAI official cited above said repair works at the NH-9 and NH-24 (Ghazipur protest site) is likely to take longer than NH-44 (Singhu border).
13-12-2021||Delhi||As dust settles at Delhi’s Singhu border, protest leaves little behind||As the dust settles at Singhu border, the evidence of a community of several thousand farmers thriving in the middle of a national highway is not too prominent anymore. With the farmers finally departing for their homes on Saturday morning after over a year, what remains at the border – the site which became associated with the farmers’ protest against the three farm laws — is only a handful of larger tents, the structure of the main stage covered in tin sheets and a few tractor trolleys being loaded with equipment to be sent back to Punjab and Haryana. During a spot check on Sunday, HT found that the main road is littered with some boulders and debris, with scattered potholes where tents were dug into the ground. However, the area has now taken over by locals busy inspecting the site of the farmers’ protest and what is left behind, as shops around the area begin to open up slowly. The main highway is yet to be made fully operational, with commuters still having to take detours from inner colony roads on either side of the highway. HT saw several earthmovers and cranes at work, removing and breaking the cemented barricades placed on the Delhi side of the border. “Both carriageways can be opened up only once all the barricades are removed and the road has been suitably cleared out. This will take a few days,” said a Delhi Police officer stationed at the beginning of the barricaded area. While the actual site of the protest has nearly been cleared up, among those who have stayed behind include members of NGOs like United Sikhs and the Life Care Foundation – each operating large enclosures with medical facilities and beds for those who became ill over the course of the protest. Meanwhile, only the outer shell of the main stage still stands, with a library and a stall for the Mitti Aid NGO, each of which are likely to be dismantled by Monday. Avtar Singh, founder of the Life Care Foundation says their 10-bedded facility was able to treat nearly 6,000 people over the past year, including trauma cases. “We had a high-tech facility, which is why it has taken us longer to return. The medical equipment has to be sent back first. We will send our beds and equipment on several trucks, while the team will leave on Monday for Dera Bassi [a city in Punjab],” said Singh. Nachhattar Singh Grewal, a popular face in the farmers’ protest is still at Singhu border as well, camped up outside the Mitti Aid enclosure. He says he stayed back to distribute blankets and other items to homeless people in the area. “We wanted to stay a day or two extra and distribute blankets and other items to the locals here, who would sleep under our tents and feast on the langar service (community kitchen). For them, the end of the protest is a big loss,” says Grewal. But, he says it is time to head back, and will leave for Punjab on Monday. While he may depart, a group of 10 farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab don’t plan to. With chains wrapped around their arms and neck, the group says it will sit on hunger strike at the site, until the centre guarantees a Minimum Support Price (MSP). “Even if the highway opens up, we will sit on one side of the road and continue our protest,” said Sukhbir Singh, one of the 10 protesters, from Hisar in Haryana. The end of the protest means shops on either side of the highway, some of which remained shut for nearly a year, were opening up once again. Hansraj, the manager of a government wine and beer shop located at Singhu border was busy ensuring the final touches of a fresh paint are completed before the evening. “We expect the highway to open in a day or two. We will open our shop from Monday and fresh stock has already arrived,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-dust-settles-at-delhi-s-singhu-border-protest-leaves-little-behind-101639334464963.html
13-12-2021||Kolkata||Police officer, civic volunteer arrested for allegedly molesting woman in Kolkata||An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a civic police volunteer of the Bidhan Nagar city police district located on the eastern outskirts of Kolkata were arrested on Sunday for allegedly molesting a woman late on Friday night, police said. The crime took place on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass when the victim, a resident of Asansol in West Burdwan district, was offered a lift on a motorcycle by the accused. She sought help after getting stranded because of lack of public transport. She alleged that the duo molested her on the moving motorcycle and dropped her at a desolate place when she protested. ASI Sandip Pal and civic police volunteer Abhishek Malakar were arrested on the basis of a complaint the victim lodged at Kasba police station of the Kolkata Police in the early hours of Saturday, an officer said on condition of anonymity. The Kolkata police took up the matter with the Bidhan Nagar city police. The two men were held after footages caught on security cameras installed along the EM Bypass were examined. They were suspended immediately. The victim told the police that she came to Kolkata to appear for a job interview. She was supposed to live with a friend for two days. When she failed to get a bus that would take her to Garfa, where her friend lives, she stopped the civic volunteer who was coming on a motorcycle. The civic volunteer gave her a lift for some distance from Bidhan Nagar before calling the ASI over phone. She alleged that the ASI forced her to sit between the two men before they molested her. With Kolkata gearing up for the December 19 municipal elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) targeted the government after the arrests since Kolkata was declared the safest metro for women in the 2020 annual report of the National Crime Records Bureau. BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of turning Kolkata into a lawless city. “The arrests have proved that contrary to claims made by the TMC, Kolkata is not a safe place for women,” he said. No TMC leader commended on the incident till Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/police-officer-civic-volunteer-arrested-for-allegedly-molesting-woman-in-kolkata-101639334463651.html

We have now decided to postpone our strike till December 31. If our demands are not met by then, we will conduct a meeting to decide the next course of action.” On December 5, over 1,000 doctors from across the state had held a meeting in Karnal and later submitted a memorandum to the chief minister. The doctors had said that if the long pending demands are not met, then out patient departments of all government hospitals in the state will be closed for the whole day on December 13, and emergency and postmortem services will also be shut from December 14 onwards.The doctors’ association has also demanded to restore the previous quota for in-service candidates in the PG course policy, along with addition of super speciality courses. The doctors said that restoring the previous policy will increase the number of in-service doctors pursuing PG course and the department will get more specialists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-govt-doctors-defer-strike-till-dec-31-after-meeting-with-health-minister-101639334284382.html
13-12-2021||Lucknow||KV Corridor will add to Kashi’s spiritual vibrancy, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the Kashi Vishwanath (KV) Corridor project will add to the spiritual vibrancy of Kashi (Varanasi).He made the observation a day before he inaugurates the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, spread over 5.5 lakh (550,000) square feet area, in Varanasi on Monday. A festive atmosphere was palpable in the temple town before the event.The KV Corridor that connects the Ganga and Kashi Vishwanath temple has been decorated with ornamental lights and tons of marigold flowers and garlands for the ceremony.“Tomorrow, 13th December is a landmark day. At a special programme in Kashi, the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham project will be inaugurated. This will add to Kashi’s spiritual vibrancy. I would urge you all to join tomorrow’s programme,” PM Modi said in a tweet.PM Modi will be on a two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency Varanasi from Monday.Soon after arriving in Varanasi, Modi will offer prayers at the Kaal Bhairav temple around noon and thereafter reach the KV Corridor gate on the bank of the Ganga. At around 1pm, he will visit Kashi Vishwanath Temple and offer prayers, after which he will inaugurate Phase 1 of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham (KV Corridor), constructed at a cost of around ₹339 crore, a statement said.According to Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), it was the vision of the prime minister for a long time to facilitate the pilgrims and devotees of Baba Vishwanath, who had to encounter congested streets and surroundings with poor upkeep, when they practised the age-old custom of taking a dip in the holy river, collecting Gangajal and offering it at the temple.A total of 23 buildings will be inaugurated in the Phase 1 of the project.“They will provide a variety of facilities to the pilgrims visiting Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple, including Yatri Suvidha Kendras, Tourist Facilitation Centre, Vedic Kendra, Mumukshu Bhavan, Bhogshala, City Museum, Viewing Gallery, Food Court, among others,” it said.Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary Tarun Chugh said over 50 crore (500 million) people will watch the KV Corridor inaugural ceremony that will be shown live on television and live streamed on various social media platforms, including YouTube.Around 3,000 special guests, including saints, Vedic scholars, priests from all 11 other jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva will attend the inaugural ceremony, he added.There is a hi-tech command and control centre with cameras installed in every nook and corner for round the clock surveillance to ensure foolproof security, said commissioner of police, Varanasi, A Satish Ganesh.Divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal said, “It is matter of great satisfaction that KV Corridor is completely ready. It is all set to be inaugurated by Prime Minster Narendra Modi on December 13.” Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board (SKSADB) chief executive officer Sunil Verma, who supervised the project, said, “The entire Kashi Vishwanath Dham has been decorated with flowers for its inaugural ceremony.” All arrangements have been completed, he added.Rajbahadur Patel, a resident of Khajuri in Varanasi, said, “No one thought that the Kashi Vishwanath temple complex could be made so grand by expanding it. But PM Modi has made it a reality.” Ballu Vijay Yadav, who runs a tea stall in Pandeypur area and named it the NaMo tea stall in 2014, said, “Kashi Vishwanath Dham is divine, spiritual, and grand. The devotees, including kanwarias, will not have to wait for hours for darshan of Baba Kashi Vishwanath because the KV Corridor is spacious and sprawling. It is a gift to the devotees, including kanwarias.”Ravi Gupta, a resident of Pandeypur, said KV Corridor has added to the glory of Sanatan Dharma (Hinduism).Vivek Singh Raghuvanshi, resident of Tewar village in Cholapur area of Varanasi, expressed happiness over construction of the KV Corridor.“It will make pilgrimage comfortable and thus will boost religious tourism,” he said.Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said tight security arrangements have been put in place in the entire city for the inaugural ceremony.The prime minister will witness Ganga aarti at around 6pm on Monday.The next day, he will preside over a conference of the chief ministers of BJP-ruled states on the Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) campus.The conclave will provide an opportunity to share governance-related best practices and is in line with the Prime Minister’s vision of furthering the team India spirit, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kv-corridor-will-add-to-kashi-s-spiritual-vibrancy-says-pm-modi-101639334165077.html
13-12-2021||Mumbai||Congress to contend with AIMIM in upcoming polls||Mumbai While parties like the Trinamool Congress are aggressively poaching the support bases of the Congress, the Grand Old Party will also have to contend with the presence of the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen in Maharashtra. Next month, the AIMIM will soft-launch its campaign for the Maharashtra municipal polls with a rally at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai on 11 December, which will be addressed by party chief and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi and touch upon issues confronting the Muslim community.The AIMIM is attacking the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for allying with the pro-Hindutva Shiv Sena and for seeking the votes of the Muslims, yet dragging its feet on providing quotas for them. It is also demanding the revival of the waqf board and using its resources for the community’s welfare.The Congress in Maharashtra on Sunday alleged that the AIMIM and BJP are two sides of the same coin, a day after AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the party and the NCP at a rally in Mumbai for “failing” to implement a five per cent reservation for Muslims in the state. Senior Maharashtra Congress leader Naseem Khan on Sunday wondered why the Owaisi-led All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) remained “silent” on the Muslim quota issue when the BJP government was in power in Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019Led by the firebrand Owaisi brothers from Hyderabad, Asaduddin and MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi, the AIMIM appeals to a section of Muslims like the youth, who are of the opinion that the “secular” parties use them as a vote bank, while the community continued to be institutionally neglected and socially, politically and educationally backwards. The AIMIM, which contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), notched up its first victory outside Hyderabad, with its Imtiaz Jaleel breaching the saffron stronghold of Aurangabad.Congress-NCP leaders grumble that the VBA ate into the “secular” votes, causing their defeat in eight constituencies. Though the alliance fell apart later, the AIMIM won two seats in the Maharashtra assembly.“Between 2014 and 2019, the Congress and NCP were seeking that the erstwhile BJP government must introduce quotas for the Muslims. But, why are they dragging their feet now that they are in power?” questioned Jaleel, AIMIM MP from Aurangabad, and the party’s Maharashtra chief. The Bombay High Court (HC) had stayed the Maratha quota and reservations in jobs for Muslims that was introduced by the erstwhile Congress-NCP regime in 2014 but did not stay the decision to reserve 5% seats for Muslims in education. The BJP-Shiv government later approved a bill for Maratha reservations, but did not cover Muslims.The AIMIM is demanding a revival package for the Maharashtra State Board of Waqf (MSBW), which controls 93,000 acres of prime Muslim endowment lands across Maharashtra, but has few resources to protect it. “The board must get a one-time (revival) package. These vacant lands must be used for starting schools, commercial complexes to generate employment, and hostels for girls.” sought Jaleel, noting that most waqf lands are encumbered.Jaleel said they had originally planned to hold the rally as part of this campaign on 27 November, but was denied permissions by the police citing Covid restrictions. He stated that the Shiv Sena, Congress, NCP and the BJP, were conducting public meetings, even without the consent of the police. The AIMIM has hence threatened to hold the meeting at the BKC grounds even if the permissions do not come through.Jaleel said that while political motives could be attributed to this campaign being launched before the municipal elections, they were “raising genuine questions at the right time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-to-contend-with-aimim-in-upcoming-polls-101639333983708.html

13-12-2021||World||Calling it divisive, India votes against UNSC draft resolution on climate change||India on Monday voted against the adoption of a draft resolution by the UN Security Council (UNSC) on climate change, sharply criticising it as an attempt “to undermine the hard-won consensus which we reached in Glasgow” and would “sow the seeds of discord among the larger UN membership”.The draft resolution, which was written by UNSC members Ireland and Niger (penholders in this UNSC on climate change) and backed by 12 of the body’s 15 members, sought appropriate climate change discussions portraying climate as an issue that threatens international peace and security.India, China and Russia opposed and voted against it.“Climate change decisions are sought to be taken out of the wider international community represented in the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and given instead to the Security Council,” TS Tirumurti, Indian permanent representative to the UN, said explaining India’s opposition to the draft.He added: “Ironically, many of the UNSC members are the main contributors of climate change due to historical emissions. If the Security Council indeed takes over the responsibility on this issue, a few states will then have a free-hand in deciding on all climate-related issues. This is clearly neither desirable nor acceptable.”India is “second to none” when it comes to climate action and climate justice but the UN Security Council was not the platform for them.“Today’s UNSC Resolution attempts to undermine the hard-won consensus which we reached in Glasgow,” Tirumurti said, referring to the last UN climate change meet. “This resolution would only sow the seeds of discord among the larger UN membership.”The Indian ambassador to the UN went on to say that the draft resolution “sends a wrong message to the developing countries that instead of addressing their concerns and holding developed countries responsible for meeting their commitments under the UNFCCC, we are willing to be divided and side-tracked under the guise of security”.The way forward instead was to provide affordable access to climate finance and technologies. “Developed countries must provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest. It is necessary that climate finance be tracked with the same diligence as climate mitigation. And the reality, Mr President, is that the developed countries have fallen well short of their promises.”Developed countries had committed decades ago to contribute to a climate fund of $100 billion every year to support climate action in developing countries and they have not yet met the target - the latest available data for 2018 is $79 billion.“This is particularly important to recognise because today’s attempt to link climate with security really seeks to obfuscate lack of progress on critical issues under the UNFCCC process,” said Tirumurti.The ambassador listed out India’s commitment as laid out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Glasgow meet: India will take its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; it will meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030; it will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now till 2030; cut carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45%; and achieve Net Zero goal by 2070.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calling-it-divisive-india-votes-against-unsc-draft-resolution-on-climate-change-101639416909654.html

13-12-2021||World||China reports 1st Omicron case, outbreak of Delta subvariant||The first case of the Omicron Covid-19 variant infection in the mainland was detected in the northern city of Tianjin on Monday night, health authorities said.The infection was discovered in a traveller who arrived in the city from overseas on December 9, Chinese official media reported, adding that the patient is currently being treated in isolation in a city hospital.Separately, a sub-strain of the Covid-19 Delta variant has triggered a new cluster of cases in eastern China’s industrial powerhouse province of Zhejiang, causing many of the 190 cases in a week, locking down more than 500,000 residents and shutting down factories.Several infections diagnosed until Monday afternoon were of the Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4, prompting large-scale travel restrictions in the province, mass nucleic acid tests with more 52,000 people sent to centralised isolation.Zhejiang reported a total of 192 locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms during the December 6-13 period, official numbers showed on Monday, marking the province’s first domestic cluster outbreak this year.“The whole-genome sequencing and analysis found that the cases in the three cities (Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing) were caused by the Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4. It is more transmissible and carries a higher viral load than the original novel coronavirus, said an official with the Zhejiang provincial centre for disease control and prevention,” official news agency Xinhua reported.“Local authorities have imposed restrictions on public gatherings and travelling out of the province to prevent the virus from spreading further,” the report said.“The province has brought a total of 540,430 people under quarantine control, of which 52,824 were in centralized isolation, 21,835 were under home health observation, and 465,771 were under routine health monitoring,” a state media report said.More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies said they had suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of China’s eastern Zhejiang province in response to local government’s tightened Covid-19 curbs, causing their share prices to plunge, Reuters reported on Monday.China reported 80 new locally-transmitted cases with symptoms on the mainland for December 12, including 74 identified in Zhejiang.Separately, the city of Manzhouli, located at China-Russia border, in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reported 537 local cases during the latest resurgence.Of these, 507 were undergoing treatment, and 25 were discharged from the hospital.China has reported a total number of 99,681 Covid-19 cases and 4,636 deaths from the infection. The national health commission (NHC) on Monday said that more than 2.61 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses had been administered in the country as of Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-1st-omicron-case-outbreak-of-delta-subvariant-101639403229330.html
13-12-2021||World||UK reports its first Omicron death as variant continues to spread rapidly||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday confirmed the first death due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus as Britain expanded its booster programme for all aged 30 and above. Johnson told reporters that “at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron”. The confirmation comes amid reports of the new variant of concern causing mild disease as compared to the Delta, which is currently the dominant strain globally.The World Health Organization said in a technical briefing that Omicron is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms. The UN health agency report stated that the Omicron variant has been detected in at least 63 countries as of December 9."So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus - I think that's something we need to set on one side - and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population," Johnson said.UK's National Health Service expanded its vaccine booster programme from Monday after the country's health security agency found that the additional dose of the Covid vaccine significantly restores protection against mild disease caused by Omicron. But users are facing issues with the booking system amid high demand for booster shots.“The COVID vaccine booking service is currently facing extremely high demand so is operating a queueing system. For users aged 18-29, please be aware that booking opens on Wednesday 15 Dec. For all others experiencing waits, we would advise trying again later today or tomorrow,” UK NHS wrote on Twitter.Meanwhile, a new modelling study has projected up to 74,800 deaths in the United Kingdom by April 2022 due to the Omicron variant. The study suggests that Omicron has the potential to cause a wave of transmission that could lead to a higher number of infections and hospitalisations than during January 2021 if no additional control measures are implemented over and above the current ‘Plan B’ policy in England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-its-first-omicron-death-as-variant-continues-to-spread-rapidly-101639396788515.html
13-12-2021||World||Study projects up to 75,000 deaths in UK by April end due to Omicron, boosters may not be enough||The Omicron variant of coronavirus could cause between 24,700 to 74,800 deaths in the United Kingdom by April end, according to a new modelling study. The researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine suggest that the new variant of concern, which was first identified in South Africa, has the potential to cause a wave of transmission that could lead to a higher number of infections and hospitalisations than those witnessed during January 2021 in the event of no additional control measures over and above the current ‘Plan B’ policy in England.The researchers have projected the levels of infections, hospital admissions and Covid-related death for all scenarios based on the measures taken by the government. Citing the “most optimistic scenario” which includes low immune escape and high effectiveness of boosters, the study suggests that the wave of infection from Omicron could witness a peak of over 2,000 daily hospital admissions. It has projected 175,000 hospitalisations and 24,700 deaths by April 30, 2022, for this scenario.In case of high immune escape of Omicron and lower effectiveness of boosters, the wave of infection could lead to a peak in hospital admissions around twice as high as the peak seen in January 2021. The researchers, considering the most pessimistic scenario, have projected 492,000 hospitalisations and 74,800 deaths by April. They estimate stronger measures may be required to keep the peak of hospital admissions due to Omicron below the January 2021 peak.“In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of Omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home. However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed,” Dr Rosanna Barnard, the co-author of the study, said in a statement.“Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough,” Barnard added.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and currently available in preprint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-projects-up-to-75-000-deaths-in-uk-by-april-end-due-to-omicron-boosters-may-not-be-enough-101639391225420.html

"I assure the nation that no-one will leave our office with any reason to be upset."He appealed to people to stay away until the office is operational again."I am really sorry about this, I am upset because people are facing hardship. They're wasting their money and standing here uselessly," Haqqani said."The office is closed, our systems are not operational."A number of provincial passport offices are still open and officials in Kabul are processing around 2,000-3,000 passports from these offices each day, he said, but it was still unclear when the Kabul office would reopen.As well as the equipment issues, Haqqani said officials were working on stamping out corruption and rooting out the so-called 'Commissionkar' - commission agents who promise to ensure swift treatment of applications for a fee."We have arrested bribe takers, from inside and outside the office," he said. "We will use any possible way to clean the country of bribe takers everywhere."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-passport-office-head-urges-patience-as-anxious-crowds-keep-gathering-101639373883888.html
13-12-2021||World||Two weeks into Omicron outbreak: What do we know so far||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been found in 63 countries so far and will surpass Delta in spreading speed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.“As of December 9, 2021, cases of human infections with this variant have been identified in 63 countries across all six WHO regions," a statement by the WHO said.The United Nations health agency said, based on preliminary data, the Omicron variant might reduce the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines but added that this strain is less dangerous than Delta.WHO designated variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern on November 26. Is Omicron spreading fast?According to the WHO, Omicron appears to have a growth advantage over Delta. “It is spreading faster than the Delta variant in South Africa where Delta circulation was low, but also appears to spread more quickly than the Delta variant in other countries where the incidence of Delta is high, such as in the United Kingdom,” it said.The reproduction rate of Omicron in Gauteng, where South Africa’s outbreak is currently centred, is over 3, which means that every infected person on average infects three more. Cases in South Africa are rising at a near-record pace, and the rate of increase has outstripped South Africa’s three earlier waves.Also read | Israel imposing travel ban for Britain, Denmark, Belgium over Omicron spreadAccording to a study in Japan, Omicron is 4.2 times more transmissible than delta. Epidemiologist John Edmunds has said the mutated virus may be spreading faster in England than in South Africa, with cases in the UK possibly topping 60,000 a day by Christmas, according to Bloomberg.Are infections severe? Doctors have reported Omicron patients with fatigue and headaches and little more in a contrast to racing pulse rates and respiratory problems in those infected with the Delta variant.South Africa’s three biggest private hospital operators say cases are much milder than in earlier waves. There are few people on oxygen or ventilators and only a slight uptick in deaths.Also read | Omicron cases in India at 38; 6 states and 2 Union territories report infections“There are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron. While preliminary findings from South Africa suggest it may be less severe than Delta, and all cases reported in the EU/EEA to date have been mild or asymptomatic, it remains unclear to what extent Omicron may be inherently less virulent. More data are needed to understand the severity profile,” according to WHO.Do vaccines work against Omicron?Research has shown that Omicron is able to largely, but not completely, evade the antibodies generated in response to the inoculation. A study by Pfizer has also backed this up.“Preliminary evidence, and the considerably altered antigenic profile of the Omicron spike protein, suggests a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission associated with Omicron,” WHO also said.Also read | UK raises Covid alert level as Omicron advances“There is some preliminary evidence that the incidence of reinfection has increased in South Africa, which may be associated with humoral (antibody-mediated) immune evasion,” it added.In addition, preliminary evidence from a few studies of limited sample size has shown that sera obtained from vaccinated and those previously infected had lower neutralisation activity than with any other circulating variant of concern and the ancestral strain.Does it affect children differently?Initial hospital admissions in South Africa saw a higher number of children under the age of 5 than previously. However, most only stay in hospital for a short time, and according to South African health minister Joe Phaahla, there are no reports of respiratory complications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-weeks-into-omicron-outbreak-what-do-we-know-so-far-101639374136574.html
13-12-2021||World||Alibaba fires woman who accused boss of rape in #MeToo setback||Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has fired a woman who accused a manager of sexual assault, a surprise move that came just months after China’s e-commerce leader admitted bungling its initial response to the allegation.The employee surnamed Zhou told the Dahe Daily Alibaba had terminated her for spreading false information in August about being raped by a senior manager. She didn’t get any severance and was compensated up to the date of termination on Nov. 25., according to a screenshot of an official memo and an interview with Zhou published by the central Chinese newspaper.Zhou’s termination caps a months-long scandal that played out across social media and ignited intense debate about the excessive drinking perpetuated by Chinese corporations and discrimination against women at tech firms. The employee touched off a furor in August when she published an 8,000-word account accusing her manager and a client of sexual assault after an alcohol-fueled dinner during a work trip. Her account -- including a video of her handing out leaflets while shouting at the top of her voice in the company cafeteria -- went viral and turned China’s No. 2 company into the highest-profile symbol of abuses regarded as prevalent throughout businesses and tech firms, the by-product of an environment that often prioritizes achievement over culture. The Alibaba manager surnamed Wang was fired and two senior executives at the e-commerce giant resigned as Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang called the company’s handling of the incident a “humiliation.”Alibaba spokespeople didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment on the report. Zhou wasn’t immediately available for comment.Public debate around her accusations has so far been freely allowed online, an unusual concession for a country that’s fiercely censored previous #MeToo discourse, including tennis star Peng Shuai’s allegation she was coerced into sex by a senior government official. Posts carrying the hashtag “Female Alibaba employee fired” had attracted more than 680 million views as of Monday morning.    Zhou’s firing provoked a broad range of responses on social media over the weekend, with those decrying her termination vying against others who pointed to inconsistencies in her account that came to light during a police investigation. “This was blown out of proportion and caused severe harm to Alibaba and society,” one post read. Others questioned Alibaba’s move. “As an internet giant, what Alibaba did was inconsiderate. Firing the woman caused new problems. Why didn’t Alibaba reflect on its own management flaws?”In September, prosecutors dropped their case against Wang, saying he wouldn’t face criminal charges. Wang’s behavior didn’t constitute a criminal offense and he was held under the category of just “forcible indecency,” which carried a maximum penalty of 15-days detention, they said.Police reports also appeared to refute elements of Zhou’s account, including her assertion she’d found an open pack of condoms under her bed. The report re-ignited debate around Zhou’s account, splitting public opinion about the extent to which she was a victim.Alibaba in recent months has taken a hard line against information leaks associated with the case. It dismissed 10 staffers for leaking her accusations, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The company felt they violated very strict policies against exposing content carried on employee forums, the people said.While many details of the incident remain unclear, Zhou’s ordeal has triggered what many say is a long overdue examination of the ways Chinese women are too often treated at work: overlooked, objectified, forced to take part in male-dominated rituals like drinking with clients and brushed aside when reporting abuse.Zhou told the Dahe Daily she received many messages from women saying they too had been sexually assaulted and forced to drink in the workplace, but most stayed quiet to avoid repercussions.Alibaba has since moved to establish better protections for its employees. It’s created a hotline and a team of senior women executives dedicated to investigating sexual harassment complaints. In a commentary about the incident, the Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog warned that “under the table rules” such as forced drinking for business purposes may lead to crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alibaba-fires-woman-who-accused-boss-of-rape-in-metoo-setback-101639368187860.html

13-12-2021||World||US tornadoes: 8 factory workers dead, 8 missing at Kentucky factory||Eight people are confirmed dead at a Kentucky candle factory that was hit by a tornado and another eight remain missing, but dozens more have been accounted for, a company spokesman said Sunday, raising hope that the toll from a Midwest twister outbreak won't be as high as first feared.While officials initially said 40 of 110 workers at Mayfield Consumer Products had been rescued, spokesman Bob Ferguson said more than 90 people had now been located.While eight remained missing, there was hope they might be OK.“Many of the employees were gathered in the tornado shelter and after the storm was over they left the plant and went to their homes,” he said.“With the power out and no landline they were hard to reach initially. We're hoping to find more of those eight unaccounted as we try their home residences.”Workers on the night shift at Mayfield Consumer Products were in the middle of the holiday rush, cranking out candles, when a tornado closed in on the factory and the word went out: "Duck and cover.”Autumn Kirks pulled down her safety goggles and took shelter, tossing aside wax and fragrance buckets to make room. She glanced away from her boyfriend, Lannis Ward, and when she looked back, he was gone.On Sunday, he was among scores of people feared dead in the rubble of the factory and elsewhere across the state.Gov Andy Beshear initially warned Sunday that the state's overall death toll from the outbreak of twisters Friday night in Mayfield and other communities could exceed 100. But later in the day, he said the number might turn out to be half that, citing details from the candle company.“We are praying that maybe original estimates of those we have lost were wrong. If so, it's going to be pretty wonderful," the governor said.Kirks and others could only wait in agony for news of their loved ones amid the rescue effort.“Not knowing is worse than knowing right now," she said. "I'm trying to stay strong. It's very hard right now.”Kentucky was the worst-hit state by far in an unusual mid-December swarm of twisters across the Midwest and the South that leveled entire communities and left at least 14 people dead in four other states.Forty people who were inside the candle factory were pulled out soon after the twister struck, authorities said. The number of people who had been in the factory was initially put at 110. Rescuers had to crawl over the dead to get to the living at a disaster scene that smelled like scented candles.But by the time churchgoers gathered Sunday morning to pray for the lost, more than 24 hours had elapsed since anyone had been found alive. Instead, crews recovered pieces of peoples' lives — a backpack, a pair of shoes and a cellphone with 27 missed messages were among the items.Layers of steel and cars 15 feet deep were on top of what used to be the factory roof, the governor said.“We're going to grieve together, we're going to dig out and clean up together, and we will rebuild and move forward together. We're going to get through this," Beshear said. “We're going to get through this together because that is what we do.”Four twisters hit the state in all, including one with an extraordinarily long path of about 200 miles (322 kilometres) long, authorities said. The outbreak was all the more remarkable because it came at a time of year when cold weather normally limits tornadoes.Eleven people were reported killed in and around Bowling Green alone.“I've got towns that are gone, that are just, I mean gone. My dad's hometown — half of it isn't standing," Breshear said of Dawson Springs.He said that going door to door in search of victims is out of the question in the hardest-hit areas: “There are no doors.”“We're going to have over 1,000 homes that are gone, just gone,” the governor said.With afternoon high temperatures forecast only in the 40s, tens of thousands of people were without power. About 300 National Guard members went house to house, checking on people and helping to remove debris. Cadaver dogs searched for victims.Kirks said she and her boyfriend were about 10 feet apart in a hallway when someone said to take cover. Suddenly, she saw sky and lightning where a wall had been, and Ward had vanished.“I remember taking my eyes off of him for a second, and then he was gone. I don't know where he went, don't have any idea,” she said.Kirks was at a ministry center where people gathered to seek information about the missing.“It was indescribable,” Pastor Joel Cauley said of the disaster scene. “It was almost like you were in a twilight zone. You could smell the aroma of candles, and you could hear the cries of people for help. The candle smells and all the sirens is not something I ever expected to experience at the same time.”The outbreak also killed at least six people in Illinois, where an Amazon distribution centre in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri.Debris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted sheet metal, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows were blown out and roofs torn off the buildings that were still standing.In the shadows of their crumpled church sanctuaries, two congregations in Mayfield came together on Sunday to pray for those who were lost. Members of First Christian Church and First Presbyterian Church met in a parking lot surrounded by rubble, piles of broken bricks and metal.“Our little town will never be the same, but we're resilient,” Laura McClendon said. “We'll get there, but it's going to take a long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tornadoes-8-factory-workers-dead-8-missing-from-at-kentucky-factory-101639358715359.html

But UNSC is not the place to discuss either issue. In fact, an attempt to do so appears to be motivated by a desire to evade responsibility in the appropriate forum and divert the world's attention from an unwillingness to deliver where it counts,” Tirumurti said.India is second to none when it comes to climate action and climate justice.

And we will do so at the right place, the UNFCCC,” he said.He added that developed countries must provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest, saying it is necessary that climate finance be tracked with the same diligence as climate mitigation.

All responsibility will be mine. The only condition is that the subject of comedy will be Digvijaya Singh. Sanghis (RSS cadre) should not object to this!! Don't be afraid!! Give the date and time as per your convenience. All your conditions are accepted," Singh wrote and tagged a news report related to Kamra.Sharma said Singh is inviting Pakistan's terrorists to his home for a biryani party. “This doesn't mean that we all will accept it. Those who disrespect Lord Ram and Sita and our country will not be allowed to hold a show in Bhopal and MP,” Sharma said and accused the Congress and Singh of indulging in divisive politics.Last month, Faruqui was denied a nod to hold a show in the Karnataka capital amid protests by some right-wing outfits. A few days later, Kamra, a vocal critic of the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, said his stand-up shows, scheduled to be held in Bengaluru, were cancelled after the organisers received threats.Earlier this year, Faruqui had spent a month in jail in Indore after a BJP MLA's son lodged an FIR in January accusing him of hurting religious sentiments through his show.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-calls-comedians-kunal-kamra-munawar-faruqui-pakistan-s-terrorists-101639413563215.html

Out of these 21 airports, eight airports have been operationalized. The government also said that 154 Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) airports, including 14 water aerodromes and 36 helipads, have been identified for development/upgradation, under the Udey Desh ka Aam Naagarik (UDAN) scheme, so far.Replying to MP Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Gen VK Singh, minister of state for civil aviation, said that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has taken up development of new airports and expansion and up-gradation of existing airports at the cost of around ₹25,000 crores in the next four-five years. These plans include expansion and modification of existing terminals, new terminals, expansion or strengthening of existing runways, aprons, Airport Navigation Services (ANS) control towers, technical blocks. Singh also informed that three Public-Private Partnership (PPP) airports at Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru have undertaken major expansion plans to the tune of ₹30,000 crores by 2025. The government had formulated the Greenfield Airport Policy, 2008, to provide guidelines for the establishment of new greenfield airports in the country. As per the policy, an airport developer (including the state governments), is required to send a proposal to the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA).There is a two-stage process for the approval of the proposal ‘site-clearance’ stage and ‘in-principle’ approval stage. As per this policy, MoCA receives proposals from the state governments (or airport developers) for establishing airports. Singh said, “MoCA has so far accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for setting up of 21 greenfield airports across the country namely Mopa (Goa), Navi Mumbai, Shirdi and Sindhudurg in Maharashtra, Kalaburagi, Bijapur, Hassan and Shimoga in Karnataka, Datia (Gwalior) in Madhya Pradesh, Kushinagar and Noida (Jewar) in Uttar Pradesh, Dholera and Hirasar in Gujarat, Karaikal in Puducherry, Dagadarthi, Bhogapuram and Oravackal in Andhra Pradesh, Durgapur in West Bengal, Pakyong in Sikkim, Kannur in Kerala and Hollongi (Itanagar) in Arunachal Pradesh.”“Out of these eight airports namely Durgapur, Shirdi, Sindhudurg, Pakyong, Kannur, Kalaburagi, Oravakal and Kushinagar have been operationalized,” Singh concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civil-aviation-ministry-receives-in-principle-approval-for-setting-up-21-greenfield-airports-across-india-101639410610964.html

13-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Dec 14, 1967 - Lok Sabha approves Language Bill||After a long and furious debate, the Lok Sabha today heard Home Minister Y. B. Chavan reiterate that the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill was the most acceptable and balanced compromise possible in the present circumstances, before approving it by 224 votes to 75. Among the Congress Party members, Seth Govind Das, a conscientious objector, voted against the Bill. The DMK also voted against the Bill on the ground that the assurances given by Mr Nehru and Mr Lal Bahadur Shastri had been watered down and that “a reappraisal of the Constitution” was necessary. Replying to the general debate, Mr Chavan said the many differences of approach to the issue made a compromise necessary, but added that the purpose of the Bill was limited. He declared with widely appreciated emphasis, that Hindi would of course be the sole official language of the country eventually, since only one of the Indian languages could be given such a status and since Hindi was the most widely-spoken Indian language. He, however, added, that English would have to be retained as associate official language for some time in order to accommodate, those States which were not immediately prepared to accept Hindi alone in that status, and that the rest of the country would do well to show some understanding of their predicament.This, the Home Minister, said was the only way to make practicable the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and the assurances given by Mr Nehru and Mr Lal Bahadur Shastri. There was no question of amending the Constitution to make English the associate official language. This, he said, was not warranted by the country’s traditions and history. An Act of Parliament was sufficient to retain it as a provisional link language until Hindi became unanimously acceptable. Rightful PlaceHe assured the House that energetic efforts would be made to improve Hindi and develop it to a point where it could assume its rightful place. Mere, legislation, Mr Chavan said, did not change or develop a language- it must grow. Among the members who spoke notably in the discussion today, Mr Mohammed Ismail (Muslim League-Kerala) drove home a point by remarking that since Hindi protagonists in Uttar Pradesh itself were not giving Urdu its rightful place and repeatedly promised secondary place to it in that State, the sincerity of their assurances to other Indian languages in the non-Hindi States was open to doubt. Mr M. Maran, (DMK), who made his maiden speech today, contended that Hindi was as foreign to Tamils as English. Mr Rabi Ray (SSP) made part of his speech in Oriya to demonstrate its closeness to Hindi. The Lok Sabha is expected to take up clause by clause reading of the Bill tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisdaydec-14-1967-lok-sabha-approves-language-bill-101639406770439.html

13-12-2021||India||Delhi airport installs e-boarding gates. Here's how it will work||The Delhi airport has installed e-boarding gates across all three terminals for contactless and seamless travelling amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. GMR Group-led Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said it has rolled out the e-boarding facility for department passengers across all flights. The gates have been set up at Terminal 3 and Terminal 2 and the installation at Terminal 1 is underway.The contactless e-gates, empowered by touchless technologies and boarding card scanners, allow passengers to flash their physical or e-boarding cards and verify their flight details. After the verification process at the e-gates, the air travellers can proceed to security checks. Passengers carrying wide luggage or reduced mobility (PRM) can pass through it easily, and those carrying only hand baggage can walk through the normal lane e-gates, according to the company.“Passengers who have verified their boarding passes by scanning at the e-gates can simply walk past the e-boarding gates for security checks and then board a flight without having to show their documents again," said DIAL.The company said e-boarding gates have reduced the transaction time by 50 per cent which has resulted in lower queues. Apart from shortening the boarding time, it also allows people to avoid touching facility surfaces and people to people interaction in line with Covid protocol.Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, DIAL CEO, said that the company is in constant pursuit of enhancing the passenger experience, reported ANI.“Though, the onset of the global pandemic has made it more challenging to meet the travelers' expectations as health and safety concerns have increased. DIAL has responded to the challenge and set a benchmark with several innovative solutions in place, e-boarding gates being one of the unique technological solutions installed at the airport. The in-house team of DIAL performed several trials at Delhi Airport, keeping in view the Covid-19 guidelines issued by various government agencies. Our sole aim is to keep our passengers safe at any cost," ANI quoted Jaipuriar as saying.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-airport-installs-e-boarding-gates-here-s-how-it-will-work-101639396480268.html

Uttar Pradesh is set to see the next assembly election early next year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Varanasi on a two-day visit- where he inaugurated the first phase of the mega Kashi Vishwanath corridor project. Besides chief minister Yogi Adityanath, his counterparts of other BJP-ruled states are in the city to take part in a CM's conclave. Yadav also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in the state with his oft-repeated claim that all recent inaugurations were launched when he was in power.#WATCH | "It's good that the programmes are one-month long (for Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi).

13-12-2021||India||Retail inflation in November rises to 4.91%, marginally up from 4.48% in October||India's retail inflation accelerated in November, led by a rise in food prices, but remained within the medium-term target of the central bank, strengthening views that the bank could keep interest rates on hold at its next meeting in February.Consumer prices rose 4.91% in November from the same month last year, speeding up from October's 4.48% but lower than the consensus Reuters poll forecast of 5.10%, Ministry of Statistics data showed on Monday.The Reserve Bank of India left interest rates on hold last week, saying growth was a priority as it warned of risks from inflation and the new Omircon variant on the economic recovery.India's economy expanded 8.4% in the September quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace among major economies, but economists say the pandemic situation is a wild card.The central bank expects retail inflation at 5.1% for October-December period and 5.7% for January-March quarter in the current financial year.Food prices, which contribute to nearly half of the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.87% year-on-year in November, compared with 0.85% a month before. Prices of edible oil rose nearly 30% from a year ago period while vegetable prices fell by 13.6%.Inflation has been within the RBI's 2-6% target range in recent months, and a cut in fuel tax last month by the federal government and softening of global crude oil prices have dampened inflationary pressures.Economists, have, however warned of risks of uptick in headline inflation over the coming months as companies pass on rising input costs to consumers amid economic recovery."CPI inflation is set to rise further over the coming months and the risks are stacked to the upside," said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.However, any rise in inflation is unlikely to trigger monetary tightening by the central bank, he said.Retail fuel prices rose 13.35% in November year-on-year compared to 14.35% in the previous month, the data showed.Annual core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was estimated at between 6.08% and 6.2% in November, according to three economists, compared with 6% to 6.1% in the previous month.The government does not release core inflation numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retail-inflation-in-november-rises-to-4-91-govt-101639397916141.html

Addressing a gathering inside the Kashi Vishwanath complex, the prime minister said every Indian, for him, is a part of God, and, thus, wanted to ask them for “something”, not for him, but for the country.“I want three resolutions for our country, not for myself - cleanliness, creation and sustained efforts for a self-reliant India,” he told the gathering which included Hindu seers.Terming cleanliness a 'way of life', Modi called for people’s participation in this enterprise, especially in the Namami Gange Mission. Taking about the second resolution, PM Modi said Indians had lost their faith in their own creation because of the long period of slavery.“Today, from this thousand-year-old Kashi, I call upon every countryman - create with full confidence, innovate, do it in an innovative way,” he added.PM Modi inaugurates Phase 1 of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in VaranasiThe prime minister said the third resolution is necessary to intensify efforts towards ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. He concluded his speech by saying India is in its 75th year of independence and “we have to work now on how India will be when it celebrates 100 years of independence.”During his address, the prime minister highlighted that how the invaders tried to destroy the city but others rose to safeguard it. If there is an Aurangzeb, PM Modi said, Shivaji is also there. “If any Salar Masood comes, then brave warriors like King Suheldev make him taste the might of India’s unity.

13-12-2021||India||Panel advises government to keep ban on approving new engineering colleges||A committee set up to look for ways to overhaul engineering education in the county in 2018 had earlier advised the government to put a moratorium on granting approvals to new engineering colleges for two years starting 2020, and now in its interim report, it has recommended continuing the freeze barring some exceptions, the union ministry of education told the Parliament on Monday. The committee cited low enrolment in engineering and diploma programmes across the country as the reason behind the recommendation, the ministry said. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 2018 constituted the committee headed by BVR Mohan Reddy, the chairman of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad, to recommend short term and medium term prospective plans for engineering education in India. The development came after AICTE observed that seats were lying vacant in several engineering colleges.In 2019, the Reddy committee advised AICTE to stop setting up new colleges from the academic year 2020 and “review” the creation of new capacity every two years after that. The committee observed that the capacity utilisation in engineering colleges during 2017-18 in undergraduate and postgraduate level was at 49.8% . “The Committee has held three meetings on 18.10.2021, 10.11.2021 & 30.11.2021 and reviewed the Engineering Capacity, Enrolment and Placement Data over the last three years in Engineering Institutions. In the light of low enrolments into the Engineering and Diploma programmes across the country, the Committee in its interim report submitted in December, 2021 recommended to continue the moratorium on approving new Engineering Colleges in the country barring a few exceptions,” education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in the statement.Also Read | Clarify if government will recognise cryptos or not: Adhir Ranjan tells CentreThe committee’s recommendation has come at a time when engineering colleges in India recorded a 10-year-low in the number of seats being offered this year. Officials had cited closure of over 340 colleges between 2018-19 and 2020-21 and the ban on opening of no new colleges as the reason behind the drop. As per the data presented by the minister, the total approved intake in the AICTE approved engineering institutions has declined from 26,95,333 from academic year 2012-13 to 23,66,728 in academic year 2021-22. The intake was 24,42,948 in 2020-21, and 25,39,682 in 2019-20. As per the data provided by the ministry, the enrolment remained low over the last three years. For instance, against the intake capacity of 24,42,948 in 2020-21, only 12,75,880 enrolment were reported. Similarly, in 2019-20, only 14,10,683 students enroled against the 25,39,682 seats, and in 2018-19, only 14,16,319 out of 27,11,068 available seats were filled.

The government should clarify in the Parliament whether it is going to recognise cryptocurrency or not,” said Chowdhury in Lok Sabha.He questioned that if the prime minister’s Twitter handle can be compromised, how can the government ensure safety and security of the citizens’ Twitter handles. “This is a serious issue...

13-12-2021||India||Darool Uloom asks Saudi Arabia to rethink decision to ban Tablighi Jamaat||Islamic seminary Darool Uloom Deoband has condemned the reported decision of Saudi Arabia to ban Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jamaat after denouncing it as a "gateway of terrorism".Chief Rector of the seminary, Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, has asked Saudi Arabia to rethink its decision, saying otherwise a wrong message may be conveyed to Muslims.This is for the first time that the Islamic seminary of Deoband has openly condemned the Saudi government.The religious affairs ministry of Saudi Arabia had recently dubbed the Tablighi Jamaat as a gateway of terrorism and banned it.Prominent Muslim activist Zafar Sareshwala told PTI, "I am surprised by the decision of Saudi Arabia as the Tabligi Jamaat was always an antidote to any extremist idea. The Jamaat maintained its disapproval of all modern Jihadi movements. Even the Taliban has spoken many times against the Tablighi Jamaat".Saudi Arabia's description of the Tablighi as a gateway of terrorism is unbelievable and unacceptable, he said.In a video message from the UK, Sameeruddin Qasmi, Spokesperson of the Tabligi Jamaat of Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz, said, "It is a big allegation on the Tabligi Jamaat. It has no connection with terrorism. Tablighi Jamaat is the group that stops terrorism, condemn terrorism and disowns terrorism.""We don't allow anyone to speak against any religion, community and country. We talk only for five pillars of Islam, none of our men have ever been found involved in any terrorist activities", he asserted."The Saudi government might have been mislead," he added.Mohammad Miyan , the member of one of the factions of the Tablighi Jamaat, said, "Our Jamaats are working all over the world. Even in Saudi Arabia, Jamaat members are working to bring the Muslims on the right path as taught by the prophet. We will not comment over the decision of Saudi government, but our Jamaats will continue to work in Saudi Arabia".Maulana Fakhrul Hasan Khan , a senior faculty in Darul Uloom Nadwa, said, "Till now we have received the news of ban only through the media. We will contact our people in Saudi Arabia before reaching any conclusion".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darool-uloom-asks-saudi-arabia-to-rethink-decision-to-ban-tablighi-jamaat-101639387283000.html
13-12-2021||India||Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is everything standard Paperwhite isn’t||There are two sides to the Kindle e-reader debate. For some it brings a specialised experience with an unparalleled sense of transcendence and for others it sits uneasily in a world where Apple iPad, Android tablet or even a phone can fill that role, in a way. Something to ponder over if you are not tethered to the belief that real books are the only way to read. That neatly takes us to the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, the 2021 iteration, which is the fourth Kindle model in the line-up. Fourth, in a way at least. If we don’t weave this in as a variant of the existing Paperwhite—ideally, we shouldn’t, because there’s enough that’s been added to make this feel like a new e-reader. The price tag of ₹17,999 for the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition pegs this at a serious ₹4,000 premium over the standard Paperwhite e-reader. Your call on whether this is worth an upgraded display (read auto adjusting illumination) and wireless charging (hello, smartphones!). Just like the plain-Jane Paperwhite, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition also has a 6.8-inch glare-free Paperwhite display with integrated lighting and 16-level grey scale (this isn’t a colour display). Yet, it isn’t the same as before. The peak brightness has been boosted, which should help with the outdoor reading on a winter’s afternoon when you want to enjoy some sunshine. This type of a display is anyway very resistant to reflections and ambience induced glares, which really helps with the comfort of reading. The other big addition is the auto-adjusting lighting (essentially, this is auto brightness), something the less expensive Paperwhite does not have. It is a bit surprising that a feature as basic as this, still isn’t a standard fixture across the Kindle line-up. it should be. The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition and the more expensive Kindle Oasis (around ₹21,999) have this, the more affordable Kindle Paperwhite (around ₹13,999) and the entry-spec Kindle (around ₹7,999) miss out in the present generations. It isn’t a new feature and is aimed at course correction. Setting this up will be easier too. It isn’t entirely pleasant to type on a Kindle screen when there is the underlying urgency to set up a sparkling new e-reader and get started with a book that cannot wait anymore. Now, your phone can help you get started, via the Kindle app on your phone. It is simpler and gets you to the doorstep of a world of reading quicker—you can download all your Kindle books from the cloud, complete with the last progress stage. The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition upgrades the storage to 32GB, a serious step forward from 8GB on the standard Paperwhite. If you’re upgrading from a Kindle that you’ve held on for a while, you’d appreciate the new interface as well. That’s the biggest visual overhaul the Kindle interface has received in years. The idea is to make it more intuitive, and to a large extent, it has worked. Home and Library are now easier to identify tabs on the bottom of the screen, while a more smartphone-esque ‘swipe down to access controls’ gesture is now part of the Kindle experience too. Transition animations still exhibit some amount of sluggishness from time to time, but there is a definite speeding up of navigation as you move around the Home and Library options, as well as the menus. Also Read: Electric vehicles in India: Miles to go, but the journey has begunKindle and battery life have always evoked a sense of relief. These humble e-readers don’t need to be charged often, and last weeks (not days or hours) on a single charge. The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition now gets wireless charging as well. Theoretically, it will work with any Qi standard wireless charger you may already be using for your iPhone or Android phone. Yet, owing to the larger size of the Kindle, you’d find this works better on flatter-design wireless chargers (such as the SanDisk iXpand 15-watt wireless charger) than the ones which have a slightly curved back, designed more for the phones they are meant to work best with (such as the OnePlus Warp Charge 50 wireless charger). Speaking of the battery life, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition should last as much as 10-weeks on a single charge. That summarises the advantage of a specialised reading tool in a world where phones and tablets have become the all-in-ones. Try going on a binge reading session on your phone, and the eyes will hurt after a while. And on a tablet, you’ll be hunting for the charger after 7-8 hours of reading. The thing is, you would be expecting us to say the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is a giant leap forward for the Kindle e-readers. It isn’t. Think of this as a more capable version of the 2021 edition of the Kindle Paperwhite. That brings with it some bragging rights. If you’ve already ordered yourself a Paperwhite, there could be that sense of regret, that you’ve just missed out on a lot of future proof features. That said, the basics of a Kindle don’t change. They simply evolve. Even if you have an older Kindle and don’t really feel the need for more storage or auto brightness controls or wireless charging, you would do well to hold on to what you have. But if you must have the very best the Kindle has to offer, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition should definitely be what you splurge on. In fact, this has more than the pricier Kindle Oasis too.

The scale contains five age brackets (with a minimum age of 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100 years), and the additional quantum increases with age (from 20% to 100% of the pension or family pension).

However, he acknowledges himself as a Hindu only during elections. He will wear janaeu during elections. He will visit temples and go for tourism during the elections. But when elections are not there, then he goes to beaches and has nothing to do with being a Hindu," Majumdar told ANI on Sunday."The people who claim themselves as Hindus are no less than the Ramayana's Ravana who came dressed in bhagwa clothes as an imposter to kidnap Sita," Majumdar added.Rahul Gandhi said on Sunday Hindutvavadis only want power and they are in power since 2014 as he urged people to throw them and bring back Hindus who follow the path of truth."Hindutvavadis spend their entire life in search of power. They want nothing but power and can do anything for it. They follow the path of 'Sattagrah' (search for power), not 'Satyagrah' (search for truth). This country is of Hindus, not of Hindutvavadis," Rahul Gandhi said at the Jaipur rally.Also read | ‘Attack me, I am not afraid’, says Rahul Gandhi on speech about Hindu, Hindutva“Who is Hindu? The one who embraces everybody fears nobody, and respects every religion, while a Hindutvavadi bows down before his fear," he added.“In Indian politics today, there is a competition between two words -- 'Hindu' and 'Hindutvavadi'.

But the country says that Rahul Gandhi is neither a Hindu, nor a Hindutvavadi, or a Hindustani. The reason is that a conspiracy is being run by Gandhi family to defame Hindu and Hindutva and compare it with terrorist organisations like Boko Haram and ISIS," Bhatia was quoted as saying by PTI.He also connecting the statements made by Congress leader in Rajasthan with the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. “These poisonous sentences are being spoken in view of the upcoming assembly elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh.

13-12-2021||India||PM Modi to inaugurate Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh on Monday to inaugurate Phase 1 of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, constructed at a cost of around ₹339 crore.Before the inauguration event at 1pm, PM Modi will visit the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and offer prayers, according to the statement by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).The PMO statement said the corridor is set to facilitate pilgrims, who had to encounter congested streets and surroundings with poor upkeep when they practised the age-old custom of taking a dip in the holy river. It will have an easily accessible pathway that will connect the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the Ganga, according to the statement.The project is spread over an area of about 5 lakh square feet—the earlier premise was limited to just around 3,000 square feet. The project involved the purchase and acquisition of more than 300 properties around the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.PM Modi will inaugurate 23 buildings in Phase 1 of the project, the PMO said in the statement. They will provide a variety of facilities to the pilgrims visiting Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple, including Yatri Suvidha Kendras, Tourist Facilitation Centre, Vedic Kendra, Mumukshu Bhavan, Bhogshala, City Museum, Viewing Gallery, Food Court, among others.The foundation stone of the project was laid by the Prime Minister on March 8, 2019. Since then, PM Modi has constantly monitored the work progress and also gave inputs and insights to improve the project and make it more accessible for the devotees, the PMO statement added.The Prime Minister will also visit the Kaal Bhairav Temple and witness Ganga Aarti onboard a roll-on/roll-off vessel. On Tuesday, he is scheduled to attend the 98th-anniversary celebrations of Sadguru Sadafaldeo Vihangam Yog Sansthan at Swarved Mahamandir in Varanasi.According to the statement, he will also participate in a conclave of chief ministers of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, along with deputy chief ministers from Bihar and Nagaland.The conclave is being organised to provide "an opportunity to share governance-related best practices and is in line with the Prime Minister's vision of furthering team India spirit."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-kashi-vishwanath-corridor-in-varanasi-today-101639358228987.html

But it is less dangerous than Delta, it added.Here are key points:1. According to health officials, a 20-year-old fully vaccinated man who came to Chandigarh from Italy to meet his relatives has tested positive for Omicron. The man landed in India on November 22 and is currently in institutional quarantine.2. The health department said in a statement issued late Sunday he “has now tested as Covid negative today”, but his five family contacts have tested positive for the virus.

13-12-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Formula 1 thriller, PM Modi in Gurugram and more…||Phew! What a season-ending thriller the Formula 1 race was last night. Max Verstappen with 395.5 points (10 wins, 18 podiums) pipped Lewis Hamilton (8 wins, 17 podiums) to become the 2021 world champion. So much adrenaline, yes, but so few outlets to let the excitement die down!Yet, this week is going to one hell of a rollercoaster with announcements, events and rallies to keep the news cycle running. Today and tomorrow, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for the month of November will be released. There was a marginal uptick in CPI inflation in October. After reaching a six-month high of 6.3% in May, reports Abhishek Jha, it had declined continuously up to September, when it was 4.35%. In October, CPI inflation was 4.48%. Both core CPI inflation – the non-food, non-fuel component – and non-core inflation increased in October. The core component increased from 6% in September to 6.24% in October. The non-core component increased from 2.42% to 2.63%.On the other hand, at 12.5%, WPI inflation, a measure for prices that producers face, was at its second-highest level in October since the new series began in January 2011. The highest level of WPI inflation in the new series was seen in May this year, when it was at 13.11%. It had, however, moderated to 10.66% by September before increasing again in October.We don’t know what the political and economic impact of these announcements is going to be, but the Reserve Bank’s decision last week to keep rates steady could be an indicator.Today, however, there will be a flurry of political activity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually lay the foundation stone of Umiyadham Temple in Gurgaon, besides inaugurating the multi-crore temple complex at Kashi-Vishwanath.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will also visit Goa, where the Trinamool Congress wants to make significant inroads. The TMC is likely to witness several 'high profile' inductions with current NCP MLA Churchill Alemao widely tipped to switch sides. Over the coming weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too will be in the state to celebrate 60th year of Goa's Liberation.Tomorrow, December 14, is when controversial Narcotics Control Bureau official Sameer Wankhede will be summoned by the caste certificate scrutiny committee. Later this week, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will hold a rally in Dehradun to honour war veterans. There is also a nationwide bank strike expected on December 16. On December 18, PM Modi will lay the foundation of the 600 km Ganga Expressway, and India will host central Asian foreign ministers the same day.Political activity in several states may also turn out to be interesting. As relations between the Kerala government and Governor Arif Mohammed Khan get strained further, chief minister Pinayari Vijayan will meet the latter on Monday to wrinkle out differences over appointments in state universities. The CBI court in Kochi has summoned former CPI(M) legislator KV Kunhiraman and four others in connection with the twin murder of two Youth Congress activists on Wednesday. The same day the Kerala high court will hear their anticipatory bail pleas.In Jharkhand, the state’s five-day winter session begins today. This session will be crucial as the government is likely to introduce a Bill to check lynching in the state. The winter session of the Karnataka state legislature will also commence from today, and will go on till December 24. The results of the December 10 MLC polls for 25 seats of the upper house of the state legislature will be announced on December 14. The opposition is likely to corner the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government over charges of corruption and the contentious anti conversion laws among others.In Tamil Nadu, the Madras high court will on December 13 continue to hear the case of compliance reports of various state and central government departments on action taken to protect the LGBTQIA+ community and the NCERT is also expected to file a status report on a controversy that was flagged by the court that the education department had rightly uploaded material to sensitise people on the community but it was taken down from its website within hours due to external pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-formula-1-thriller-pm-modi-in-gurugram-and-more-101639337808127.html
13-12-2021||India||Karnataka logs third case of Omicron amid growing fears of a third wave of infections||The third positive case of Omicron, the new strain of the deadly novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, has been detected in Karnataka adding to fears of the southern state.“Third case of #Omicron has been detected in Karnataka. A 34-year-old male returning from South Africa has tested positive. He is isolated and being treated in a govt hospital. 5 primary and 15 secondary contacts have been traced and samples sent for testing,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a post on Sunday.The detection comes amid growing fears of a possible third wave of infections in Karnataka that was left ravaged by the two earlier waves.Karnataka has steered clear of imposing any new restrictions but are trying to drive home the point of increasing vaccination coverage in the state.The third case detected in Karnataka comes amid a major lapse in monitoring of one of the two known persons with the Omicron variant, who left India for Dubai without informing the authorities. A case was registered with the police after the person left the country based on a negative Covid-19 test report, which has now come under suspicion.Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has announced that separate guidelines would be issued for student hostels and Covid-19 clusters as part of the state’s Covid-19 management.As on December 12, Karnataka has administered a total of 8,02,89,249 doses of Covid-19 vaccines of which the first and second doses account for 4,65,07,530 and 3,37,81,719 respectively, according to information on CoWin.The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state has restricted people without both doses of vaccination from entering public spaces like malls, cinema theatres and even being allowed into Karnataka, especially from Kerala and Maharashtra.A RT-PCR test is mandatory for all international passengers arriving in Karnataka.Other guidelines, issued on Saturday, state that patients with mild and moderate symptoms will be discharged after 10 days from the onset of the symptom. However, in both cases the patient must be asymptomatic for the last three consecutive days, should maintain an oxygen saturation level of 95% (without oxygen support) for four consecutive days, two negative RT-PCR test reports 24 hours apart should be presented before getting discharge.The guidelines added that after discharge, home quarantine is advised for seven more days, with self-monitoring for symptoms and follow-ups from the district surveillance officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-logs-third-case-of-omicron-amid-growing-fears-of-a-third-wave-of-infections-101639336864230.html
13-12-2021||India||Autonomy of probe agencies priority for Modi govt: Jitendra Singh||Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh on Sunday urged the eight states, who have withdrawn the general consent to CBI to investigate cases, to rethink their decision.The minister emphasised that these state governments have to come clear and state whether they trust the CBI or not, or whether they trust the probe agency selectively as they continue to give selective consent in cases which suit them.Addressing the Investiture Ceremony at the CBI headquarters in New Delhi on Sunday, the minister expressed concern over eight states withdrawing the general consent to CBI to investigate cases but nevertheless holding on to the prerogative to give selective consent where it suits them, Singh called for wider introspection by the polity, the society and the nation at large whether this is the kind of propriety which is to be followed.Eight states - West Bengal, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Mizoram -- have withdrawn the general consent to investigate cases previously granted to CBI under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act of 1946 (DSPE Act).The minister called upon these state governments to do a rethink on the decision of withdrawal of general consent to CBI to investigate cases.According to the statement released by the CBI, the Union Minister said that the Modi government is committed to the preservation and strengthening of the independence and autonomy of the country’s investigation agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The Union Minister said irrespective of ideological beliefs, it is the collective responsibility of all to strengthen institutions like CBI, as these institutions also contribute to strengthening the nation’s resolve to achieve the ultimate goal of incorruptibility in society.The minister’s statement comes after the Lok Sabha passed the bills to extend the tenures of the chiefs of the ED and CBI, respectively, from two years to a maximum of five years. The move has been criticised by the Opposition who alleged that it will compromise the agencies’ autonomy.The statement from the agency said the Union minister reiterated that the Modi-led government’s administrative outlook is determined by three main Mantras- zero-tolerance for corruption, transparency and citizen centricity.“He said the commitment of the present government is to bring in more transparency, more citizen centricity and more accountability in governance and is indicated by its decisive initiatives to operationalize the institution of the Lokpal in the country to check corruption at high places,” read the statement.Speaking on the occasion, Director CBI Subodh Kumar Jaiswal reiterated unflinching commitment of CBI to work towards the national goal of Zero Tolerance against Corruption stating that CBI has over the years evolved into a multidisciplinary premier investigating agency of the country inducting professionals from different fields.Dr.Jitendra Singh presented the Police Medals for Meritorious Service to 47 CBI officials including Tej Prakash Devrani, Inspector, ACB, CBI, Dehradun. (Now DSP); K.Pradeep Kumar, DSP, EO-III, CBI, New Delhi (Now ASP); Pramod Kumar, DSP, AC-I, CBI, New Delhi; Thakur Singh Bhandari, Inspector, ACB, CBI, Ghaziabad among others.The Investiture Ceremony was also attended by Suresh N.Patel, Chief Vigilance Commissioner and Pradip Kumar Tripathi, Union Secretary (Personnel).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/autonomy-of-probe-agencies-priority-for-modi-govt-jitendra-singh-101639335664040.html
13-12-2021||India||Don’t intend to take over guv’s post as chancellor of universities: Kerala CM||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said his government has no intention of taking over the position of chancellor of universities in the state and added that Governor Arif Mohammed Khan’s recent outbursts over “political interference” in the appointment of vice-chancellors were “unfortunate”.“We have a healthy official and personal relation with the Governor. Both never pursued a collision course and respected each other. We request him to continue in the position of the chancellor,” the chief minister said, while talking to reporters in north Kerala’s Kannur.On October 8, the Governor sent a strongly worded letter to Vijayan, saying he was really pained over “dipping standard” of higher education sector in the state and blamed “brazen political interference” as reason for this. He reiterated his charges while talking to HT on Saturday. Khan also said “he could not bend further” and asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if “political interference” continued.The Governor has reportedly expressed displeasure over the recent re-appointment of Prof Gopinath Ravindran as Vice-Chancellor of Kannur University for another four years and the state Assembly passing of an amendment to the University Act, which have taken away the power of the chancellor to appoint the University Appellate Tribunal.When asked about Khan’s displeasure about the reappointment of Kannur University VC, the chief minister said the Governor was the appointing authority and he signed the letter. “The Governor expressed some doubts over his re-appointment and later the advocate general met him and cleared them. I don’t know why he’s expressing concern after signing the appointment letter,” said Vijayan. He also ruled out the VC’s resignation. “I don’t know why he has some rethinking now and only he can only explain it,” Vijayan said.The CM said the government had taken note of some the concerns raised by the Governor and the state’s chief secretary and finance minister met him immediately. “I request the Governor to continue in the chancellor post. We never forced him to do any particular posting and in future also it will be our policy,” Vijayan said, adding he was forced to talk to the press since the Governor made his observations public.However, the Governor, while speaking to reporters in Delhi, said he has nothing to say to the CM through the media. “Why should we talk to each other through the media? If he wants to say something, he can talk to me. I do not want to send him any message through the media,” Khan said.He added that he requested the CM to take over as chancellor of universities as “I do not want to have a conflict with my government”.“You (CM) become Chancellor and you do whatever you want to. I am requesting them again to bring an ordinance amending the Universities Act to become Chancellor of Universities as it is not my Constitutional duty. Let them decide who wants to be Chancellor. Let them bring ordinance and I will sign it,” he said.
13-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: December 13, 1996 — India annex series against South Africa||Kanpur – The South African batsmen could not reach themselves beyond the time they were expected to and succumbed to a 280 runs defeat five minutes after lunch on the concluding day of the third and final Test match at Green Park here today. India, who have won this McDowell Test series 2-1, now travel to South Africa on Dec. 19 to a three-Test series and a tri tournament. Overnight 127 for five, the South Africans were left with not much hope and their later order batsmen did not raise any fresh indication of a fightback when the play resumed today morning. With India grabbing two quick wickets in the Rut 15 minutes, all the visitors could do was to delay the inevitable.The end finally came in the first ball of the second over after lunch in a bit of dramatic fashion. At 179 for eight at lunch, the South Africans were probably looking forward to extend the proceedings a little more. But Venkatesh Prasad and Srinath picked up a wicket each in the first ball of their respective overs to bring an abrupt end to the South African innings.Skipper Sachin Tendulkar opted for the new ball after 93 overs five minutes before the lunch and received the results immediately after the &minute break, Prasad’s first ball to De Villiers was an in-cutter for which the batsman had no answer. His stumps were uprooted and suddenly the end looked very near.It was the turn of Srinath to finish off the match. He had Paul Adams, the last batsman, fishing outside the off stump and man of the match Mohd Azharuddin took a simple catch at second slip. As South African skipper Hansie Cronje later admitted that it was Azharuddin who made the main difference between the two teams, at was good to see the former Indian captain being a direct party in rounding off the South African innings. The defeat loomed so la on the visitors from the third d self that there was hardly anyone around to celebrate it when their second innings folded up for 180 runs. While the spectators remained more or less passive all around the stadium, the players, too, looked unaffected. Those who picked up the stumps did it more because of the custom. And these very few who burst crackers probably were more eager to exhaust their Diwali leftovers. ‘The intense battle and conflict between the bat and the ball which has developed cricket into a great game was never there in the 125 minutes of play today except for a short period when Klusener was batting with authority. The lefthander showed some class in his unbeaten 34 before he ran out of his partners. He was also involved in the biggest stand of the day, 29 runs for the ninth wicket with Pat Symcox.Klusener hit five boundaries along the carpet. He picked up two in Srinath’s very first over of the day leaving a lot of people around wondering whether it was a wise decision to replace Kumble from the pavillion end. Spinner Sunil Joshi, just been discarded from the Test squad for South Africa, was the first one to strike. The very fourth ball of the day saw McMillan trying to sweep and Laxman, substituting for Ganguly, taking a running catch at square leg. It was a well-judged catch. Srinath came in for some punishment from new batsman Klusener, but hit back in his second over when he trapped overnight batsman Dave Richardson leg before. The batsman played back and missed. Klusener and Symcox batted together for 50 minutes before Joshi struck. Symcox came on the frontfoot and played an uppish stroke.

13-12-2021||India||Varun Gandhi pilots private member’s bill for guaranteed MSP of 22 crops||Varun Gandhi, a lawmaker from the Bharatiya Janata Party, has piloted a private member’s bill that seeks legal guarantee of minimum support price for 22 agricultural commodities with an annual financial outlay of ₹1 trillion.Gandhi, who represents Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha, has been asking the government to take a lenient view of the farmers’ concerns. Last month, he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider paying ₹10 million as compensation to the families of farmers who died during the year-long protest against the farm laws that have now been repealed, and accept the famers’ demand for statutory guarantee of MSP.The bill – The Farmers Right to Guaranteed Minimum Support Price Realisation of Agri-Produce Bill, 2021 – has been submitted to Parliament, but is yet to be tabled. Any member of Parliament who is not a minister can move a private member’s bill. A decision to admit a private bill rests with the chairman in case of Rajya Sabha and the speaker in case of the Lok Sabha. These bills are taken up during the second half of the session on Friday.The bill proposes that MSP is set at a profit margin of 50% over the comprehensive cost of production as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee in 2006. “Any farmer realising a price less than the above declared MSP price shall be entitled to compensation equal to the difference in value between the price realised and end guaranteed MSP,” the proposed bill envisages.It provides for codification of various crops based on quality parameters, ensuring that the farmers do not have to resort to distress sales if crops do not meet predefined quality criterion. The bill encourages crop diversification and recommends the most suited crop to be cultivated for each sub-district, thereby reducing the environmental cost of agriculture and promoting crop patterns suitable for long-term ecological sustainability.It calls for setting up a separate department under the farm ministry to implement the law. The draft legislation calls for establishing well-equipped procurement centres – one for every five villages – and creation of supply chain infrastructure, which includes warehouses and cold storages to help farmers seamlessly store and sell their produce after harvest.On November 19, Modi in a televised address to the nation announced the repeal of the contentious farm laws, and the bill to sanction the repeal was passed in the ongoing winter session of Parliament. Farmers’ unions that have called off their stir are demanding a statutory guarantee of MSP.Gandhi put out a tweet about the bill. “India’s farmers & her governments have long debated the agricultural crisis, in & out of commissions. The time has come for an MSP law. I’ve created & submitted to Parliament what I believe to be an actionable piece of legislation. I welcome any critique of it,” he said in the tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-pilots-private-member-s-bill-for-guaranteed-msp-of-22-crops-101639334343635.html
13-12-2021||India||1st cases in Kerala, Chandigarh, Andhra; Omicron tally 38||A total of five new cases of the Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2 were reported across India — one each in Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra – on Sunday, taking the national tally of the heavily mutated variant to 38.All the five people who tested positive on Sunday had arrived from abroad, according to state officials.The new Omicron infections detected on Sunday in Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh and Kerala were the first in the respective regions, while the tally in Karnataka and Maharashtra now stands at three and 18, respectively. Omicron infections have also been reported in three other regions – nine in Rajasthan, three in Gujarat, and two in Delhi.Experts across the world have warned that there is a high possibility that the Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa in November-end, may lead to a new wave of infections wherever it gains a foothold. Whether the variant leads to milder disease is unclear, but early data appears to strongly suggest that this variant is a more resistant to vaccines, and evidence is now mounting that it could surpass the Delta variant’s transmissibility.In Kerala, state health minister Veena George said early on Sunday that the first Omicron case has been confirmed in the state. In a post on Facebook, she said the male patient, a native of the state, had recently returned from the United Kingdom, one of the countries seeing a high volume of Omicron infections. She added that the patient’s condition was stable and that his wife and mother had also tested positive and that their samples have been sent for genome sequencing, results of which are expected in few days.In Karnataka, officials confirmed the third positive case of Omicron in the state in a man who returned from South Africa. “Third case of #Omicron has been detected in Karnataka. A 34-year-old male returning from South Africa has tested positive. He is isolated and being treated in a govt hospital. Five primary and 15 secondary contacts have been traced and samples sent for testing,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said.In Maharashtra, the first such infection in Nagpur on Sunday took the state’s tally to 18. Senior officials from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation said that the infected person, a 40-year-old who arrived in Nagpur on December 5 from Burkina Faso, had 30 close contacts, all of whom have tested negative for Covid-19.A 20-year-old man, who landed in Chandigarh from Italy on November 22, tested positive for Omicron on Sunday. “His whole genomic sequencing report was received late night on December 11 and found positive for Omicron variant,” senior officials told PTI. However, by Sunday evening, the man had already tested negative for Covid-19, as had his seven high-risk relatives, officials said.The Omicron case in Andhra Pradesh was a 34-year-old who arrived in Mumbai from Ireland in November end. The man tested negative in an RT-PCR test in Mumbai and was subsequently allowed to travel to Visakhapatnam on November 27. “On conducting a re-test at Vizianagaram, the test was found positive... His sample was for genome sequencing and it was Omicron positive,” informed Andhra Pradesh Health Department.The Omicron variant was first detected in India in Bengaluru with two people testing positive for it comprising a South African national of Indian origin and a doctor.On Saturday, the Centre had asked states to maintain a strict watch on the situation, with focused district-level measures for containment of clusters of new cases in light of the new variant.The Union health ministry has repeatedly emphasised the importance of testing and surveillance, testing of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection cases through rapid antigen tests (RAT) and retesting by RT-PCR of symptomatic RAT negative tests.“Rapid antigen test may not be as accurate as RT-PCR tests but it is a beneficial tool where caseload is high,” said Dr Amita Jain, head of microbiology department at King George’s University, Lucknow.India’s daily new Covid-19 cases have hovered under 10,000 for the past few weeks, the lowest since the pandemic took grip of the country in mid-2020. A total of nearly 34.7 million people have been so far been infected with the disease in the country, more than 474,000 of whom have died. Till Sunday, more than 1.32 billion doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered across India to 814.5 million people (299.6 million partially vaccinated and 514.9 million having received both shots of the vaccine). Around 31.9% of the country’s adults are now partially vaccinated while another 54.8% are fully vaccinated, data shows.With inputs from Mumbai, Chandigarh, Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-cases-in-kerala-chandigarh-andhra-omicron-tally-38-101639334282892.html
13-12-2021||India||Despite show of unity, Opposition candidate loses key Rajya Sabha panel election||For the past two weeks, opposition parties have been showcasing their united might in protests, both inside and outside the Rajya Sabha. But their candidate suffered an embarrassing defeat in an internal election of the Upper House due to lack of support.An election was held on December 10 for two vacancies in the parliamentary committee on welfare of other backward classes (OBCs). V Sivadasan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was the opposition candidate, while the Bharatiya Janata Party fielded two candidates, Dineshchandra Jemalbhai Anavadiya and Sakaldeep Rajbhar, for the two posts.The election, in which only Rajya Sabha members participated to fill the vacancies from their House, saw a poor response from the opposition. As a result, both seats went to the BJP candidates.“Even the candidate, Sivadasan, didn’t come to vote,” said a parliamentary official.“I was busy in some urgent matter in Kerala,” Sivadasan said. “We lost the election as not many people voted for us.” He lost by just 12 votes, Sivadasan said.His party’s floor leader in the Rajya Sabha, Elamaram Kareem, one of the 12 suspended members of the House, added: “It was a Friday and not many people were present in the House. Moreover, 12 of us couldn’t vote due to suspension.”On Thursday and Friday, the opposition had paused its protests both outside and inside Parliament due to the tragic death of chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 other armed forces officers in a helicopter crash that shook the nation.The OBC panel, headed by BJP’s Rajesh Verma, looks into various aspects of OBC welfare and meets regularly to seek reports from various government wings about reservation and fulfilment of OBC quotas.“The latest defeat underlines that the opposition remains fractured at crucial occasions,” an opposition leader said on condition of anonymity.He pointed out that although the government didn’t have numerical majority in the Upper House in 2019, it could easily push the Triple Talaq Bill, the legislation to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into union territories and the scrapping of the Article 370 in the House.The National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, counting on its friendly parties such as Biju Janata Dal and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, now enjoys a marginal majority in the Upper House.
13-12-2021||India||Karnataka reports third Omicron case, says government||Karnataka has reported its third case of Covid’s Omicron variant after a South Africa returnee tested positive, state health minister K Sudhakar said on Sunday. “Third case of #Omicron has been detected in Karnataka. A 34-year-old male returning from South Africa has tested positive. He is isolated and being treated in a govt hospital. 5 primary and 15 secondary contacts have been traced, and samples sent for testing,” Sudhakar said in a post on Sunday.The detection comes amid growing fears of a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Karnataka, which was left ravaged by the two earlier waves.Karnataka government has steered clear from imposing any new restrictions but are trying to hammer the point of increasing vaccination coverage in the state.The third case detected in Karnataka comes amid a lapse in monitoring one of the two known persons with the Omicron variant, who left India for Dubai without informing the authorities. The police registered a case after the person left the country based on a negative Covid-19 test report, which has now come under suspicion.Meanwhile, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has announced that the government would issue separate guidelines for student hostels and Covid clusters as part of the Covid-19 management.As of December 12 (4 pm), Karnataka has administered a total of 80,289,249 doses of covid-19 vaccination, of which the first and second doses account for 46,507,530 and 33,781,719 respectively, according to information on Cowin.The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government restricted people without both doses of vaccination from entering public spaces like malls, cinema theatres. Restrictions are strict for people entering Karnataka, especially from Kerala and Maharashtra.RT-PCR test is mandatory for all international passengers arriving in Karnataka.Other guidelines, issued on Saturday, state that patients with mild and moderate symptoms will be discharged after 10 days from the onset of the symptom. However, in both cases the patient must be asymptomatic for the last three consecutive days, should maintain an oxygen saturation level of 95% (without oxygen support) for four consecutive days, two negative RT-PCR test reports 24 hours apart should be presented before getting discharged.The guidelines added that after discharge, home quarantine is advised for seven more days, with self-monitoring for symptoms and follow-ups from the district surveillance officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-reports-third-omicron-case-says-government-101639334163722.html
13-12-2021||India||More items recovered from man who stole Maradona’s watch||More belongings of Diego Maradona have been recovered from the house of Wazid Hussein, who was arrested on Saturday for stealing a limited edition Hublot watch engraved with the football legend’s signature from a Dubai storage and fleeing back home to Assam’s Sivasagar, police said on Sunday.“Ref recovery of Hublot Watch of Late Diego Maradona, more memorabilia have been recovered. (It includes) jacket, track pant, T-shirt, shoes, toy doll, squash racket, watch, lighters, cap and iPads,” GP Singh, Assam’s special director of police, tweeted on Sunday. “The recovery has been made at the instance of Wazid Hussein detained yesterday by Sivasagar Police.”Assam police arrested Hussein, a resident of Sivasagar district who worked as a security guard in the United Arab Emirates, after Dubai police requested Indian law enforcement authorities to catch the fugitive. They conducted searches after questioning the man and found several more items stashed at Hussein’s in-laws’ place at Khumatai in Moranhaat area of Charaideo district.“We have recovered the items and informed our higher authorities. They are in contact with Dubai police,” said Rakesh Raushan, superintendent of police in Sivasagar district. “We are seeking details of the items that were stolen from the store in Dubai where the belongings of the football legend were kept.”Hussein was on Saturday produced before a court, which sent him to a five-day remand, Raushan said. Further investigations are ongoing and Hussein’s family is cooperating with the authorities.Maradona was seen wearing two Hublot Big Bang watches during the FIFA World Cup 2010, when the watchmaker launched its Maradona Big Bang Chronograph Limited Edition.Hussein worked as a guard at a private company in Dubai since 2016. The company apparently stored Maradona’s belongings. In August, he asked for permission to return to India, saying his father was unwell. Hussein allegedly stole several belongings of the late Argentinian footballer before returning home.Hussein is not responding to interrogation, Raushan said. “He is not sharing details on how he managed to steal such important items and came back to India, hiding them from all those security systems in international airports,” the police officer said. “We are a bit surprised why he didn’t try to sell them. Our interrogation and investigation are going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-items-recovered-from-man-who-stole-maradona-s-watch-101639334043999.html
13-12-2021||India||'As stopgap, India must boost vulnerable people with available vaccines'||Expert groups – the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) – are studying scientific evidence and deliberating on the need for booster vaccine shots against Covid-19 in the country. The Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore is conducting a study to look at which of the two main vaccines available in India – Covishield and Covaxin – can be a better booster shot. The study could not find an adequate number of trial participants who have taken Covaxin, prompting Dr Gagandeep Kang, a leading researcher and microbiologist from CMC, to put out an appeal on social media. “Folks in Vellore, Chennai, Bangalore or Delhi willing to consider participating please email mnm.cmcvellore@gmail.com,” she said. On Sunday, HT spoke to Dr Kang about the ongoing study and the available evidence on boosters. Excerpts: What is the status of CMC Vellore’s ongoing study on boosters?We started recruitment for the trial in September. We are taking people who have received two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin and then randomly assigning them to receive a booster dose, more than three months later. The idea is to prepare for a programme for India on boosting. We want to make sure that mixing and matching is okay and have some idea of what the performance is like. We had no problem in getting people who have got Covishield, but we had a problem finding enough people who have received two doses of Covaxin and willing to be in the trial. The study was getting delayed since we are having trouble finding people in Vellore, so we are now looking at recruiting people outside Vellore, who we can run the study on and follow up on the phone. If we finish recruitment fast, we get the results fast. While it was okay to keep doing things at the pace we were doing them earlier, now with Omicron coming, I really think we can shorten the time to results. It’s an advantage for all of us.The Covishield results are ready, but because it’s a trial of both vaccines, we can’t unblind it until we finish the Covaxin arm.Going by data emerging from different parts of the world, which vaccines are most suited for boosters?Right now, all we are measuring is antibody responses. And if we look at antibody response measurement, the Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines give the highest level of antibodies either as primary series or as boosters. So, you have to have the mRNA vaccines somewhere in the mix. For instance, if you boost with AstraZeneca on an mRNA-base vaccine, that also gives a high value. Having an mRNA vaccine in the mix of either primary or booster series seems to be showing up as important. But remember that this is only antibody response and we not talking about the T cell response here.Then there are protein vaccines, but we don’t know what the antibody levels will be like with the Indian protein vaccines. But hopefully, we will have that data soon.And then there are vectored vaccines and inactivated virus vaccines. Covaxin in the clinical trial seems to have higher antibodies than the Chinese inactivated vaccine.With the emergence of the new Omicron variant, can we afford to wait for Indian data to roll out a booster policy?For the immunocompromised, we should have rolled out a third shot dose or the booster, months ago. I have been saying this for a while now. The immunocompromised need better vaccination strategies, they need more doses. You can’t use a one-size-fits-all strategy, when you know that certain groups have extra vulnerability.We don’t have the mRNA vaccines in India. But we can think about the priority population first by giving them what is available. By then we will have data from our study being conducted at CMC Vellore, among healthy people, and it will tell us which is a better vaccine to boost with.So, if India does allow boosters, Covishield or Covaxin can be used for third doses?Every vaccine will boost, it’s a question of which vaccine is the best. If you have vaccines that give a high and long-lasting response, then you will need to boost less often. So that’s what we should aim for. But in the absence of data, in the absence of knowledge about what might be best for our population given our prior exposure, it’s difficult to make a final policy now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-stopgap-india-must-boost-vulnerable-people-with-available-vaccines-virologist-gagandeep-kang-101639334042884.html

Of the total scheduled sitting time of 56 hours for the first two weeks, 28 hours were lost due to disruptions and forced adjournments,” the secretariat said in a statement.Productivity of the House stood at 49.7% in the first week of the winter session that began on November 29.Disruptions in the current session have primarily been set off by the opposition’s demand to revisit the decision to suspend 12 MPs for the duration of this session after the House passed a motion accusing them of causing damage to House property, jostling with security staff and marshals, and raising slogans on the last day of the monsoon session in August. The opposition parties also protested when the government did not agree to their demand to allow a discussion during the passage of the bill to repeal the farm laws.Since the beginning of the session, Rajya Sabha has spent 34.25% of functional time on legislative business, passing a total of five bills, including two in the first week.Bills that were passed in the Upper House include the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, 2021; the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020; the Farm Laws repeal Bill; the Dam Safety Bill; and the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (Amendment) Bill, 2021.“Nine hours and 48 minutes were spent debating these Bills in which 56 members took part. A total of 21.89% of the functional time has been spent on starred questions,” the secretariat official said, requesting anonymity.On Monday, the House will take up for consideration and passage the High Court and Supreme Court Judges Salary and Condition of Services (Amendment) Bill, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-productivity-improves-in-second-week-of-winter-session-101639333924671.html
13-12-2021||India||Explaining the decline in women’s role in workforce||Women’s participation in India’s labour force is low and has been declining this century, official employment surveys have shown. However, these surveys – the Employment and Unemployment Survey (EUS), and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) – do not sufficiently explain the reasons for this trend or offer clues on how this trend can be changed. A survey conducted by the Center for the Advanced Study of India (CASI) at the University of Pennsylvania has tried to solve this problem. The survey was conducted in January-August 2019 in around 15,000 households in four cities: Dhanbad in Jharkhand, Indore in Madhya Pradesh, Patna in Bihar, and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The survey was done in the core city, and their peripheral rural and urban areas. While its results may not apply uniformly across the country, they offer important pointers to understand India’s falling female labour force participation. Here are four charts that explain this.Women’s LFPR is declining, especially because of rural womenLabour force participation is captured in a number called the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR, or the share of people either working or looking for a job). Women’s LFPR in the latest PLFS before the pandemic (2018-19) was just 18.6% compared to 55.6% for men. PLFS and its earlier version – the EUS – show that women’s LFPR was not always this low. It has fallen over time, especially because of a decline in the LFPR of rural women. However, rural women’s LFPR continues to be higher than urban women’s.Official surveys offer some clues, but not definitive answerThe PLFS does offer some clues for these trends. Marriage, for example, significantly reduces women’s LFPR. In the 21-25 years and 26-30 years cohorts, unmarried women are twice as much likely to participate in the labour force as married women. This suggests that the expectation of household work after marriage negatively impacts women’s participation in the labour force.However, the PLFS does not ask reasons for not working or not looking for work. It is possible that women are willing to work, but the available jobs are not suited to their requirements. Moreover, a working paper based on the PLFS published in October by Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, who teaches economics at Ambedkar University, suggested that people could be misreporting their employment status (reported by HT on November 1: https://bit.ly/3rZAVdk). Unemployed people – those looking for work but not finding one – possibly report that they are simply not looking for work, and end up being misclassified as out of labour force. LFPR may not represent the true size of the labour force in that case.Similarly, the PLFS also shows that for married women, agriculture is the most preferred sector for work. This explains why rural women’s LFPR is higher than urban women’s. Still, we can only hazard guesses on why agriculture is the preferred sector for married women.In a published article detailing the survey’s results on LFPR, the researchers – Deepaboli Chatterjee and Neelanjan Sircar of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) – suggest that the reason why women are engaged in agriculture is because such jobs fit these needs of flexibility and proximity. “As India urbanises, labour market opportunities fitting those criteria are in shorter supply, causing women to leave or become unwilling to enter the labour market,” they said, explaining the falling LFPR. Any attempts to fix the trend in women’s LFPR must, therefore, keep India’s urbanisation trends in mind. Moreover, that even help available with household work does not change women’s willingness to work suggests that societal expectations have a role in women’s need for flexible and proximate work.Employment improves women’s role in decision-making, but not in financial decisionsDoes employment change women’s role at home? Although not a jobs survey in itself, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) tells us an important thing about this. Women’s decision-making power in the household is more if they are employed, according to its unit-level data for the 2015-16 NFHS analysed by HT. To be sure, this does not necessarily mean that employment improves women’s decision-making power. It is also possible that the converse it true: in households where women have decision-making power, women are more likely to be employed.The CASI survey puts an important qualification on this trend. It shows that even when women are making the decision on a matter, they may not be involved in its finances, even if they are employed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explaining-the-decline-in-women-s-role-in-workforce-101639333923098.html
13-12-2021||India||Saving Western Ghats ecosystem need of hour, say experts in Karnataka||Experts have indicated that the cost of calamities is far higher than the loss of economic activities in the fragile Western Ghats that traverse through four states, including Karnataka, which has once again refused to declare the region as eco-sensitive in the garb of saving livelihoods.Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai on December 4 continued to follow the footsteps of his predecessors in refusing to go ahead with the Kasturirangan committee report, which proposed that around 37% of the roughly 60,000 square km area be declared as eco-sensitive area (ESA).The Western Ghats, a chain of mountains that run parallel to India’s western coast, traverses through Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and is around 1.4 lakh square kms and a 1600 km stretch. Of this, around 20,600 kms falls in Karnataka.“Considering the climate changes (evident from recurring floods, droughts, landslides, increasing temperature, etc), which would affect the livelihood of all people (irrespective of poor or rich) and hurt the nation’s economy. It would be prudent to conserve the fragile ecosystems, which costs less compared to the situation prone to calamities (with changes in the climate) than spending money /resources for restoration/rejuvenation,” Dr TV Ramachandra, from the Centre for Ecological Sciences in the Indian Institute of Science told Hindustan Times.To be sure, all other states had earlier rejected the Prof. Madhav Gadgil report, calling it “anti-agrarian”, necessitating the setting up of another committee under Dr Kasturirangan, which experts said, was a ‘diluted’ version that tried to find a balance in saving livelihoods as well as the rapidly denigrating ecology.This year alone, Karnataka suffered rain-related losses of up to ₹11,916.30 crores in October and November, which have been one of the wettest years in the state’s history, indicating the impacts of climate change.There were 282 landslides in 2020 in this region as against 161 in 2019, registering a 75% increase in Karnataka due to deforestation, unscientific road construction in the southern state alone between 2019 and 2020, according to government data, Hindustan Times reported on April 8.The data had prompted the environment ministry in the state to reconsider the practice of awarding tenders based on lower costs and consider a more scientific approach in the construction of public infrastructure that does not block natural drainages or deforestation, which would further loosen the soil. Ramachandra said that only 15% of the state’s geographical area is forested, compared to 21% in 1985.Experts said that the large-scale developmental projects like irrigation, reservoirs, dams, economic zones, townships and land conversion have led to the loss of precious green cover, leaving forest cover and conservation only within protected areas.Natural forests show a decline from 7.5% in 1985 to 5.7% around 2019. During the same period, moist deciduous forests came down to 4.1% from 5.7%, and dry deciduous forests have nearly halved from 4.0% to 2.2According to government data, public infrastructure in this fragile region accounts for 2.4% today as against 0.4% in 1974.Dr K. Ullas Karanth, one of India’s most well-known tigers, wildlife and environmental conservationists, said that in a country like India, denying people’s legitimate aspirations for developmental activities may not be possible.However, he does say that the focus should remain on restricting destructive activities.“Such destructive activities include infrastructure projects as well as local people’s exploitation of nature through illegal hunting, excessive livestock grazing, forest product collection and increasingly a new wave of forest encroachments unleashed by the mindless and never-ending application of the Forest Rights Act,” he said.Karanth also questioned the quality of conservationists and the misapplication of funds by forest departments. “I think this demarcation has to be a careful scientific effort for each Protected Area. Well-intentioned but coarse grain declarations at macro-scales do more harm than good. Earlier overreach by courts and government-appointed experts who identified very large human-dominated landscapes outside the protected areas as the eco-sensitive zone has escalated to the present situation where locally conservationists are being aggressively attacked by everyone else and are losing heart, the forest departments are emasculated and even within areas where the Indian Forest Act and Wildlife Protection are applicable flagrant violations are taking place, he added.Joseph Hoover, a wildlife activist and former member of the state board for wildlife said that the continued destruction of the western ghats will impact nearly 220 million people living in the southern states alone.“We are frequently ravaged by extreme climate events, but our short-sighted policymakers haven’t assessed the impact of climate change. As they live in comfort, they haven’t felt the pinch yet! Most development works could be attributed to electoral promises made by local leaders. Some politicians push for unsustainable projects to earn kickbacks and favour industrialists and business tycoons. Unfortunately, it is being done to the detriment of nature and people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saving-western-ghats-ecosystem-need-of-hour-say-experts-in-karnataka-101639333863932.html
13-12-2021||India||Modi to inaugurate Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the grand Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, spread over 550,000 sq ft, in Varanasi on Monday.The corridor that connects the Ganga and Kashi Vishwanath temple has been decked with festive lights, flowers and garlands for the inauguration ceremony.Soon after arriving in Varanasi, Modi will offer prayers at the Kaal Bhairav temple and reach the corridor gate on the banks of the Ganga. After alighting from a boat at the Lalita Ghat jetty, he will collect Ganga water and enter the corridor. He will then walk to the Kashi Vishwanath temple and offer prayers, officials said.Amid the chanting of mantras, Modi will worship the deity and offer prayers to Kashi Vishwanath as part of the inauguration ceremony, the officials said, asking not to be named.Over 500 million people will watch the ceremony to be telecast live and streamed on social media platforms, including YouTube, Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary Tarun Chugh said.Around 3,000 guests, including Vedic scholars, priests and Hindu ascetics from all 11 other jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva will attend the ceremony, Chugh said. Jyotirlingas are devotional representations of Lord Shiva.Different types of marble and stone have been used in building the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, which has seven grand gates, one of them opening on Jalasen Ghat. A jetty has been built at Lalita Ghat, where devotees will alight from boats. They can then enter the corridor through the Jalasen Ghat gate. Devotees may board boats from any of the ghats of the Ganga to reach the corridor.The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has 24 buildings equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. These include tourist facilitation centres, a Vedic library, museum, and a space for sacred scriptures, among others. It also has the Mumukshu Bhavan (salvation home) close to the gate near the Ganga.There is a hi-tech command and control centre with cameras installed in every nook and corner for round the clock surveillance to ensure foolproof security, said A Satish Ganesh, commissioner of police, Varanasi.“It is matter of great satisfaction that the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is ready,” divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal said. “It is all set to be inaugurated by Prime Minster Narendra Modi on December 13.”“The entire Kashi Vishwanath Dham has been decorated with flowers for the inaugural ceremony,” said Sunil Verma, chief executive officer of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board (SKSADB), who oversaw the implementation of the project.The facilities for tourists were improved without tampering with the original structure of the temple, said Bimal Patel, architect of the corridor project.“The work includes construction of a temple chowk (square), Varanasi city gallery, museum, multi-purpose auditoriums, hall, devotees’ facilitation centre, public convenience, salvation home, Godowlia gate, bhogshala, shelter for priests and sevadars (volunteers), a space for sacred books, and others,” Patel said. “About 70% of the 5.50 lakh sq. ft area of the corridor will have green cover.”Festive spiritA festive fervour is palpable among residents of Varanasi, considered a holy city by Hindus.“No one thought that the Kashi Vishwanath temple complex could be made so grand by expanding it,” said Rajbahadur Patel, a resident of Khajuri in Varanasi. “But Prime Minister Modi has made it a reality.”“Kashi Vishwanath Dham is divine, spiritual and grand. The devotees, including kanwarias, will not have to wait for hours for darshan of Baba Kashi Vishwanath because the corridor is spacious and sprawling,” said Ballu Vijay Yadav, who runs a tea stall in Pandeypur area, named it NaMo tea stall in 2014 fter Modi. “It is a gift to devotees, including kanwariyas.”The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has added to the glory of Hinduism, said Ravi Gupta, a resident of Pandeypur.Vivek Singh Raghuvanshi, resident of Tewar village in Cholapur area of Varanasi, expressed happiness over construction of the corridor. “It will make pilgrimage comfortable and will boost religious tourism.”After laying the foundation stone of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in March 2019, Modi had said the project will be a model for “protection and preservation” of temples, showcasing a combination of modern technology with ancient faith.The Prime Minister, who represents Varanasi in the Lok Sabha, will remain in the city for two days. He will preside over a conference of BJP chief ministers on the Banaras Locomotive Works campus on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-inaugurate-kashi-vishwanath-corridor-in-varanasi-101639332426481.html

She said that the question paper contained “Misogynistic, Anti-women, anti-child rights ideas” in her letter.  “I was shocked to read through the passages given in the reading comprehension section of the Grade 10 CBSE exams held on 11.12.2021,” she wrote in her letter, pointing out to some statements in the text like “the emancipation of the wife destroyed the parent's authority over their children" and "Children and servants were...taught their place”. I have written to the Chairperson of CBSE @cbseindia29 urging him to recall the paper and debrief it with the students. Such regressive ideas must find no place in the 21st century. https://t.co/ozQOXGIKWy pic.twitter.com/KXZt8124Iq “These statements only serve to perpetuate misogynistic ideas which were used to oppress women and they are in opposition to the very ethos of the Constitution which is centered on Equality and Social Justice,” she further said.  She expressed concerns that such passages in a question paper would normalise “regressive misogynistic” thoughts and said that the emphasis on ‘parental authority on children’ came from an outdated understanding of child development.  Urging the CBSE to recall the paper, she also suggested a “sensitization” session in every CBSE grade 10 classroom “to debrief why such regressive ideas must find no place in the 21st century.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversial-text-in-cbse-class-10-question-paper-irks-many-cong-s-priyanka-gandhi-says-bjp-endorses-retrograde-views-101639326464514.html
