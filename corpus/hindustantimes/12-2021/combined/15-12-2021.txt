15-12-2021||Lucknow||Populist announcements likely in second supplementary budget of Uttar Pradesh||The Uttar Pradesh government is set to make some populist announcements for different sections in the state assembly during the current winter session as it presents the second supplementary budget for 2021-22 and an interim budget (vote on account for the first few months) for 2022-23, ahead of the 2022 UP assembly elections.The state government has announced an increase in the honorarium for panchayat functionaries, including village pradhans, district and block panchayat presidents and may make more such announcements.Finance minister Suresh Khanna will present the Uttar Pradesh government’s second supplementary budget for 2021-2022 and the interim budget, a vote on account for first few months of 2022-2023 in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath.“Yes, the state government may come out with some announcements about farmers and others as it presents the second supplementary demands of grants for 2021-2022 and a vote on account for a part of 2022-23 in the state assembly,” said a senior officer.“The state government may get the nod of the state legislature for the new schemes in the supplementary budget and funds may be transferred to the beneficiaries under the direct benefit transfer scheme,” the officer added.“This is the last budgetary exercise before the assembly elections are formally announced. The state government is expected to seek approval to populist schemes, including a likely increase in honorarium of village pradhans in the state. The other sections of the society, including farmers, may also be benefitted by the government’s largesse. Despite two supplementary budgets, the state government’s total expenditure in 2021-22 may fall short of the original budgetary estimates of ₹5.50 lakh crore for the year,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of department of economics, Lucknow University. This is not the first time that the state government will present a supplementary budget and an interim budget in the last session of the state assembly. As chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav had also presented supplementary demands and an interim budget in the last session of state assembly ahead of the 2017 polls. The opposition is questioning the state government for bringing out the second supplementary budget for 2021-22.“The state government has not been able to use the funds already allocated to different departments in the annual budget for 2021-2022. So, there is no point in presenting the second supplementary budget,” said Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra.“The Yogi Adityanath government is implementing development projects at a faster pace and schemes have been launched for the welfare of the people. The state government allocates funds for these projects and schemes. There is nothing new as the state governments in the past, too, have presented supplementary budgets and interim budgets ahead of polls,” said Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesman Avnish Tyagi.The state government had on August 18, 2021 presented the first supplementary budget of ₹7301.52 crore for 2021-22 to provide large or even token sums for various schemes. These included a scheme to make the youths digitally proficient, pay increased honorarium to different categories of workers such as shiksha mitras, anganwadi workers and village chowkidars, clear dues of farmers and provide funds for the welfare of cows. It allocated additional sums for some of the ongoing projects too. The state government had presented its largest ever annual budget in size for ₹5,50,270.78 crore on February 22, 2021 despite constraints of the adverse impact that Covid-19 has had on the UP economy.

15-12-2021||Delhi||JNU faculty alleges irregularities in PhD admissions||New Delhi: A group of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) faculty members has written to the chancellor on Tuesday alleging “irregularities” in the interview process for the selection of PhD candidates this year, and sought an “impartial” inquiry in the matter.The letter comes three days after the JNU students’ union (JNUSU) on Sunday alleged that several candidates from “marginalised sections” who appeared for the interview were given “very low” marks. According to the JNU admission policy, candidates seeking admission in PhD courses have to appear for a viva-voce or interview after clearing an entrance exam. The entrance exam and viva have 70:30 weightage. In a letter to the JNU chancellor VK Saraswat on Tuesday, six faculty members from the University’s Centre for Economic Studies and Planning (CESP) in the school of social sciences (SSS), said, “The undersigned faculty seek your urgent immediate intervention to ensure an impartial enquiry into the way that the viva-voce/interview process for selection of candidates to the Centre’s PhD programme in the current academic year (2021-22) was organised, and to initiate steps for correcting any distortions in the selections that might have resulted from it.”The faculty members alleged that a completely “non-transparent and arbitrary process” was followed in the Center during both rounds of interviews, the first of which was held between October 26 and November 3, and second between November 25 and 27.None of the signatories to the letter wanted to be named. The vice-chancellor did not respond to messages seeking a comment. A senior university official, who asked not to be named, said, “Allegations will be looked into as per rules and procedures.”On Monday, JNU issued a statement and refuted allegations of discrimination in the interview process, and added that the institution follows “a fair, transparent and inclusive admission policy”.In the letter, the faculty membes also cited an example of a candidate who had done a postgraduate programme from the concerned Center and topped his batch, but did not get through the PhD interview. “This candidate was interviewed in the first round after successfully clearing the UFC’s JRF Examination. However, he did not make the final list of admissions because the average marks he secured in the interview (as announced in the result notified to him) were low,”the faculty members said in the letter.“Three of the five faculty members who were on the board which interviewed him, then went on record before the entire faculty and the chairperson expressing their astonishment at his average mark because they recalled his excellent performance in the interview and that they had awarded him high marks However, on this matter too there has been no response from the chairperson and no explanation has been forthcoming,” they said in the letter.When contacted, chairperson of the Center Shakti Kumar said, “The center followed all the norms and took every measure to keep the interview process transparent. We give average marks given by all committee members during the interview process.”In its statement on Monday, the JNU said, “The JNU categorically rejects the reports in certain sections of media alleging discrimination against PhD aspirants from marginalised sections of the society.... The university follows a fair, transparent and inclusive admission policy which is the foundation of its proven academic excellence.”

15-12-2021||Pune||Docs see lack of vitamin D as key driver of winter spike in arthritis cases||PUNE Winter can be especially harsh for those who suffer from arthritis. As the winter season kicks in, Dr Vishwajeet Chavan, orthopaedic surgeon at Apollo Spectra Pune said, “Usually about 70 patients with arthritis visit the outpatient department every month. However, since the onset of the cold, the number of patients has increased, and now 85 to 90 patients are complaining of joint pain in the age group of 55 to 80.” “Women are more prone to joint pain in winter than men. Hence, joint pain is 5% higher in women than in men. Hot water compression is a temporary relief. Cover your hands, knees, legs, and all arthritis-prone areas by dressing in layers. Stay hydrated as dehydration can make you more sensitive to pain. Don’t forget to exercise indoors to improve the symptoms like joint stiffness and muscle weakness, and also take warm showers,” Dr Chavan suggested, addng, “We also suggest that patients eat omega-3 fatty acids to lower inflammation in the joints and add avocado, flaxseeds, walnuts, and fish to the diet.”“Some of the strict no-nos are, stress which triggers arthritis pain, yoga and meditation can also help. Low levels of vitamin D might lead to arthritis pain and so a vitamin D supplement could be added but only after consulting the doctor. Avoid heavily processed, sugary and fried foods, alcohol, and colas that trigger joint pain,” he added. Dr Ashish Suryavanshi, orthopaedic at Lokmanya Hospital, Pune said, “I am seeing a 25% rise in cases this year as compared to last year, mostly in women above the age of 50 years, compared to men. There are more muscle spasms in colder temperatures leading to joint pain. The cold climate reduces blood circulation to the fingers and toes, which also causes arthritis pain. Less sunlight during winters can lead to lower vitamin D levels and weakened joints. Thus, many rheumatoid arthritis patients find it harder to control symptoms during chilly days.” Dr Aashish Arbat, orthopaedic surgeon at Jehangir Hospital, said, ‘‘The onset of winter will mean a long battle for patients having arthritis as they will have to deal with daily aches and joint pain and discomfort. Those patients with existing rheumatoid arthritis will witness worsened joint pain during winter.”“Joint pain and stiffness is commonly seen in arthritis patients owing to an unexpected drop in the barometric pressure (the pressure of the air) that aggravates joint problems. One’s tendons and muscles tend to expand and contract leading to joint pain due to changes that occur in the barometric pressure. Even the fluid present in the joints can become thick causing stiffness due to the sudden fall in the temperature. There is around 30-40% rise in the number of arthritis cases during winter, and some patients may also require surgery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/docs-see-lack-of-vitamin-d-as-key-driver-of-winter-spike-in-arthritis-cases-101639592497625.html

15-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi launches BJP campaign to seek people’s suggestions ahead of UP polls||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday launched the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) people-connect campaign “UP number 1 - sujhaav aapka, sankalp hamara (your suggestions, our commitment)” to seek suggestions for the party manifesto ahead of the UP polls. As part of the campaign, the BJP would seek people’s views by placing nearly a lakh “suggestion bins” called “akansha petis” in each of the 403 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh where the assembly polls are due early next year.The suggestions put in the “akansha petis” would be collated and eventually find a place in the party’s “sankalp patra” (manifesto) for the 2022 UP polls, Yogi said. The underlying message, BJP leaders said, was that the party was confident of coming back to power and that is why it was assuring people about honouring their suggestions. Like in 2017, the BJP has named its manifesto “Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra” this time too.“The word sankalp is an irrevocable commitment. It is not a mere announcement. That is why in 2017 we decided to name the manifesto as our Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra and fulfilled all the commitments that were incorporated therein,” Yogi said at the launch of the campaign. “People would also be invited to drop in their suggestion by email or on WhatsApp,” said senior minister and party veteran Suresh Khanna. “I must credit Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath with changing the age-old perception and restoring UP’s pride,” Khanna said. Playing on the word “farq saaf hai (difference is clear)” that is part of the BJP’s campaign catchline, Adityanath said the perception about the government changed drastically since his party came to power. “That is why we say confidently ‘farq saaf hai’,” he said while accusing the previous governments of “aastha ke prateekon ka aapmaan (insult to religious symbols).” Yogi also spoke of how his government had ensured an end to cattle smuggling and cow slaughter that had become rampant under previous governments. Khanna heads the manifesto committee. Its members include Lok Sabha MPs Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Rajesh Verma, Rajya Sabha MPs Brij Lal, Kanta Kardam, Seema Dwivedi and Vijay Pal Singh Tomer, minister of state Atul Garg and UP BJP vice president and lawmaker AK Sharma. Barring Brij Lal and Joshi, who couldn’t make it due to prior commitments, other members of the committee were present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-launches-bjp-campaign-to-seek-people-s-suggestions-ahead-of-up-polls-101639592019034.html

In UP, there are 58, 189 village panchayats and as many pradhans, more than 7 kakh village panchayat members, 826 kshetra panchayat chiefs and around 76,000 kshetra panchayat members, 75 zila panchayat chairpersons and over 3,000 zila panchayat members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-hikes-honorarium-of-panchayat-representatives-101639591660651.html

Mumbai district is reporting a quantum of these weekly new cases. This has pushed the overall state numbers from 4,116 new cases in the week ending December 3, to 4,456 new cases in the week ending December 10. In the past 30 days, between November 10 to December 10, Maharashtra recorded 22,348 new cases, 7.8% of India’s monthly new cases, and 781 new deaths, 6.1% of India’s monthly death toll.Three districts in the state testing less than the recommended WHO daily testing protocol for tests per million, which is 140. These districts are Buldhana (88 tests), Nandurbar (121) and Yavatmal (130). Five districts in the state are reporting a decline in testing numbers, with Nandurbar reporting a 35.61% decline, week on week, said the centre. The centre has informed the state that there are multiple districts seeing a surge in the cases which is also concerning, and so a five-pronged approach is needed - test-track-treat-vaccinate-Covid appropriate behaviour. The letter written by Arti Ahuja, additional secretary of ministry of health and family welfare to Dr Pradeep Vyas additional chief secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, Maharashtra, highlights that there are 18 districts in the state witnessing a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases which is also driving the state figures.

The highest number of new cases in the past two weeks are being reported from Mumbai which has seen an 8% rise in the number of new cases reported between December 3 and December 9, as compared to the previous week. The central government had asked all states to increase testing to bring down the positivity rate to as low as 0.5% on November 27, in the wake of the new variant of concern, Omicron. Manisha Khatri, district collector at Nandurbar district said, “In the past 4-5 days we have increased our testing to bring it up to 220 tests per million per day which is more than the recommended guidelines of World Health Organisation which recommends about 140 tests per day per million population. Nandurbar district has about 1.6 million population, including adults and children. We are conducting random tests among super spreaders and if found positive then their contacts as well. Most of the cases that we find are asymptomatic and do not require any hospitalisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/18-of-36-districts-in-state-are-seeing-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-centre-101639591183513.html

But after 12 minutes, Ravi received a message on his mobile phone that a sum of ₹329.22 was debited from his bank account.Ravi alleged that despite approaching the bank several times, the amount was not reversed in his account.The complainant also approached the food joint that told him that refunding the amount was the responsibility of the bank concerned.However, the counsel for PNB contended that when the card of the complainant was swiped, there must have been a fault in the swiping machine (point of sale terminal), for which HDFC bank was liable to be held responsible.The commission, in its order, observed that there was no deficiency of service on the part of the eating joint and it charged the amount in cash only when the ATM card transaction failed.It further stated that no case of deficiency of service stood proved against HDFC bank as it was not established on record that the machine was faulty.The commission, however, allowed the complaint against PNB. “The entry is not shown to have been reversed by PNB at any point of time nor has any evidence been led by the bank to show that this entry was reversed at some later stage. PNB has further not placed on record any document to prove that the amount of ₹329 debited in the account of the complainant was actually transferred in the account of the eating joint. In the absence of any documentary evidence on this fact, it has to be presumed that the complainant was made to pay the amount of ₹329.22 twice,” read the order.Pronouncing its order, the commission ordered PNB to refund ₹329.22 to the complainant and also pay ₹3,000 as compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pnb-to-pay-ludhiana-man-3k-for-failing-to-issue-refund-for-failed-transaction-101639591117656.html
15-12-2021||Pune||Special schools want specific guidelines for classes reopening||PUNE Even as schools reopen from Thursday, schools for students with special needs are in a fix, as there is no clarification about these reopening, of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for these schools to function. Schools and parents across the city note that offline schools are important for special students and permission should be given to reopen.Roopa Salvi, a city-based special educator and counsellor said that offline schooling is important for special children, but keeping them safe is a very difficult task.“For special students with conditions like Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other forms of intelligence disability, it becomes difficult to make them wear masks and use sanitisation. Some students cannot wear masks due to their condition. These students also have weaker immunity and so keeping them safe is altogether difficult and important,” said Salvi. She added that online classes for special students are not very helpful either.“These students have a very short attention span. Making them sit in front of the phone for online lectures is not easy. Parents have had so many problems in the last year. In schools special students learn social skills and how-to follow their routine. Due to the last pandemic, they are forced into a very uncomfortable situation. And we teachers have to start all over again if schools start offline,” said Salvi.Sadhana Godbole, managing director, at Prasanna Autism Centre, said that special students need occupational and speech therapy which can prove more effective when done offline.“Autistic students who have borderline autism and learning disabilities are doing well with online classes, but that’s not the case with all students. And hence, offline classes are very important for special students. Autistic students need occupational therapy, speech therapy. These can be effective if the child comes to schools and has a proper routine. That hasn’t been possible due to the pandemic,” said Godbole.She added that if the government permits, offline classes will be resumed.“We are all prepared for the offline classes. We can take a class of at least 10 students and begin once the government permits. We are planning to teach on alternate days if the number of students increases. A proper directive can help special schools reopen, while following Covid-appropriate behaviour to keep the children safe,” said Godbole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/special-schools-want-specific-guidelines-for-classes-reopening-101639590942010.html
15-12-2021||Pune||Schools reopen in Pune: Parent consent likely to affect student attendance||PUNE On Wednesday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) gave its nod to schools for Classes 1 to 7 to reopen from December 16. The notification issued on Wednesday said that schools will reopen with just 50 per cent attendance of students and parents consent is compulsory.Moreover, in its notification, PMC has made a RT PCR test compulsory for teaching and non-teaching staff who have received just one vaccination doseExperts noted that prominent schools with larger numbers of students will need a few days before reopening. Many schools affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) may reopen after their winter vacations.Covid-appropriate behaviour is also mandatory at schools with regular sanitisation, wearing of masks and social distancing. The notification has emphasised physical distancing of students.Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association, said that there are only two per cent of teaching and non-teaching staff are awaiting their second dose.“These staff members are adhering to guidelines issued by the PMC and getting their RT-PCR tests done. However, not all schools may reopen from Thursday. Some big schools with a larger number of students may need a day to two to get consent from parents ahead of starting. This may cause a delay of a day or two,” said Gaikwad.Medha Sinnarkar, principal, Laxmanrao Apte Prashal said, “We are starting from Thursday, but it is likely that the turnout of students will be less. We are starting school so that parents get confident enough to send their children. Many parents were concerned over the Omicron variant. It is going to take some time for parents.” CBSE and ICSE schools to reopen after winter vacationsAs CBSE semester 1 papers for Classes 10 and 12 are ongoing, many schools have decided to reopen for offline classes a little later, after getting parents’ consent.Speaking about the reopening, Arti Sharma, principal at Army Public School Khadki said that the schools will reopen after the winter vacations.“We are reopening schools post winter vacations, gradually. Right now offline classes for 8 to 12 are ongoing. And the semester exams for classes 10 and 12 will get over by December 22. After the winter vacation we are planning to start offline classes for Class 6 onwards. And then gradually allow lower standards to come to the school,” said Sharma.Officials at Pawar Public School which is affiliated to the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) board said that the examinations are ongoing.“The examination will end by December 22 and post that the winter vacation will start. The school will reopen in January first week after the winter vacation is over,” said Uday Dalvi, in charge of administration, Pawar Public school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-reopen-in-pune-parent-consent-likely-to-affect-student-attendance-101639590643298.html
15-12-2021||Other||After south Bihar, jab list in north Bihar clinic names PM, other celebs||SAHARSA: A week after irregularities in RT-PCR tests were detected in Arwal district in south Bihar, a health centre in north Bihar’s Saharsa district is now under the scanner for irregularities in the vaccination list, officials said. According to officials, the list of those who got vaccinated at the Nauhatta community health centre (CHC) in Saharsa includes names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, celebrity Rakhi Sawant, Ranu Mandal, Ranveer Kapoor besides Saharsa district magistrate (DM) Kaushal Kumar and Saharsa superintendent of police (SP) Lipi Singh.Taking strong note of the irregularities, Saharsa civil surgeon (CS) Awadhesh Kumar directed medical officer of Nauhatta CHC Dr Ramesh Kumar Singh to lodge an FIR against the hired data entry operator of the health centre Akhil Anand under the Disaster Management Act, IT Act and under section 186 (Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).“After lodging an FIR, we have started scrutinizing all the lists of both vaccination and RT-PCR tests which have been done,” Kumar said, adding, “Those found guilty will not be spared.”Terming the mistakes as ‘very serious’, he said that so far over 32 names have surfaced. However, he did not rule out the possibility of more names emerging during the investigation. The civil surgeon said that the data entry operator who was hired at per day salary of ₹450 has been sacked with immediate effect.The data entry operator, against whom an FIR has been lodged, accused the medical officer of the irregularities. “This has been done at the behest of the medical officer and health manager. I was made a scapegoat as I had complained against medical officer Dr Ramesh Kumar Singh and health manager Raj Kumar Singh to the civil surgeon after they demanded a bribe from me for the sake of continuation of my service.”Modus operandiFacing mounting pressure regarding vaccinations or RT-PCR tests, data entry operators, make entries of voter identity cards in place of Aadhaar cards to block the mobile message, said an expert.“It is quite easy to enter a false name with fake voter ID cards,” said Nitish Bhardwaj, an IT expert. “Ever since Aadhar cards were made optional, it became much easier,” he said, adding, “Voter ID cards are not linked with mobile numbers, and hence there arises no question of identifying the person whose entry is being made.”During the investigation, it was found that mobile numbers entered were either invalid or inaccessible. “The mobile number used in the name of Prime Minister is of one Rahul whose number is inaccessible,” investigating officials said, adding, “The numbers used for celebrities are invalid.”Sources within the health department said that facing immense pressure from superiors, juniors commit such glaring mistakes.Earlier, in south Bihar’s Arwal and Gaya districts, the list of RT-PCR conducted and the persons vaccinated contained the names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and actress Priyanka Chopra . An FIR was lodged against the data entry operator, who was later dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-south-bihar-jab-list-in-north-bihar-clinic-names-pm-other-celebs-101639590579866.html
15-12-2021||Pune||Sentient Labs demonstrates hydrogen fuel cell bus||PUNE Sentient Labs, a research and development innovation lab, demonstrated indigenously developed hydrogen fuel cell bus in Pune on Wednesday. The hydrogen fuel cell technology has been developed in collaboration with Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) and Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI). Dr Raghunath Mashelkar, member of board of directors, Sentient Labs, said, “World over, efforts related to green hydrogen revolution are on, but Sentient Labs stands out. At Sentient, challenges that are core to India are understood, and solutions are developed. Digitisation, decentralisation and decarbonisation is what India needs for sustainable mobility and these innovations from Sentient will go a long way.” The fuel cell utilises hydrogen and air to generate electricity to power the bus, a statement released by Sentient stated. The only effluent from the bus is water, therefore making it possibly the most environmentally friendly mode of transportation. For comparison, a single diesel bus plying on long distance routes typically emits 100 tons of CO2 annually and there are over a million such buses in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sentient-labs-demonstrates-hydrogen-fuel-cell-bus-101639590398230.html

In terms of grants in aid from the Centre, the state has received a sum of ₹19,000 crore so far as against the projection of ₹54,531 crore. People aware of the development said the state’s internal revenue is hovering around ₹25,000 to Rs30,000 crore till November against the target of generating ₹40,000 crore.Additional chief secretary ( ACS), finance S Siddharth, however, refused to comment on the likely budget size for the next fiscal year or about possibilities that the total budget size would remain same as the current year .The ACS, finance also informed that there would be pre-budget consultations with various stakeholders and representatives from industry and other sectors as like previous years. “ Yes, we have had meetings with departments on budget,” he added.

Kumar, a 1989 batch sub-inspector of police was later promoted as DSP. He is the 10th government officer who is facing a DA case after his name cropped in an illegal sand mining case and sheltering mafias.The EoU sleuths raided his residences at Bhoot Nath Road, Kankarbagh in Patna, native place at Nutan Nagar in Gaya and Lavkush apartment in Ranchi (Jharkhand).The raids were being conducted after a search warrant was issued by the Court of Special Judge, Vigilance in Patna, officials familiar with the development said.During the search, EoU found that the DSP bought a flat (1250 square feet) at Kumhrar in Patna, 6.25 decimal land in Phulwarisharif Mauza, residential plot (1200 square feet) at Nandlal Chhapra valued ₹75.68 lakh, and a flat on the name of his wife in Law Kush Apartment, Ratu Road (Ranchi). Estimation of other plots and land, owned by the couple, is being done by a technical unit of the EoU. The agency, however, could not find cash and valuables from the DSP’s residence and flats. “The agency knew it that they might not able to recover currencies and valuables as officers under the radar were trading more cautiously due to several raids and searches in the recent past”, said additional director general (EoU) Nayyar Husnain Khan, adding that his name cropped up during the inquiry by EoU when he was posted as sadar SDPO, Aurangabad, in connection with illegal sand mining case.The EoU also recovered bank passbooks, incriminating documents from the flats.

15-12-2021||Lucknow||Sack MoS home: Akhilesh demands after SIT report on Lakhimpur case||Samajwadi Party (SP) president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, on Wednesday, demanded that union minister of state for home Ajai Mishra Teni should be sacked, immediately, because the SIT report has proved that farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence under a conspiracy.“The truth has come to the fore after the SIT report. If there is any morality left in BJP, then it should immediately sack the minister of state for home,” the SP chief said.Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra is the main accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed on October 3. The minister’s son has since been arrested, along with others.On the second day of his Vijay Rath Yatra in Jaunpur, Akhilesh addressed a huge crowd and alleged that it was people in BJP who hatched the conspiracy to crush the farmers to death.“As the election dates approach, the anger against BJP will increase. Fearing defeat, BJP leaders from other states will also come to Uttar Pradesh but to no avail,” he said.Akhilesh toured the five assembly constituencies in his ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’ in the second phase of the Jaunpur tour.He said that huge support to the yatra shows that the people want change in UP.“With the support of people, the cycle will remove the bull and the bulldozer,” Akhilesh said, adding, ”Every promise made by the BJP has turned out to be a jumla (rhetoric). The BJP’s advertisement is also false. The public will give a befitting reply to the BJP.”Akhilesh said that inflation and unemployment have increased under the BJP rule. “Today, the income of the public has halved, and the inflation has doubled. BJP’s promise of doubling farmers’ income turned out to be false. A farmer is not even getting the MSP rate for his crop. Unemployment is increasing continuously. This government is anti-poor and anti-farmer,” Akhilesh said.Akhilesh promised that if the SP comes to power formed after the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, he will give the best law and order to the people of the state.“Strictest action will be taken against those who break the law. There will be no discrimination against anyone. Roads and mandis will be built. Schools, colleges and hospitals will be opened,” Akhilesh promised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sack-mos-home-akhilesh-demands-after-sit-report-on-lakhimpur-case-101639589977791.html

15-12-2021||Kolkata||TMC's Abhishek Banerjee mocks BJP over Kolkata's Durga Puja bagging UNESCO tag||TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee Wednesday mocked the BJP over the city's Durga Puja bagging the UNESCO heritage tag, saying the saffron party’s "hoax" and "bigotry" during the assembly polls have been busted. The UNESCO on Wednesday accorded heritage status to Kolkata's Durga puja festival, bringing glory to the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee lauding the move. "Durga Puja in Kolkata has just been inscribed on the intangible heritage list. Congratulations, India," the organisation said in a tweet attaching a photo of the goddess with the hashtag' living heritage. Banerjee, who is also the nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, took a dig at BJP's poll campaign during the assembly polls where it had accused the TMC government of not allowing Durga Puja in the state for the sake of vote bank politics. "Two minutes of silence for @AmitShah and all the tall leaders at@BJP4India who, during their pre-election political tours, HILARIOUSLY CLAIMED that DURGA PUJA IS NOT CELEBRATED IN WEST BENGAL. Your BIGOTRY and HOAX has been BUSTED; you stand EXPOSED YET AGAIN!" Banerjee tweeted.Reacting to Banerjee's tweet, BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said though it is a proud moment for Bengal, the TMC indeed had tried to stop Durga Puja immersion. "We are all proud about it. It is a huge honour but at the same time, TMC should not forget that it had twice tried to stop Durga Puja immersion on Dashami as the dates of Muharram clashed with it. It is a fact," Ghosh said. The BJP, ahead of the assembly polls, had launched a campaign blitzkrieg with the saffron party leaders accusing the TMC government of not allowing Hindus to celebrate Durga Puja and observe its rituals properly in a bid to appease a certain section of people to pursue vote-bank politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmcs-abhishek-banerjee-mocks-bjp-over-kolkata-s-durga-puja-bagging-unesco-tag-101639588864272.html
15-12-2021||Patna||Spousal violence high among husbands who get drunk in dry Bihar||PATNA: Prevalence of spousal violence against women is as high as 83% among husbands who often get drunk in dry Bihar, says the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), 2019-20. The Bihar state report of NFHS-5 was released in Patna on Wednesday. The spousal violence prevalence reduced to 60% among husbands who got drunk sometimes, 43% in case of those who drink but never get drunk, and 34% in case of husbands who never get drunk, said Prof SK Singh of the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, which undertook the survey, and also the principal investigator of NFHS-5. “Around 15% of ever-married women reported that their husband drinks. The percentage of such men was, however, lower than many states due to prohibition in Bihar,” said Singh. Bihar introduced total prohibition on April 4, 2016. Most of the women who said their husband drink were from districts sharing boundary with Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal, he added. “We have analysed the availability of liquor in dry Bihar to two main reasons. First, liquor was flowing from border districts of Jharkhand, UP and Nepal. Secondly, country liquor was traditionally and culturally prevalent and home-brewed in districts having tribal population, sharing borders with Jharkhand,” said Singh. Bihar was second only to Karnataka (44%), as 40% of married women between 18 and 49 years were exposed to spousal violence, he added. Bihar and Manipur, with 40% married women each, were the two states reporting higher spousal violence over the last many years even as Bihar had shown a decline from 43% since NFHS-4 (2015-16), said Singh. Husband’s schooling also had a direct correlation, as 44% of those who indulged in spousal violence never went to school. The incidence reduced to 30% in case of husbands who had completed 12 or more years of schooling, the NFHS survey said. Even among women who have at least 12 years of education, more than one-quarter (28%) have experienced such violence. Only 1 in 9 women (11%) who have experienced violence have sought help to end the violence. Among the reasons respondents cited, justifying wife beating, included woman going out without informing her husband, neglecting the house or children, arguing with husband, refusing to have sexual intercourse with husband, not cooking properly, suspicion of infidelity, and showing disrespect for in-laws. As high as 55% of ever-married women cited 3 or 4 reasons above for wife beating, while 40% attributed it to all seven reasons. Among those ever subjected to spousal violence, 55% women were afraid of their husbands most of the time, 39% occasionally and 27% were never afraid, the survey said. Early marriage continues to be prevalent in Bihar – more than two-fifths (41%) of women aged 20-24 years got married before 18 years, the legal minimum age of marriage, almost unchanged in the four years since NFHS-4 (2015-16). Almost one-third (31%) of men aged 25-29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 at marriage, down from 35% in NFHS-4.

15-12-2021||Pune||Builders’ welcome PMCs solution of free treated water, but transport is expensive||PUNE To promote the zero liquid discharge policy, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) started a free service of giving sewage treatment plant (STP) treated grey water for construction sites to avoid wastage of potable drinking water. While many construction developers have welcomed this idea, the PMC themselves are yet to begin using it for their construction. As part of the PMC’s plan to reduce water usage in the city, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar recently gave green signal to the water department to give treated water free of cost to construction sites but charge them for transport or they should arrange their own. The city has 10 STPs that create 567 MLD of treated water, which is mostly released in the rivers. Everyday there are more than 100 tankers taking potable water to various construction sites in the city, thus to stop the wastage of both the treated water and potable drinking water, PMC arrived at this decision after having talks with the representatives of the construction industry. “We had the treated water checked for the PH levels in a laboratory which said in its report that is good for using this for construction sites. Potable water is used in plenty during construction for getting better concrete results, especially during curing, but looking at the amount of water being used and wasted, we have suggested this to the construction industry,” said Anirudh Pawaskar, head, water department, PMC. He added, “The ground water is depleting and there is a need for saving water,hence after a lot of deliberations, and meetings with the commissioner, we decided to get the STP treated water checked and to our surprise the result of the tests informed that this water could easily be used in construction industry, where lot of water is needed. Thus we decided to take the first step and today passed a circular for our departments like Roads, building permission to use this water for construction. This is PMC initiative and we will show that this water will indeed help save potable water from being wasted.”Ranjit Naiknavare, of Naiknavare Associates, vice-president, Credai, Pune said, “We are using the STP treated water in our construction sites in Balewadi, Vimannagar and other areas but mostly for curing and masonry work. Usually, it is the norm to use potable drinking water for concreting works for better results but we are happy so far with the decision.” Satish Magar, CMD Magarpatta City and chairman Credai National said, “We have always used STP treated water while constructing the townships. Infact, we welcome this move by PMC and it is a good decision for large construction sites, only drawback being the mounting expenses of sending tankers to fill up the water from the STPs, which is expensive and time consuming.” “STP treated water from a residential project which conforms to prescribed standards would be suitable for use in curing of concrete work and brick work. It would be also suitable for manufacturing fly-ash bricks. It can also be used for curing concrete roads. It is widely used in gardening, toilet flushing and pavement washing thus reducing dependency on fresh potable water. One must remember STP treated water is not suitable for human consumption. In order to encourage housing complexes to save water, electricity to STP should be provided at subsidized rates,” said Manish Kaneria, Mont Vert homesMeanwhile, both Public Works Department (PWD) and building permission department of PMC are yet make use of the free service. Shivaji Lanke, head of building permission said, “We had a meeting today and the circular was passed to begin using the STP water for construction of any of the PMC buildings. We will begin soon enough after circulating the circular among the contractors that work with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/builders-welcome-pmcs-solution-of-free-treated-water-but-transport-is-expensive-101639586976937.html

The Ugrahan group, however, has decided to continue sit-ins at toll plazas in Badbar, Mehal Kalan (SKM protest sites) of Barnala and Ladda and Kalajhar in Sangrur. The protest was also lifted from the Sangrur railway station. In Barnala, protesters ended their dharna at the City Railway Station parking on the 441th day, Manna Pindi and Sanghera Reliance petrol pumps and from outside the residences of BJP leaders Yadwinder Shunty and Archana Dutt. In Sangrur, farmers called protests from Kheri, Suman and Lehra petrol pumps.“Those toll plazas must give us in writing that they will not increase toll charges and we will end the protest there. Till the toll plazas continue with the hiked toll, our sit-in will continue,” said Joginder Singh Ugrahan, state president BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) who addressed farmers at Badbar toll plaza. “We have won a battle, but debt waiver and generating more employment are pending,” he added.Meanwhile, in Bathinda BKU general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said it was not acceptable that the private firms charge higher highway user fees from the public. “After 441 days, today our activists ended their ‘Pucca Morcha’ at 30 places including the residences of the BJP leaders, petrol pumps, business and trade centres of corporate houses. Toll booths will be allowed to resume operations only if they assure to charge the fees levied before October 1, 2020,” said Kokrikalan.Meanwhile, before calling off the agitation on Wednesday, union activists gathered in large numbers at places. A large number of senior women union leaders joined for community celebrations against the BJP-led central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-continue-sit-in-at-toll-plazas-which-have-hiked-charges-bku-101639579715510.html

The high court told NCB to give Khan at least a 72-hour notice to make the travel arrangements.The judge also modified another bail condition that required Aryan to furnish his itinerary to the NCB every time he travels out of Mumbai.The high-profile case got shrouded in controversy when a key NCB witness alleged that the agency’s Mumbai zonal chief Sameer Wankhede was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket targeting Aryan. The witness, Prabhakar Sail, also alleged that he was forced to sign sheets of blank paper, prompting the anti-drug agency to set up an inquiry into Wankhede.Experts also raised doubts whether the protocol was breached during the raid – private individuals like Sail’s employer Kiran Gosavi, who was arrested in Pune on extortion charges, were seen assisting officials and walking into the Narcotics Control Bureau office despite holding no official position in any law enforcement agency.While granting bail to Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha in October, Justice Sambre noted that the NCB claim that they should be considered to have the intention to commit an offence under the NDPS Act (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act), having found in possession of commercial quantity, in the backdrop of case of hatching conspiracy is liable to be rejected.No drugs were found in Aryan Khan’s possession while the quantity recovered from Merchant and Dhamecha were ‘small’ under the NDPS Act, the court noted. NCB has alleged it seized 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of MDMA ecstasy after its raid on the cruise ship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-high-court-exempts-aryan-khan-from-friday-visits-to-ncb-office-in-mumbai-101639578995510.html
15-12-2021||Mumbai||HC rejects Rashmi Shukla’s petition for quashing of FIR for data leak||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday rejected a petition filed by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla for quashing of the FIR registered by the cyber cell of Mumbai police in connection with leakage of her report on alleged corruption in transfers and postings of police officers in Maharashtra.The HC dismissed her petition primarily on the ground that she was not named in the FIR and hence, could not seek quashing of the same. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal said, “The impugned FIR prima facie discloses cognisable offences. Since the FIR discloses a cognisable offence, the police have a duty to investigate. No ground is made out to quash the FIR and to prevent any further investigation.” The court also rejected Shukla’s prayer for transfer of the case to the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) on the ground that the two investigations were different, with one being about the allegations contained in the report and the other being about leakage of the report. “Even if the contents of the petitioner’s report are found to be correct, the alleged illegal leakage of official documents will nevertheless constitute an offence, and this will not depend on the result of the investigation conducted by the CBI,” the bench said. The court directed the police that in the event of Shukla being named an accused in the FIR, she should be issued a 72-hour advance notice.The bench hearing Shukla’s plea had reserved its order on October 29 wherein senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani submitted that though the FIR did not name his client, the state was acting in a vindictive manner against her. The FIR was registered against unknown persons after BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis cited a letter purportedly written by Shukla to the then DGP about alleged corruption in transfers of police officers and details of intercepted calls. After the FIR was registered for alleged leakage of confidential data, the Shiv Sena-led ruling coalition alleged that Shukla, who was heading the State Intelligence Department (SID) at the time, resorted to tapping of phones without being authorised to do so by the relevant authorities. Jethmalani also submitted that Shukla had performed her duty as per the mandate given to her and maintained secrecy as per the law, however the state government wanted to scuttle the probe in the Anil Deshmukh case and hence was creating hurdles to avert judicial and CBI or ED (Enforcement Directorate) scrutiny of documents. He added that NCP leaders Nawab Malik and Jitendra Awhad had leaked information on the transfers and postings. In light of these submissions, Jethmalani said that the FIR was misconceived and hence, should be quashed. He also submitted that as the CBI was probing the corruption case, the court should direct the Mumbai police to handover the probe to the CBI with respect to the other aspect in the case.While opposing the petition, senior advocate Darius Khambata for the state government argued that Shukla was not named an accused in the FIR and the probe should be allowed to continue as the investigation was on a distinct issue and there was substantial material against Shukla. Khambata referred to the three pen drives that had been requisitioned by Shukla which contained information kept in the servers of the SID, and argued that while the investigators had been able to trace two of them, they were still searching for the third one and hence, Shukla’s interrogation was necessary and vital to the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-rejects-rashmi-shukla-s-petition-for-quashing-of-fir-for-data-leak-101639578157278.html

To date, state authorities have been conducting the census. Ferozepur divisional forest officer (DFO) Nalin Yadav said the exercise, expected to begin within a month, will help add a new dimension in the understanding of challenges that wildlife faces in an open sanctuary. “For the first time in Punjab, drones and other modern measures will be used for detailed enumeration of wildlife. Punjab is roping in the Dehradun-based institute for a more scientific and accurate method to ascertain a number of different species in the sanctuary,” the DFO added. Officials added that census should be conducted at regular intervals to ensure safety of the wildlife.“We had written to the WII, the apex national body of wildlife census, last year to undertake the enumeration. It was indefinitely postponed amid the Covid-19 crisis. Now, the institute has given its consent and the census is likely to commence by the first week of January in collaboration with Punjab wildlife experts,” Yadav addedLocated in the heartland of the environment-loving community of Bishnois, the Jambeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary is unique as it is owned entirely by private individuals or panchayats. A cluster of 13 villages in Sito Gunno tehsile was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1989 on the community’s demand to protect wild animals in their private lands.The community reserve is home to hundreds of endangered blackbuck, the state animal of Punjab, blue bull or nilgai, wild boar other species, previous censuses have shown. There is no restriction on public movement, members of the Bishnoi community voluntarily guard against poaching.According to the Wildlife Census 2011, there were about 3,500 animals and six years later, the headcount was calculated at about 3,200. Sources added that the last time such a survey was conducted was in 2017, by the Punjab wildlife department; its purpose was to audit the sanctuary ahead of the widening of the Abohar-Dabwali road (national highway-354E).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/national-wildlife-institute-to-conduct-its-maiden-census-in-abohar-sanctuary-101639578155483.html

Patra had then moved the sessions court challenging the magistrate's order.“The operation of the impugned order dated November 23 is stayed,” said additional sessions judge Sanjay Sharma said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 10, 2022.While allowing Atishi’s plea, the magistrate had said the doctored video may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.“The fact that the video was published on the Twitter handle of the proposed accused with the caption (Counting the benefits of the three farm bills) 'teeno farm bills ke laabh ginate hue... Sir jee', prima facie proves that the same was circulated with no intention but to cause the farmers to believe that Kejriwal is supporting the farm laws, which may have perpetuated the state of outrage with the protesting farmers and may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation,” Kapoor said.He further said a “thorough investigation” was required to be conducted considering the seriousness of the allegations and directed the SHO to register the FIR against Patra and initiate the probe.The directions had come on Atishi's plea which claimed that the alleged video contained statements that were diametrically opposite to the stand taken by the Delhi CM and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in respect of farm laws and caused discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of farmers.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-grants-interim-relief-to-bjp-s-sambit-patra-in-doctored-clip-case-101639572191286.html
15-12-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to quash CBI summons in Anil Deshmukh case||The Bombay high court on Wednesday dismissed the Maharashtra government’s petition challenging the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) summons to top state officials in the corruption case involving former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and the plea to entrust the probe instead to a special investigation team (SIT) headed by a retired HC judge. The CBI is conducting a probe into allegations of misconduct and corruption made against NCP leader Deshmukh earlier this year by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh, who resigned as the state home minister in April this year, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) last month in connection with a multi-crore money laundering case related to the corruption probe.The HC held that there was no merit in the claims of the state that the CBI was not entitled to conduct the probe. “There is no substance in the contention of the Petitioner that the Respondent- CBI is disentitled to carry out investigation in the matter. No case is made out for withdrawing the investigation from the Respondent- CBI and entrust it to the Special Investigation Team as prayed for,” HC said. The court also said that the Maharashtra government was not entitled to relief in this case.“Considering the totality of the circumstances including the conduct of the petitioner (State of Maharashtra) as noticed by the judicial orders and manifested from the record, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief in this petition,” the court said and dismissed the petition. Also Read: HC grants ED custody of Anil Deshmukh till November 12The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal had concluded hearing in the case on November 26 and reserved its order in the petition which apart from seeking transfer of the investigation to SIT had also sought a stay on the proceedings arising out of the summons issued by the agency to former Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and the current director general of police (DGP) of the state, Sanjay Pandey. The state had claimed that the CBI was harassing its top officers by issuing them repeated summons. The state government, represented by senior advocate Darius Khambata, had submitted that CBI probe into the allegations of Deshmukh’s involvement in the bribery case for transfers and postings of police officials could not be conducted impartially asSubodh Jaiswal, the current director of CBI, was part of the Police Establishment Board (PEB) that had recommended the names of the officers for transfers. Khambata had submitted that 92.6% of PEB recommendations were approved by the home ministry during Deshmukh’s tenure and hence the Central agency headed by Jaiswal could not conduct an impartial and independent investigation. Khambata added that CBI started issuing summons to top officers Kunte and Pandey after BKC cyber police station summoned Jaiswal in the illegal phone tapping and data leak case. DGP Pandey had challenged the veracity of the transcripts in the April 19 letter by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh to CBI, wherein he alleged that Pandey tried to coerce him into withdrawing the March 20 letter to the chief minister. Singh had levelled allegations of corruption against Deshmukh in the letter. For CBI, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi had argued that the contentions of the state that Jaiswal could influence the investigation was misplaced and stated that the petition was an attempt to scuttle and derail the investigation. He also argued that though Jaiswal was appointed as CBI chief in May, the current petition was filed belatedly and added that the investigation by CBI was ordered by HC on April 5 and was not a result of Jaiswal’s whim. Lekhi had further submitted that the reliefs sought by the state government against the summons issued to its two highest officers was not maintainable as the officers did not file the petition themselves and the reliefs sought by the state were only intended to influence and mislead the court. He had also submitted progress reports of the CBI investigation in sealed envelopes to HC and said that as the court was aware of the direction of the probe, constitution and transferring of the same to SIT was not required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-quash-cbi-summons-in-anil-deshmukh-case-101639568481411.html
15-12-2021||Mumbai||29-year-old who killed sister, her lover must hang, rules Bombay high court||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench has confirmed the death sentence to a 29-year-old labourer in Maharashtra’s Nanded district for killing his married sister and her lover in July 2017. The labourer, Digambar Dasre, and his brother Mohan, later went to the police station and confessed.“We are shocked to see the manner in which deceased Pooja and deceased Govind were subjected to death,” said the division bench of justice VK Jadhav and justice Shrikant Kulkarni while confirming the death verdict on Monday.“It was done not only with the sole intention to protect the honour of the family, but to punish both of them so also to make it a lesson for those who could dare to disobey the family,” the bench said.The murder, according to the prosecution, took place at a spot between Divshi and Nigva villages on July 23, 2017 – a day after Pooja left her matrimonial home and started to live with her lover, Govind in neighbouring Telangana’s Kharbala village.Digambar Dasre married off his sister Pooja to one Jethiba Varshewar on June 10, 2017. But barely a month-and-half later, she left without informing anyone and phoned Govind, telling him that she wanted to stay with him. Digambar knew about their relationship and kept on checking with Govind about his sister. When Govind switched off his mobile, Digambar figured that Pooja was him. Digambar and his brother Mohan went to Kharbala village. Digambar promised his sister that he will get them married and took them both to a location about 40km away. Digambar killed Pooja and Govind by slitting their throats. His brother Mohan helped him in executing the plan.Digambar then reported the brutal killings to Bhokar police station within whose jurisdiction the murders were committed. The two brothers were tried for the double murder and two years later, on July 18, 2019, an additional sessions judge at Bhokar convicted them. Digambar was sentenced to death while Mohan was sentenced to life imprisonment.The matter was referred to the high court bench for confirmation of the capital punishment handed down to Digambar. Digambar and Mohad had also challenged their convictions and the sentences handed down to them. The high court heard the reference and appeals together and on Monday rejected their appeals. While upholding the death sentence for Digambar, the two-judge bench referred to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bhagwan Dass’ case, observing that the so-called honour killings, for whatever reasons, come within the category of rarest of rare cases and as such deserve the death sentence and “it is time to stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on our nation”. This is necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilized behaviour. The high court observed that the crime did not occur on the spur of moment, but was craftily planned and meticulously executed. The bench said the family could have cut off social relations with Pooja after she left her matrimonial home and joined the company of her lover, but Digambar and Mohan killed both of them in a pre-planned and calculated manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/29yearold-who-killed-sister-her-lover-must-hang-rules-bombay-high-court-101639567163758.html

However, the respondent no.1 (Delhi government) has acted with vested interest and ulterior motive as incumbent chief secretary of Delhi has been actively associated with it at every level of administrative decisions and it has obliged the serving chief secretary to pay-back to it in forth coming election of MCD as the government had decided to extend the service tenure of incumbent chief secretary for more than five years..,” the plea said.It alleged that this “blatant decision” of the government as serious bearing and repercussion to the very foundation of democracy and the notification is not only improper but also illegal and against the settled principles of law and same may be declared as unconstitutional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-seeks-response-from-delhi-govt-over-plea-against-appointing-chief-secy-as-mcd-election-commissioner-101639560361728.html

15-12-2021||Kolkata||BJP’s demand for same-day civic polls in Bengal not granted by Calcutta HC||The Calcutta high court’s division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj on Wednesday did not entertain the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) petition seeking simultaneous elections to West Bengal’s 120-odd municipal corporations and municipalities. The bench also did not order a stay on the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls, scheduled on December 19, as sought by the petitioner, the BJP’s state vice-president Pratap Banerjee. The hearing on the petition ended on December 10 but the bench had reserved its order. During the hearing on December 6, the West Bengal state election commission (SEC) said it wanted to hold the elections in the remaining 22 districts in six to eight phases by May next year. Also Read: India’s clean energy gets more funding than coal for the third successive yearThe bench on Wednesday did not give the SEC a free hand in deciding the poll schedule and directed it to disclose in the next hearing, the tentative time schedule and the minimum phases required for holding elections in the remaining civic bodies. The matter will be heard again on December 23. “Keeping in view the observations made above, respondent No. 2 and No. 3 (West Bengal government and the SEC, respectively) are directed to disclose to this court, without any further delay, minimum phases in which elections for the remaining municipal corporations/municipalities in the state will be held, and the tentative time schedule giving earliest dates for holding such elections. We expect that respondent No. 2 and No. 3 will take a decision in this regard keeping in mind their responsibility to uphold democratic principles and to carry out the mandate of the Constitution,” said the court order. On the BJP’s petition for a stay on the KMC polls, the court said a similar petition was rejected on December 1. “We are of the opinion that the prayer made by the counsel for the petitioner for staying the KMC elections cannot be accepted and is hereby declined,” said the judges. During the last hearing on December 10, advocates for the petitioner cited some judgments of the Supreme Court and said that electronic voting machines (EVM) containing voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) are mandatory, but these will not be used in the KMC elections, according to the affidavit earlier filed by the SEC. Senior advocate Jayanta Mitra, who represented the SEC, countered it. He said EVMs given to the state by the Election Commission of India (ECI) for the municipal polls do not have the provision for VVPAT.On Wednesday, the order said, “The Honourable Supreme Court had clearly observed that the existing system is not doubted by the court so far as fairness and integrity is concerned, but had observed about increasing the machines, which are subjected to verification of paper trail to a reasonable number. These judgments are not relating to the local bodies’ elections, and in none of these judgments, it has been held that the elections shouldn’t be held if VVPATs are not used.” Expressing faith in the current system, the order said, “If the number of machines that are subjected to verification of paper trail can be increased to a reasonable number, it would lead to greater satisfaction among not only the political parties, but the entire electorate of the country. This is what the court should endeavour, and the exercise, therefore, should be to find a viable number of machines that should be subjected to the verification of VVPAT paper trails keeping in mind the infrastructure and the manpower difficulties pointed out by the deputy election commissioner. In this regard, the proximity to the election schedule announced by the ECI must be kept in mind.” Though the court rejected all the demands made by the BJP, the party’s national vice-president, Dilip Ghosh, said the legal exercise was necessary. “People of Bengal have to move the court for everything because they have no other option. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) never allows free and fair elections,” Ghosh alleged. Transport minister Firhad Hakim welcomed the court’s order, saying, “The BJP moved the court because it knows that it will not win a single seat in Kolkata.” With the polls barely four days away, the TMC intensified its activities. The party announced that chief minister Mamata Banerjee will campaign for the candidates in eastern Kolkata on Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjps-demand-for-same-day-civic-polls-in-bengal-not-granted-by-hc-101639559660820.html

The Himachal government had recently floated a bid for the ropeway project, for which a fresh agreement was signed with the Punjab government in 2019. However, it failed to find any takers. The project has been hanging fire for more than a decade. The plan for setting up the ropeway project was conceived in 2009 to connect two places of historical and religious importance to Sikhs and Hindus — Anandpur Sahib in Punjab with Naina Devi, located at an altitude of 1,177 metres on Shivalik hills of Bilaspur district in Himachal. Naina Devi is revered as the place where the eyes of Lord Shiva’s consort Sati fell after she set herself on fire and was cut into 51 pieces by Vishnu’s chakra. It is believed that Guru Gobind too went to Naina Devi and performed a yagna to seek blessings of the Goddess before leaving for his military campaign against the Mughals in 1756. More than 30 lakh tourists visit Naina Devi each year and the majority of them are from Punjab.“There were no bidders when we floated the tender, modalities and conditions laid in the tender will be reworked,” said Subashaish Panda, secretary, tourism. Himachal Pradesh government and Punjab government had floated a joint venture Shri Anandpur Sahib, Shri Naina Devi ropeway limited, which is headed by Punjab government’s additional chief secretary, tourism.The project was shelved owing to differences between the then Himachal chief minister Virbhadra Singh and former Punjab chief minister Prakash Singh Badal. The first memorandum of understanding (MoU) to execute the project between the two states was signed in July 2012, between chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and Punjab chief minister Prakash Singh Badal. The cost of the proposed project at that time was estimated at ₹85 crore. Congress when assumed reins shelved the project in June 2014. It was revived by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who inked a fresh MoU with his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh in 2018.The road distance between Anandpur Sahib and Naina Devi is 24.7 kilometres and the ropeway project will cut it down to 3.5 kilometres. The proposed ropeway alignment includes three terminals, with the lower one to be set up in Punjab and the intermediate and upper terminal to be set up in Himachal Pradesh. The ropeway would have the capacity to cater to at least 800 persons an hour per direction.

A case under sections 411 and 473 of the IPC has been now registered at the Sector-49 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-man-catches-hold-of-thief-with-activa-stolen-year-ago-101639519023875.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||UGC pay scales row: PU, college teachers protest in Chandigarh||Continuing with the demand for the immediate implementation of revised UGC pay scales as per the seventh pay commission by the Punjab government, teachers of Panjab University (PU) and affiliated colleges held a protest at Matka Chowk on Tuesday.The stir was a part of statewide education bandh under the banner of Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations (PFUCTO). The protest rally was organised by the Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) and Chandigarh unit of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers Union (PCCTU). Holding placards and raising slogans, the protesting teachers expressed their anguish and resentment towards the Punjab government for repeatedly making “false” promises and “befooling” the teaching community, which plays a significant role in educating these policy and decision makers. The teachers have decided to organise regular protests till their demands are met. PUTA in its statement said, “It is a pity that while the present government of Punjab keeps harping upon the importance of education for developing the state, the teachers of higher educational institutions have been forced to boycott all academic work and sit on the roads for their rights, which should have naturally come to them.”“It was therefore decided that if the government still fails to respond favourably to the demands of agitating teachers, intensified efforts would be strategized in future,” the statement added. A delegation of teachers also met some of the cabinet ministers of Punjab on Tuesday and submitted the memorandum of their demands to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-row-pu-college-teachers-protest-in-chandigarh-101639518846234.html

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Gandhi Bhawan conservation project at Panjab University gets off the ground||The conservation work for Panjab University’s Gandhi Bhawan will soon get off the ground as a tender for the first phase of the project, which has been in development for the last few years, was recently released. The first phase of the project will see the restoration of the building’s accompanying reflecting pool, following which the focus will shift onto the outer panels and roof of the building.The Conservation Management Plan for the iconic building was prepared by Panjab University. The varsity had been the recipient of the Getty Foundation’s 2015 Keeping it Modern grant. The US-based foundation has provided a ₹1.4-crore grant to the department of Gandhian and Peace Studies for the conservation project. Manish Sharma, head of the department, said, “The work on the first phase of restoration will begin soon and we expect it to be completed before the next monsoon season.”The conservation plan was arrived upon after extensive background research, testing of materials, and technical analysis by a team of experts and organisations including the DRONAH and IIT Madras.Restoration of the reflective poolThe restoration work of the building’s reflective pool will start with careful removal of floor tiles, which would be assigned numbers based on positions. The process will be followed up with the cleaning of individual tiles, which will later be reused to level the pool’s concrete bed.The water proofing project, meanwhile, will involve the filling of any cracks in the pool base and masonry joints with an elastomeric material and applying a waterproofing coat on the entire surface.Restoration of external panelsThe work on the exterior cladding panels will be carried out in the second phase. Site inspections were conducted between December 2020 and September 2021 for a visual assessment and drawings were prepared. The defects in the panels were thus identified.In addition to the removal and refixing of the dislodged panels, the refixing of previously removed panels will also be carried out. The third and last phase of the project will see the restoration of the building’s roof.Inaugurated in 1962 by Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the first president of independent India, the Gandhi Bhawan is a heritage building of architectural and cultural significance. The building is also a quintessential example of the modern buildings that came up during rapid expansion carried out in India in the 1950s and 60s. 
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Newer parts of Chandigarh ailing too||Even though parts of ward number 35 of the Chandigarh municipal corporation fall under the third phase of the city development plan, here too, a number of civic issues exist.The ward comprises Sector 48, Sector 49, Sector 50 and Sector 63. Before the fresh delimitation, these areas came under wards 13 and 22. Stray dog menace, poorly maintained vacant lands and absence of a regular bus service are among the key issues faced by residents here.Even though door-to-door garbage collection takes place in these sectors, there still remain pockets where garbage is dumped on vacant land pieces. Residents also complain about broken streets at many places.Ravinder Singh Nagpal, 68, a resident of Sector 49, said, “Cleanliness is missing in certain pockets and vacant plots have become dump yards. A regular bus service is also required in the ward.”A common sentiment echoed by many residents is that completion certificates should be awarded to housing societies in a fixed time, as they have been pending for years now.They also raised the issue that MC should undertake internal maintenance of the housing societies in every respect as they pay property tax as well as internal maintenance charges to the society managements.A resident of Sector 48, who did not wish to be named, said, “Although MC is actively fixing whatever issues come here, some of the vacant spaces have been turned into garbage dumping zones. Further the ward is adjacent to villages like Jagatpura in Punjab from where many rowdy and unruly drivers frequently enter the city and drive dangerously.”Residents also complained about unhygienic surroundings near the motor market in Sector 48. In Sector 49, they said sometimes the street lights do not work properly at night. “Street light repair work is needed in some areas,” said Bhupinder Kumar, a shopkeeper in Sector 49.Moving to Sector 63, even though the area is smaller compared to other sectors, residents here also have a list of problems to show. They complained about lack of night security, stray cattle and dilapidated parks.Dharmvir Ahuja, 64, a resident of Sector 63, said, “Although the flats here are newly constructed, the water pipelines were broken within a few years and the residents had to replace them on their own. We do not have any nearby market. A beat box for law and order issue is also missing.”Know your ward:Localities: Sector 48, Sector 49, Sector 50 and Sector 63General wardVoters: 24,000 Key issues:Stray dog menace Poorly maintained vacant landsNo regular bus service Broken street lightsStray cattle Dilapidated parksLocal voices:There is no cleanliness at certain pockets and vacant lands here are not maintained well.

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala domestic airport project gets first grant of ₹40 crore||The Union ministry of civil aviation has sanctioned a grant of ₹40 crore to begin the construction of the domestic terminal at the Ambala airport, Haryana home minister and local MLA Anil Vij said on Tuesday. The project is being taken up under the UDAN-3.0 scheme of the central government to boost regional connectivity. Under the project, the terminal will come up near Mama-Bhanja Peer on Jagadhri road in the vicinity of the airforce station from where passengers will be taken on a taxiway to board the aircraft. For flight operations, the airforce strip will be used, officials had said. “With this development, I hope the dream of having an airport in Ambala will soon become a reality. The process of construction of the domestic airport terminal will start now. The airport will facilitate flight operations to Lucknow and Srinagar,” Vij said in a statement. After hanging fire for almost two years due to the selection of land, officials of the district administration, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Cantonment Board Ambala had met in April this year and mutually agreed on the land and gates of the proposed airport. The officials agreed on the transfer of nearly 15 acres of empty defence land near the airforce station. It was agreed that one gate will open on the Jagadhri road and the other inside the station, so that the flight operations could take place safely. Vij had met defence minister Rajnath Singh at least thrice in New Delhi and defence officials several times in Ambala and Chandigarh to resolve the deadlock. It is pertinent to mention here that the Ambala airforce station is home to Rafale and Jaguar aircraft and is crucial to the armed forces amid tensions with neighbouring China and Pakistan. Earlier, the administration had identified land in Dhankaur, Dhulkot, Garnala and Barnala villages adjoining the station, but couldn’t proceed due to a range of issues.Last week, Ambala deputy commissioner Vikram had visited the proposed site and chaired a meeting with the officials concerned, asking them to speed up the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-domestic-airport-project-gets-first-grant-of-40-crore-101639518665148.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to get third air quality monitoring station by January 2022||After a second Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) was set up in Sector 22 this year, a third CAAQMS will be launched near the Sector 43 ISBT by January 2022, as per officials of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC).Currently, the city has two air quality monitoring stations in Sectors 22 and Sector 25, and three manual observatories at Sector 17, Sector 39 IMTECH and PEC in Sector 12. The Sector 22 CAAQMS was earlier a manual observatory, run by the CPCC, before it was converted. The CAAQMS are maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board and provide hour-wise pollution data, which isn’t available at the manual observatories.Speaking about this, member secretary of CPCC, Debendra Dalai said, “We have set up the third observatory near the Sector 43 ISBT and the nearby main road as the focus was on pollution caused by vehicular traffic.” Similarly, the Sector 22 observatory focuses on the market area of the city and Sector 25 deals with the outskirts of the city.The CPCC has been running test runs at the centre, which had been readied around October itself, but due to some electrical faults it wasn’t launched. “Initial tests conducted on it say it is ready for use. With the election code in place, it will be inaugurated and opened in January now,” Dalai said.The CPCC also started an air purification tower in Sector 26 this year to clean air within its 500-metre radius. “The department is looking at the data for the whole year to correlate air quality with the seasons and to ascertain how beneficial the tower has been for the city,” Dalai added.Air quality deterioratesWith the temperature dropping, the Air Quality Index (AQI) went past 200 at the Sector 22 CAAQMS on Tuesday morning. It touched 200 at 3am and kept rising during the day, reaching 252 at 6pm. Between 201-300, AQI is considered poor and can cause breathing discomfort to most people with prolonged exposure. The air quality was better at the Sector 25 CAAQMS where it stayed between 100 and 200.India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said with a western disturbance coming towards the region, the northerly winds which dispersed pollutants from the city’s air had stopped and due to falling temperature, inversion had also caused the AQI to rise. On Tuesday, the maximum temperature went down to 21°C from 21.1°C on Monday. The minimum temperature also dipped slightly from 8.8°C to 8°C. Highs and lows of 19°C and 7°C are expected over the next three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-get-third-air-quality-monitoring-station-by-january-2022-101639518663841.html

In his complaint to the police, Ganesh Singh, a resident of Baltana, said he visited the SBI branch in Sector 23, on December 9, to withdraw cash to make a payment. There, two men approached him while he was filling the withdrawal form for ₹99,000 and started helping him. The duo then told him to hold onto a wad of notes wrapped in a handkerchief and told Ganesh that they will withdraw his money for him. After withdrawing the money, the accused walked out of the bank with Ganesh and asked him to keep the money wrapped in the handkerchief, while leaving with his cash. But on opening the bundle, he realised, it contained only paper and no currency notes. On his complaint, police on Tuesday registered a case under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector-17 police station.

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||RITES to prepare roadmap to decongest Chandigarh roads by August 2022||The UT administration has set the ball rolling on the Chandigarh Mobility Plan by fixing August 2022 as the deadline for Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) to submit its plan for decongesting city roads.In a meeting, chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal to discuss the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Chandigarh tricity area, the administration asked RITES, which will start the work in January 2022, to submit its report within eight months. The meeting, attended by senior UT officials and representatives of RITES, was held at the UT Secretariat on Tuesday.Pal said, “We had a preliminary meeting with RITES and fixed the timelines for the study. They will have to submit different progress reports after every two months. There will be an inception report, collection of data, presentation of draft report and presentation of final report. The entire process will have to be completed within eight months.”In this meeting, study objectives and vision for sustainable mobility for horizon year 2041 were also highlighted.“RITES will update the data of the its 2009 report and prepare the plan as per the latest guidelines of the Union ministry of road, transport and highways (MoRTH). It will conduct scenario analysis of different mobility options in different sectors and then submit which mass rapid transport system (MRTS) is the best suited for the tricity,” said Pal.RITES will also offer options to integrate mobility plan with land use plan and determine the optimal mix of multi-modal public transport network.Focus on green mobilityThe focus of the mobility plan will be to provide safe, secure, efficient, reliable and seamless connectivity for residents of Chandigarh, added Pal.In addition to this, the officials also focused on low-carbon mobility plan for the city as the key area for Chandigarh Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP). It was stressed that the existing transport system with current and future demands for public transport system should be kept in mind.Notably, in November this year, the administration, in a major push to create an eco-friendly transportation in the city, accepted the United Kingdom’s offer to provide technical assistance to develop a sustainable mobility plan for the city.The broad objective of the UK-funded study is to provide support for de-carbonising the city’s transport and contribute towards the climate change agenda. The study will also focus on suggesting alternative eco-friendly transport system for the city.The work on this study is also set to start in January.“Both consultants will work together. They will also examine different international options. Then they will integrate their mobility solutions. Our focus is on the green options within the comprehensive mobility plan,” said Pal.MRTS plans revived in August this year After years in cold storage, MRTS plans were revived in August this year by the administration after it decided to go in for a fresh study on the comprehensive mobility plan for the city.The earlier RITES report, prepared more than a decade ago, was found to be outdated as the city’s requirements changed drastically during this period and also, the guidelines set by MoRTH of the MRTS project changed.With a population of over 12 lakh and 15 lakh registered vehicles, Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles per household in the country, leading to traffic congestion and snarls. In addition to these, over two lakh vehicles on interstate routes cross the city daily.Since the metro rail plans were shelved, the administration has not been able to opt for any other alternative, such as monorail, skybus or metrolite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rites-to-prepare-roadmap-to-decongest-chandigarh-roads-by-august-2022-101639518603756.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||BJP insulted Chandigarh people: Congress||The Chandigarh Congress on Tuesday accused BJP of insulting city people by not fulfilling the 15 promises the party made in its vision document in 2016. In a statement issued here, Rajiv Sharma, spokesperson of Chandigarh Congress, said the BJP has denigrated the sanctity of election manifesto as not only did it fail to fulfil any of the 15 promises it made, but also did not even try to take steps to implement them. He said the BJP did not even try to convert all leasehold properties into freehold ones. “The BJP totally failed to provide affordable residential houses to the people of Chandigarh in the last six years. They did not launch a single scheme to provide affordable houses,” he added. He further said that the BJP could not get the land allotted to residential, commercial, government and cultural, social, and religious institutions to the Chandigarh Housing Board for building affordable houses as per their third promise. “They went back on their other promise to allot residential houses to people in villages by getting the oustees rehabilitation plan passed. Such a plan did not come on the agenda of the BJP for discussion, leave alone passing and implementing it,” Sharma added. No new community centres in newly developed sectors of Chandigarh were built in last few years, he said. It was further stated that no progress was made to start new Jan Aushadhi Centres in hospitals and establish new schools. The promised ‘Film City’ is also nowhere to be seen, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-insulted-chandigarh-people-congress-101639518543572.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: ‘BJP only party capable of giving stable government’||Union minister of state for defence and culture Ajay Bhatt on Tuesday said that the people of Chandigarh have been introduced to the fact that development and trust are enshrined with the BJP. “This is the only party which is capable of giving a stable government to the city as well as at the Centre,” said Bhatt, who was in town to campaign for BJP candidates ahead of upcoming Chandigarh MC elections. Bhatt addressed a series of public meetings in support of party candidate Heera Negi (Ward 22), Bhupinder Sharma (Ward 34), Rashi Bhasin (Ward 10) and Vimla Dubey (Ward 9). Bhatt said the trust of the people is the capital of the BJP, which proved to be the constant force behind peoples’ representatives resetting the all-round development. Bhatt in his addresses said the elections are fought on the basis of development works. “The BJP that formed the existing municipal corporation is fully confident this time by the virtue of its deeds,” he said. Referring to the development of the country by PM Narendra Modi at the Centre, Bhatt said the mayors of Chandigarh have also maintained the tradition of ‘Jan Sewa’ at the grassroots level in the last six years. Taking a dig at the opposition parties, Bhatt said other parties do not have issues, so they are now misleading the people by creating misunderstandings, but educated people will no longer be misled by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-bjp-only-party-capable-of-giving-stable-government-101639518366232.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||War of videos intensifies as Chandigarh MC poll campaign enters its last phase||From the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) delivering a personalised message from Arvind Kejriwal to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) encapsulating its ‘achievements’ of six years in a one-minute video and the Congress ‘highlighting’ the BJP’s failures during its regime, a war of videos has started as the Chandigarh municipal poll campaign enters its last week. These videos are being shared on different social media platforms, but it is the WhatsApp and Telegram on which the parties are using the ‘groups’ to reach out to as many people as possible. The party workers are being encouraged to form these groups and share content while Chandigarh residents are being encouraged to join these. Candidates and parties are also sharing messages directly with the people of city. The videos are generally less than one minute with infographics and catchy background music. Though the parties are sharing same kind of media to amplify their campaign messages, their strategy and focus differ largely. AAP’s Delhi model For the AAP contesting its first MC election in Chandigarh, the focus is on its ‘Delhi Model’ and Kejriwal as its main icon. “Hello haanji namashkar ji, main Arvind Kejriwal bol raha hoon…” is how the pre-recorded video message from the AAP supremo starts as he seeks votes from Chandigarh residents. Referring to the city slipping in Swachh Survekshan rankings, Kejriwal goes on to assure in the video that the party will once again make Chandigarh the ‘City Beautiful’ and ‘free of corruption’. In its video messages, the AAP is also focusing on the ‘guarantees’ it is promising to the voters. “We are also highlighting the failures of both the BJP and the Congress in the last 25 years of their rule. With the campaign being run in the background of the Covid pandemic, the party is using these videos extensively across different platforms,” said Prem Garg, Chandigarh AAP convener. The AAP is also encouraging its candidates to share their individual videos, though the focus on the ‘Delhi Model’ remains there too. BJP drums up its achievementsBJP’s video begins with “Chandigarh BJP sarkar ke kaam sirf 60 second mein, aankh na jhapakna…” and goes on to list more than 60 development works completed by the party in the last six years of its MC rule. Other BJP videos take sector-wise approach and describe what the party has achieved in these areas in terms of education, senior citizen welfare, health and infrastructure. “Development is the main poll plank for the party in the MC elections. So, it is now about our achievements in the videos, and nearer to election day we will share our vision for the Chandigarh’s future. We are getting tremendous response from residents,” said Arun Sood, BJP’s Chandigarh state president.In addition to Chandigarh BJP’s Twitter and Facebook handles, party workers are also sharing these videos on WhatsApp and Telegram groups. Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher, with more than 4.2 lakh followers, is also actively sharing videos on her Twitter account. Congress’ street playsThe Congress campaign videos primarily highlight the ‘failures’ of the BJP in the last six years. Also, some show how the city ‘gained’ during the 15-year rule of Congress. Party’s city chief Subhash Chawla also regularly shares his videos in attempt to brief the electorates and give response to the rival parties on different issues. But with the AAP and the BJP having a head start over the Congress in terms of campaign videos, the party has now introduced street plays (nukkad nataks) as a campaign tool. The theme though remains the same: ‘Failures of BJP in last six years’. Volunteers of the party from Punjab and Chandigarh have been roped in to highlight the problems faced by the residents of the city. City slipping in swachh rankings, Dadumajra garbage dump, taxes, and inflation are some of the common themes.

In the survey, 12,622 men and 9,365 women were included from the age group of 18 to 35,” said Sharma.He said the AAP would provide free 20,000 litres of drinking water, Wi-Fi hotspots, smart parkings, and free-of-cost facilities to the residents after winning the MC elections with an absolute majority. Apart from this, the party will also provide free garbage collection facility to the people under a mechanism, he added. Sharma further said that free e-rickshaws will also be made available for the residents. Free ambulance facility will be provided in every ward of the corporation and booking of all community centres will be free for the prayer meetings for the dead, the party’s election campaign incharge said. Sharma said that working women in Chandigarh find it difficult to keep their young children in crèches. “To get rid of this problem, crèches will be built in every ward of the city, where women will be able to drop their children by paying a nominal fee,” he said, adding that baby minders (aayas) will also be appointed and safety of children would be ensured. “All these free services will be provided by tapping into the full potential of advertising spaces in the city. We will also rope in CSR funds. We have already talked to them and soon after the AAP wins elections, we will introduce these,” said Sharma.The party will incorporate the findings of the survey in its manifesto, which it is likely to release in a couple of days, he added. Kejriwal in city on December 19AAP supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will be in city on December 19. Party co-incharge Pardeep Chhabra said, “Kejriwal will hold a public rally. This will give a boost to the party in the coming MC polls.” Kejriwal is one of the star campaigners of the party.Earlier, the party had planned a roadshow for Kejriwal’s visit, but with the state election commission’s Covid guidelines prohibiting road shows, it was dropped, Chhabra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/committed-to-making-chandigarh-no-1-again-aap-101639517883626.html

According to the police, the suspect did not inform the woman that he was already married, and allegedly murdered her when she began asking him to marry her.The police said the victim’s mother filed a missing person complaint at the DBG Road police station in central Delhi on Friday.The police checked CCTV cameras from the workplace and found that she had left around 7pm. A case of kidnapping was registered and investigation taken up, said deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Singh Chauhan.DCP Chauhan said that on Sunday, the Surajkund police found the woman’s body in a forested area, following which her parents identified the body as their daughter’s. The police said a dupatta was found tied around her neck, suggesting that she was strangled to death. Accordingly, the murder charge was added to the kidnapping case.During subsequent investigations, the police team scanned CCTV cameras of the neighbourhood where the woman worked and found that on Thursday, the woman had gone to a cake shop in the neighbourhood with an unknown man, later identified as Asif. The police then arrested him and based on his call detail records, he was found to be in constant touch with the victim over the phone.“We questioned Asif and he confessed to killing her,” added the DCP.During questioning, the police said, Asif revealed that he befriended the woman while working in the house. The woman later expressed a wish to marry him but since he was already married, he allegedly hatched the plan to murder her, police said.He allegedly asked her to meet him in Karol Bagh on Friday, and the two later went on his bike to a hotel in Faridabad where he reportedly tried to come clean about his marriage and promised to divorce his first wife.However, an altercation allegedly broke out between them and Asif allegedly pacified her by promising to marry her the next day.He allegedly took the victim to a forested area on Saturday where he attacked her with a kitchen knife, the DCP said.“In the ensuing scuffle, the knife broke and fell on the ground. Asif panicked and finding no option, he strangled her using her dupatta. To avoid suspicion, he resumed his duty at the workplace on Sunday,” added DCP Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-kills-delhi-woman-after-hiding-from-her-that-he-was-married-101639516888261.html

Varinder Kumar Sharma, deputy commissioner, along with senior Air Force officers, paid tribute to Sekhon by laying a wreath as the Punjab Police presented the Guard of Honour. Sekhon, born on July 17, 1943, was commissioned in Indian Air Force on July 04, 1967. He is remembered for exhibiting immense courage at the time of the December 14, 1971 attacks at the Srinagar Air Field, during the Indo-Pak war. Despite being under attack, Sekhon displayed exceptional flying skills and took off to counter the six-aircraft-strong Pakistani attack, destroying two enemy aircrafts and forcing the others to return. Being heavily outnumbered, Sekhon eventually made the supreme sacrifice in the service of the nation and was martyred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-admn-pays-tribute-to-param-vir-chakra-recipient-nirmanjit-singh-sekhon-101639516624052.html

The committee has been directed to look into every aspect and possible reasons behind the fire. The members have also been instructed to submit a report to the environment department within two days, after which appropriate action would be taken to ensure such instances do not occur in future,” said Rai.The Bhalswa landfill comes under the jurisdiction of the BJP-ruled North MCD. Elections to the three municipal corporations are scheduled for early next year.“It was discovered that due to the fire at the Bhalswa landfill site, piles of garbage were spilled everywhere around the site and the smoke made the air barely breathable for the people around. Reportedly, many such unfortunate instances of fires have taken place in the past, but the North MCD has not taken any action to prevent them,” said Rai, adding that landfill fires are a major contributor to Delhi’s air pollution.North MCD spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking a comment.On Monday, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that small fires in landfills are common across the world, and attributed it to gas build up. “The issue has been raised after two days and a small fire has been exaggerated to be a major incident,” he said, replying to an earlier AAP charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-appointed-3-member-panel-to-look-into-bhalswa-landfill-fire-101639516276153.html

Dhindsa assured the members that the matter will be taken up by the department on priority.Supreet Kaur, president of EcoSikh, said, “The action plan was submitted by the directorate of environment and climate change, department of science, technology and environment, government of Punjab, to the National Green Tribunal on April 30, 2019. We want the departments concerned to start implementing what they have been promising, so that some improvements on the ground can be seen.”Gagnish Khurana, who has been working on clean air initiatives for many years, said, “The action plan has three major points concerning the police, which were highlighted in the memorandum. First, the pollution certificate check of vehicles should be strictly enforced to ensure better compliance. The number of challans in Ludhiana have come down from 11,315 in 2018 to 1,178 in 2020. This should be tightened to ensure better compliance with pollution norms. Secondly, the WhatsApp number promised in the action plan for citizens to report vehicle pollution related cases should be started as soon as possible. Also, the synchronised traffic light system promised in the action plan should also be implemented on priority. “Kapil Arora from Council of Engineers, Jaskirat Singh of Naroa Punjab Manch and Gurpreet Kaur of EcoSikh were also part of the delegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngos-want-ludhiana-police-to-implement-clean-air-plan-in-city-101639516277846.html

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Court extends stay on demolition of former Jammu and Kashmir deputy CM till Jan 28||The judicial member of J&K special tribunal, Jammu, Rajesh Sekhri on Tuesday extended the stay against demolition of a house belonging to former deputy chief minister Nirmal Singh and his wife Mamta Singh in Nagrota, till January 28. The special tribunal allowed Nirmal Singh and his wife to file objections in an application filed by whistleblower advocate Muzzaffar Ali Shah. Shah has sought his impleadment as party respondent in the appeal filed by Mamta Singh against the demolition order of their house situated at Ban village, Panjgrain (Nagrota). During the hearing, advocate Adarsh Sharma, appearing for JDA, filed a detailed reply and objections to the appeal preferred by Mamta Singh. In the objections, JDA stated that the area of village Ban/Panjgrain (Nagrota) was notified in the local area limits of JDA, as such, any person who undertakes/intends to construct something in the land notified in the local area limits outside JMC limits has to take a valid legal building permission for construction from JDA, as it is the custodian of the master plan. JDA has also denied the stand of the appellant of Nirmal Singh and his wife Mamta Singh with regard to the completion of the construction of their house in 2017. The JDA, in its reply, categorically submitted that the appellant constructed the house without permission from the competent authority as the area. The plot is part of land measuring 12 acres purchased by some senior BJP leaders through a company Himgiri Infrastructure Development Limited, of which Mamta Singh was a shareholder. A month after construction of the house started in October 2017, the Army informed and requested the then deputy commissioner, Jammu, through a letter on November 2, 2017, to order the police authority and civil administration concerned stop it since the activity was in violation of the Works of Defence Act, 1903. Nirmal Singh was then the deputy CM. The Army had also lodged a written complaint before SHO Nagrota on November 27, 2017, and also approached Jammu SSP on December 12 for registration of an FIR. However, there were no action, which compelled the then Corps Commander 16 Corps Lt General Saranjeet Singh to write a letter on March 19, 2018 to Nirmal Singh, who was deputy CM then. Army then moved the High Court in May 2018 and the matter is sub-judice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/court-extends-stay-on-demolition-of-former-jammu-and-kashmir-deputy-cm-till-jan-28-101639514822654.html
15-12-2021||Delhi||Do not seek sympathy, it will stereotype you: Delhi HC judge to women lawyers||Delhi high court judge, justice Prathiba M Singh, on Tuesday advised women lawyers to not seek sympathy from the court, lawyers and even their clerks, saying that “it stereotypes them”.Speaking on the achievements and challenges of women at the Bar at an event organised by “Women in Law and Litigation”, justice Singh also said that women should know how to manage their time in a competent manner. The event was organised to felicitate justice Hima Kohli, a Supreme Court judge.“Don’t seek sympathy from the court or from lawyers on the other side or even your clerk. You don’t have to tell them that my child is unwell, I have to pick up my daughter from school. Please don’t do that... That stereotypes you,” she said.Justice Singh, who was elevated as a judge of the Delhi high court in 2013, said that women should not keep a “sacrificial mentality” and keep helps to assist her.“Always keep a domestic help, a driver. Don’t think that ‘I have to sacrifice’. Sacrificial mentality is not required for women. You just have to fight it. Always keep a driver because then you can work in the car,” she asserted.She exhorted women lawyers to face all the stress with a smile: “Your child may feel ‘mummy ghar pe nahi hoti (mummy is not at home)’ but one day, he/she will be proud that you are a lawyer.”She also praised the Delhi high court and described it as the most cosmopolitan court where religion, caste and marital status are irrelevant, even though she said that women who make it as senior lawyers at the court often had to work twice as hard as their male counterparts. Justice Singh suggested that women lawyers should be well read and should not shout in the courts.“Pick your battles and don’t fight with everyone…Don’t shout in the court...else people will say, ‘Bhaisahab, badi ladaki hai’. Also, don’t be too soft... otherwise they will say, ‘aawaz nahi nikalti’,” she said as the entire gathering burst out in laughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/do-not-seek-sympathy-it-will-stereotype-you-delhi-hc-judge-to-women-lawyers-101639513952517.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||5 of extended family killed, 2 hurt in Ramban road mishap||At least five people, including the driver of the ill-fated Tempo Traveller, died when the vehicle veered off the road and plunged into a 500-ft deep gorge in Ramban district, said officials. Ramban district commissioner, Mussarat-ul-Islam, who rushed back to the spot, said, “Those who died were part of an extended family. The dead include four women and the driver while two other occupants, who sustained injuries, have been shifted to Ramban district hospital.” The DC said the family was returning home to Doda from Ramban after offering condolences to the family of ASI Ghulam Hussain Bhat. Bhat was among two policemen killed in Srinagar on Monday after terrorists targeted a bus carrying policemen. The DC said prima facie it appears that the driver of the ill-fated vehicle failed to negotiate a sharp bend that caused the accident. “It is a very remote and hilly area with no parapets by the narrow and congested road. The driver, it appears, failed to negotiate a sharp curve,” he said. The DC, who had also gone to meet the family of the deceased ASI, had rushed back to the accident site and monitored the rescue operation. The vehicle fell from Chanderkote-Kastigarh link road, into Chamutri Nullah at Chilai in Chuchater village in Rajgarh tehsil of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-of-extended-family-killed-2-hurt-in-ramban-road-mishap-101639514042684.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||‘Pak trained terrorist’ killed in Poonch, aide on the run||Security forces on Tuesday gunned down a foreign mercenary, specially trained to operate in Rajouri-Poonch area with a possible aim of orchestrating a strike in Behramgala area of Poonch district, said officials. He was identified as Abu Zarara. “In a successful joint operation, Indian Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police eliminated one terrorist in Behramgala. The operation was launched on Monday, after receiving specific intelligence on presence of armed terrorists in the area,” said defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand. “During the encounter in early hours of Tuesday, the terrorist attempted to escape while opening fire at security personnel. However, he was neutralised in the ensuing fire,” Lt Col Anand added. An AK-47 assault rifle, four magazines and pouches have been recovered from the slain terrorist. “The Pak-trained terrorist was first detected in August this year. He was probably part of Pakistan’s efforts to revive terrorism in South of Pir Panjal. While the terrorist and his accomplice have been on the run, taking shelter in deep jungles for the past few months, their need for food, clothing and communication (mobile) forced them to contact civilian population,” said the spokesperson. Indian Army, in joint effort with the police, monitored this mobile communication on a near real-time basis while the locals provided crucial information on the movement of suspects. “This enabled the security forces to corner the terrorists, force them to get away to higher reaches of Pir Panjal ranges despite onset of winters,” he added. As the terrorists got isolated and moved away from civilian populated area, security forces launched a clinical operation after receiving a specific input from locals in Behramgala area. “The terrorists attempted to get away by opening fire on security forces, but this foreign terrorist was eliminated in return fire, while his accomplice is on the run,” he said. “The recovery of AK- 47, four magazines (filled), one grenade & some Indian currency clearly reveal Pakistan’s complicity with this terrorist,” said Col Anand. This was the eighth terrorist to be eliminated this year in the region. Recently Haji Arif, a dreaded terrorist guide was also eliminated on the LoC in the Rajouri sector.

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege case: Punjab Police SIT grills dera head in Sunaria jail for second time||The Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases on Tuesday visited the Sunaria jail in Haryana’s Rohtak district again and questioned Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for the second time in less than two months. The SIT led by Ludhiana range inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar asked around 90 questions from the sect leader during his six hours grilling over his alleged role in the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in faridkot district on June 1, 2015, and the subsequent sacrilege incidents. An official privy to the development said the questions were asked to bring clarity as the replies of Ram Rahim during his previous interrogation and that of sect vice-chairperson Prithvi Raj Nain were contradictory. The team will now file a second status report on Ram Rahim’s interrogation, including a copy of the questionnaire and replies, in the Punjab and Haryana high court before December 17, when the matter is scheduled for hearing on his pleas seeking anticipatory bail and quashing of production warrants issued by a Faridkot court. The move is also seen as an attempt by the SIT to counter Ram Rahim’s another plea demanding that the CBI be asked to continue probe into the 2015 sacrilege cases and the SIT probe be stayed. The SIT is likely to push for the dera chief’s custodial interrogation in Faridkot on production warrants citing his ‘non-cooperation’ during the questioning in the Sunaria jail. IGP Parmar said, “We put more questions before Ram Rahim to crosscheck certain aspects as many queries arose after Nain’s interrogation. Again, most of the replies of Ram Rahim were evasive. A status report will be filed in the high court on his interrogation.” The SIT had prepared a new set of questions for Ram Rahim on the basis of 200 queries asked from Nain and documents collected from the dera headquarters in Sirsa. The SIT on December 10 visited the dera headquarters and questioned Nain for more than four hours. Nain answered 75 questions and requested to discontinue citing health issues. On this, the SIT gave him a list of 125 questions to which he submitted his replies on Monday. On November 8, the SIT had asked 114 questions from Ram Rahim during his 7-hour grilling in the S jail and submitted a 65-page status report in the high court four days later. In the report, the SIT claimed that the conspiracy of desecration of Sikh scriptures was hatched at the sect’s administrative block in Sirsa and that the followers never acted without the permission of Ram Rahim. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera followers, the SIT-led by then inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra had named Ram Rahim and sect’s three national committee members—Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri—as accused in the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala sacrilege case. Last month, sect administration wing chairperson Vipassana Insan and Nain were summoned on multiple occasions by the SIT but they failed to appear. While the SIT managed to question Nain last week, they are still to trace Vipassana. 
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chargesheet filed against Sukhbir Badal, others in Zira court in 2017 road blockade case||Police have filed a chargesheet against Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and others in a 2017 road blockade case in a Zira court in Ferozepur district. The challan was filed on October 21 but the matter was not reported yet. Activists Parvinder Singh Kitna of SBS Nagar, Kuldeep Singh Khaira of Ludhiana and Hakam Singh of Chandigarh had approached the high court in 2019 seeking action against the Akali leaders who were booked for causing road blockades across the state. In a press statement issued on Tuesday, the activists said the case was registered against Sukhbir at the Makhu police station. According to details uploaded on the Zira court website, the first of the four hearings so far took place on October 21. The court adjourned the matter to January 11 next year in the last hearing on November 29. On the activists’ plea demanding action against the Akali leaders, the HC has fixed the next hearing on March 17 next year. On December 8, 2017, the police booked Sukhbir, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia and other party leaders in a criminal case on charges of blocking the Harike bridge and obstructing traffic in protest against the Congress government after some party candidates were prevented from filing their nomination papers in the civic body polls. The Akalis had also blocked the roads at Beas, Phillaur, Balongi, Sirhind, Sangrur, Sunam, Mansa, Ludhiana, Rampura Phul, Bhikhi and Pathankot in the state. A case under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 283 (causing danger or obstruction in public way), 431 (damage to roads and bridges), 188, 148 of the Indian Penal Code and section 8-B of the National Highway Act, 1956 has been registered at Makhu police station for blockade at Bangaliwala Pul, near Harrike. They said that Ludhiana police had filed chargesheet against the Akali Dal leaders, including MLAs Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and Manpreet Singh Ayali besides Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, former minister Hira Singh Gabria and others in a Ludhiana court on September 9 this year for the blockade of national highways. Also, SBS Nagar police had filed a chargesheet against Akali Dal MLA from Banga Sukhwinder Sukhi and others on September 13 this year. “The Pathankot police had also filed a challan against the Akali Dal leaders, including former minister Desh Raj Dhugha, in the case in the same matter. Interestingly, the Kapurthala police filed closure report in the case which was registered against former Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Jagir Kaur at the Dhilwan police station for blocking the national highway. The report was accepted by the Kapurthala court,” the activists said. 
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls 2022: Malwa’s power centre Bathinda set for keen contest||Bathinda district has six assembly constituencies, the highest in the seven districts of Malwa. Five segments are part of the Bathinda Lok Sabha seat, while Rampura Phul is part of Faridkot parliamentary constituency. The district, considered the power centre of south Punjab, was among the key places from where the Aam Aadmi Party had performed best in 2017 as three of its candidates won from Talwandi Sabo, Maur and Bathinda Rural. Later, however, AAP legislators Jagdev Kamalu and Rupinder Kaur Ruby switched sides to join the Congress. With the Shiromani Akali Dal pulling out all stops to regain its predominantly rural stronghold, 2022 is going to be a keen contest. Bathinda Urban: Cong hopes to buck anti-incumbencyRepresented by Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, Bathinda Urban is one of the most-watched assembly contests. The constituency has given Punjab two finance ministers in Surinder Singla (2002) and Manpreet Singh Badal (2017). The urban seat with a sizeable number of government employees has become a hub of protests with them targeting the minister for the lack of will to hike their financial benefits. The closure of Punjab’s oldest thermal power plant, the poor stormwater management and delay in relocating the city’s bus stand are issues that matter. Since the first assembly elections in 1957, the Congress got the mandate on seven occasions and the incumbent MLA relies heavily on the political management by his brother-in-law, Jaijeet Singh Johal, alias Jojo. For the first time, the Congress won the Bathinda municipal corporation elections this year and hopes to improve its performance in 2022. Bathinda has an interesting trend though, of not electing an MLA for the second time since 1985. Bathinda Rural: A SAD fortress breached by AAP This rural segment was earlier called Pakka Kalan and the Shiromani Akali Dal held sway till the last elections when political novice Rupinder Kaur Ruby of the Aam Aadmi Party won by a handsome margin. But last month, the low-profile MLA quit the AAP to join the Congress after Charanjit Singh Channi assumed charge as chief minister. She is now keen to contest from Malout (reserved) seat in Muktsar district. The SAD has fielded former MLA Parkash Singh Bhatti from here. A turncoat, Bhatti was elected from Balluana in Fazilka as a Congress candidate in 2002 and he contested as the Akali candidate in 2017 but lost. Congress leader Harvinder Singh Laddi, who finished third in the last election is again staking claim for the seat. He has been a vocal opponent of his friend-turned-foe Manpreet Singh Badal, the state finance minister. Poor irrigation facilities and the underdeveloped industrial area are key poll issues. The Bathinda cantonment with an estimated 9,000 voters is a part of this segment. Talwandi Sabo: Face-off between veterans & young gunsTalwandi Sabo, which is home to one of the five temporal seats of Sikhism, Takht Damdama Sahib, has been represented by Jeet Mohinder Sidhu four times. In 2002, he won as an Independent and twice as the Congress candidate. He switched loyalty to the SAD in 2014 and in the bypoll in the same year, he won by over 40,000 votes. In 2017, he suffered a humiliating defeat from Baljinder Kaur of the Aam Aadmi Party. This time too, Sidhu is the Akali nominee from the rural constituency and faces Baljinder Kaur. The Congress faces an internal feud between Khuzhbaz Jattana, who lost the last elections, and party veteran Harminder Singh Jassi. A relative of jailed Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, Jassi won the seat twice. The segment has dera followers in different villages who Jassi has pinned hopes on. Among key issues being raised by the voters are an upgrade to the five-bed civil hospital and construction of a railway overbridge.Rampura Phul: A game of ping pong between SAD, CongA constituent of Faridkot Lok Sabha seat, this rural constituency has seen a direct poll battle between two local stalwarts. In the last four elections since 2002, veteran Akali leader Sikander Singh Maluka and Gurpreet Singh Kangar of the Congress have taken turns to retain the seat. This time, the SAD faced dissidence when Maluka was denied the ticket from Maur segment in Bathinda. Maluka wanted his son Gurpreet Maluka to be fielded from Rampura Phul but party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal rejected the demand. Kangar, who was removed from the state cabinet after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned as CM in September, is lobbying to retain the Congress ticket, whereas the AAP has fielded Punjabi singer Balkar Singh Sidhu. Amarinder’s ancestral village of Mehraj falls in this segment. Poor quality drinking water and the absence of a proper sewage system in nagar panchayats are common complaints here. Bhucho Mandi: A haven for parachute candidates, so farFormerly called Nathana assembly segment, Bhucho Mandi is a predominantly rural seat. In the last election, Pritam Singh Kotbhai of the Congress had defeated AAP’s novice candidate Jagsir Singh by a narrow margin of 645 votes.However, the tenure of this first-time legislator, who is a moneybag from Muktsar district, was mired in controversies. He faced criminal cases in chit fund scams in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.Fielding outsiders, the Congress has been retaining the seat for the last three polls. However, the locals are now increasingly voicing their concern about feeling “unrepresented” by parachute candidates.Meanwhile, residents in the rural belt, including Lehra Mohabbat and Nathana, have been demanding to revert from nagar panchayat to gram panchayats. They complain of exorbitant taxes being charged by the urban local body for various utility services and a plethora of permissions before undertaking any work.The seat has a considerable number of followers of Dera Sacha Sauda and could impact the results if they go for a collective decision.Maur: Akali stronghold where blast wounds still fester The entry of SAD leader and former MP Jagmeet Singh Brar has made the electoral contest at Maur interesting. A turncoat, Brar, is contesting for the first time from Bathinda district. The rural segment is a traditional Akali stronghold since 1997. However, in 2017, Aam Aadmi Party’s Jagdev Kamalu won it by defeating SAD’s heavyweight Janmeja Singh Sekhon by over 14,000 votes. Kamalu, who rebelled in 2019 along with former Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, joined the Congress in June this year, hoping to get the party ticket, which has several claimants with veteran Harminder Singh Jassi not keen to contest this time. Four days before the February 4, 2017, assembly elections, Jassi had a narrow escape in twin blasts that left seven people, including five children, dead. The incident is a major issue this time as the police have failed to make any headway in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-2022-malwa-s-power-centre-bathinda-set-for-keen-contest-101639512482340.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Recording wife’s telephonic conversation secretly invasion of her privacy: High court||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that recording telephonic conversations of a woman by her husband without her knowledge amounts to infringement of her right to privacy. The bench of Justice Lisa Gill said that it cannot be ascertained as in which circumstances the conversations were held. “…these conversations would necessarily have been recorded surreptitiously by one of the parties,” the bench observed. The court was hearing a plea filed by a Punjab-based woman challenging a January 2020 order of a family court in Bathinda allowing the estranged husband to prove that a CD pertaining to a conversation between him and her was “subject to the condition of its correctness”. Their marriage took place in 2009 and they had a daughter two years later. The man had sought divorce in 2017 after their relationship soured. In 2019, the husband filed an application pleading that that a CD and transcriptions of recorded conversations be taken on record. This was allowed by the family court but the woman challenged it in the high court. She argued that the evidence submitted was wrongly accepted, as it would amount to invasion of her privacy, as the conversations had been recorded without her knowledge and consent. The man had claimed that in the divorce plea that his wife used to treat him in a cruel manner. The conversations so recorded are only an attempt to prove the same, it was argued. The high court while quashing the Bathinda court’s order observed that the acceptance of such recording would be a violation of the woman’s fundamental rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/recording-wife-s-telephonic-conversation-secretly-invasion-of-her-privacy-high-court-101639512362452.html

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: HC quashes recruitment process of pre-primary school teachers||The Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed the recruitment process initiated by the Punjab government to fill 8,393 posts of pre-primary school teachers in the state’s primary schools. These are the posts against which over 10,000 teachers working in the state are demanding their absorption and have been staging dharnas across the state. The posts were advertised in November 2020, but the advertisement was withdrawn earlier this year and a fresh recruitment process was initiated with a change in criterion. The fee submitted pursuant to the 2020 advertisement was to be reversed. The criterion adopted by the Punjab government to fill these posts was challenged by some candidates. Last month, acting on the plea, the high court had stayed the recruitment exam. The petitioners had alleged that the criterion has been made under the pressure of teachers’ unions with 13,000 members, who are already working in the state and appointed previously without adopting rules for public appointments. The basic qualification was a diploma for the posts in question. But the criterion was changed and three-year experience as education provider was made necessary, apart from academic and professional qualification, leaving thousands, otherwise eligible, in the lurch. With this criterion, 75% candidates to be selected ought to be from these 13,000 teachers, one of the petitioner’s lawyer, Vikas Chatrath said.The high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia and justice Vikas Suri said that employees for whom reservation has been provided to the extent of 100% had failed to get the benefit of regularisation earlier and now the state proposes to absorb most of them by reserving the source of this recruitment. “This action of the State is totally arbitrary and in direct conflict with the constitutional mandate laid down under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, wherein the right of public employment and equality has been enshrined. Accordingly, it is held that it is not permissible for the State to have 100% reservation for a certain category of persons,” the bench recorded.The court said that the state can fill up the posts of pre-primary school teachers under the Group-C Service Rules, 2020, by only allowing 50% reservation of the 8,393 posts, to give the benefit to the education volunteers, etc. The balance 50% would have to be left out to the other categories, for consideration, it said, while quashing the advertisement with a direction to the state to issue a fresh advertisement, taking into consideration this judgment.“… restricting the source of recruitment to a particular group of persons who had joined service as a stop gap arrangement at local/village level would deny the other persons an opportunity to apply, which would be violative of the equality of opportunity regarding the employment or appointment,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-hc-quashes-recruitment-process-of-pre-primary-school-teachers-101639511942156.html

Addressing the media in Chandigarh on Tuesday, Punjabi actors Amitoj Mann, Babbu Mann, Gul Panag, Ranjit Bawa, Jass Bajwa and agriculture expert Devinder Sharma said the “manch” is the outcome of the farmer’s agitation, “which has brought a positive thought among the people of Punjab and has given us the right direction”. “We have come up with a 32-point agenda covering all major issues of Punjab. If any political party agrees to our agenda, we will support it, but will not become its part,” said Punjabi singer and actor Babbu Mann said.Amitoj Mann, a Punjab actor and director, said: “Punjab is passing through a bad phase. The main motive of political parties is to loot the state by any means. Today, the youth of Punjab is leaving the state and going abroad as we do not have many opportunities here.”Questioned about her affiliation to the Aam Aadmi Party, Gul Panag said: “Most of the political parties have failed to address issues of Punjab, and now since I have joined this manch, I will not have any affiliation with any political party.” The representatives of the manch appealed to the people to come forward and give suggestions on key issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jujhda-punjab-punjabi-actors-social-activists-join-hands-to-highlight-key-issues-101639511888011.html
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drug case: Punjab CM orders FIR to probe Asthana letter leak||A day after a confidential note of Punjab Bureau of Investigation (BoI) chief SK Asthana surfaced on social media in which he had expressed himself against any legal action against Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia in an alleged drug case, the state government announced on Tuesday to register an FIR into the leak of official communication addressed to the director general of police. “We will register an FIR to probe how the letter was leaked and who leaked it. We will thoroughly probe as to how these important files were leaked and how the officer went on leave?” said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, without naming Asthana who had proceeded on a two-day leave last week and excused himself from a scheduled meeting with the CM in which the 2018 Special Task Force report on politically explosive drug issue was to be discussed. The chief minister said: “Moreover, the portion of the letter which was leaked has another part too that was written by the same officer with hand. The part of the letter that has been leaked has no meaning.” On Monday, four pages of a letter that Asthana had purportedly sent to DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota appeared on social media, wherein he had flagged legal hitches in booking Majithia on the basis of the STF report that is lying in sealed cover with the Punjab and Haryana high court. The embarrassing leak, shared from a foreign phone number and posted on Twitter using a handle named “Hawk Mark”, came in the wake of a stepped up pressure on the Channi government from Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu to take action on the drug issue ahead of the state assembly election due early next year. Asthana, according to people familiar with the developments, wrote the letter to the DGP before proceeding on an emergency medical leave amid reports of pressure on him to give nod to take action against Majithia. The police official was admitted in a private hospital in Mohali. An additional DGP rank officer, Asthana was brought in by the Channi government as the BoI chief a couple of weeks back. He was the third officer to get this posting in barely one month. Leak left govt red-facedChanni’s announcement about registering the case came as the leak left the Punjab government red-faced as it was preparing to take action in the political sensitive drug cases on the basis of the STF report. “This leak must be by those big fish of the drug trade who are afraid of action in these cases. These people are threatening our officers as well. But our police is very brave,” said Channi, without taking names. “These people have moved the high court as well. The court has asked that fellow as who you are in this case. If they are so clear, why they have moved the court,” said Channi, alluding a petition moved by Majithia in the high court seeking to be heard in the case that he alleged was being used by his political opponents to tarnish his image. Asthana had sought clarity if it would be legally tenable to act upon the report of the STF head when the same lies sealed in custody of the high court. Also, despite the Punjab advocate general’s request to the high court to return it, the report has not been returned to date, he had pointed. Meanwhile, the Punjab government has started the hunt for new officer to replace Asthana as the BoI chief. 
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||SAD-BSP alliance will form next government in Punjab: Mayawati||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has claimed that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-BSP alliance will form a majority government in Punjab under the leadership of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. She also said the Congress and other political parties will be wiped out in the Punjab assembly election due early next year. Addressing a press conference at her residence in Lucknow on Tuesday, the BSP supremo said: “In 1996 general election, the SAD-BSP alliance had bagged 11 out of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. The Congress was wiped out in the election. In the coming assembly election, the history will repeat itself and the Congress and other rival parties will meet the same fate.” Mayawati also extended wishes to SAD leadership on completing 100 years. “There are a few parties in the country that have served the people for 100 years. Akali Dal is one of the oldest regional parties in the country that is fighting for the welfare and rights of the people of Punjab,” she said. The BSP president said the party has a strong bond with the people of Punjab for decades. “Punjab is the birthplace of BSP founder Kanshi Ram. He launched a movement to uplift the weaker sections in society in Punjab. The BSP cadre is working hard to fulfil his dreams,” she said, adding that Kanshi Ram was on good terms with former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal.BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra is on a three-day visit to poll-bound Punjab. He participated in the foundation day programme of the SAD at Moga and discussed the assembly election campaign strategy with Badals.On Wednesday, Mishra will hold a meeting with BSP office-bearers and workers in Chandigarh. Later, he will attend a meeting of BSP-SAD candidates for the 2022 assembly election and other leaders.The SAD forged an alliance with the BSP in June for next year’s Punjab assembly polls. According to the seat-sharing arrangement, the BSP will field candidates in 20 of the 117 assembly seats in the state while the rest will be contested by the SAD.
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||SAD marks 100 years, calls for joint front of regional parties to strengthen federalism||On its centennial commemoration day on Tuesday, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) called for the formation of a joint front of regional parties to espouse the cause of federalism nationally. At a well-attended party rally in the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections due early next year, the Akali leadership also revived the party’s commitment to work on the Anandpur Sahib Resolution to achieve greater autonomy to states. Addressing the gathering, SAD patriarch and former five-time chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said the 101-year-old party has a rich history to fight to protect the rights of the Sikhs and peasantry, adding that the Akali Dal was the first party to raise the voice of federalism. “Now all regional parties are also calling for strengthening federal rights. If federal rights of states are secure, then unpopular laws cannot be implemented without approval of the states. We are committing to strengthen federal nature of the country,” he declared, adding, “It is time to recall the contributions and sacrifices made by Akalis for the ‘quom’ and Punjab.” Populist pitch Making a poll pitch, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal promised ₹50,000 per acre compensation for crop damage, restoration of old pension scheme for government employees and free power for all religious places if the SAD-BSP alliance comes to power in Punjab next year. “From holding ‘chabian da morcha’, a campaign for the recovery of the keys of the Sri Harmandir Sahib treasury in the early 1920s to the national Emergency and the recent farmers’ agitation, Akalis have always fought from the front. There is no other political front in the country that could match sacrifices made by the Akalis,” he said. Sukhbir said even after 55 years of its bifurcation, Punjab is still deprived of its right to get back Punjabi-speaking areas from Haryana. “Akalis spearheaded the movement of Punjabi Suba to meet aspirations of Punjabis. Respective central governments crushed the federal spirit but the party is committed to fight it back,” he added. Badal Sr equates Cong with Mughals Badal exuded confidence that in the coming assembly elections, the SAD-BSP alliance would repeat the 1996 performance. “In 1996, BSP supremo Kanshi Ram and Akalis fought Lok Sabha elections together and won 11 out of 13 seats in Punjab. The alliance will perform again. But we will have to fight against Congress government of Punjab, BJP-led Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party to protect interests of Punjabis,” he said. Badal urged voters to elect the next government wisely to protect the future of the next generation, while equating the Congress with the British and Mughals. “It is the time to ensure that political power remains Punjab-centric and with those understanding the aspirations of Punjabis,” he said. Without disclosing his electoral plans for the forthcoming elections, Badal said he would abide by the role granted by the party. Speaking on the occasion, BSP general secretary Satish Mishra said the alliance was set to sweep the forthcoming polls by securing 100 seats. He also lashed out at other rival parties, including the Congress and the AAP. Prominent among those present were former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral, and SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-calls-for-joint-front-of-regional-parties-to-strengthen-federalism-101639511884173.html

A 22-year-old man was arrested for kidnapping the class 1 student, they said. According to police, the suspect, Varun Singh, a native of Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, was known to the boy’s father, Mohammad Idris Ali, a medical practitioner. The suspect was earlier Ali’s neighbour and would often visit his house, police said, adding that he planned the kidnapping after he lost ₹3 lakh in gambling and bookies started pressuring him to repay the amount. The victim’s father said that his son and daughter go to school every day with their grandfather. “On Monday, they left home around 8.15am. After 20 minutes, I received a call from the school asking for my Aadhaar card and my son’s photograph. I was about to leave when the school authorities again called to inform me that someone kidnapped my son from outside the gate,” he said, adding that the school is just a five-minute walk from his house. Ali filed a complaint at DLF Phase 3 police station, following which a team from the police station reached the spot and started investigation, police said. Meanwhile, the suspect called the father and asked him to arrange ₹3 lakh and wait for his next call, police said. Manoj Kumar, station house officer of DLF Phase 3 police station, said that the suspect had thought of kidnapping a minor from a posh locality but later changed his plan as he would have needed the help of more people to pull it off. “He finally decided to kidnap the child of a family known to him that was also doing well financially,” the SHO said. Police said the suspect had followed the boy last week to know the school timings. On Monday, as soon as the grandfather dropped the boy and his sister, the suspect told the boy that he had a surprise for him and lured him with chocolates. Kumar said the suspect took the class 1 student to his rented room in Chakkarpur and locked him inside. KK Rao, commissioner of police, formed a team led by the area SHO to rescue the boy. “Teams from Cyber police station were also roped in and by afternoon, the location of the caller was identified. Police raided the suspect’s rented accommodation and arrested him from the spot,” Rao said. The boy was rescued unhurt and handed over to the family members on Monday night, police said. 
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Our mission is to form next govt in Punjab: Capt Amarinder||Punjab Lok Congress chief and former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that their party’s mission was not just to defeat the Congress but to form the next government in the state. Addressing the party workers while inducting two-time former MP Amrik Singh Aliwal and four ex-MLAs into his newly formed outfit, Amarinder said he was overwhelmed by the response from across the state. “Several sitting and former legislators from the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal would be joining our party very soon,” he said. Besides Aliwal, former legislators Harjinder Singh Thekedar, Prem Mittal, Farzana Alam and Rajwinder Kaur Bhagike, ex-district Congress committee presidents Jagmohan Sharma and Satvir Singh Palli Jhikki, Punjab Arthiya Association president Vijay Kalra and Patiala mayor Sanjeev Bittu were among those who joined the party. In the evening, Kalra surfaced at a press conference held by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi who said that he (Kalra) would remain with the Congress. Amarinder said that Punjab was under a massive debt of about ₹5 lakh crore, which was about 70% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the state. “This would take generations to repay and the corrective measures are needed to be taken immediately,” he added, wondering from where chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was going to get the money for his populist announcements. “Probably he knows that the Congress is not going to come back and let the next government bear the brunt.” He also warned police officials against intimidating his party workers at the behest of some local Congress leaders, saying he would take all necessary measures to come down heavily on such “hooligans” in uniform. Amarinder was reacting to reports of cops stopping their party workers who were putting up posters in the Malwa region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/our-mission-is-to-form-next-govt-in-punjab-capt-amarinder-101639511642219.html
15-12-2021||Mumbai||Eight new Omicron cases in state take tally to 28||MUMBAI: Maharashtra on Tuesday reported eight new cases of the heavily-mutated Omicron variant of Covid-19, taking the state’s tally to 28. Seven of the new cases are from Mumbai and one is from Vasai-Virar on the outskirts of the city. While the state health department said none of them had a history of foreign travel as per preliminary information, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) confirmed that one of the infected persons had travelled to London recently. The remaining seven are the UK-returned person’s co-workers and, therefore, were high-risk contacts. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, and officer-in-charge of the city’s public health department said that the infected person had returned to Mumbai in the first week of December. BMC said he did an RT-PCR test after he developed mild symptoms of Covid-19. “The patient’s samples were sent for genome sequencing, and high-risk contacts were traced,” Kakani said. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing to Pune’s National Institute of Virology, according to the BMC. A BMC statement said that the patient had mild symptoms, and a follow-up RT-PCR test is due on Wednesday (today). The patient’s condition is stable. According a report issued by the state government, Mumbai now has the most number of Omicron cases in the state with 12, followed by Pimpri-Chinchwad (10), Pune (2) and one each in Kalyan-Dombivli, Nagpur, Latur and Vasai-Virar. So far, nine Omicron patients have tested negative for Covid-19 and have been discharged. Of the eight new infected persons, three are women and five are male, aged between 24 and 41, the state health department said on Tuesday. Three of the patients are asymptomatic while five have mild symptoms. “According to preliminary information, none of them have a history of international travel,” the state health department report said, contradicting the BMC. “One of the patients travelled to Bangalore while the other had travelled to Delhi. One person detected in Mumbai is from Rajasthan. Out of these eight patients, two are in hospital and six are at home isolation. The close contacts of these patients are being tracked. Out of these, seven patients have been vaccinated and one has not been vaccinated.” To be sure, between December 1 and the morning of December 14, 91,320 passengers, including 13,615 from at-risk nations, arrived at the international airports in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. Through surveillance at the airports, the administration has detected 38 Covid-19 positive cases, including 30 from at-risk countries and eight from other countries. Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers that arrived since November 1 is underway, according to state officials. Through airport and field surveillance, 430 samples were sent for genomic sequencing, and the results of 21 are awaited, the health department said. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 Task Force, said, “The number of Omicron cases is still small. The cases are sporadic and not in big clusters, so there is no need to panic at the moment. We have to focus on aggressive contact tracing, and strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. There should be an emphasis on well-ventilated spaces. People should avoid closed spaces as much as possible.” Mumbai-based infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said that all the Omicron patients have had mild symptoms and have recovered on their own without any intervention. “We simply have to be watchful,” he said. On Tuesday, Maharashtra added 684 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 6,645,136. It also reported 24 fatalities due to Covid-19, pushing the death toll to 141,288. The active cases in the state stood at 6,481. Mumbai added 217 new Covid cases and one death, taking its tally to 765,659 and death toll to 16,360. Meanwhile, in a bid to ramp up the vaccination drive in Mumbai, the BMC has decided to extend the timing of civic inoculation centres to 10pm from the present 5pm. Kakani said, “We will be extending the duration so that more people can walk in and get their doses at the earliest.” According to BMC, 80% of the city’s population is fully vaccinated and due to rising Omicron variant concerns, the civic body aims to fully vaccinate the city’s eligible population at the earliest. It added that on Tuesday 60,370 beneficiaries took their doses in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eight-new-omicron-cases-in-state-take-tally-to-28-101639511522150.html

Union minister and election in-charge for the state, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, gave the slogan of “Nava Punjab BJP De Nal” during a party convention in the city on Tuesday. The event saw sizable participation of workers from across the state. The party has planned 20 social welfare programmes in each assembly constituency across the state to mark the 400th birth anniversary of the ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur. While hailing the grit and determination of farmers for making the country food surplus and the youth for securing the borders of the state, Shekhawat said that it was after nearly two years that BJP could hold a mega event.“Covid hit our party activities; later, the farm agitation hampered events and conferences. We have to start our journey afresh. We need to shun our mutual differences,” said Shekhawat, hinting at differences among the state level leaders.“Punjab, which was number 4, till recently now stands at number 16 in GDP growth and has a debt of over ₹4 lakh crore. Successive governments have never bothered to create a road map for recovery,” he added. Declaring that BJP will contest on 117 seats, Shekhawat added that the party was open for alliance with like-minded entities. Former IAS officer SR Ladhar, who had set up the Kirti Kisan Sher-e-Punjab Party, merged his political outfit with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the presence of Shekhawat. Another Dalit face, former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Mohan Lal Banga, who had joined the BSP and then gone on to join the Congress in 2019, also entered the saffron fold. Former IPS officer Ashok Bath also joined the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-poll-campaign-to-be-aggressive-shekhawat-101639511463834.html

During the meeting, seven teams of sanitation wing officials were constituted for the purpose. Additional municipal commissioner Dr Vaishali Sharma directed the officials concerned to ensure the inspection is completed by December 30.“The teams will have to check the compliance to the parameters prescribed under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 at all the bulk waste generators. If the rules are not being followed anywhere, then they will take action against them as per the rules. It is mandatory for BWGs to dispose of the waste at their own level by converting it into compost, sending recyclable items to empanelled recyclers, and getting the remaining waste collected from the MCG,” said Sharma who chaired the meeting.Sharma further said that in the meeting it was also decided that agencies empanelled for providing technical assistance to BWGs should also be examined during the survey, and action should be taken against those found to be inactive as per the rules.In July, the MCG had empanelled 12 agencies for providing technical support to BWGs and assisting them with setting up in-house compost units.If a BWG is a condominium, it asks its residents of each household to segregate waste into dry and wet waste. Wet waste such as vegetables peels and egg shells is then transported to an in-house composting unit and converted to compost which can then be used as natural fertilisers. According to the officials, 331 BWGs have been fined so far this year for violating waste management rules. These included 15 in MCG’s zone 1 area, 61 in zone 2, 128 in zone 3, and 127 in zone 4. A first-time violation by a BWG carries a penalty of ₹1 lakh while subsequent violation carries a ₹5 lakh fine, said the MCG officials.The MCG’s citizen monitoring committee was formed in February 2018 to oversee solid waste management in the city. Besides MCG officials, the committee has four members who are residents of the city.

Two policemen, including an assistant sub inspector, died in the hospital yesterday.Inspector general of police, Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar said the militants had come with a plan to snatch the rifles, however, the policemen foiled the attempt.“Three militants of Jaish, including two foreign militants, were responsible for the attack. One of the militant was injured in police retaliation as there were blood spots in the area. The attackers escaped towards Pampore and Tral and we will soon neutralise the militants responsible for the attack,” Kumar told reporters on the sidelines of the wreath laying ceremony in Srinagar.Kumar said 25 cops were present in the bus at the time of the attack. “The militants attacked the police bus when the Road Opening Party (RoP) had already withdrawn from the area and militants took advantage of darkness. We are taking preventive measures. The RoP duties will be extended and bullet proof vehicle will be placed there,” he said.IG Kumar said that it was a pre-planned attack and militants seem to have conducted a proper recce before the attack.This was the second major terror attack in the Valley after a string of targeted civilian killings. Security around forces’ installations have been further beefed after the attack. On Saturday, militants killed two policemen in north Kashmir’s Bandipora market when they attacked a police party at Gulshan market. Police said also a foreign militant was involved in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/srinagar-bus-attack-another-cop-succumbs-to-injuries-toll-reaches-3-101639511222180.html
15-12-2021||Mumbai||Omicron effect: Schools reluctant to begin offline classes||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday released a circular confirming that school managements should start physical batches for their students starting on Wednesday. Thane Municipal Corporation, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and Thane Zilla Parishad, which includes rural parts of Thane district, also announced that schools within their jurisdiction will reopen offline for Classes 1 to 7 on Wednesday.This decision, however, was not received well by schools across Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) with many worried about handling more students on campus at a time when the country is witnessing rising cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. On Tuesday, Maharashtra reported eight new Omicron cases taking the state’s tally to 28. All eight patients reported on Tuesday had no history of international travel, unlike the previous 20.“Hybrid classes are easier with smaller batch strength, but balancing physical and virtual classrooms becomes difficult,” a principal of an ICSE school said, wishing to remain anonymous. “Unlike older children who can be told to follow rules, young children simultaneously in physical and virtual classrooms will be tough to handle,” she added.Rupa Roy, principal of Balmohan Vidyamandir in Dadar said the school has begun prepping for physical classes for grades 1 to 7, but are awaiting consent forms from parents before starting hybrid classes. “For the time being, classes for lower grades will run online only and once our work is done and we have enough numbers through consent forms, we will start physical classes,” she said.A handful of state board schools, however, plan to start physical classes for Classes 5 to 7 by gauging how many students show up over the next few days.Some schools reached out to parents, and many decided to continue with online classes for the time being. “Parents share the same concern as us—safety of children, especially the younger ones,” said Jose Kurien, regional director (western zone II), DAV Public Schools. “It’ll be impossible to maintain Covid protocols on campus without being strict with the students, but that will be unfair to the children. We’d rather continue the online classes for the time being and focus on hybrid classes for the older students.”In the last week of November, the state cabinet decided to reopen schools in the physical mode for Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and Classes 1 to 7 in urban areas starting December 1, while the older classes had already been following the hybrid model since October 4. This move was delayed by two weeks by BMC taking into account rising Omicron cases in the state.“Reopening schools means starting school buses for students. This poses a new problem, as there is no way to ensure Covid protocols are followed within the bus. We’ve spoken to parents and a majority of them are comfortable with continuing classes in the online mode,” said Rohan Bhatt, chairman, Children’s Academy group of schools.On November 30, the Association of ICSE Schools in Maharashtra had released a statement clarifying that most ICSE schools in the city will remain busy until December 16 with the first semester exams and can take a call on reopening for younger students only after December 21.“As per the government notification, maintaining six-feet social distance in classrooms means schools need to make arrangements but for the time being, teachers too are busy with invigilation duty for board exams. We therefore request the government to allow ICSE schools to take a call and reopen schools either on December 21, or post-Christmas holidays in January 2022,” said a statement signed by Perin Bagli, secretary of the association.Some parent-teacher associations objected to BMC’s new circular. “Teachers are already struggling with hybrid classes for the older batches and without consulting schools and teachers, the government has now decided to bring more students back to school. At present, everyone is concerned about rising Omicron cases and instead of rethinking its decision the government is forcing this move on everyone. Sadly, not once did the government consult parents or schools before announcing the move,” said Arundhati Chavan, president of Parent-Teachers Association United Forum.“College students are allowed to attend classes only if they are vaccinated, but school students are not vaccinated, despite which there is eagerness among authorities to reopen schools. Is the government or school management ready to take responsibility of the students’ health,” said Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents Association.Keeping in mind the government order, some schools have taken steps to start classes for students from standard 6 and 7. BK Birla Public School, Kalyan, said it has made all necessary preparations to reopen for Classes 6 and 7 on Wednesday. “We will gradually reopen for the rest of the school,” a member of the school management said.Ranjana Jangra, principal, BK Birla Public School, said, “We are prepared to start classes in the hybrid mode as more than 50% of parents have given consent.” Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation has asked all schools within its jurisdiction to reopen for Classes 1 to 7 from Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-effect-schools-reluctant-to-begin-offline-classes-101639511162017.html

DTCP officials said that they will demarcate the government land, which has been encroached, to identify the illegal constructions so that property owners can remove such structures themselves. The property owners have been asked to remove the illegal structures in the next 15 days, the officials said.Notices to the violators were given by the department last month and prior to that the public works department had also issued notices, said the officials. Presently, the 44 feet road comes under the newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM), which has planned to widen the road, they said. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that every house on this road was inspected recently and illegal construction was checked. “We have asked the owners to remove the constructions voluntarily as some structures have encroached up to 10 feet on the road. These need to be removed within the next 15 days or else demolition drive will be carried out,” he said. The DTCP officials said that demarcation of the road would be carried out in the next three days after which the owners can take corrective measures. “Most of these properties are rented out to labourers and workers in Manesar,” said Bhath. As per the MCM officials, not only this road but several other village roads have been encroached upon. “Once this road is cleared of encroachments, the others will also be cleared gradually,” said an MCM official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-property-owners-in-manesar-village-asked-to-remove-encroachments-101639511042164.html

The court added that the nature of allegations is serious in the scam reported between 2016 and 2021. The allegations are that crores were transferred into the bank accounts of the Amandeep Group of Hospitals for which forged prescription/ verification slips and documents with fake seals/ stamps of the Indian Army and forged signatures of senior army personnel were used, it added. The court was hearing the bail plea of one Narinder Kumar, arraigned as an accused in April 2021 FIR, on allegations of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy registered at Shahpur Kandi in Pathankot. The initial complaint was made by army authorities to the hospital. Now, three FIRs stand registered into the scam. Inquiries conducted by the hospital had pointed the needle of suspicion on the petitioner and one more person. The petitioner had alleged that the he had been made a scapegoat and that the investigating agency was under the influence of the hospital due to its deep pocket. He had also alleged the involvement of army officials. The police probe, initially, had given a clean chit to the hospital. Later, the hospital’s name was also added to the FIR. When during the hearing court asked about the reason for the same, the state counsel’s response “drew a blank”. Interestingly, these affidavits were filed by Bureau of Investigation, Punjab. The high court bench of justice Deepak Sibal dismissed the bail plea and taking into account the seriousness of the case asked the SIT led by Prabodh Kumar, Special DGP, Investigation, Lokpal, Punjab, to investigate. He would choose his team, including one officer of the rank of superintendent of police, himself. The SIT would probe all three FIRs, registered into the scam. The court has also directed the Punjab DGP to extend all possible assistance to the SIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-orders-sit-probe-into-forgery-of-army-officials-signature-101639510864815.html

15-12-2021||Other||Parole to prisoners from abroad: Central treaties to prevail over state govt rules: HC||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that Central government treaties with foreign countries would prevail over state government rules on parole to prisoners, transferred from other countries. The bench of justice Sant Parkash said courts should also refrain from passing any such order, which would result into denting the harmonious relationship between the two countries, while considering parole cases of such convicts. To maintain balance in overall international harmony, honour bilateral agreements and to avoid negativity in the relationship between countries, courts should not pass such orders, which come in the way of relationship between the two countries, it added. The court was hearing parole pleas from three persons, all murder convicts, transferred from the United Kingdom. One Harpreet Singh had sought parole of four weeks to get married. He was involved in an April 2011 murder, awarded life sentence and transferred to India on the Centre’s request, and lodged in Kapurthala jail. The second case was of Gurminder Singh, also lodged in Kapurthala jail, seeking parole of eight weeks for the repair of his house. He was convicted in September 2014 for murder and awarded life sentence. He approached the UK authorities for transfer, which was allowed in September 2018. The third case was of Gurmej Singh, convicted in a murder case and awarded life sentence in February 2006, with a minimum term of 35 years. In May 2012, the UK authorities accepted his transfer plea. During the hearing it came to fore that he had availed nine paroles, each of eight weeks. The petitioners had argued that the enforcement of sentence shall be governed by the law of the receiving state and that the country alone would be competent to take all appropriate decisions. In its response, the Centre had said that while considering parole pleas bilateral agreements should be honoured, adding that due to violations of agreed terms, the UK government had placed on hold, requests of transfer of prisoners to India. The court observed that since the agreement on transfer of sentenced persons is entered into at the level of Union government with a foreign country, appropriate authority in all cases would be the Centre and the rules of state governments would not apply to persons transferred under the Centre’s agreement, it was the Centre, who has to honour and take care of the sensitivities involved in the bilateral relations with the foreign country. “Thus, irresistible and unerring conclusion can be drawn that parole cases of the petitioners are to be governed by the terms and conditions of the Indo-UK Agreement,” the court said, dismissing the pleas and adding that the state authorities are merely the custodian of such convict. The limited role of a state authority is to receive and hold him in custody, it added.
15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Government put ‘Himachal on sale’, says Opposition as they walk out||Opposition Congress created an uproar in the House and locked horns with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party members over the government’s move to lease out tourism department properties, which were recently constructed with funding from Asian Development Bank (ADB), before staging a walk-out.As soon as the question hour ended, leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri raised the issue under point of order.Accusing the state government of putting ‘Himachal on sale’, Agnihotri said that prime properties of tourism department which were built with funds provided on loans were being sold to private players.He said that four properties of tourism department in Mandi, Solan and Kullu districts, including convention and cultural centres, had been sold to private players for 10-15 years, in violation of the norms. Agnihotri alleged that recently the government got sanctioned a loan of ₹2,095 crore to develop tourism infrastructure by building similar properties.The ruling party members refuted the allegations and accused Agnihotri of lying on record in the House, eventually resulting in a heated exchange between the leader of opposition and the parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj. Amid sloganeering from both the sides, the Opposition members moved into the well of the house and staged a walkout after some time.Meanwhile, making a statement in the house after the Opposition walked out, Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur said that the tourism department properties were not sold but leased out to private properties.The minister alleged that when in power, the Congress had sold tourism department units, including Wildflower Hall.“The properties leased out by the state government will have a clause of 5% annual increase in the lease money, which will add to the state coffers,” he said.The minister said that many tourism department-owned units were running into losses, with some even becoming defunct.He said there was no harm in the leasing out properties if the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) was no able to operate them.“The properties have been leased as per the norms of ADB and the directions by the centre,” he said.“The Opposition members are disrupting the House daily just for media glare,” he said.State parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj said it was the UPA government that propagated public-private-partnership (PPP) and built-operate and transfer basis to make public sector units financially viable.“However, they are now opposing the move by the BJP government,” he said

This truck was insured, and therefore, the insurance company was liable to pay compensation.The counsel for the insurance company argued that as per testimony of an eye-witness, he chased the truck for 2-3 kms after the accident and the truck was being driven at a speed of 50 kmph. Therefore, it was not over-speeding and the driver was not driving rashly. However, the high court rejected this argument and said that rash and negligent driving does not always equate with over-speeding.Earlier, the Motor Accident Tribunal had awarded a compensation of ₹2,30,400 along with interest of 8% pa from the date of judgement. However, the high court considering the hardship of the parents of the deceased enhanced the same to ₹33,50,000 and directed the National Insurance Company to pay the same.The court observed, “An accident leading to the death of a child causes great shock and agony to the parents and family of the deceased. The greatest agony for a parent is to lose their child during their lifetime.”“We can only imagine the pain and agony suffered by claimant no.2 (mother of the deceased). First, she lost her only son and then she lost her husband too. Against daunting odds, she has spent the later years of her life fighting a long and lonely battle enduring a fate we do not wish on anyone,” observed the bench while awarding interest of 8% pa from the date of filing of the case before the Tribunal instead of interest awarded from the date of judgement by the Tribunal.On July 20, 2004, Abhishek, the son of the claimants, was hit by a truck while travelling on the Delhi-Bareilly highway. Abhishek died while he was being taken to the hospital.In December 2004, his parents filed a petition in the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal seeking compensation under section 161 of Motor Vehicle Act which provides for compensation in hit-and-run cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rash-negligent-driving-doesn-t-equate-with-over-speeding-allahabad-hc-101639510261767.html

He said as many as 1,27,637 works under MNREGA were currently going on in the state. Besides, 74,527 works were also lying pending.He said that in the last four years, the state has done remarkable work under the scheme and exceeded the target of man-days created. “In 2019-20 the state created 280 lakh man-days against a target of 270 lakh man-days. Similarly, in 2020-21 target was 320 lakh man-days while the state created 336.19 lakh man-days,” he said. The minister said that MNREGA has been converged with other schemes to cover the wages of skilled labour. “As far as non-payment of wages over five months is concerned, strict action will be taken against responsible officials,” said Kanwar. He said that Rs.88 crore has been released from the corpus fund for making payments. Hard to assess losses to tourism due to CovidSince people are directly and indirectly involved in the tourism business, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment of the losses caused to the tourism industry due to the Covid pandemic, the government stated in a written reply to the question raised by Dharamshala legislator Vishal Nehria.The government said it has taken various steps to provide relief to businessmen associated with the tourism industry who were hit by the pandemic. Interest subvention scheme was notified by the state government on July 2, 2020, under which working capital loans are available for businessmen associated with the tourism industry for their immediate needs like running daily business, paying wages to workers, paying rent. The scheme was applicable till March 31, 2021, which has now been extended up to March 31, 2022.In 2020, the demand charges for electricity consumption for hotels and restaurants registered under the commercial category were waived for a period of six months and water supply to the registered units was done on domestic rates.Apart from this, Himachal Pradesh Tourism Policy, 2019, has been implemented under which for the construction of new tourism units with a minimum investment of ₹5 crore or expansion of the already established units, 5% of the total fixed capital investment cost or a maximum amount of ₹3 crore would be given as Capital Investment Subsidy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/around-rs-2-20-crore-wages-pending-under-mnrega-minister-tells-himachal-assembly-101639510201823.html

On the basis of the survey report, the state government will take a decision on regularising these colonies, said officials on Tuesday.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the district administration has given the permission to use a drone with restrictions in certain areas. “The survey will be conducted within 45 days in collaboration with a private agency with the scope of preparing individual colony layout based on geo-referencing and size of roads, and the construction status of each plot will be mapped. The survey will also establish the physical infrastructure and development status,” he said. As per the directions issued by the Gurugram administration, the drone survey can be carried out in the entire district barring 26 locations, which have administrative and military presence.The DTCP estimates that more than 700 illegal colonies have come up in the district in the past 10 years. The officials said that the survey will generate good quality images with technical data, which will help the department to finalise the status of each colony. “Any fresh violation can be easily identified and action can be taken based on the images generated in this survey,” said Bhath. Under the Haryana urban development and urban local body rules, there is no provision for creating basic infrastructure in illegal colonies in the state. These settlements first need to be notified and only those developed on more than 50% land in a particular area can be regularised and provided civic facilities, said the officials. The DTCP officials further said that the survey report will enable the government to identify the areas where more than 50% development has taken place so that a decision can be taken on the notification of grant of services and infrastructure. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that in the last one and half years, the department has carried out more than 100 demolition drives and cleared around 800-acre land from illegal constructions. “More than 1,500 notices have been issued to violators and the drone survey will help identify the status of illegal colonies,” said Sharma.The state government has also set up a portal for RWAs of unauthorised colonies to share the status of construction, development of infrastructure and layout plan on the basis of which a call will be taken to provide them services and infrastructure. 
15-12-2021||Mumbai||Fisherfolk affected by development projects seek better compensation plan||Mumbai: Fisher communities have expressed concern over the draft policy prepared by the department of fisheries on compensating fisherfolk affected by development activities in Maharashtra. The Akhil Maharashtra Machhimaar Kruti Samiti (a state-wide fishworkers society) wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray raising objections to specific clauses in the policy, stating it would serve as a “death knell” to the community if passed into law. In a letter dated December 8 (HT has seen a copy), president of the AMMKS Devendra Tandel outlined six broad demands one of which pertained to the compensation proposed in the policy which is in line with directives issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT order came in 2015 in a case dealing with the displacement of fishers in Uran by the JNPT port expansion. According to Tandel, the method of calculating compensation was far less than the actual earnings of fisher communities. The NGT had determined that each affected family should be compensated for the loss of earnings. It was assumed that on average a family would comprise four members (two men and two women). The average total earnings per family was taken to be ₹800 per day, which amounted to an annual income of ₹2.92 lakh per year. A third of the amount was considered by the court as a “mere subsistence” amount, and the final “gross loss of income per family” was determined to be ₹1.94 lakh per family per year. “This approach does not consider that in every household both the fisherman and fisherwoman are earning members of the family. This approach does not consider the types of vessels and the overall income of each fisherman... depending upon the size of the vessels and the number of vessels,” Tandel wrote in his December 8 letter. “Very simply, the compensation provided is far less than what fishermen are able to make,” Tandel said. The state government has prepared a draft policy for compensation of fisherfolk affected by development projects with six broad recommendations, including one that mandated proponents of infrastructure projects to deposit a sum equal to 2% of the total project cost with the fisheries department. Details around this proposed regulation are unclear at present. This comes in response to a petition filed in the Bombay High Court by the Mariaayi Machhimaar Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit — a registered fishworkers cooperative based in Vashi — on behalf of the fishing community from Vashi, Juhu, Koparkhairane, Ghansoli and Diva villages. Urban development experts said that the fisheries department must develop such a compensation policy in consultation with fishers. “Arriving at a figure for compensation is a very tricky thing. One cannot make generalisations. There needs to be uniformity in the approach, but the merits of each case need to be considered as well,” said Pankaj Joshi, principal director at the Urban Centre,a non-profit organisation working on urban planning and design. The AMMKS has also demanded fisherfolks’ participation in social and technical impact assessments for development projects, representation on grievance redressal committees, and special assistance to subsistence fishers who are not part of any registered co-operatives. Rajesh Mangela, a fisher community leader from Mora Gaon in Juhu and spokesperson for the National Fishworkers Forum said: “This policy has done only one good thing, in that it will make project proponents pay two percent of their project cost to rehabilitate fishers. But the modalities of how that payout will happen, and how exactly it will benefit us, we don’t know.” Mangela also feared that by legitimising the provision of compensation, project proponents will be given free rein to hamper fishing activities under the banner of development. “On the one hand, areas will be opened up for development due to amendments to the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) notification. On the other hand, the state says it will compensate for development. But as we have seen with the recent protests in Worli, fishermen want their livelihoods safeguarded first and foremost. The draft compensation policy completely ignores this demand,” Shweta Wagh, an architect and researcher who has been tracking the impact of the Coastal Road on fishing communities in Worli, said. Dr Atul Patne, commissioner, fisheries department, did not provide a comment for this story as he was away on medical leave. Another official seeking anonymity said, “It would not be appropriate to comment. Let the fisherfolk who petitioned the High Court give their response in court first.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fisherfolk-affected-by-development-projects-seek-better-compensation-plan-101639510142360.html

In this connection, Asha workers could be helpful in detection of cancer, he said. Dr Kanan said, ”We started a project for early detection of cancer in rural areas with the help of Asha workers, which got a lot of success. With the help of Asha workers, 1360 men were screened for oral and throat cancer. Of these, 6.93 percent were suspected of cancer and were sent to the PHC for further confirmation. Similarly, 3079 women were screened for breast and cervical cancer by Asha workers and 11.5% suspected cases were sent to higher medical centres for further tests. As many as 1160 women were screened for the human papilloma virus, which proves to be the cause of cervical cancer and 146 were found positive.” Professor Kanan said that this project could prove useful in early detection and awareness of cancer in other parts of the country as well. The benefit of this screening was that when 1.29 crore people were screened, apart from cancer, 8 percent of them were diagnosed with diabetes and 12 percent with high blood pressure. He said, “By applying the primary screening model, early detection of non-communicable diseases and cancer is possible.” Dr. Kanan said that there was a need to pay more attention to early detection and treatment of cancer. Chief secretary and president of the institute RK Tiwari said, “Due to Covid, the past one and a half years were very difficult. Despite limited resources, we overcame the challenges of corona with collective efforts. We performed better than many other countries.” Principal secretary, medical education, Alok Kumar appreciated the progress of the institute. In his address, director of SGPGIMS Professor RK Dhiman said that the super specialty DM programme would start soon in emergency medicine and ophthalmology. Apart from this, MSc in radio pharmacy would also be started. He said work wa going on for the creation of a tele ICU. With this system, six prominent medical colleges of the state would be connected with each other for better treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/asha-workers-can-help-in-early-detection-of-cancer-101639510024283.html
15-12-2021||Lucknow||‘Lucknow: Ode To A City’, a tribute to the lost heritage’||LUCKNOW: Who was Tikait Rai? Where was Latouche buried?—these and many more such curious questions got an answer on Tuesday with the launch of the latest book of Dr PC Sarkar— ‘Lucknow: Ode To A City’. The book was launched at a function organised by The Lucknow Expressions Society at Kaifi Azmi Academy. Dr PC Sarkar, who holds a PhD in organic chemistry and at present works as a principal scientist with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, India and is an authority on the history of Awadh, said that his book was an answer to all such curious questions that were never answered before. “There were certain questions that always bothered me for example, the name—Latouche Road, why it was named as Latouche, who was Latouche and so on. Hence, through a book I have tried to satiate the queries of all those who always had such queries,” said Dr Sarkar during the book launch. Sarkar said, “The book is not a history book. It is more of a tribute to the lost heritage of Lucknow, its palaces, architectural marvels which no longer exist and about the people, who had contributed to the uniqueness of Nawabi and colonial Lucknow.” The book launch event began with lighting of the lamp followed by Kanak Rekha Chauhan, founder of the Lucknow Expressions Society, who welcomed the author Dr PC Sarkar as well as the chief guest for the event, Shahansha Mirza Sahab, descendant of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, and other panelists like Mehru Jaffer, architect Vipul Varshney and Denzil Godin. Chief guest Nawab Shahansha Mirza hopes that this book would create greater awareness about the glorious past. He also compared how Europeans conserve their heritage and how India has shown disregard for many of its heritage sites. Hailing from Kolkata, he feels that “Wajid Ali Shah is much more famous in Kolkata than in Lucknow” and his contribution to the culture in Kolkata was “much more than the potato in the biryani”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-ode-to-a-city-a-tribute-to-the-lost-heritage-101639509607466.html

The arrested accused operated from New Delhi, ATS officials said. Earlier, the ATS had arrested nine people, including the mastermind of the racket. According to a press statement issued by the ATS, the arrested accused was identified as Mohammad Kayum Sikdar, a Bangladeshi national who was living under the pseudonym Khokhan Sardar in south Delhi. “Mohammad Kayum was brought to ATS headquarters in Lucknow for questioning, on the basis of information provided by another accused. Kayum was arrested after his involvement was found in the illegal racket,” read the press statement. As per ATS officials, Khokhan used to arrange fake Indian documents for Bangladeshis trafficked into the country. He also arranged jobs for them and facilitated their journey outside the country on fake Indian documents. The ATS alleged that the gang trafficked Bangladeshis into the country mostly in West Bengal, where they were kept in abandoned madarsas and taught to speak and sign their names in Hindi. The accused were given fake Hindu names and fake Indian Identity cards before being sent to Delhi via train. On Sunday, the ATS officials held eight such Bangladeshis in Kanpur from a Delhi -bound train. Fake identity cards were recovered from each of the eight individuals.

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers will clear all sites by Wednesday: Tikait||Farmers camping at Jind’s two toll plazas and Hisar’s Ramayana toll plaza on Tuesday lifted their dharnas after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders took part in a ‘Samapan Samaroh’.Addressing the gathering at Jind’s Khatkar toll plaza, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait urged the farmers to get ready for a big battle if the Union government fails to take appropriate steps to ensure minimum support price (MSP) on crops and taking back cases filed against farmers.“We have not ended the agitation but suspended the stir to give rest to the foot soldiers. We have won this battle due to Haryana farmers’ support and Punjab leadership. Political parties and governments had created a wide gap between farmers of the two states over the Satluj-Yamuna canal (SYL) link but this agitation has broken all barriers and united Punjab and Haryana,” he said.“The politicians can also try to divert attention of the SYL but you need to be aware from their dirty politics,” he added.SIT heading in good directionCommenting on the special investigation team’s (SIT) probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, BKU leader Tikait said the investigation is heading in a good direction and Union minister Ajay Mishra should resign from his position on morality.“The farmers’ agitation will play a crucial role in the next year’s Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. The farmers know everything and are intelligent in taking decisions before casting the vote. We will hold a meeting of SKM leaders on January 15 to review the steps taken by the Union government over our demands,” he added.BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said they will form the committees of SKM in all districts across country.“The farmers will clear all protest sites in Haryana by Wednesday morning.

15-12-2021||Pune||River Rejuvenation: Work order not issued yet, PMC scrambles to retain project||PUNE Though Union Jalshakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had instructed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to issue the work order for river rejuvenation project within the deadline, it is looking difficult as the bid is only at technical evaluation level, civic officials said, adding that an extension has been sought from the Centre. The PMC is executing river rejuvenation project with the help of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). As per the project deadline, it was expected that the project will be completed before January 31, 2022. However even as the deadline is approaching closer, the work for the project is yet to start due to several controversies in the past including inflated bid. Considering this, Pune MP Girish Bapat met the union minister Shekhawat and urged him to give extension for the project so as to ensure the funding proposal from JICA will not lapse. Officials from municipal administration said issuing work order till Tuesday was difficult due to technicalities. Jagdish Khanore, head of the JICA project in PMC stated that the PMC had done the technical evaluation of the bid and has submitted it to the JICA for conducing same during last week. “Now the JICA team is evaluating it. After getting clearance from JICA and central government the proposal will come to PMC for financial scrutiny. Administration will then carry out the financial evaluation and later submit it to standing committee for approval. After that, work order will be issued to the selected firm, which has bagged the contract. In total, six bidders participated in the tendering process.” According to PMC officials, though the project is getting a fund of ₹1,000 crore, due to inflation, the project cost has increased because of the delay. The PMC would need to bear the additional burden for it and for that the ruling party would need to take help from opposition parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/river-rejuvenation-work-order-not-issued-yet-pmc-scrambles-to-retain-project-101639508281593.html

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Nuh court traces weapon of murder through UID, leads to conviction||Nullifying the theory of a weapon being planted by the police in a murder case, a trial court in Nuh took upon itself to track the ownership of the pistol allegedly used in the murder, leading to conviction of the accused. The trial pertained to murder of one Aamil Rashid, of Bisru village in Nuh, who was allegedly shot dead by one Khalid of the same village in 2018. The counsel of the accused had said that the .32 bore pistol shown to be recovered from the accused was planted by the investigating agency to falsely implicate the accused. Tracing the murder weapon Highlighting lapses by the investigating officer (IO) in tracing the firearm used in the crime, additional sessions judge (ASJ), Nuh, Prashant Rana in his December 9 order said it came to the notice of this court that there is a number engraved on the sketch of the pistol, a unique number engraved on the pistol which had been manufactured from rifle factory, Ishapore in West Bengal in 2018. “For a just decision of the present case, it was essential that the custody chain of the pistol was tracked. The Bichhore police station SHO was directed to depute a police officer and trace ownership records of the pistol. It was found to have been purchased and owned by the accused, the court said. The court said the defence counsel could not rebut the proof of ownership of weapon despite sufficient opportunities. The ASJ said there was a delay of around a year in dispensation of justice in the present case on account of lapse of the IO in tracing the recovered firearm, which could have been easily traced as it was immediately recovered, was in the name of the accused, and had a unique identification number engraved on it. Court points out police lapses Commenting on the lapses made by the IO in tracing the firearm, the court said the pistol recovered from the accused bore a unique identification number and the IO could have easily proved the ownership and chain of custody of the weapon of offence, but he did not do so. The court said police records showed that the IO was well aware that the accused had purchased the weapon of offence from a gun house in Jammu and Kashmir in August 2018 against his arms licence, a fact the accused had disclosed before the IO. “The IO said the accused told him that he lost the arms license and its photocopy also. The IO became silent about the ownership of the weapon of offence and the arms license of the accused. He did not try to trace the arms license with the weapon registered in it. He became silent for the reasons and intentions best known to him. This court does not wish to impute any mala fide intention to the IO or even exonerate him of such an intention as the same is beyond the scope of this trial. The lapse of the IO may have been wilful and deliberate, or on account of lack of training,” the court said. ‘Duty of court to find out truth’ The ASJ said the accused may have a question in his mind as to whether the court was justified in collecting the evidence. The answer would be in affirmative. The reason being, it is the bounden duty of the court to find out the truth in its entirety, so that the justice is done. The court does not sit simply as an umpire in a contest between two parties and declare at the end of the combat as to who has won and who has lost but it has a legal duty of its own, independent of parties, to take active role in the proceedings and reach at the truth, which is the foundation of administration of justice, the ASJ said. 
15-12-2021||Pune||Finally, offline classes for Class 1 to 7 to restart in Pune from December 16||Schools in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will reopen from December 16, separate notifications by municipal corporations stated on Tuesday, a day before the previous order on withholding plans on resumption of offline classes for Class 1 to 7 was effective. In Pune, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar issued the order about the school reopening after detailed discussions with the state deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. Earlier, the schools were to restart from December 1, but in view of the threat of Omicron variant of Covid, the decision was deferred till December 15. As per the orders issued by the PMC commissioner, Class 1 to 7 of English and Marathi medium schools have been allowed to resume offline classes from Thursday. As per the orders, school administrations should strictly follow Covid protocols and safety measures issued by the state government. All the teaching and non-teaching staff should be fully vaccinated and, if not, they should have done the RTPCR test 72 hours before. Also, it is mandatory to get parents’ consent from students to attend the offline classes in the school. “In Pune, the vaccination is being done on large scale, but the children are not yet vaccinated. So, it was earlier decided not to restart schools till December 15 and review was taken today of the situation. Currently there is only one active Omicron patient in Pune city and we are closely monitoring all travellers coming from abroad. So, it has been decided to resume schools for Class 1 to 7 from December 16,” said Vikram Kumar. Meanwhile, schools from the rural parts of the Pune district, which began offline teaching for class 1 to 4, has seen increased attendance. Speaking about the school reopening, Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The schools in our city are finally reopening from December 16 and while taking this decision deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pune district collector Rajendra Deshmukh, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and PMC commissioner held discussion in detail. Now the schools should look after the preparations for restarting of school, right from sanitising school premises and classrooms to getting the parents’ consent is all necessary for the safety of students.” The decision evoked mixed reaction from parents and teachers. Some parents said there was no hurry to restart offline classes in the light of new variant. Others welcomed the decision. “I think it’s a good decision as studying online had hampered overall growth of students who are in the age of learning how to read and write,” said Mandar Kulkarni, a parent.

15-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana potato growers suffer losses as wholesale prices crash to around ₹500 per quintal||The beginning of the harvesting season of potatoes has given a bitter experience to the local farmers with the fall in wholesale prices in mandis.Farmers alleged that they are being forced to sell their produce at around ₹500 per quintal and are unable to get even the input cost.“With the beginning of the harvest season, prices have come down to around ₹450- ₹550 per quintal now there is a strong possibility that prices may fall further as the harvest will pick up,” said a commission agent at Kurukshetra’s Pipli grain market.“I have harvested two acre of potato crop and earned just ₹1.10 lakh whereas the input cost on this land was around ₹90,000,” said potato-grower Darshan Lal of Ladwa in Kurukshetra, who has grown potato on 10 acre.Another farmer Kuldeep Singh, who has taken five acre on rent for potato cultivation at Radaur in Yamunanagar district, said, “This seems another bad year for potato farming. At the price of ₹5,000 per quintal, we will not be able to earn the production cost and rent of the land,”Potato traders are blaming poor demand and fluctuating prices in the open markets in country for fall in the prices.“Most potato crop is being sold in the open markets in Bihar and Delhi but the prices are not stable. That is why traders in local mandis of Haryana fear losses and are not showing interest in potato purchase,” said Raj Kumar, a potato exporter from Kurukshetra.Last year, prices of early harvesting varieties had fetched good prices and were sold at around ₹1,500 to ₹2,000 per quintal. “Expecting that the prices may remain the same this year too, most farmers have grown early harvesting varieties but the prices have fallen below expectations,” said an official of the state horticulture department.The Haryana government had announced the ‘Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana’ to compensate for the difference in the situation of farmers selling crop at lower price than the fixed price. But farmers said the base price of ₹5 per kg fixed by the government does not cover the production cost.“Since the yield of early harvest remains around 100 quintal per acre against the 150 to 160 quintal of the lateral varieties, the government should increase the base price to around ₹10 to prevent farmers from bearing losses,” demanded farmer Rajiv Kumar of Shahbad in Kurukshetra district.

15-12-2021||Pune||6 fully grown trees cut down on temple premises in Pune||PUNE In a reckless act of hacking trees as many as six fully grown trees were axed inside the Mahalaxmi temple premises at Gadital, Hadapsar. Environment activists and Area Sabha Association of Pune, green pune movement held a silent protest on Tuesday to show the devastation of green coverThe Tree authority officer of the Hadapsar ward office admitted his mistake and visited the spot when the activists complained, thus filing a panchnama against the trustees. “The trustees have been writing for requests to trim tree branches as they were overhead and hanging low over the passing road. Besides they also mentioned that there were plenty of migratory birds and bats in the trees whose droppings littered the temple premises. We had given them permission to trim the branches and not to cut them completely. After I received complaints from the residents and activists, I visited the area and they had completely destroyed the trees. Hence, after panchnama I penalsed them to plant 15 trees in place of the six trees they destroyed,” said Prasad Katkar, tree officer, Hadapsar ward office.The trustees mentioned in the letter that besides the bird droppings, the birds also dropped chunks of meat and fish into the temple premises thus causing a problem to devotees, hence Katkar said he gave the permission on religious beliefs and to maintain peace.But residents living in the area feel that it is injustice to the many birds which were nesting in the big banyan trees that were hacked. Ajay Patel, a resident said, “During the lockdown, with no devotees visiting the temple, the trees in the premise had become a sanctuary for many migratory birds and bats. When I heard the noise of wood being cut, I rushed to see that almost all the branches were being hacked and the bird nests were thrown in the nullah flowing nearby. I complained to the ward office and requested them to visit and stop this.”“It is sad to see such devastation. The trees which were well within the premises are heavily pruned or cut. Though the permission was to prune the branches which were stated to be coming over road and hence supposedly were a safety threat,” said Sathya Natrajan, part of the Area Sabha Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/6-fully-grown-trees-cut-down-on-temple-premises-in-pune-101639507021349.html
15-12-2021||Delhi||Why Delhi is yet to record a fog episode so far this year||It’s mid-December when usually Delhi records dense spells of fog. However, this year, the city has not even seen a major fog episode so far.Explaining the reason behind this, experts said that parts of northern plains experienced two western disturbances (WD) so far, but none of them added sufficient moisture for the formation of fog. They added that high wind speeds during this period has also ensured that fog did not form in the manner it usually does.India Meteorological Department (IMD) data for the Palam monitoring station shows that Delhi has recorded the lowest fog hours between December 1 and 14 in the last at least six years. In 2015, the city recorded 157 hours of fog, and in 2016, Delhi saw 126 hours of fog during this period. But this year, Delhi has seen seven hours of fog till December 14.Last year, Delhi recorded 74 hours of fog over Palam which included a “very dense” fog spell on December 7, when visibility dropped to zero and operations were impacted at Delhi airport.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, who analysed long-term fog data, said this is the first season since 2012 that even shallow to moderate fog has not been recorded so far. IMD classifies the intensity of fog in terms of visibility. When the visibility is between 1,000 and 500 metres, it is classified as “shallow”; between 500 and 200 metres is ”moderate”; below 200 metres is “dense”; and under 50 metres is ‘very dense’.“By this time of the year, we generally get shallow to moderate fog, with a dense fog spell also occurring. After 2012, this is the first time we are seeing similar conditions where even CAT I and CAT II visibility procedures for shallow to moderate fog haven’t been deployed at the Delhi airport,” said Jenamani, who added that though low temperatures were ideal for fog formation, a stable wind pattern is needed for heavy fog spells.“This is not limited just to Delhi, but the entire northern plains. Delhi will see another western disturbance from December 15-16, which may lead to some shallow to moderate fog in the morning, but from December 17 onwards, wind speed will again pick up and conditions will become unfavourable for fog,” Jenamani said.This year, while four hours of fog was recorded on December 3 and 4, when visibility dropped below 1,000 metres, three fog hours were recorded on the night and morning of December 4 and 5.Navdeep Dahiya, an amateur weatherman who runs ‘Live Weather of India’, an online platform that provides weather information, said the two western disturbances in the first week of December were both fairly weak, and could not add enough moisture. “The first western disturbance around December 2 and 3 was near Maharashtra, and by the time it reached Delhi, it fizzled out. The next western disturbance around December 5 and 6 did bring enough snowfall to the mountains, but Delhi only recorded a drizzle,” he said.Dahiya said Delhi may stand a better chance of seeing fog after December 24. “Another western disturbance is expected this week, but it will again be weak... A better chance of good fog is expected only after December 24, when a stronger western disturbance might influence weather,” he added.An official at the Delhi airport confirmed operations have been smooth so far. “There have been no delays or any impact on operations so far due to fog,” he said.Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board’s air laboratory, said Delhi will have to wait for ideal meteorological conditions. “If the difference between ambient temperature and dew point, which means the point the air is saturated with moisture, is sufficient, one will see fog. You also need clear skies and calm winds for moisture in the air,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/why-delhi-is-yet-to-record-a-fog-episode-so-far-this-year-101639506422770.html
15-12-2021||Delhi||Admissions to entry-level classes begin in Delhi, forms available from Wednesday||Private, unaided and recognised schools in the national capital will start the process of admissions to nursery classes for the 2022-23 academic session from Wednesday, according to the schedule notified by the Delhi government’s directorate of education.According to the admission circular issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) which provides details of the admission process, schools were to upload the admission criteria by December 14. The admission forms will be available from December 15, and the last date for submission is January 7. The school websites will upload the first list of selected candidates on February 4.The second list will be released on February 21, and a subsequent list, if required, will be announced on March 15. The admission process is to be concluded by March 31, according to the schedule.DoE has made it mandatory for the schools to charge only ₹25 for the application form. The purchase of the school prospectus by the parents will be optional. The department has fixed an upper age limit of 4, 5, and 6 years as of March 31, 2022, for admission in nursery, kindergarten and Class 1, respectively. The minimum age for admission in these classes is 3, 4, and 5 years as of March 31, 2022, respectively, the DoE circular said.In line with previous years, an age relaxation of up to 30 days for admission may be granted by the head of school in the minimum and upper age limits for these classes. Parents can approach the principal or head of the school to seek age relaxation through a subscribed application, the DoE circular said.Most schools in the past have kept maximum weightage for neighbourhood (distance), siblings and alumni while allotting points in their eligibility criteria. However, some have also taken the first child and girl child as a criterion into consideration. For instance, Bal Bharati Public School, Ganga Ram Hospital Marg, has allocated 20 points to the first born child. The Indian School has also allocated 20 points to the first born child.Sudha Acharya, chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said the forms for nursery admission will be available on the school website as well as the campus for convenience of parents who are not very technology-savvy. “ While the majority of the parents nowadays tend to opt for online forms, we will also be providing the forms on school premises since parents living in the vicinity and others who are not tech-savvy might need hard copies of the form,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.Apeejay School, Panchsheel Park, has allotted 10 points to physically disabled children. The school also allocated 15 points to a first-born child or a girl child.“Parents seeking admission can visit the school’s website for registering their children. We have adopted an admission process which is well-defined and transparent to ensure equitable admission opportunities for all,” said Ritu Mehta, principal, Apeejay School.The DoE has given the schools autonomy to decide their own criteria for admission, and upload them on DoE’s website by December 14. But it has also warned the schools not to include 50 listed parameters — such as parents’ education, profession, income, food habits, and written or oral interviews of both students and parents — that were abolished by the Delhi government in 2016.A senior Delhi government official, who asked not to be named, said in case of any grievances and violation of rules, applicants can lodge a complaint with the DoE. “If any specific complaint against violation of norms against any school is lodged, we will take action,” said the official.Sumit Vohra, who runs a portal on nursery admissions, said in complete violation of the government guidelines on admissions, some schools had given preference to aspects that have been abolished by the government.“Some schools have given 50 marks preference to students coming from areas where school transport is available. As per the criteria abolished by the government, schools cannot make a declaration regarding picking or dropping. No one is taking cognisance of these violations,” said Vohra.Asma Saeed, a parent, said she was keeping a tab on the schools in the neighbourhood that have uploaded the criteria already. A resident of Vasant Enclave, she is aiming at securing a seat in a good school in the neighbourhood for her daughter. “The only points I will be able to get are the ones for distance. I don’t meet any other criteria for sibling or staff. I will take some time and make a list of the schools where I can apply before registering,” said Saeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiadmissions-to-entry-level-classes-begin-forms-available-from-wednesday-101639506242500.html
15-12-2021||Delhi||Air quality in Delhi deteriorates further amid low temperature, moderate winds||elhi’s air quality deteriorated on Tuesday, touching the higher end of the “very poor” category, as temperatures remained low and wind speed remained moderate. The Capital recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 367, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily 4 pm bulletin on Tuesday, an increase from Monday’s reading of 331 (very poor), and 254 (poor) on Sunday.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 7.5°C and maximum temperature of 22.7°C on Tuesday, both a degree below the normal temperature for this time of the year. In comparison, the maximum and minimum temperature on Monday was 22.4°C and 6.6°C.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast the minimum temperature to remain around 7°C for the next two days.It, however, said that the minimum temperature could rise to around 8 degrees Celsius (°C) by Friday under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, which is expected to bring a spell of very light rain on Thursday night. The temperatures will again start dropping from Saturday and could touch 5-6 degrees Celsius, it added.“There is a possibility of very light rain and drizzle activity occurring on the evening and night of December 16. This is under the influence of another western disturbance, but its impact will be minimal as it will be fairly weak over Delhi NCR,” said R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD.In terms of air quality, agencies forecast that Delhi’s AQI will remain in the “very poor” range till Wednesday, with a slight improvement expected from Thursday. “Delhi is recording low temperatures for the past three days and that has led to a slight deterioration in air quality, with wind speed also moderate. Air quality will remain ‘very poor’ for two days before a combination of some light rain and an increase in wind speed aids Delhi from Thursday onwards,” said Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar).CPCB classifies AQI as “poor” when it is between 201 and 300, as “very poor” when it is between 301 and 400, and “severe” when it is over 400. Delhi last recorded a “severe” day on December 2.According to experts, Delhi tends to see a second spike in air pollution towards the last week of December, when temperatures dip to their lowest. “Air quality should remain between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ during this period, but historical data shows a spike tends to occur in the last week of December and the first week of January,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-air-quality-worsens-as-winds-remain-calm-101639506181166.html
15-12-2021||Delhi||Veg or non-veg: Delhi HC wants stricter markings on food||he Delhi high court has ruled that there should be complete disclosure of all ingredients used to manufacture any food article so that people can determine if they are truly “vegetarian” or “non-vegetarian”, adding that “every person has a right to know what they are consuming and nothing can be offered to the person on a platter by resort to deceit, or camouflage”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh added that the ingredients used in the manufacturing process should not only be written in code, but also by source of origin -- plant or animal, made naturally or manufactured in a laboratory.“It should also be fairly disclosed as to what is the plant source, or animal source – as the case may be, in respect of all the ingredients in whatever measure they are used. The Food Business Operators are directed to ensure full and strict compliance of Regulation 2.2.2(4) on the basis that the use of any ingredient – in whatever measure or percentage, which is sourced from animals, would render the food article as non-vegetarian,” the court said in a December 9 order that was made public on Tuesday.The bench noted that it has found that several food articles which have ingredients sourced from animals are shown as “vegetarian” by affixing a green dot on the packaging.While hearing a plea by a trust, Ram Gau Raksha Dal, for labelling of all products -- including eatables and cosmetics -- as “vegetarian” or “non-vegetarian” not only on the basis of its ingredients but also on the substances used in the manufacturing process, the bench threatened action against food business operators if they did not comply.It said that the failure of the authorities to list “non-vegetarian” products used in the manufacturing of food articles was tantamount to deceit of the public at large, and particularly those who wished to profess strict vegetarianism, thus leading to a violation of the fundamental rights.“It matters not – as to what is the percentage of such ingredients (which are sourced from animals), which are used in the manufacture of food articles. Even though their usage may constitute a minuscule percentage, the use of non-vegetarian ingredients would render such food articles non-vegetarian, and would offend the religious and cultural sensibilities/ sentiments of strict vegetarians, and would interfere in their right to freely profess, practice and propagate their religion and belief,” the court said in an order of December 9.The petition contended that it is the fundamental right of any citizen to know whether or not the food they consume, cosmetics and perfumes they use, clothes/garments they wear, contain, or are manufactured by using, components or parts derived from the body of an animal.On December 9, the high court was told by the petitioners that one ingredient coded on packaging as E631 denotes Disodium Inosinate -- the disodium salt of inosinic acid. The bench was told that this is used as a food additive, and often found in instant noodles, potato chips, and a variety of other snacks, and is commercially prepared from meat or fish.Taking note of this, the high court bench said, “A little search on Google shows that it is often sourced from pig fat. Even though it is a food additive, yet, the Food Business Operators often do not disclose in their packaging – in terms of the Regulations..., that the food article wherein the said ingredient is used, is a non-vegetarian product.”Though several such ingredients are used, merely the codes of the ingredients are disclosed, without actually disclosing on the packaging as to what is the source, i.e. whether it is plant based, or animal based, or it is a chemically manufactured in a laboratory, it added.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) told the Delhi high court that all food business operators are already mandatorily required to mention the list of ingredients used in manufacturing or processing of food products.To be sure, packaged food items are tagged with red (non-vegetarian) and green (vegetarian) tags based on ingredients, as per the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules, 2011.The matter will next be heard on January 31, 2022, when the court is also expected to adjudicate on the aspect of cosmetic items as well.FSSAI officials did not respond to requests seeking a comment.

Delhi sees close to 600,000 new vehicle registrations every year and with the new system of RC printing, buyers will no longer have to wait for months to get their RC, no longer have to visit RTO’s and can enjoy hassle free registration of their new vehicles. This service will soon be officially dedicated to the public by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal,” said Gahlot.The new QR code-based smart cards for RCs have the owner’s name printed on the front, and the microchip and the QR code are embedded on the other side.Delhi has 263 dealers who are providing the facility of printing of registration certificates at the dealerships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-only-state-to-issue-rc-at-vehicle-dealer-s-shop-kailash-gahlot-101639505823205.html
15-12-2021||Delhi||Electric vehicles sales in Delhi more than India average: Gahlot||Delhi is emerging as the “EV capital” of India with sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in the city six times higher than the rest of the country, city transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday.“Delhi’s progressive EV policy has turned out to be a huge success. In the last quarter, EVs have surpassed the sales of CNG and diesel vehicles in Delhi. Between September and November 2021, EVs accounted for 9% of the vehicles sold in Delhi; while the national average is 1.6%. In the last quarter alone, 9,540 EVs were sold in Delhi,” he said.The Delhi government notified its EV Policy on August 7, 2020. Under the policy, the Delhi government has set a target for EVs to account for 25% of sales by 2024. As part of the policy, Delhi also became the first state in the country to fully exempt road tax and registration fees for all new EVs registered in the city.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday tweeted, “I’m glad Delhi is emerging as the EV capital of India with a 9% share of EVs. Delhi is doing everything possible to reduce its contribution to pollution.”So far, the Delhi government and the power distribution companies have facilitated setting up 201 charging stations with over 380 charging points across Delhi in the past two years --- the highest for any city in the country, Gahlot said.“Another 600 public charging points are to be added by mid-2022. The Delhi government recently launched India’s first single window facility to install EV chargers faster (within seven days) and cheaper (under ₹2,500 for slow charger) than anywhere else in India,” he said.A total of 9,540 electric vehicles were sold in Delhi from September to November. Of this, 2,873 were sold in September, 3,275 were sold in October and 3,392 in November. EVs have risen to the second position in automobile sales, after petrol vehicles (82,626 units sold), according to Delhi government data.At the same time, EVs surpassed popular choices such as diesel and CNG-run vehicles by a significant margin. 7,820 CNG vehicles and 2,688 vehicles were sold between September and November. In the hybrid category, 3,918 petrol+CNG vehicles were sold, and 1,429 petrol + other hybrid variants were sold, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/electric-vehicles-sales-in-delhi-more-than-india-average-gehlot-101639505524123.html

15-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 11 agitations by North MCD teachers in four years, yet salaries pending||More than 7,000 teachers in North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run schools have said that they do not agree with the decision by a confederation of staff unions of the civic body to withdraw a strike against non-payment of salaries and dearness allowance, claiming that they do not trust the assurances by the civic body.Shikshak Nyay Manch (SNM) – an umbrella body of teachers’ association of the three municipal corporations in Delhi, in fact, alleged a tacit understanding between the Confederation of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Employees Union (CMCDEU) and the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled North MCD.According to Kuldeep Singh Khatri, the president of SNM, teachers of North MCD schools have gone on 11 strikes in the last four years. “But barring two occasions, our grievances were not addressed,” Khatri said.Nearly 10,000 employees of the North MCD that included teachers, doctors, sanitation workers and paramedical staff called off a 24-hour strike organised on Monday after the civic body assured them that the dues will be cleared within a time frame provided to the staff union leaders during talks between the two sides.The teachers, however, have said that they will continue boycotting online classes until the salaries are credited their bank accounts. They have also been demanding that the civic body should provide clarity on the ₹500 per month internet charge.Khatri said that after the North MCD administration de-recognised four teachers’ unions -- Delhi Adhyapak Parishad, Prathamik Shikshak SC/ST Union, Akhil Delhi Prathmik Shikshak Sangh and Nagar Nigam Prathmik Shikshak Sangh -- in 2015, the teachers were left with no forum to raise their grievances. “After three years of struggle, the teachers finally formed a non-political platform SNM in January 2018. Since then, we have staged as many as 11 demonstrations, including dharnas and hunger strikes, at different venues. But barring on two occasions, all our appeals fell on deaf ears,” he said.Khatri said the circular issued on Monday by the North MCD was not clear on payment schedule. “We have four months’ salary dues now, but they have assured to pay for only two months. Even about the payment of outstanding dearness allowances arrears, the circular states that it will be released as per the availability of funds. They are asking us to take online classes, but they have no answer to under which head they will bear the internet charges of ₹500 per month. As far as the civic body’s claims that employees had called off their strike on Monday, are not the teachers their employees? It was like a match-fixing, where all the concerned stakeholders were not taken into consideration. Their assurances are nothing more than a ploy to delay the payment till the coming municipal elections, so that the next dispensation faces the issue. If our demands are not fulfilled by this week, will will have no option but to demonstrate before the BJP national headquarters on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg,” Khatri said.Vinay Tanwar, a teacher in a North MCD school, said the municipal officials promised to pay the September salary by Monday, but no fund has been released as yet. “At the same time, the North MCD mayor said that they will release funds for November’s salary of the Safai karamcharis. We are unable to understand the calculation of these leaders that if they don’t have ₹60 crores to pay our October salary, how they can give ₹77 crore to safai karamchari for November’s salary,” he said.Pawan Kumar, another North MCD teacher, said the teachers will no more rely on the written or verbal assurances given by the civic body. “Can they publicly admit that how many promises have they fulfilled so far? They have now become habitual of making empty promises,” he said.When contacted, Raja Iqbal Singh, the North MCD mayor, said the civic body officials are trying their best to find an amicable solution to the problems of the employees and pensioners. “We are not getting our share of funds from the Delhi government. Despite running out of funds, we are trying to make regular payments to them. I hope that things will be normal in a month or so,” he said.Senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak said the BJP-ruled municipal bodies were a testament to the high-headedness and corruption among the BJP leaders. “There are number of areas in which the BJP-ruled MCDs have failed to deliver. But they have only two ways to handle everything -- either blame it on the AAP government or fool the employees,” he said.AP Khan, the convener of the CMCDEU, said the strike was called off on Monday taking cognizance of the positive approach of the civic body administration “Since the municipal authorities have sought three weeks, to redress all our grievances, all the unions of confederation have unanimously accepted their proposal. If they do not fulfil their promises , we will decide the further course of agitation after that. We are not supported or affiliated to any political party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi11-agitations-by-north-mcd-teachers-in-four-years-yet-salaries-pending-101639504860788.html

One person has died after contracting the variant, which is set to become the dominant strain in London.More than 146,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-record-daily-covid-cases-with-omicron-spreading-rapidly-101639587584789.html
15-12-2021||World||Putin, Xi hold call amid tensions with the West||Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a video summit on Wednesday, lauding bilateral ties as a pillar of multilateralism and hoping to boost economic engagement in a show of solidarity as Beijing and Moscow come under increasing pressure from the western bloc on issues like Taiwan, Ukraine and human rights.Putin said he looks forward to attending the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and meeting Xi. He is the first leader of a country to do so in a show of strength with China against the backdrop of several western democracies announcing a diplomatic boycott of the Games over the state of human rights in Xinjiang.China and Russia have come increasingly closer under strongmen leaders Xi and Putin, seemingly forming a bloc of their own against the US and its allies.Putin won support from Xi for his push to obtain binding security guarantees for Russia from the West, a Kremlin official said, according to Reuters.Xi addressed Putin as his “old friend,” while the latter called Xi as both his “dear friend” and his “honourable friend” as they talked about a wide range of issues.The all-round practical cooperation between China and Russia has demonstrated tremendous political strengths and huge potential, Xi said.Xi, according to the official news agency Xinhua, said China and Russia have acted as responsible major countries, becoming the central pillar of practising multilateralism and safeguarding international equity and justice.The Chinese President added that trade between China and Russia in the first three quarters of 2021 has topped $100 billion for the first time, and for the whole year, bilateral trade looks to reach a record high.Putin said Russia “consistently stands against the scheme of politicising sports” in context of the diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics and also extended Moscow’s “staunch” support on China’s position on Taiwan.He said Russia-China relations are a paradigm of international relations in the 21st century.“Their relations embody a high degree of strategic mutual trust and have set an example of mutual benefit based on non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and mutual respect for each other’s interests,” Putin noted as per the Chinese official readout.“A new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries, based among other things on such principles as not interfering in internal affairs (of each other), respect for each other’s interests, determination to turn the shared border into a belt of eternal peace and good neighborliness,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin.Xi added that the Russian president “strongly supported China’s efforts to protect key national interests and firmly opposed attempts to drive a wedge between our countries.”Diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions have brought Beijing and Moscow with each supporting the other on most international issues.While China has faced sanctions over abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and for carrying out a crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, Russia has faced international sanctions and censure for annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and over the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.Xi said that he has met Putin for the 37 times since 2013, according to the Russian translation of their remarks, quoted by the NYT, as the virtual summit began.From the appearance of the current state of China-Russia ties, the two leaders are set to meet many more times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-xi-hold-call-amid-tensions-with-the-west-101639576821987.html
15-12-2021||World||Omicron will become dominant strain of Covid in EU by mid-Jan: Bloc president||European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said the Coronavirus's Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, will become the dominant strain in the 27-nation bloc by mid-January.The head of the EU’s executive branch, however, exuded confidence that the bloc is well prepared to fight the highly contagious strain. Given the high rate of vaccination in the bloc and the availability of vaccine doses, von der Leyen said Europe is now in a better position to fight the virus.She said more than 300 million people in the EU have been fully vaccinated and that 62 million people have gotten a booster jab.The commission chief further said the EU is facing a "double challenge" of increasing cases in recent weeks due to the Delta variant and rising threat from Omicron.“We're seeing an increasing number of people falling ill, a greater burden on hospitals and unfortunately an increase in the number of deaths," she was quoted as telling European lawmakers.Von der Leyen said the increase in infections remains due “almost exclusively" to the delta variant. “And what I'm concerned about is that we are now seeing the new variant Omicron on the horizon, which is apparently even more infectious."The alarming rise of new infections has prompted the implementations of further restrictions across Europe.Italy has made negative tests mandatory from vaccinated visitors even as the move has raised concerns that it will limit free movement at a time when many EU citizens travel to see their relatives and loved ones.Portugal adopted a similar measure on December 1, requiring a mandatory negative test for all flights arriving in Portugal, even for people with health passes and regardless of their point of origin or nationality.According to an analysis of data from South Africa, where the new variant is driving a surge in infections, Omicron seems to be more easily spread from person to person and better at evading vaccines, but also milder in terms of severity.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-will-become-dominant-strain-of-covid-in-eu-by-mid-jan-bloc-president-101639573910467.html
15-12-2021||World||Researchers find a new strategy to boost vaccine efficacy amid Omicron spread||Amid the emergence of Omicron cases across the globe, researchers have found that adding a component of a viral protein in the Covid-19 vaccines, can boost their immune response and also provide increased protection against new variants.The researchers of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) discovered in their findings that using a fragment or component from viral polymerase protein, which is found in SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses (SARS, MERS and the common cold) can trigger a more robust immune response from the vaccines.The study, which has been published in the ‘Cell Reports Journal’ comes at a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the Omicron variant reduces the efficacy of existing Covid-19 vaccines and is also more transmissible.“Given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs,” the United Nations health agency said in a technical brief on December 12.Also Read | Omicron Covid-19 variant more transmissible, reduces vaccine efficiency: WHOFirst discovered in South Africa, cases of Omicron Covid-19 variant has now spread to 63 countries, including India. As many as 64 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in India, with West Bengal reporting its first infection a few hours earlier after a 7-year-old boy tested positive. Earlier in the day, Rajasthan and Delhi also reported four cases each of the Covid-19 variant.According to the researchers of UCLA, their findings will pave the way for preparing a new generation of Covid-19 vaccines that would be able to tackle current variants such as Omicron and Delta, and the ones that may arise in the future.According to researchers, most Covid-19 vaccines use a component of the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 to trigger the immune system of the body to produce antibodies. However, newer variants such as Omicron and Delta, which carry mutations to the spike protein, can make them less detectable to the immune cells and antibodies stimulated by vaccination.Viral polymerases serve as engines that coronaviruses (all types) use to replicate themselves, thereby permitting the infection to spread swiftly. However, unlike spike protein, these proteins are unlikely to change or mutate even as viruses evolve.Also Read | Two weeks into Omicron outbreak: What do we know so farResearchers stressed on rare and naturally occurring T cells that are installed with molecular receptors on their surfaces for recognising foreign protein components called ‘antigens’. They said when a T cell encounters an antigen that its receptor recognised, it self-replicates and produces additional immune cells - some of which target and kill infected cells immediately, whereas others remain inside the body for years to fight the same infection should it ever return.To find out if the human immune system has T cell receptors capable of detecting viral polymerase protein, researchers exposed blood samples from healthy individuals (collected prior to the Covid-19 outbreak) to the viral polymerase antigen. The study found that some T cell receptors did, in fact, recognise the polymerase.The researchers then used a method called ‘CLInt-Seq’ to genetically sequence these T cell receptors. They also engineered T cells to carry these polymerase-targeting receptors, which allowed the research team to study the receptors' ability to detect and kill SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.The team is now conducting more studies to analyse viral polymerase as a potential new component for Covid-19 vaccines in order to find a strategy to increase their protection and long-lasting immune response.The study is authored by Pavlo Nesterenko, a UCLA graduate student, and Owen Witte, who holds the presidential chair in developmental immunology in the UCLA Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics. While Pavlo is the first author, Witte holds the corresponding position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-find-a-new-strategy-to-boost-vaccine-efficacy-amid-omicron-spread-101639565437300.html

The toughest, of course, is being an NYPD cop on the street," said Patrick Lynch, head of the main police union in the city, the Police Benevolent Association.Sewell is currently chief investigator in Nassau County, east of New York City."We are absolutely focused on violent crime," she told the Post. "Violent crime is the number one priority."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-keechant-sewell-new-york-s-first-female-police-chief-ever-101639565555161.html
15-12-2021||World||Rwanda reports six confirmed Omicron cases; imposes shutdowns, quarantine rules||Rwanda has detected its first six cases of the fast-spreading Covid-19 Omicron variant, prompting the government to escalate pandemic measures, including shutting down nightclubs and extending quarantines for international travellers.Visitors will now be required to quarantine for three days instead of the current 24 hours, the government announced, after recording six cases of the Omicron variant in travellers and their contacts."A Covid-19 PCR test will be taken upon arrival and an additional test, taken on day three and on day seven at own cost, from the arrival date," the Ministry of Health said in a statement late Tuesday.The current midnight to 4 am curfew will remain in place while nightclubs have been ordered to close their doors barely three months after reopening.Omicron, first detected by South Africa and reported to the WHO on November 24, has a large number of mutations, leading many governments to swiftly reimpose containment measures to rein in transmission.Early data suggests it is more transmissible than the Delta variant, which was first identified in India and accounts for the bulk of the world's coronavirus cases.Rwanda, a country of 13 million people, has enforced some of the strictest containment measures on the continent and implemented a rigorous regime of testing and contact-tracing.Last month, it became the first country in East Africa to bar direct flights to and from nine countries in southern Africa where the Omicron variant was first reported.In total, the country has registered 100,763 cases of Covid-19 and 1,344 deaths, according to official figures.Rwanda has so far fully vaccinated 4.2 million people -- around 60 percent of Rwandans aged 18 and above.Unlike other countries in the region, it has also started administering vaccine booster shots to eligible adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rwanda-reports-six-confirmed-omicron-cases-imposes-shutdowns-quarantine-rules-101639559455706.html

The results, released on Tuesday, were the first-published preliminary data on the impact of Sinovac's vaccine against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.According to the researchers, the study has now been accepted for publication in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal. It showed that none of the 25 Sinovac vaccine recipients turned up with sufficient antibodies to neutralise the Omicron variant; only five of them had neutralising ability (not from antibodies), and vaccine efficiency was reduced significantly to 20-24%.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine produced some antibodies against Omicron but showed no neutralisation, according to Penny Moore, a professor at Johannesburg’s University of The Witwatersrand, which conducted the study.The virologist said that laboratory experiments were conducted on blood plasma samples from people who had had two doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine or the J&J single-shot inoculation. Although the vaccine appeared to provide some protection against Omicron, it is most likely from some other means such as stimulation of immune cells as opposed to neutralising antibodies.None of the pharmaceutical firms have yet responded to the results of the lab studies on Omicron, although a Sinovac spokesperson told the Reuters news agency that the company's own laboratory testing had shown the effectiveness of the third dose of its vaccine.Scientists say it is still too early to know if Omicron causes more or less severe Covid-19 than previous variants, but in the meanwhile, the fast-spreading Delta variant remains dominant worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-routs-j-j-vaccine-in-lab-study-may-evade-sinovac-and-biontech-too-101639549471713.html
15-12-2021||World||Amid violence, Myanmar citizens urge gas sanctions to stop military funding||The young woman in Myanmar decided to speak out when she realized that money from the company she loved was now in the hands of the military leaders she hated.She and her parents had long worked for Total Energies, the French company that operates a lucrative gas field off the coast of southern Myanmar with a state-owned enterprise. But in February, the military took over Myanmar’s government and its bank accounts, including those that receive hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the Total gas field, known as Yadana.As military abuses such as the murder and detention of thousands have grown, the young woman joined others across Myanmar in a groundswell of support for targeted sanctions on oil and gas funds, the country’s single largest source of foreign currency revenue. But Western governments — most notably the United States and France — have refused to take that step amid lobbying from energy company officials and resistance from countries such as Thailand, which gets gas from Myanmar. On Friday, the U.S. announced a raft of sanctions against several Myanmar officials and entities, but again left out oil or gas revenues.The young woman chanted slogans outside Total's offices, and later protested the military's takeover. She said she has since lost her job, and was thrown into prison for three weeks.“We had a good relationship and good memories of Total,” said the young woman, whose name, like those of other Myanmar gas workers in this story, is being withheld by The Associated Press for their safety. “Total has taken a lot from Myanmar....so they should at least help Myanmar with a little bit of effort during such a bloody period in our country.”In recent months, the Myanmar public’s cries for sanctions on gas revenues have grown thunderous. In August, activists launched the “Blood Money Campaign” movement, risking their lives by marching in the streets and carrying signs that read: “Freeze payments to junta and save Myanmar.” Others posted photos of themselves on social media holding signs that targeted the gas companies at the center of the debate: “Total, Chevron — Stop accessory to murder.”The United Nations’ top expert on human rights in Myanmar says millions of people across the country are imposing personal sanctions by withholding taxes, refusing to pay power bills and boycotting products linked to the military. And on Nov. 30, hundreds of civil society organizations in Myanmar joined their international colleagues in signing a letter asking Total's CEO to stop payments to military-controlled accounts.The AP also obtained a copy of a letter from workers at Yadana to their managers earlier this year calling on Total’s subsidiary, Total E&P Myanmar, to suspend export payments to the military, place the funds in a protected account and freeze income tax.“We are specifically concerned that the profits gained from Yadana Project, which we are working for, will, one way or another, help fund the military junta’s violent repression of Myanmar people,” the letter said.Total and Chevron say they condemn human rights abuses, but argue that sanctions could cause Myanmar's people further problems, such as cutting off electricity and making local gas workers vulnerable to military retaliation.Meanwhile, tolerance on the ground for global inaction has worn thin. Local armed groups, referred to as People's Defense Forces, have targeted bill collectors for the national utility and sabotaged buildings and infrastructure, according to EarthRights International, which works on environmental and human rights issues in Myanmar.Pro-sanctions activists don’t want to shut down the gas field itself. Instead, they want to sanction the project’s revenues and place them in a protected offshore bank account that the military can’t touch.The sanctions would target the state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is a joint venture partner in all offshore gas projects in Myanmar, including Yadana with Total, Chevron, and Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production. Total has a majority stake in the venture and runs its daily operations, while MOGE collects revenues on behalf of the government. Gas from Yadana is piped to Myanmar and neighboring Thailand.Several smaller offshore gas fields operate in Myanmar’s waters, run by companies from Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, India and South Korea in partnership with MOGE. China is also an investor in the pipeline that delivers the gas to the country.About 50 percent of Myanmar’s foreign currency comes from natural gas revenues, with MOGE expected to earn $1.5 billion from offshore and pipeline projects in 2021-2022, according to a Myanmar government forecast. The Yadana gas project and pipeline is particularly important, earning around $400 million in revenues in 2017-2018.Yet despite the growing calls for action, neither U.S. President Joe Biden nor French President Emmanuel Macron have publicly moved against Myanmar’s oil and gas revenues. The current sanctions from the U.S. and European Union lean heavily on gemstones.The U.S. State Department did not directly address AP’s questions about why it has yet to impose sanctions on MOGE. Instead, the department pointed to a list of other people and entities the U.S. has already sanctioned, including several military officials and their family members, two army units believed responsible for a litany of atrocities, the military’s two largest holding companies and a state-owned gems enterprise.“We will not hesitate to take further action against those who perpetrate violence and suppress the will of the people,” the department said in a statement.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the Biden administration is weighing tough new sanctions on Myanmar to pressure the country’s military leaders to restore a democratic path.An aide on the House Foreign Affairs Committee acknowledged that oil and gas make up “a huge chunk” of the military’s ability to maintain control. Despite that, a measure introduced in the House in October that specifically calls out MOGE as a potential sanctions target has yet to advance.The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the thinking around the legislation, said objections from Singapore and Thailand have played a role in the Biden administration’s hesitation to impose new sanctions, as has lobbying from Chevron. Activists have accused Singapore's banks of holding assets on the Myanmar military's behalf, although its central bank has said regular surveillance showed Myanmar companies and citizens did not have “significant funds” in the city state.In the first half of 2021, Chevron reported spending $3.7 million on federal lobbying in the U.S., with “Burma Energy Issues” and “Myanmar Energy and Investment Issues” listed as specific lobbying areas of focus.“It certainly seems in the U.S. there is a major lobbying campaign going on from Chevron to try and protect its interests,” said Chris Sidoti, a human rights lawyer and a member of the U.N. Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar from 2017 to 2019.In response to questions from the AP, a spokesman for Chevron pointed to an earlier statement from the company, which said Chevron would comply with any sanctions imposed by the U.S.“Any actions should be carefully considered to ensure the people of Myanmar are not further disadvantaged by unintended and unpredictable consequences of well-intentioned decisions,” Chevron wrote in its May statement.The French government also said it wants to avoid adding to the burdens of Myanmar civilians through sanctions and aims to target individuals from the junta rather than a vital economic sector. France wants to avoid normalizing relations with the junta but also wants to “stay involved on the ground” for humanitarian reasons, which requires “operational contacts” with Myanmar's administration, according to a senior official in the French president's office. He described the French government's thinking on condition of anonymity.He said Total's activities in Myanmar, including how it carries out payment for the gas, are the company's responsibility. Both the French government and Total want a return to a democratically elected government, “but at the same time you have to take into account the reality on the ground," he said.French authorities have told activists that Europe is expecting to impose a fourth round of sanctions by Feb. 1, the anniversary of the military’s takeover, and that both the energy and banking sectors are on the table.Total said in a statement that it is trying to keep its local employees safe from reprisals such as forced labor, and also to avoid further harm to Myanmar's population. Total also argues that it has to pay taxes and respect its contract legally, and that it will donate the equivalent of the taxes to human rights associations in Myanmar. Total cancelled exploration for new deposits in Myanmar after the military takeover.“The facts are that, in order to close off this source of revenue, the gas production should be brought to a stop,” the statement said. “Any cut to such supply of gas and, consequently, any risk of disruption to the supply of electricity must be considered in light of the consequences it could have on everyday life of local citizens."But several workers in Myanmar interviewed by AP dismissed concerns about their welfare, arguing the entire country is already oppressed. On Nov. 30, 789 civil society organizations — including 540 within Myanmar — sent a letter to CEO Patrick Pouyanne asking the company to “put an end to its complicity in crimes against humanity” by making payments to a holding account until democracy is restored. The letter argued that Total is now violating local laws against misappropriating public money and “has placed itself on the side of the junta.”MOGE can be targeted for sanctions without interrupting the flow of energy, said Tom Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar.“The people of Myanmar are not calling for anything that they, themselves, are unwilling to do,” Andrews said in an e-mail to the AP. “But the fact remains that to be truly effective, the people of Myanmar need countries to join them and impose sanctions on MOGE.”Human rights activists say it’s unconscionable for any company to help fund a military that has, in recent months, engaged in mass torture, launched attacks on medics, forcibly disappeared thousands of people, and returned mutilated corpses to victims’ families as tools of terror. Since February, soldiers and police have killed at least 1,300 people and arrested more than 10,800, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors deaths and arrests.Last month, the National Unity Government, an underground opposition group and parallel administration, released a public statement that dubbed MOGE the military’s most important financial lifeline and called for urgent sanctions.“As a nation, we have these natural resources to build a school, to build a hospital, to build a road,” said spokesman Dr. Sasa, who goes by one name. “So why are we still using this money to kill the people of Myanmar? To us, it is barbarity.”In response to questions, the military said state revenue is used for education, infrastructure, development projects and public service, and is also used “proportionately for the rule of law and for defense.” The military has long denied allegations of human rights abuses.“All state revenue is spent according to the needs of the country,” the military said in a statement to the AP. "Putting restrictions on the current government is directly affecting the social and economic life of the citizens.”The Yadana project provides less than 1.5 percent of Chevron’s worldwide natural gas output, and Total says Yadana represents less than 1 percent of its production. But while Yadana isn’t a significant source of income, it also doesn’t cost the companies much because major set-up fees were incurred decades ago, said Readul Islam, a Singapore-based research analyst at Rystad Energy. Chevron and Total would also struggle to sell the operation, given the remaining short life of the aging gas field and the grim political situation, he said.“These operations are not company-makers by any sense, but they are profitable," Islam said.Also, Chevron and Total’s aversion to sanctions may be less about money than about precedent, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.“If you signal that every time a country has serious human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch and other groups can come in and say, ‘You should sanction your revenue,’ it’s going to create business headaches for them all over the world,” he said.With public pressure mounting, Total and Chevron announced in May that they were suspending dividend payments by the Moattama Gas Transportation Company, which owns the Yadana pipeline. While welcoming the move as a first step, activists argue the dividend payments are a fraction of the military’s gas revenues.The energy analytics firm Wood Mackenzie in November downgraded its forecast of Myanmar gas exports to Thailand after Yadana’s output fell faster than expected. Rights activists said Thai fears of a gas slowdown or cutoff at a time of surging prices across Asia have stiffened its resistance to new sanctions, which the U.S. and EU appeared reluctant to challenge. The Thai government did not respond with comment.In Myanmar, some gas workers have dismissed the energy companies’ concerns that they will face retaliation with sanctions. One 10-year employee of Total said the risk of losing his job due to sanctions was nothing compared to the risk of the generals remaining in power.“Everyone needs a job,” he said. “But I don’t want to survive by working here while everyone is suffering from this crisis.”Given he and millions of others already have risked so much in the pursuit of democracy, he is frustrated with the international community’s failure to act.“I don’t understand why they keep paying the junta,” he said.After the young woman whose family had long worked for Total protested outside its gates, the contractor company that hired her warned her not to participate again in the country’s pro-democracy Civil Disobedience Movement, she said.A few months later, she posted on social media about what she felt was Total’s poor treatment of a colleague who died of COVID-19. Days later, she said, the contractor company fired her for allegedly defaming Total. In a statement, Total said that no Total E&P employees have been fired since the military's takeover, and none have been prevented from participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement.In September, she was arrested and imprisoned for three weeks under Section 505(A) of the Penal Code, which, in part, criminalizes comments that “cause fear” or spread “false news.”“I feel very disappointed in Total because they are neglecting this country in which they invested,” she said.For another Total employee, the lack of action from those who claim to stand for human rights is baffling. Why he asked, hasn’t the international community told gas companies that if they do business with the military, they can no longer do business with the rest of the world?For him, the solution to military abuse is simple.“If they do not have revenue, they cannot buy weapons,” he says. “If they cannot buy weapons, this revolution will end quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-violence-myanmar-citizens-urge-gas-sanctions-to-stop-military-funding-101639550005730.html
15-12-2021||World||China: PLA conducts nuclear, chemical, biological warfare drill in Tibet||A joint military brigade of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has recently carried out a “real combat drill” involving anti-nuclear, chemical and biological warfare in Tibet in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh.The exercise, including commandos, armoured assault groups and soldiers trained for chemical warfare were drawn from various wings of the army.It was organised by the Tibet military region under the Western theatre command (WTC), the largest of China’s five commands that is responsible for the Sino-India disputed border, extending for 3,488 km from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.The news of the 24-hour long exercise held in late November was published in an official PLA news portal on Tuesday.Chinese official military media rarely mentions drills that involve Chinese armed forces and non-conventional weapons.The article described in brief the nature of the drill and what the participating soldiers were responding to but did not specifically mention where the exercise was held. “A joint military brigade under the Tibet military area command held a real-combat drill on a snowy plateau in late November,” the article said.It was headlined: “A synthetic brigade of the Tibet military region carried out a cross-day and night mobile multi-arm coordinated actual combat drill”.After rockets were launched and the armoured assault group was deployed, army engineers were called in to install explosives on the targeted “obstacle”, the article said.Subsequently, the commanding officer warned of “nuclear, biological and chemical attack”. “Encountered a nuclear, biological and chemical attack! Suddenly, an immediate guidance command came. Li Qunfeng, commander of the third battalion, put on gas masks, quickly passed through the poisoned zone, and then reported the situation to the command post, requesting the chemical defence detachment to help and decontaminate.”“The drill closely focused on the ‘enemy’ situation, focusing on key and difficult subjects such as day and night manoeuvring and multi-arms coordination, and tempered the firepower attack capability of the troops in complex environments,” the report added.The report carried photos of the exercise including one in which soldiers were wearing gas masks.In a report in November, the US department of defence said China is carrying out research in chemical and biological dual-use technology.“The PRC has engaged in biological activities with potential dual-use applications, which raise concerns regarding its compliance with the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),” the report said.“Studies conducted at PRC military medical institutions discussed identifying, testing, and characterising diverse families of potent toxins with dual-use applications.”“Based on available information, the US cannot certify that the PRC has met its obligations under the CWC due to concerns regarding the PRC’s research of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) and toxins with potential dual-use applications,” the US report added.The drill in November is likely to have been closely followed by the Indian defence establishment.It is part of the PLA’s continuous efforts to remain combat ready along the Sino-India border, where it is said to have deployed an unknown number of troops - estimates run into thousands - and heavy cache of advanced weaponry.The PLA has published how it has improved the facilities and living conditions for its border troops in high-altitude areas of Tibet and Xinjiang, indicating that they have been deployed for the long-run.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Soldiers were killed on both sides in a brutal fight on the night of June 15 at Galwan Valley.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pla-conducts-nuclear-chemical-biological-warfare-drill-in-tibet-101639551500287.html
15-12-2021||World||Omicron threat: Canada likely to announce new travel guidelines||Canada is expected to reinstate its advisory against all non-essential travel outside the country while reversing relaxations like those for foreign nationals entering the country, due to the potential impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, a development the country’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described as “scary” on Tuesday.Many measures that eased as vaccination rates increased could be rolled back in an announcement that is expected soon. Among them is barring fully vaccinated foreign nationals from travelling to the country, according to the outlet CBC News. Such travellers were allowed since September 7 this year. Similarly, while the government officially withdrew its advisory against non-essential travel by Canadian citizens and permanent residents outside the country this October, that is likely to make a comeback, according to the outlet CTV News.These moves are expected after Trudeau held an emergency conference call with premiers of Canada’s provinces and territories on Tuesday evening as Omicron threatens to disrupt the holiday season in the country.In an interview with the outlet Red FM on Tuesday, Justin Trudeau said, “This Omicron variant is scary. And it’s the last thing anyone needs, to have to worry, again, about another wave.”However, he added that with greater vaccination uptake including booster and paediatric doses along with health-related precautions, Canada would “make it through this winter and into a much better summer”.National Omicron figures were not provided, but the country’s most populous province Ontario reported that the variant now accounts for 30.8% cases of new daily infections with the doubling time at just three days. Ontario health officials expected the variant to account for nearly all new cases by January next year.More worryingly, the province’s Science Advisory Table placed the reproductive or R rate at 4.01, far higher than that for Delta, which was at 1.09.There were 4,336 fresh cases of all Covid-19 infections on Tuesday and Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam tweeted that eight provinces had reported higher numbers, making “for a national weekly increase of 30%”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-threat-canada-likely-to-announce-new-travel-guidelines-101639547719779.html
15-12-2021||World||Mark Meadows, ex-Trump chief of staff, held in contempt for defying Capitol riot probe||US lawmakers voted Tuesday to recommend criminal contempt charges against Donald Trump's former top aide Mark Meadows for refusing to testify before the congressional panel investigating the January 6 assault on the Capitol.The rebuke from the House of Representatives moves the ultra-conservative ex-congressman a step closer to becoming the first White House chief of staff to be prosecuted after leaving the post since H.R. Haldeman in the Watergate scandal nearly 50 years ago."We've given Mark Meadows every opportunity to cooperate. He's brought this situation on himself," the House January 6 select committee said in a statement ahead of the vote, which went roughly along party lines, with just two Republicans joining every Democrat to hold Meadows in contempt.The panel is investigating Trump's efforts to overturn his defeat in the November 2020 election in the run-up to the Capitol riot -- as well as the help he got from Meadows and others.Meadows, who served in the House for seven years before decamping to Trump's team in 2020, defied a subpoena requiring him to testify, pointing to an "executive privilege" claim by the Republican former president.That defense, which is theoretically only available to sitting presidents seeking to keep sensitive conversations with aides private, has already been shot down by a federal appeals court.The nine-member select committee, which voted Monday to advance the contempt case, says it is seeking answers about text messages and other communications that Meadows has already acknowledged are not privileged.Investigators say Meadows has given up any right to refuse testimony in any event, as he is promoting a new memoir that includes detailed accounts of January 6 and his conversations with Trump.He has also spoken numerous times about the attack in primetime appearances on Fox News.‘Dereliction of duty’During Monday's hearing, Cheney readout frantic messages sent to Meadows during the assault from three Fox News hosts, as well as administration officials, lawmakers, and the president's son Donald Trump Jr.Each begged Meadows -- unsuccessfully -- to get Trump to call off his supporters and put a stop to the violence."We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand," Trump Jr told Meadows.The messages made it clear that, contrary to their efforts since January 6 to downplay the assault, members of the former president's inner circle were appalled by the violence at the time."It's disappointing and unfortunately not surprising that some of the very same individuals who were willing to warn, condemn and express horror over what happened on January 6 in private were totally silent... or, even worse, were spreading lies and conspiracy theories," President Joe Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.Cheney described the texts as evidence of Trump's "supreme dereliction of duty" during three hours of inaction during the assault when thousands of his supporters stormed the Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's election victory.In a further sign of the net tightening on figures accused of involvement in the Capitol assault, the Democratic attorney general for the US capital said Tuesday he was suing the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, blaming the far-right groups for the violence.The Meadows case is a federal issue, however, and the 62-year-old Florida native will have to sweat until the Justice Department decides whether prosecutors will take up the House referral.The department charged former White House strategist Steve Bannon with criminal contempt of Congress less than a month after the House voted to refer him.The Meadows decision may prove less straightforward than the case of Bannon, who was not working for the Trump administration at the time of the riot.Meadows' lawyer George Terwilliger said in a statement his client's refusal to cooperate did not amount to non-cooperation, but rather an effort to "honor" Trump's rejected privilege claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-meadows-ex-trump-chief-of-staff-held-in-contempt-for-defying-capitol-riot-probe-101639542519066.html

Moore said the vaccine appears to provide some protection against omicron, perhaps via other means such as stimulation of immune cells.J&J didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A measure of antibody levels, called geometric mean titers, fell from 1,419 against the original coronavirus strain to 80 against Omicron among people who received Pfizer shots. The same measure fell from 303 against the original strain to undetectable levels against omicron in those who had received J&J’s shot, Moore said in an online presentation on Tuesday.“Omicron does indeed exhibit substantial immune escape from antibodies,” she said. “The situation, I think, is even more alarming for the J&J vaccine -- there was no detectable neutralization in our assay.”Severe DiseaseThe as-yet-unpublished research Moore presented to an African health conference ties in with early experiments by South Africa’s Africa Health Research Institute and Pfizer’s own research. Omicron’s discovery was announced by South African scientists on Nov. 25.Still, Moore stressed, the body has other protection against the virus.“Reduced antibody titers will likely result in a decreased ability of vaccines to prevent infection but protection against severe disease likely to be preserved,” she said on one of her presentation slides.  J&J’s vaccine appears to be preventing severe disease in a study involving hundreds of thousands of South African health workers and no one on the study has died after being infected by the omicron variant, Glenda Gray, the co-lead of the study said in an earlier presentation on Tuesday.Discovery Health Ltd., the country’s largest medical insurance provider, said earlier today that a two-shot course of Pfizer’s vaccine appeared to offer 70% protection against being hospitalized after infection with the omicron variant. The shots made by Pfizer and J&J are the two currently being used in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-vaccine-loses-antibody-protection-against-omicron-in-lab-study-101639537015720.html

According to the Reuters news agency, both Beijing and Moscow also share similar approaches in foreign policy with respect to Iran, Syria and Venezuela, and recently revived a push to lift United Nations sanctions on North Korea.Also Read | Russia, China top agenda as G7 ministers call for unity against authoritarianismExtensive discussions on foreign policy, in view of rising global tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border, are likely to come up on Wednesday in the virtual meeting between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed a day prior that the premiers will be discussing a host of international issues during the upcoming online meeting, including the “aggressive rhetoric” of NATO and the United States pertaining to Ukraine.“The situation in international affairs, especially on the European continent, is very, very tense, and of course, requires discussion between the allies, between Moscow and Beijing,” the Kremlin spokesman was quoted as saying by the Sputnik news agency. “We see very, very aggressive rhetoric, both from NATO and from the United States of America, this requires our discussion with the Chinese side.”According to Peskov, the two countries will also discuss regional issues, energy, and bilateral relations. It is to be noted that China had received significant amounts of coal from its northern neighbour amid a gruelling shortage in fossil fuel stocks this year, another indicator of the two nations warming up to each other in an effort to consolidate against the West's influence.Also Read | ‘US democracy weapon of mass destruction’: China lambasts global summitChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, on the other hand, did not reveal what the two premiers will discuss but said that full details of the meet will be released afterwards. “At the meeting, the two heads of state will give a full review of China-Russia relations and cooperation in various fields this year and make top-level designs for the development of bilateral ties next year,” he was quoted as saying.It is, however, not yet clear what Beijing's stance on Ukraine is, even though the situation at the border continues to heat up. Moscow has repeatedly refuted US allegations of preparing an invasion while expressing concerns about the transfer of NATO's military equipment near Russian borders and the increase in the number of Western instructors in Donbas. Russia has also said it has the right to move forces within its own territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xiputin-meet-lined-up-today-after-both-russia-china-left-out-of-biden-summit-101639531231867.html

China was not on the U.S. State Department's invited participants list."Losing a diplomatic ally is a very painful thing for us," Wu told reporters.China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beijing has increased military and political pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims, drawing anger from the democratically ruled island, which has repeatedly said it would not be bullied and has the right to international participation.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would not bend to pressure or change its determination to uphold democracy and freedom."The more successful Taiwan's democracy is, the stronger the international support, and the greater the pressure from the authoritarian camp," she said in Taipei.China and Nicaragua's move to re-establish diplomatic ties will likely boost Beijing's influence in a part of the world long considered the United States' backyard, angering Washington.Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega first cut ties with Taiwan in 1985, but they were re-established with the island in 1990 under then-Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.Wu said all of his colleagues in the foreign ministry "put forth their greatest efforts to maintain these diplomatic ties."Nicaragua's move to cut ties with Taiwan leaves the island with just 14 formal diplomatic allies, most of them in Latin America and the Caribbean, plus a handful of small states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-target-our-allies-while-us-was-hosting-democracy-summit-taiwan-minister-101639529152044.html
15-12-2021||World||US Covid-19 death toll crosses 800,000||The United States, the country hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, crossed 800,000 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University showed.The figure is greater than the entire population of several states, including North Dakota and Alaska.Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who lead the House of Representatives and Senate respectively, as well as House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and other members of Congress held a moment of silence on the steps of the Capitol building Tuesday evening."On this day... we will remember that 800,000 loved ones did not make it this far: a lost father or grandfather, mother or grandmother, a friend, a familiar face in the neighborhood," Schumer said in a statement."All of us know of someone whom this disease has taken away."Around 450,000 of the deaths occurred in 2021, despite highly effective vaccines that were first authorized in December 2020 and widely available by springtime.The vast majority of the deaths have been among the unvaccinated.According to official data, the risk of dying from Covid-19 was 14 times higher among people who had not been fully vaccinated, compared to those who had, in September, the latest month analyzed.Vaccinations picked up during the fourth wave of the disease, driven by the Delta variant, and more than 60 percent of the country's 332 million people are now fully vaccinated -- though the United States still lags behind other wealthy nations.The country is now into its fifth wave, with the epicenter in colder northern states, as people gather more often indoors.Omicron, the latest variant of concern that has caused worldwide alarm since it was first reported in South Africa in late November, now accounts for around three percent of US cases, but that is expected to rise rapidly, as has been seen in other countries.Even if early data suggesting the variant causes milder illness in most people is confirmed, its increased transmissibility and ability to overcome prior immunity may negate this advantage, by infecting far more people.Health authorities are urging everyone over 16 to get a booster shot to restore immunity to levels comparable to two doses against earlier strains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-800000-101639527726241.html
15-12-2021||World||Tesla faces barrage of US sex harassment lawsuits||Six women sued Tesla on Tuesday, alleging a culture of sexual harassment at the electric carmaker's California plant and other facilities that included unwanted touching, catcalls and retaliation for those who complained.The lawsuits -- filed within a month of two others -- add to the controversies centered on the Fremont factory in the San Francisco Bay area and which include a Black ex-employee being awarded $137 million in a racism case."Tesla's factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction site or frat house than a cutting-edge company in the heart of the progressive San Francisco Bay area," several of the suits claim.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaints, which in at least one instance argued CEO Elon Musk's explicit or provocative tweets influenced the tone at the workplace.The six separate new suits filed Tuesday in a California court include five women who work or worked in the Fremont factory facilities, while one was employed in service centers in southern California.Michala Curran was 18 when she started her job at the Fremont plant and within weeks, her supervisor and co-workers were making explicit comments to her face about her body.One male co-worker sexually propositioned her, saying plant employees often had sex in the parking lot."After nearly two months of being sexualized at her first job out of high school, she could not take it anymore and decided to quit," her suit says, alleging "rampant sexual harassment at Tesla."SpaceX allegationsThe other cases were filed by Jessica Brooks, Samira Sheppard, Eden Mederos, Alize Brown and Alisa Blickman, who alleged in her lawsuit that she faced retaliation for reporting the misconduct."She was denied certain privileges and benefits that were afforded to women who did not object to supervisors' sexual advances and flirtations," Blickman's complaint says.Mederos, who worked in southern California Tesla service centers, said Musk tweets that reference sex or drugs inspired laughter and jokes among her co-workers."When Tesla launched the Model Y, Elon repeatedly pointed out that when one reads the Tesla Models S, 3, X and Y together, it spells 'SEXY,'" her suit said. "Some of Ms. Mederos' co-workers latched onto this, calling everything 'sexy.'"Echoing concerns in the lawsuits, a former engineer from Musk's SpaceX rocket firm has published an essay alleging she was sexually harassed at work."Men from the company found my Instagram account, messaging me to ask me out. One called my phone at 4:00 am. Another coworker came to my house and insisted on touching me even when I repeatedly requested we stay professional," wrote Ashley Kosak."I reported each incident of sexual harassment I experienced to HR, and nothing was done," she added.SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The series of lawsuits come after a California jury ruled in October that Tesla should pay a Black ex-employee $137 million in damages for turning a blind eye to racism the man encountered at the Fremont plant.Time magazine on Monday named Musk as its person of the year 2021, citing his embodiment of recent technological shifts but also troubling trends reshaping people's lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-faces-barrage-of-us-sex-harassment-lawsuits-101639525927891.html

"We've got one of the highest vaccination rates, which means we can fight this thing. We don't have to surrender to it."Australia has inoculated nearly 90% of its population above 16 with two doses and shortened the wait time for booster shots after the emergence of the Omicron cases.Morrison, who had been deemed a casual contact after attending an event last week along with a COVID-infected person, said he has been cleared to fly interstate to Queensland after negative test results."That's what living with the virus is," he said.Australia closed its borders in March 2020 in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and had limited the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed entry. The relaxation of border rules is expected to ease labour shortages, which threaten to hamper an economic rebound.The return of foreign students, who are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, will help businesses to fill many casual jobs. More than 235,000 foreigners, including about 160,000 students, held visas for Australia at the end of October, official data showed.The easing in travel rules comes as the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, lifted most restrictions from Wednesday for the unvaccinated, despite a steady rise in Omicron infections after a staggered reopening.The state logged 1,360 new cases, the biggest daily rise in more than three months and since a nearly four-month lockdown ended in early October. Australia has recorded about 235,500 cases and 2,117 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-omicron-worries-australia-reopens-borders-for-noncitizens-101639524656258.html

15-12-2021||World||Virus restrictions approved in UK but dissent worries Boris Johnson||British lawmakers voted Tuesday to approve new restrictions to curb the spread of the omicron variant, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a major revolt by lawmakers in his own Conservative Party who are opposed to the regulations.The result was a blow to the authority of the embattled prime minister, whose approval ratings — both with voters and inside the party — have plunged amid ethics scandals and allegations that his government breached its own pandemic restrictions.The House of Commons voted on measures that take effect this week, ordering masks to be worn in most indoor settings in England, changing rules on self-isolation and — most contentiously — requiring proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to enter nightclubs and large crowded events.All passed comfortably because of opposition party support, but 97 Conservatives voted against the nightclub rules, according to a House of Commons tally — by far the biggest rebellion of Johnson's premiership. It came despite Johnson imploring Tory legislators to back the measures in a private meeting just before the vote.Lawmaker Charles Walker, one of the rebels, called the vote “a cry of pain from the Conservative Party” that the prime minister must heed.Vaccine passes have become commonplace in many European countries, but Johnson’s government has resisted introducing them in England, although the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which set their own health rules, have done so.The British government argues that the highly transmissible omicron strain has changed the argument, and COVID passes for some venues are now a sensible measure, alongside booster vaccinations for all adults.“Omicron is a grave threat,” Health Secretary Sajid Javid told lawmakers, saying the strain was already estimated to be infecting 200,000 people a day in the UK.He said the nightclub rule was “not a vaccine passport” because people could also use a negative virus test to enter venues.Many Conservative legislators, however, argued that the new requirements were economically damaging and restricted individual freedoms.Former government minister Andrea Leadsom called the regulations “a slippery slope.” Conservative lawmaker Greg Smith argued that vaccine passes and mandatory vaccinations for health workers — another government policy — marked “a fundamental change in the relationship between citizen and state, and one to be resisted.”Other Conservatives argued vaccine passes would not slow the spread of the virus, because omicron appears more resistant to vaccines, while some accused the government of exaggerating the threat from the new variant.The opposition Labour Party, meanwhile, backed the rules. Labour health spokesman West Streeting said they were “a necessary response to the omicron threat.”“We can’t be sure about the severity of the omicron variant, but we can be certain that it’s spreading and spreading fast,” he said. "When people invoke the story of the boy who cried wolf — the warnings that came before but never materialized — people should remember that in the end there was a wolf.”As if to underscore omicron’s rapid spread, a handful of lawmakers missed the vote because they have COVID-19 and are in quarantine.The rebellion was a sign of growing discontent with Johnson in Conservative ranks. The party picked him to be leader in 2019 because he promised to “get Brexit done” after three years of gridlock over Britain’s departure from the European Union under Prime Minister Theresa May. The same promise helped Johnson win a December 2019 election with an 80-seat majority in the House of Commons, the biggest for any Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.Since then the pandemic and a series of scandals have chipped away at the support for Johnson and his government. Johnson’s initial reluctance to impose a nationwide lockdown in early 2020 helped give the U.K. the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe apart from Russia, with more than 146,000 deaths.A successful vaccination program helped Johnson recover some of his authority, but his government has faced damaging allegations that it flouted the coronavirus rules it imposed on everyone else, including claims staff in Johnson’s 10 Downing St. office held lockdown-breaching Christmas parties last year. Johnson has ordered an inquiry, but insists he personally broke no rules.The government also faced charges of cronyism when it tried to block the suspension of a Conservative lawmaker found to have broken lobbying rules by advocating on behalf of two companies who were paying him. The government changed tack after an outcry and the lawmaker, Owen Paterson, resigned.A special election on Thursday to replace Paterson could add to Johnson’s woes. Polls suggest the opposition Liberal Democrats may take the seat from the Conservatives. Nationally, the Labour Party has opened up a lead in opinion polls.Since a national election is not scheduled until 2024, the danger for Johnson comes largely from his own party. The Conservatives have a long history of dumping leaders when they become unpopular.“Clearly, he is in trouble,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “The question is whether that trouble is terminal or not."I doubt whether he is in any immediate danger — he will still be there by Christmas. But I think the new year will be an interesting few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-restrictions-approved-in-uk-but-dissent-worries-boris-johnson-101639523129360.html

A US panel of experts narrowly voted in favor of the Merck pill two weeks ago, but FDA authorization is still awaited.Final study results showed molnupiravir reduced hospitalizations and deaths by a modest 30 percent, and there were also safety concerns over how it actually works, which is different from the Pfizer pill.Merck itself recommended against molnupiravir's use in pregnant women after animal studies showed harm to fetuses.- Real-world vaccine data - The news comes as the heavily-mutated Omicron variant is spreading rapidly around the world, with the World Health Organization saying it is "probably" present in most countries.Even if early data suggesting that the variant causes milder illness in most people is confirmed, its increased transmissibility and ability to overcome prior immunity may negate this advantage, by infecting higher numbers of people.Many countries have stepped up their booster shot campaigns in a bid to restore vaccine efficacy.The latest research out of South Africa found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still offered good protection against serious illness of 70 percent, though this was reduced from 93 percent during the country's Delta wave.The study was based on the results of 78,000 PCR tests taken in South Africa between November 15 and December 7.It also found two doses were 33 percent effective against infection -- a result that aligns with early research from Britain, which experts said underscored the case for a third dose.The British research found a third dose of Pfizer -- either after two earlier doses of Pfizer or two of AstraZeneca -- brought efficacy against infection back up to 70-75 percent.The South African research further confirmed reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, and a lower percentage of people infected with the new variant were hospitalized when compared to the country's first wave, after adjusting for vaccine status.bur-ia/sst||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-claims-covid-pill-paxlovid-drastically-reduces-disease-severity-101639522822905.html

Korea, facing economic crisis, to convene parliament to discuss budget||The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the isolated state's rubber-stamp parliament, will convene on Feb. 6 to discuss government budgets and other issues, state media said on Wednesday as the country faces mounting economic woes.The North's parliament rarely meets and usually serves to approve decisions on issues such as governing structures and budgets that have been created by the state's powerful Workers' Party, members of which form the vast majority of the assembly.The agenda for February's meeting will include the work of the cabinet, government budgets, childcare legislation and "the law on the protection of the rights and interests of overseas compatriots," KCNA news agency reported.The decision to convene the parliament came at a plenary meeting of the SPA's standing committee on Tuesday, KCNA said.The standing committee was overseen by its chairman, Choe Ryong Hae, one of the most powerful officials under the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.The committee also discussed laws on construction design, property and river and ship transport, KCNA reported.North Korea's economy suffered its biggest contraction in 23 years in 2020 as it was battered by continued UN sanctions, COVID-19 lockdown measures and bad weather, South Korea's central bank has estimated.North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but closed borders and imposed strict prevention measures, seeing the pandemic as a matter of national survival.The UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea has said the country's most vulnerable people risk starvation after it slipped deeper into isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-facing-economic-crisis-to-convene-parliament-to-discuss-budget-101639522803784.html
15-12-2021||India||Government looks to name new Chief of Defence Staff with eye on reforms||The government is working fast on appointing a new chief of defence staff (CDS) after the untimely demise of General Bipin Rawat in a Mi-17V5 chopper crash last week to ensure that ongoing military reforms are not slowed down, people familiar with matter said on Wednesday. Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said that jointness would remain the military’s priority. The minister said integration of the armed forces to enhance their effectiveness and reshape the conduct of future operations would progress seamlessly. Leadership vacuum is never good, said one of the people cited above. Rawat, who was killed in the crash along with 13 others, was spearheading the theaterisation drive to best utilise the military’s resources for future wars. Singh’s comments indicated that the current vacuum created by Rawat’s passing will not hit India’s theaterisation plans. Such appointments should never be left vacant as ambiguity is the biggest enemy of the governing mechanism in any set up, said military affairs expert Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd), who headed a committee that presented its report on enhancing the military’s combat potential to the government in 2016. “I was not only hoping but reasonably confident that the government would immediately appoint an officiating CDS to steer the ongoing reforms and look into emerging security challenges,” he said. According to a key recommendation made by the 11-member Shekatkar panel, the government should choose the CDS from among the three service chiefs. The defence minister said the process of “integration and modernisation of tri-services” was initiated with the creation of the post of CDS and the department of military affairs (DMA), and it will be carried forward to achieve the goals as early as possible. Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. As CDS, he wore multiple hats --- he was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), headed DMA, and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister. All eyes are now on who will be appointed as Rawat’s successor at a time when the theaterisation plan is at a critical juncture and needs a man with matching vision to carry it forward. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane became the senior-most military officer in the country after Rawat’s demise. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him. There is a strong possibility of Naravane being named as the new CDS if the government follows the seniority principle, as previously reported. Army vice chief Lieutenant General CP Mohanty and Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi, who are both course mates, are the senior-most officers in the army after Naravane. Naravane is due for retirement next April but that may not happen in the changed circumstances. Many in the security establishment believe that the first two or three CDS appointments should be from the army as the security challenges the country faces are along the borders with China and Pakistan. However, making top appointments is the government’s prerogative. The possibility of deep selection cannot be ruled out as was done when Rawat was appointed army chief almost five years back. He superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz. The Indian Air Force has already begun a probe into the CDS chopper crash, and plans to complete it swiftly. Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, who is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, is heading the tri-service probe. He has defied death multiple times in his 39-year military career, including once during one of the gravest emergencies in IAF history involving a Russian-origin Mi-17V5 helicopter. At this point, it is not clear what went wrong with the helicopter in the final moments of the crash though the weather in the area where it went down did not have good visibility. Search crews last week recovered the helicopter’s black box that could give vital clues about what went wrong.
15-12-2021||India||Goa minister Milind Naik resigns hours after Cong names him in ‘sex scandal’||PANAJI: Goa minister for urban development Milind Naik resigned from Pramod Sawant’s cabinet on Wednesday, hours after the Congress accused the minister of sexually exploiting a young woman from Bihar.“Shri Milind Naik has tendered his resignation as a minister in Government of Goa, to ensure a free and fair probe, which has been accepted and sent to the Hon’ble Governor,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant’s office said in a statement late on Wednesday.The announcement came hours after Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar alleged Milind Naik was involved in a sex scandal that he had first spoken about last month. Chodankar said he was putting out the minister’s name because the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government hadn’t acted against him despite being given details of the sexual misconduct.“The minister involved in the sex scandal, Milind Naik, should be sacked and action should be initiated against him. And ministers like Milind Naik who sexually assault women should be not be protected or the people of Goa will not forgive me,” Chodankar told a press conference in Panaji on Wednesday.Chodankar also released printouts of what he said were private messages between the woman and the minister to back up his allegation.Milind Naik did not respond to multiple requests by HT for his version. Local media reports in Goa, however, quoted Naik rubbishing the Congress allegation, insisting that these were only designed to defame him. “I have nothing to do with this matter,” he said after Chodankar first spoke about the allegations last month but hadn’t identified the minister, saying the opposition wanted to wait for 15 days for chief minister Pramod Sawant to act against the minister concerned. The Congress leader claimed that the minister was heard on tape sexually exploiting a woman, who he said, among other things, was forcing her to have an abortion.The Congress said an official complaint has also been filed with the police with the women’s police station against the minister. In the interim period, Chodankar said he also received a legal notice by a law firm claiming to represent the unnamed victim, who the notice said, was from Bihar and warned him against releasing any of the allegedly damning material.Chodankar said he also hoped Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar takes necessary steps “to safeguard the interests of a daughter of Bihar, against whom a minister in Goa is committing atrocities”.“Give the required confidence to the woman who is claiming to be from Bihar as per the legal notice I have received and the police complaint that is filed. You are speaking about empowering women in Bihar. Will you stand with your daughter or with the minister in Goa. The people of Bihar and India are watching you,” Chodankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-minister-milind-naik-resigns-hours-after-cong-names-him-in-sex-scandal-101639590578087.html
15-12-2021||India||Uncanny parallel between deaths of Group Captain Varun Singh, Siachen survivor||An uncanny parallel between the passing away of Group Captain Varun Singh and Lance Naik Hanamanthappa Koppad, who was killed along with nine others on the Siachen glacier five years ago, emerged on Wednesday. Their brave fight against death lasted about a week as the country prayed for a miracle on both occasions. Both were sole survivors. Both were in their 30s. And both their families were hoping against hope that they would defeat death. Both will be remembered. Koppad survived six days buried under an avalanche in Siachen in February 2016 before he died at the Army Hospital (Research and Referral) in Delhi. Singh passed away on Wednesday at the Air Force Command Hospital in Bengaluru after a week-long brave fight against death. Koppad was among 10 soldiers who were swept away by an ice wall on February 3, 2016, while guarding the Sonam post located at 20,500 feet. The 33-year-old was from 19 Madras. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the nation in paying homage to both Koppad and Singh. “He leaves us sad and devastated. RIP Lance Naik Hanumanthappa. The soldier in you remains immortal. Proud that martyrs like you served India,” Modi then said in a tweet. Group Captain Singh was the only man to have survived the December 8 Mi-17V5 chopper crash that killed 13 people including chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat. He was 39. “Group Captain Varun Singh served the nation with pride, valour and utmost professionalism. I am extremely anguished by his passing away. His rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti,” the PM wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The chopper crash that sent shock waves through the Indian military establishment, has been dubbed a devastating setback for the ongoing military reforms and raised questions about succession in the armed forces.

The forest department therefore had asked the DRDO to switch off the lights that could disorient the turtles. “The high-powered illuminated lights installed at the test range centre are a distracting factor for turtles that instead of heading towards the nesting ground move towards the test range centre,” Bhoi said.The high-powered lights at the Integrated Test Range Centre have been installed for coastal security watch and vigil programmes. The DRDO has covered the lights to reduce the intensity.The endangered turtles travel all the way from the Pacific Ocean and visit the Odisha coast in November after travelling for thousands of kilometres in the seawater. They mate in December and January before the mass nesting, which takes place in the last week of February to the second week of March. The turtles also lay their eggs at the mouth of the Rushikulya river in Ganjam district and Devi river in Puri district. An Olive Ridley female turtle usually lays about 120-150 eggs and the hatchlings emerge in a span of 45-60 days. However, out of every 1,000 hatchlings that enter the sea, only one manages to reach adulthood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-covers-bright-lights-on-coastal-watch-to-avoid-distracting-olive-ridleys-101639584576221.html

This is lower than the usual limit of ₹25,000.In a statement, the RBI said the decision was taken in consultation with the government. The RBI said it "has decided that Indian passport holders as well as persons of Indian origin carrying the Overseas Citizen of India Card along with their passports travelling to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, Narowal, Pakistan through the Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, shall be allowed to carry outside and bring into India at the time of his/her return, only Indian currency notes and/or foreign currency in USD, the total value of which may not exceed ₹11,000".The country’s central bank issued the statement titled 'Lower currency limit for pilgrims visiting Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur'.According to the Foreign Exchange Management (Export and Import of Currency) Regulations, 2015, any Indian resident may carry outside currency notes of up to ₹25,000, other than to Nepal and Bhutan.

15-12-2021||India||UNESCO recognises Kolkata’s Durga Puja as Intangible Cultural Heritage||The UNESCO on Wednesday added Durga Puja in Kolkata to its 2021 list of Intangible Cultural Heritage, giving international recognition to the biggest religious festival of the 331-year-old city and the state of West Bengal. As many as 36,946 community Durga Pujas are organised in Bengal. Of these, around 2,500 are held in Kolkata. In recent years, several organisations had urged UNESCO to recognise the festival. Traditional yoga and the Kumbh Mela got the recognition in 2016 and 2017 respectively. On Wednesday, the Durga Puja was the only Indian festival to make it to the list of 20 events and traditional activities. “Durga Puja is an annual festival celebrated in September or October, most notably in Kolkata, in West Bengal of India, but also in other parts of India and amongst the Bengali diaspora,” the UNESCO wrote on its website on Wednesday, mentioning the cultural activities, involvement of artisans and participation of the masses. “Durga Puja is seen as the best instance of the public performance of religion and art, and as a thriving ground for collaborative artists and designers. The festival is characterized by large-scale installations and pavilions in urban areas, as well as by traditional Bengali drumming and veneration of the Goddess. During the event, the divides of class, religion and ethnicities collapse as crowds of spectators walk around to admire the installations,” the UNESCO said. Defining Intangible Cultural Heritage, the UNESCO has said: “The term ‘cultural heritage’ has changed content considerably in recent decades, partially owing to the instruments developed by UNESCO. Cultural heritage does not end at monuments and collections of objects. It also includes traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as performing arts, oral traditions, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe.” Founded by the East India Company in 1690, Kolkata was the capital of British India from 1772 to 1911, when the capital was shifted to Delhi. The UNESCO’s announcement was welcomed by Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) as chief minister Mamata Banerjee is widely recognized as the biggest patron of the festival. Banerjee has drawn criticism from opposition parties for granting government funds for community puja organising clubs and holding a carnival at Kolkata’s Red Road before immersion of the idols. The carnival drew a huge number of foreign tourists in recent years. It has, however, not been held for two years in its usual form because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The budget of many community puja organisers in Kolkata and the districts runs into several lakhs of rupees. The money is raised through subscription from members of the public and corporate sponsorship. According to a study the British Council of India conducted last year, the economic value of the artistic creations and cultural activities during Durga Puja in West Bengal is more than ₹32,300 crore. “Durga Puja occupies the heart of every Bengali. Mamata Banerjee has made the best efforts to promote the festival as a national event. She has given a grant of ₹50,000 to each of the clubs and also held the carnival. Her efforts and that of the puja organisers have succeeded,” said senior TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. Even as it rose to become Bengal’s biggest opposition party since 2019, when it won 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, joined the festivities in an apparent bid to connect with the masses. October 22, 2020 became a significant day in Bengal politics when Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually joined the commencement of the first Durga Puja the Bengal BJP unit organised at the Salt Lake campus of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Salt Lake, a township located on the eastern outskirts of Kolkata. No other Prime Minister had earlier inaugurated a Durga Puja in Bengal. As PM Modi invoked the goddess in Bengali and talked of female empowerment, laws to curb crime and Central schemes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (save and educate the girl child), his speech was streamed by the party to its supporters in all 294 assembly constituencies. EZCC, which is the under the Union ministry of culture, wore a festive look. Since the BJP could win only 77 assembly seats in the March-April polls against a target of 200, the enthusiasm was visibly less at EZCC this year. Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said the UNESCO’s recognition was a gift for millions of Bengalis. “This is recognition for a culture that has been inculcated and built over several centuries. The UNESCO has recognized the superlative emotion behind the celebrations,” said Majumdar. Many eminent citizens of Kolkata welcomed the news. “This is a joyous moment for all Bengalis. I, however, feel that the recognition should have come much earlier,” noted writer Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay told the media.

15-12-2021||India||Cabinet clears bill on electoral reforms, allowing voluntary Aadhaar-Voter ID linking||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday is learnt to have cleared a bill on electoral reforms, news agency PTI reported. The reforms will allow the Election Commission to seed the Aadhaar number with electoral rolls on a voluntary basis, the report said.According to the bill cleared by the Cabinet, the electoral law will be made “gender-neutral” for service voters. Another provision of the bill will allow new voters to enrol on four different dates every year. As of now, those turning 18 on or before January 1 of every year are only allowed to register as voters.An army man’s wife is entitled to be enrolled as a service voter, but a woman army officer’s husband is not, according to the existing provisions. The ECI had asked the law ministry to replace the term ‘wife’ with ‘spouse’ in the provision in the Representation of the People Act related to service voters.In August 2019, the Election Commission proposed amendments including linking of the ID card with Aadhaar number which will curb multiple enrollments of the same individual at different places. This has been a long-pending proposal of the Election Commission. In 2015, when the EC launched the National Electoral Law Purification and Authentication Programme to link the Aadhaar number with the Voter ID number, the programme was stalled after the Supreme Court ordered that the use of Aadhaar would be optional for availing of welfare schemes.Big push to design, make semiconductor chips in India gets Cabinet nodAccording to reports, the law ministry started working on the proposal in 2020 when Ravi Shankar Prasad was the minister. In August this year, minister Kiren Rijiju informed Parliament that the government was considering the EC's proposal. "After consulting various stakeholders, the Commission submitted its 244th and 255th Reports encompassing various aspects of electoral reforms which, inter alia, include disqualification from contesting election on framing of charges, regulation of election finance and opinion polls, ban on paid news etc," the minister said in a written reply.As PTI reported, another proposal in the reforms will allow the Election Commission to take over any premise for the conduct of elections overruling objections to taking over schools as polling booths.The bill on these reforms cleared on Wednesday is likely to be introduced in the ongoing Winter Session, the agency reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-bill-on-electoral-reforms-allowing-voluntary-aadhaar-voter-id-linking-101639580411371.html

15-12-2021||India||Stared death in the face last year, only survivor of Mi-17 crash passes away||Group Captain Varun Singh, the only man to have survived the December 8 Mi-17V5 chopper crash that killed 13 people including chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, passed away on Wednesday morning after putting up a brave, week-long fight against death. The 39-year-old died of burn injuries at the Air Force Command Hospital in Bengaluru, and is survived by his wife, Geetanjali Singh, and two children aged 11 and eight. The chances of his survival were grim from the beginning --- he suffered 95% burns --- but the entire country was hoping and praying for a miraculous recovery. He came from a military background. “IAF is deeply saddened to inform the passing away of braveheart Group Captain Varun Singh, who succumbed this morning to the injuries sustained in the helicopter accident. IAF offers sincere condolences and stands firmly with the bereaved family,” the Indian Air Force said in a statement. A top-notch fighter pilot, Varun was flying in the ill-fated Russian-origin helicopter as a passenger. He had encountered a rare, life-threatening emergency aboard his fighter jet in October 2020, but his lightning reflexes and flying skills averted a crash. He was commissioned in IAF as a fighter pilot in 2004. Tributes poured in for the group captain from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and several others. “Group Captain Varun Singh served the nation with pride, valour and utmost professionalism. I am extremely anguished by his passing away. His rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti,” the PM said. The defence minister, who was in touch with Varun’s family, said the untimely demise had pained him beyond words. “He was a true fighter who fought till his last breath. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and friends. We stand firmly with the family, in this hour of grief,” he added. Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to deliver a talk when the Mi-17V5 crashed near Coonoor. It took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48 am, and was scheduled to land in Wellington at 12.15 pm. But the air traffic control at Sulur lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08 pm when it was just seven minutes from its destination. Varun was directing staff (air) at DSSC and the CDS’s liaison officer for the visit. He was a test pilot and had flown several fighter aircraft in the IAF’s combat fleet. Just four months ago, on August 15, Varun was awarded Shaurya Chakra, India’s third-highest peacetime gallantry medal, for exceptional courage and remarkable presence of mind in handling a rare mid-air emergency involving the locally-built Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA). The standard operating procedure required him to eject and abandon the aircraft. “However, I took a few calculated risks and managed to land without any damage to either the aircraft or civilians,” he later said. The award was a deserved recognition of his heroism in the cockpit of what then seemed to be a doomed fighter aircraft. If it were not for Varun’s brave efforts and his decision not to bail out, the aircraft would have become the first LCA to crash. On October 12, 2020, Varun, then a wing commander, was on an LCA test sortie when sudden loss of cockpit pressurisation at high altitude triggered some nerve-racking moments. It was a life-or-death situation but Varun prevailed and went on to land the plane. “There was rapid loss of altitude, with the aircraft pitching up and down viciously. Despite being in extreme physical and mental stress in a life-threatening situation, he maintained exemplary composure and regained control of the aircraft, thereby exhibiting exceptional flying skills,” the Shaurya Chakra citation said. “He displayed extraordinary courage and skill to safely land the fighter aircraft. The pilot went beyond the call of duty and landed the aircraft taking calculated risks. This allowed an accurate analysis of the fault on the indigenously designed fighter and further institution of preventive measures against recurrence,” the citation added. A month after he was awarded Shaurya Chakra, Varun wrote a warm letter to his school principal with a request that his message be shared with the students of Army Public School in Chandimandir. The message was deep. “It is ok to be mediocre…Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best... Never lose hope, never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be,” he wrote. “If I am able to inspire even one child to believe in himself/herself, I would have achieved my objective of writing this letter.” Varun inspired millions of Indians in life and death.
15-12-2021||India||Delhi sees Indian Ocean as region of peace, works to keep seas, airways open||NEW DELHI: India sees the Indian Ocean and the Indo-Pacific as a region of peace and prosperity and will work to keep the seas, space and airways free and open and secure from terrorism and piracy, minister of state for external affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh said on Wednesday. The post-pandemic world places a greater premium on trust, technology, transparency, resilience and reliability, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) has a critical role to play in this regard, Singh said in his keynote address at the Indian Ocean Dialogue.The dialogue is IORA’s track 1.5 forum for discussions among stakeholders such as experts, government policy-makers, think tanks and civil society groups on strategic issues of interest and concerns facing the region. The theme for this year’s event, which was hosted by India, was “Post-pandemic Indian Ocean: Leveraging digital technologies for health, education, development and trade in IORA member states”. Singh said India’s “Security and Growth for All in the Region” or SAGAR doctrine envisions the Indian Ocean and greater Indo-Pacific as a region of peace and prosperity, based on trust and transparency, respect for international maritime rules, equal access as a right under international law, sensitivity to each other’s interests, peaceful resolution of disputes and enhanced maritime cooperation. “India will always work towards keeping the seas, space and airways free and open; nations secure from terrorism and piracy; ensuring access to and responsible use of global commons, a global cyber-space free from disruption and fair, transparent and balanced trading systems; and enhancing connectivity for inclusive and sustainable national, regional and global economic growth,” he said. Singh noted the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a new urgency to re-imagine international cooperation and accelerated socio-economic changes that the Indian Ocean Region had been witnessing. It has also disrupted supply chains, impacted manufacturing and affected trade, leading to a rethink of the approach to economic policies, he added. India, he said, is trying to foster meaningful multi-stakeholder partnerships, sharing of advanced and frugal technologies, collaboration in vaccine and pharmaceutical production and transparency in health information. “We recognise that a different world awaits us. It is one that puts a greater premium on trust, technology and transparency as well as resilience and reliability,” he said. “IORA...has a critical role to play in this regard. On its part, India remains committed to share her experience and resources in the spirit of solidarity.” Singh also said countries need to speedily normalise travel through recognition of vaccine certificates so that livelihoods are restored. India has worked out solutions in this field with some 100 nations and wants to expand this in the Indian Ocean Region. The Indian Ocean Rim region is crucial for global commerce, energy and geopolitical stability. Half of the world’s container ships and two-thirds of global oil shipments pass through the region, which is home to more than 2.7 billion people. The Indian Ocean Dialogue focused on how IORA states used digital technologies and platforms to overcome Covid-19 disruptions in health, education, development and trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sees-indian-ocean-as-region-of-peace-works-to-keep-seas-airways-open-101639575923483.html
15-12-2021||India||Kerala high court rejects plea questioning re-appointment of Kannur VC||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday rejected the plea questioning the re-appointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Dr Gopinath Raveendran much to the satisfaction of the state government. His re-appointment was one of the reasons for a recent tiff between the Kerala government and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and the latter sent a strongly-worded letter to the CM saying he was forced make certain appointments including that of Kannur VC. Raveendran was re-appointed as the VC on November 23, on the day his first term ended. The plea challenging the re-appointment was moved by university senate member Dr Ramachandran Keezoth and two others. They pleaded that the re-appointment was against the norms of the University Grants Commission and he had also crossed the permissible age of 60 years. They also contended that it was done in lieu of some appointments made by the VC flouting all norms. But Justice Amit Rawal dismissed the plea later observing that all records produced before the court show that norms were in place. Though the petition was filed last month the court refused to entertain the petitioner’s bid to file a fresh affidavit in view of the raging controversy between the Kerala Government and Governor. Petitioners said they will move the division bench against the single judge verdict. State higher education minister R Bindu welcomed the high court verdict. Her two letters to the Governor were leaked recently in which she asked the Governor to re-appoint Raveendran and do away with the search committee for the new VC. The Opposition has been demanding her resignation saying she pressurised the Governor to re-appoint Raveendran. The Governor had sent a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on December 8 in which he said he was really pained over the “dipping standard” of the higher education sector and blamed “brazen political interference” as the reason for this. He also asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if political interference continued. The chief minister on Sunday asked the Governor not to take any action in a hurry but the latter refused to budge. According to political observers, the real trigger (between the Governor and government) was the reappointment of Raveendran. He was reappointed for a period of four years after the government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee to select the new VC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-rejects-plea-questioning-re-appointment-of-kannur-vc-101639575449074.html
15-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 16, 1950 - Nation mourns Patel’s death||The end came six hours after he had a heart attack which made him unconscious. Oxygen was administered to relieve the difficulty in breathing. Sardar Patel momentarily regained consciousness at about 8 a.m., but thereafter life slowly ebbed away till he breathed his last 90 minutes later. The mortal remains of the great leader were cremated at the Sonapur Burning Ghat (Chowpatty) at 7-40 p.m. near the spot where his brother, Vithalbhai Patel, was cremated 17 years ago. After the funeral pyre was lighted by Sardar Patel’s son, Mr. Dahyabhai Patel, Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, Minister without Portfolio, Government of India, and the President, Dr Rajendra Prasad, made speeches paying tributes to the departed leader. During the ten hours that Sardar Patel’s body remained with them, Bombay’s multitudes demonstrated the high esteem and great veneration in which the city in particular-his second home-and the country in general held Mahatma Gandhi’s right hand man. As the common people mournfully filed past in an endless stream the Sardar’s body as it lay in state, planes were arriving every few minutes from different parts of the country carrying a cross-section of the country’s leadership and condolence messages from far and near poured in. Then the last journey started at 5-20 p.m. along a four-mile route, with Maniben and Dahyabhai sitting on either side of the cortege and with the Sardar’s nearest colleagues immediately following in a jeep. Men of the Defence Services, so dear to him, brought up the rear of the procession. All along the route men and women, cramming the footpaths, balconies and windows, chanted Gandhiji’s favourite prayer hymn “Raghupati-Raghava-Rajaram.” Flowers were showered on the cortege as it moved slowly along the narrow Vithalbhai Patel Road. It was 7-20 p.m. when the procession reached the crematorium. The leaders took turns to carry on their shoulders their great comrade’s body on the last lap of the journey. Twenty minutes later, at a spot adjacent to where his brother Vithalbhai’s ashes were mixed with the good earth, a pyre of sandalwood was going up in flames as the strains of “ Raghupati Raghava-Rajaram “ sung in chorus by Congress Desh Sevikas filled the air. With that was becoming “air, earth and water,” what was Vallabhbhat Patel, the unflinching fighter, the great general, the sagacious administrator, the farsighted statesman and the architect of a united India. PEACEFUL END Sardar Patel was serene throughout the brave fight he put against death. His face looked majestic and peaceful notwithstanding the intense pain he underwent during the last few hours. The end came peacefully. Sardar Patel went to Bombay on Tuesday on medical advice, as it was considered that the milder weather of Bombay as against the severe cold of Delhi, would be beneficial to him. The change appeared to have done him considerable good and on Tuesday he was restful. He was also comfortable during the day on Wednesday, but from about 10 p.m. there was a setback and he was restless. This condition continued intermittently with restful periods on Wednesday night and Thursday. At 3-10 a.m. yesterday he had a heart attack, similar to the one he had in Delhi last year. Doctors were summoned. Dahyabhai Patel, Sardar Patel’s son, his daughter and constant companion. Maniben, his daughter-in-law and grandson and Mr V. Shankar, private secretary, were at his bedside since his condition became grave. Mr B. G. Kher, Mr Morarji Desai and S. K Patil were called to Birla House early yesterday Dr M. D. D. Gilder and Mr Nathubhai D. Patel were in constant attendance on him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-16-1950-nation-mourns-patel-s-death-101639574844338.html

The government has warned against laxity in following Covid-19 related protocols, urging people to not delay vaccination.Telangana director of health G Srinivasa Rao told reporters that two passengers – one a 24-year-old woman from Kenya and another 23-year-old man from Somalia, who landed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, tested positive for Covid-19 on their arrival on December 12.“Their samples were sent to the laboratory of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology for genome sequencing and their results were announced on Tuesday night. Both of them were found to be positive for the Omicron variant,” the health director said.The woman passenger, who was found to be staying at Tolichowki area, was immediately shifted to the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS). “We have also collected the swab samples of all her contacts, including family members and kept them in isolation,” he said.Similarly, the address of the 23-year-old man from Somalia was identified as Mehdipatnam and efforts were made to shift him to the TIMS soon, besides conducting tests for his contacts. “However, both the passengers have very mild symptoms and there is nothing to panic about. They are safe,” Rao said.The health director said a seven-year-old boy who also landed at the Hyderabad airport on an international flight along with his family on the same day and subsequently left for West Bengal, also tested positive for Omicron.“But the family did not enter the city. It took a connecting domestic flight to Kolkata immediately. Before leaving, the boy gave the throat swab samples for testing and it turned out to be positive for the Omicron variant. We informed the West Bengal government about the same,” he said.Sandip Sanyal, chief medical officer of health, Murshidabad, said the child and his parents landed in Kolkata on December 11 and travelled to Farakka in a car. The family lives at Beniagram in Murshidabad’s Farakka area but on Wednesday the boy and his parents were in Kaliachak in the adjoining Malda district where they had gone to visit some relatives, he said. “The boy is in stable condition,” he said. “Health workers are in touch with the family. The area where the family live has been declared a containment zone,” Sanyal added. A senior health department official said in Kolkata that the child will be sent to a hospital soon and his parents and relatives will be kept in isolation following standard protocol. India’s first Omicron cases were reported from Bengaluru on December 2. They were a 66-year-old and a 46-year-old man. Since then, seven other states and two UTs have reported Omicron cases. The Union health ministry has issued an advisory to states to vigorously screen and test all passengers coming via international flights and has extended all Covid-19 restrictions till December 31. The ministry has told states to do proper contact tracking of persons found to be testing positive for Omicron.The Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa, has spread to 63 countries with one death being reported in UK where the variant is spreading fast. According to the World Health Organisation, the Omicron will soon surpass Delta and will become the dominant variant across the globe. Authorities worldwide are racing to determine how contagious the variant is and how effective existing vaccines are against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-test-positive-for-omicron-in-telangana-and-bengal-india-tally-climbs-to-52-101639571841431.html

15-12-2021||India||Protests over SIT report on Lakhimpur Kheri violence jolt Lok Sabha||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi moved an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, seeking to discuss the special investigation team’s (SIT) report on the October 3 episode. Following continuous protests by Opposition parties, the Lower House was adjourned. Demanding a discussion on the episode in which eight people died at a farmers’ protest site near Tikunia in Uttar Pradesh, Opposition parties shouted slogans against the government, halting proceedings at the Lok Sabha. Gandhi told reporters outside the Parliament, “They are not allowing us to speak, that’s why the House is being disrupted. Their minister is involved in it (Lakhimpur Kheri incident)… So a discussion should be allowed, but they don’t want to discuss it.” Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni, is the prime accused in a vehicle-ramming incident in Lakhimpur Kheri that resulted in five deaths. The run-over sparked a deadly mob-lynching incident, eventually resulting in a total of eight fatalities that day. The SIT’s submissions sparked a political row on Tuesday with the Opposition demanding minister Mishra’s resignation. A court in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday added stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to a First Information Report (FIR) against 13 people accused of mowing down protesting farmers during the Lakhimpur Kheri episode. The decision of the chief judicial magistrate in Lakhimpur Kheri came a day after the SIT looking into the violence told the court that the incident was “well planned” and “deliberate”. Holding placards, Opposition lawmakers shouted slogans demanding a discussion on the matter. DMK MP TR Baalu requested Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to allow a discussion on the SIT report. But the request was not immediately accepted by the speaker, who asked the MPs to follow the procedure even as Opposition leaders kept shouting slogans during question hour. Some Opposition members entered the well of the House and shouted slogans. Congress lawmaker K Suresh, the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha, moved an adjournment motion demanding that Mishra should “step down immediately so that a fair investigation is carried out, justice is served, the culprits are brought to book, and the farmers are delivered justice”. Asking Opposition members to allow the House to function, Birla said, “I’ll let you raise the issue after the question hour… Today, there are important debates lined up on issues such as price rise. Do you not want to discuss it?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-over-sit-report-on-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-jolt-lok-sabha-101639569681727.html

Minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai made the statement in response to a question from Congress lawmaker Vivek Tankha. Tankha sought to know whether a timeline was chalked out to grant statehood to the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.“Statehood to Jammu and Kashmir would be granted at an appropriate time,” Rai said in a written statement in the Lok Sabha.Tankha also asked whether a timeline was planned to hold elections in the two Union Territories. In response, Rai said the decision to schedule polls there is the prerogative of the Election Commission of India.In October, while speaking in Srinagar after a meeting to review the security situation in the Kashmir valley, Union home minister Amit Shah had said that Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood would be restored soon after the delimitation process and subsequent elections.Earlier, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah said the government broke its promise that there would be no extension to the Jammu and Kashmir Delimitation Commission beyond March 6. He also urged the government to first grant statehood and then conduct polls there.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad last month compared the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood with demoting a chief minister to the post of a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA).In June, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had said the Centre should accept the demand for restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir in line with the Constitution and democracy. Congress leader P. Chidambaram had tweeted, “The Congress Party’s position, reiterated yesterday, that full statehood must be restored to J&K should clear any doubt or ambiguity. What was made under the Constitution cannot be unmade by an Act of Parliament misinterpreting and misusing the provisions of the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/statehood-to-jammu-and-kashmir-would-be-granted-at-an-appropriate-time-centre-101639561881257.html

Aryan had approached the court seeking modification in the bail condition as the drugs-on-cruise case in connection with which he was arrested is not being investigated by NCB Mumbai. The high court on Wednesday allowed the waiver but specified that Aryan will have to be present before the SIT Delhi as and when directed, provided the notice is given prior 72 hours. Justice Nitin Sambre, who allowed the waiver, said Aryan can travel outside Mumbai as long as he submits his itinerary to the investigation officer of the case beforehand."We are seeking modification of bail condition 'J' regarding attendance on Friday. Nothing is happening. Whenever they want he can be summoned. The Bombay branch is also not in the matter after SIT," senior advocate Amit Desai submitted on Wednesday. The NCB too agreed to a partial modification of the bail condition as NCB Mumbai is not probing the case. Special prosecutor Shreeram Shirsat who appeared for NCB said Aryan should be present when called by the SIT.Aryan Khan was granted bail by the high court on October 28 under 14 conditions. One of these conditions was Aryan should appear before the NCB's south Mumbai office every Friday to mark his presence. On Wednesday, as the high court heard the waiver plea, Aryan's lawyer Desai further argued that every time Aryan Khan appears before the NCB's office in Mumbai, there is a huge crowd and he has to be accompanied by police personnel, which causes unnecessary hassle.

15-12-2021||India||India's clean energy gets more funding than coal for the third successive year||Indian lenders channeled more funds to clean energy projects compared to coal-based ones for a third straight year in 2020 with more expected to flow into the renewables sector in the coming years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled ambitious goals last month for cutting emissions.Clean energy projects got 74% of the total funds from financial institutions last year, or 243.8 billion rupees ($3 billion), according to a report by New Delhi-based research organizations Climate Trends and Centre for Financial Accountability. That’s a 6% rise from 2019 approvals for clean energy projects of about 229.71 billion rupees in 2019. Just 85.2 billion rupees, or 26% of the 2020 funds from Indian lenders went to coal-fired plants, data from the report showed. This represents an 86% slump in approvals for coal plants since 2017 and is in line with declining availability of funds globally for fossil-fuel projects.  This trend is expected to continue after Modi announced India’s plan for net zero emissions by 2070 at COP26. Modi also raised India’s 2030 target for low-emission energy capacity to 500 gigawatt from 450 GW and to wants the country to generate half its electricity using renewable energy. Renewable energy forms 40% of India’s current installed capacity of 392 GW while coal remains the mainstay at 52%, according to government data.The report, which analyzed 42 project finance loans worth 329.97 billion rupees that closed last year, showed that solar energy got most of the financing and commercial banks didn’t lend to coal projects. Only the state-run Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation disbursed funds to fossil fuel-based projects.Despite lenders favoring clean energy, lending for coal in 2020 grew by 40% to 85.2 billion rupees after two straight years of declines as the state-owned banks emerged as the lenders of last resort. Also the number of coal projects getting financing have fallen although India has brought online significant coal capacity with about 34 GW getting built and another 21 GW in the pipeline. “Worryingly, the stranded risk of these assets is significant,” Climate Trends and CFA said in the report. “As the growth in India’s energy demand slows, and the number of renewable energy installations rises, the utilization rate of coal plants will continue to decline. As such, their economics will deteriorate further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-clean-energy-gets-more-funding-than-coal-for-the-third-successive-year-101639556924753.html

Also, senior House officials pointed out that such suspensions have never been revoked before the completion of the suspension period without the suspended MPs or their party leaders regretting the conduct that led to punitive action, an official said.Wednesday’s meeting saw a united Opposition, including leaders from the Congress, the NCP, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Shiv Sena, approaching Naidu to resolve the issue.On Tuesday evening, Congress president Sonia Gandhi held a meeting with four other Opposition leaders, where it was decided that Pawar, leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, and other top leaders will approach Naidu to seek revocation of the suspension and defuse the crisis.“During discussions on the suspension issue, the Opposition leaders suggested to Naidu to convene a meeting of leaders of various parties to consider resolving the stalemate,” an official said. “The chairman observed that such a meeting will be called when it is appropriate. In saying so, Naidu implied that such a meeting would serve no purpose when either the suspended MPs or leaders of their respective parties are not willing to reflect on their conduct for which they were suspended and regret the same in an appropriate manner.”While Congress leaders Anand Sharma and P Chidambaram served a notice for the termination of the suspension of the 12 MPs, Naidu argued that the notice was not in order. “It was not accompanied by the text of the motion to be moved in the House. Naidu also said that even if any notice served was in order, he would need time to examine the same before deciding on its admission, and he can’t be forced either inside or outside the House for a decision on the same,” the official said.“Rule 223(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the House requires that every notice in writing shall be addressed to the secretary general and shall be left at the council notice office so as to enable further consideration. On the contrary, the notice of Sharma and Chidambaram, scribbled on a piece of paper, was given to chairman Shri Naidu in the House when zero hour was in progress, and they demanded immediate action on it,” said another official.

Son of an army officer, Singh was awarded Shaurya Chakra earlier this year for displaying outstanding courage and presence of mind while handling a rare mid-air emergency involving a light combat aircraft (LCA) that he was flying last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about Singh’s demise. “Group Captain Varun Singh served the nation with pride, valour and utmost professionalism. I am extremely anguished by his passing away. His rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti,” the PM wrote.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said he was pained beyond words to learn of the officer’s demise. “He was a true fighter who fought till his last breath. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and friends. We stand firmly with the family, in this hour of grief,” the minister tweeted. Congress leader Rahul extended his condolences to Singh’s family and friends. “This is a sad moment for the country. We all are with you in this grief,” he tweeted.President Ram Nath Kovind conferred Shaurya Chakra, India’s third-highest peacetime gallantry medal, on Varun Singh on August 15, 2021. He was a wing commander at that time. On October 12, 2020, Singh was flying a test sortie on an LCA when an emergency developed due to the failure of cockpit pressurisation at high altitude. It was an unprecedented failure. “There was rapid loss of altitude, with the aircraft pitching up and down viciously. Despite being in extreme physical and mental stress in an extreme life-threatening situation, he maintained exemplary composure and regained control of the aircraft, thereby exhibiting exceptional flying skills,” Singh’s citation said. “He displayed extraordinary courage and skill to safely land the fighter aircraft. The pilot went beyond the call of duty and landed the aircraft taking calculated risks. This allowed an accurate analysis of the fault on the indigenously designed fighter and further institution of preventive measures against recurrence,” it added. After being awarded Shaurya Chakra, Singh wrote an emotional letter to the principal of his alma mater, Army Public School in Chandimandir, thanking the school and his teachers for their mentorship in his formative years. “I credit this prestigious award to all those I have been associated with over the years in school, the National Defence Academy, and thereafter the Indian Air Force, as I firmly believe that my actions that day were a result of the grooming and mentoring by my teachers, instructors and peers over the years.” Singh wrote. He concluded his letter by writing an inspiring message for the schoolchildren. “It is okay to be mediocre… Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best... Never lose hope, never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be,” Singh wrote.

15-12-2021||India||Corruption or diarchy? Bihar’s varsities search for answers||At the foundation function of Patna University on October 1, additional chief secretary of the department of education, Sanjay Kumar alleged there was a distortion in the higher education system in the state which created a distance between the government and the varsities, which he claimed were runningunder a “diarchy” system. “We are try to improve higher education. However, the diarchy system in higher education gives administrative control to the chancellor’s office although all the finance is taken care of by the state government. This also needs to be discussed and debated. I think this diarchy has created a bit of distortion in the higher education system. You should also discuss and debate it. Why is there a distance between the government and the varsities...,” he had said in the presence of state education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, revealing how the government views challenges in the higher education ecosystem in the state.Governor as the chancellor of state universities has been an old practice, just as the President of India happens to be the Visitor of Central universities. Corruption issues In November this year, the special vigilance unit (SVU) raided Rajendra Prasad, a serving Magadh University VC, and recovered alleged ill-gotten wealth, resulting in tensions between the government and the Governor’s house. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary did not attend the function at Raj Bhawan to award top performers in the universities.A day before the function, Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University vice chancellor Md Qudus wrote directly to chief minister Nitish Kumar, accusing Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) VC, SP Singh of financial misconduct . Singh at one of point held the charge of four universities and now holds charge of three.It is not the first time VCs have been accused of corruption, mostly related to purchase of books and answer-books or tenders and some of them were removed by the Raj Bhawan in the last one decade. At present, VC of Veer Kuer Singh University has been on compulsory leave for over six months, power of VC of Jai Prakash University has been seized for close to 10 months and VC of Magadh University has been granted medical leave following raids at his office and residence. Also Read: India needs independent regulatory body to oversee Big Tech firms: Sushil Modi“The university system is such that any decision has to pass through several levels of scrutiny, viz. syndicate, senate, technical committee for tenders, pay fixation committee etc. and there are designated officers, viz. registrar, finance officer, financial advisor, besides others. What needs to be examined is how and at which level corruption is allowed to happen and how such decisions are cleared. The past record shows that the matter is forgotten with the removal of one VC or officer,” said a former vice-chancellor of a state university, who was not willing to be named. Varsities struggle While corruption issues and political slugfest in state universities hog media limelight, the basic issues confronting students such as late sessions, unfilled vacancies of faculty and outdated curriculum, remain unaddressed. At present, except Patna University, academic sessions at all others are running late, some delayed by two years.Even salary payment continues to be erratic with retired teachers still awaiting arrear of the 7th Pay Commission. Teachers and staff in colleges under Patna-based Pataliputra University have not been paid for the last three months.“The government rightly wants proof of utilisation of funds released earlier. But for any lapse, the accountability should be fixed on the authorities concerned. The teachers and staff should not be made to suffer,” the teachers’ body of the College of Science, Art & Commerce (Patna) said in a letter to the VC. Though the new VC, RK Singh, was appointed on November 24, he is yet to take charge even after the lapse of over a fortnight. In other universities, the authorities have managed to give salary through internal sources in anticipation that the government will release the grant. The government puts the blame on the universities for delay, citing lack of utilisation or diversion of funds. Late sessions, poor ranking Under the new education policy (NEP), accreditation is a basic requirement for funding. Since 2013, there has been a rush by institutions to get accredited to be eligible for Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyan or RUSA funding. Despite the 2022 deadline to get accredited, there is not much enthusiasm among institutions who fear poor grading due to severe shortage of teachers, poor student feedback, inadequate infrastructure and lack of research. The total number of NAAC-accredited colleges in the state is less than 100, including just six in the A grade. Bihar has 250 constituent colleges and an even higher number of affiliated or private colleges. Only Patna University is accredited B+. Nalanda Open University, which runs distance education courses only, has time till 2023 to acquire ‘A’ grade to be able to continue admitting students. Low GER, huge vacancies Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s focus is on increasing the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education, which remains very low in Bihar at around 15%, while it was 27.4 at the national level in 2017-18, according to the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE). Tamil Nadu recorded 49% GER.Under the new education policy, the target is to take GER to 50% nationally by 2035. To achieve the target, the government aims to increase around 20,000 seats this year and open post-graduate teaching at the district level to boost GER, despite 50% of posts in colleges and universities lying vacant. To make up for the shortage of teachers, the government has decided to appoint ad-hoc teachers, which has led to demand for absorption or weightage in appointments and the matter has landed in the high court. The government decision to provide free post graduate education to girls has created a new set of practical problems for institutions as except Patna University no other educational institution has been reimbursed the fee..

15-12-2021||India||WhatsApp empowers 500 villages in India with access to digital payments||Instant messaging platform WhatsApp announced on Wednesday the ‘Digital Payments Utsav’, its pilot program of empowering 500 villages across Karnataka and Maharashtra with access to digital payments through ‘payments on WhatsApp’. The announcement – in line with its parent company Meta's vision to accelerate financial inclusion – was made at Fuel For India 2021, an annual event that showcases the positive impact and socio-economic transformation delivered by the organisation's family of apps.Announcing WhatsApp’s game-changing intervention for ‘new-to-digital’ users, WhatsApp India head Abhijit Bose said, “We are committed to accelerating financial inclusion in the country. We have started this pilot programme in 500 villages across Karnataka and Maharashtra as part of our mission to take on board the next 500 million into the digital payments ecosystem.”He said that WhatsApp’s “ease of use and reliability” can promote the adoption of UPI with users across the society, “including those at the bottom of the pyramid.”“We will continue to contribute meaningfully in this journey of educating users at the grassroots, so they can trust digital payments, as they gradually make the transition from a ‘cash-only’ way of financial life,” said Bose.The ‘Digital Payments Utsav’ was launched on October 15 earlier this year at the Kyathanahalli village in Karnataka's Mandya district, where on-ground facilitators familiarised villagers with the various aspects of digital payments – including signing up for UPI, setting up an account, and the best practices for safely using digital payments.WhatsApp said that initial results from the pilot programme have been encouraging. Villagers have begun adopting ‘payments on WhatsApp’ as a new model for transactions, it said.“The village-grocery store or the beauty-parlor owner and scores of other people and small and medium businesses are now accepting and receiving payments digitally using ‘payments on WhatsApp’” the company said in a statement.It also provided a number of testimonials from villagers, who participated in the pilot and shared their experience at the Meta Fuel for India event.Chidananda KJ, a gram panchayat member of the Kyathanahalli village, said, “Withdrawing money from banks in villages used to be tedious and time-consuming, and ATMs usually do not have cash. Things have become much easier because of payments on WhatsApp.”“I’ve been running my parlour for the past ten years,” said Shruthi K, the owner of a beauty salon. “Old customers prefer to pay by cash. I don’t have my own UPI-ID. So when new customers want to pay digitally, I give them my son’s WhatsApp QR code.”WhatsApp has also recently placed the iconic ₹ symbol in its chat, thus making it recognisable and easy for people across segments to use the digital payments feature. Additionally, the messaging platform has also equipped its main camera to scan QR codes, adding another layer of convenience for users to make payments on WhatsApp, thus enabling in the process access to 20 million QR code-accepting stores in the country.As part of WhatsApp’s India roadmap for payments, the platform plans to make significant investments behind ‘Payments on WhatsApp’ over the next six months in order to accelerate its growth across India. Notably, for the payments feature, WhatsApp has partnered up with NPCI and RBI in achieving the shared objective of scaling the adoption of UPI and enabling financial inclusion for those most in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-empowers-500-villages-in-india-with-access-to-digital-payments-101639546782135.html

It seeks to replace the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to move the Bill in the second half of the Upper House proceedings.According to PRS Legislative Research, the Bill amends the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to correct a drafting error. The Act regulates certain operations (such as manufacture, transport, and consumption) related to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.In 2014, the Act was amended and the clause number of the definition for such illicit activities was changed. However, the section on penalty for financing these illicit activities was not amended and continued to refer to the earlier clause number, rendering the punishment inoperable.

15-12-2021||India||India needs independent regulatory body to oversee Big Tech firms: Sushil Modi||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Sushil Modi on Tuesday said India needs an independent regulatory body that will regulate the activities of Big Tech firms and ensure that they dedicate proper budgetary allocation towards “content moderation” as well as “revenue sharing” with traditional media organisations. He also accused social media platform Facebook of not flagging fake content and hate speech, thereby “undermining [the] safety” of users in India. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha during zero hour, Modi said Google and Facebook together dominate around 75% of the digital advertising market in India. “With ad revenues of ₹23,213 crore - ₹9,326 crore for Facebook and ₹13,887 crore for Google - they (Facebook and Google) earn a share higher than the combined revenues of the top 10 listed traditional media companies. At ₹8,396 crore through their advertisement reseller model, they send away the major portion. Facebook sends 90% of gross advertisement revenues to the global subsidiary, while Google India sends 87%,” he said. The lawmaker claimed that these Big Tech firms don’t pay traditional news platforms sufficiently despite making money by displaying their journalistic content. “To ensure this following an EU directive, countries such as France, Germany and Australia have already legislated neighbouring rights in which platforms such as Google are made to pay traditional media outlets for use of their content,” he said. Criticising the companies for not flagging hate speech and fake news, Modi said, “Facebook is undermining safety of the largest user base of 34 crore users in India. It does not flag problematic content such as fake [news], misinformation and hate speech. As per a report, Facebook found that over 40% top views in the state of West Bengal were ‘fake or unauthentic’.” Modi said the social media giant spends “a miniscule 13% of its budget” to flag content outside the US. The MP also said with its budget allocation for India, the platform lacks capacity to flag content for Hindi and Bangla languages.

Three cases were reported in Vechur, Aymanam and Kallara panchayats in the district. The samples were sent to National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease in Bhopal where bird flu was found to be present.Local authorities said that culling of ducks and other birds will begin on Wednesday to contain the spread of the virus. They added that 25,000 birds will be culled.This is a fresh confirmation of avian flu in the southern state where ducks and other domesticated birds have been dying over the past few weeks.The state government sounded an alert in Alapuzha district last week after the state animal husbandry department confirmed bird flu (H5N1) in some samples.A total of 12,000 ducks were culled in ward number 10 of Thakazhi gram panchayat on Friday. The decision was taken after Alapuzha district collector chaired an emergency meeting and decided to intensify the actions to prevent the bird flu from spreading to other areas.A total of 140 samples were sent for test and 26 samples tested positive for bird flu.Endowed with many backwaters and water bodies, farmers rear a duck in a big way in Alapuzha, which results in cases of bird flu regularly. Birds from other countries are reportedly the carriers of the virus. In Alapuzha and neighbouring Kottayam, duck rearing is an important business, and there is high demand for eggs and meat of the water bird, generally priced higher than poultry.The district administration also banned the use and sale of eggs, meat and manure of ducks, chickens, quails and domestic birds in the affected areas. This restriction will be applicable in Champakulam, Nedumudi, Muttar, Viyapuram, Karuvatta, Thrikkunnapuzha, Thakazhi, Purakkad, Ambalapuzha South, Ambalapuzha North, Edathva panchayats and Harippad Municipality area.The local police were instructed to support these activities and to conduct surveillance in the area. The department of animal welfare will ensure the service of rapid response teams and bury the birds.Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by an airborne virus in birds. It can spread to humans in rare conditions, and if it happens, it can trigger a person to person transmission, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-bird-flu-cases-reported-in-kerala-s-kottayam-culling-to-begin-today-101639538472387.html

15-12-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear pleas pertaining to Mullaperiyar dam’s safety today||The Supreme Court is set to hear on Wednesday a string of petitions which have raised safety concerns regarding the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam, a broiling operational dispute between the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar had last Friday adjourned the hearing to December 15 after senior advocate Shekhar Naphade informed the top court that the Tamil Nadu government will be requiring more time to file its reply to the fresh objections raised by Kerala.The Kerala government had earlier moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to Tamil Nadu to not release a huge quantity of water in the wee hours from the spillway shutters of the century-old dam, saying it causes heavy damage to people living downstream.Also Read | Tamil Nadu opens shutters of Mullaperiyar dam angering Kerala; several areas inundatedIn this regard, Kerala also seeks the formation of a ‘joint technical on-site committee for spillway release’, comprising of two members each from both states. This panel shall decide on the quantity and time of surplus discharge through spillway shutters to ensure disaster management authorities receive a due warning, proposes Kerala.Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, maintains that there are no safety concerns regarding the Mullaperiyar dam, which is “hydrologically, structurally and seismically safe”. It instead blames a “social media campaign” initiated in Kerala that seeks to question the dam's safety in a bid to ‘harass’ Tamil Nadu.The Central Water Commission (CWC), said Tamil Nadu, has already fully assessed the safety concerns regarding the 126-year-old dam and endorsed the 142-feet water level. The safety concerns have also been supported by extensive reports of the expert committee and the empowered committee, it said. The pleas raising issues about the dam, which was built in 1895 on the Periyar river in Idukki district of Kerala, are now set to come up before the Supreme Court bench for hearing today. Before posting the matter for December 15, the court had earlier allowed parties ample time to file a response to fresh applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-pleas-pertaining-to-mullaperiyar-dam-s-safety-today-101639528107641.html

What these numbers suggest is that the post-pandemic recovery has been uneven.What is the actual state of the economy? One way to answer this question is to look at the numbers from the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey (CPHS) to track the pandemic’s impact.CPHS is a high-frequency, large-scale, nationally representative survey of close to 200,000 households and, currently, the only dataset that allows us to track income changes on a monthly level for India. While data on indicators such as employment is available until August, income data from CPHS is available until June 2021. This means that currently the CPHS allows us to track the income impact of both the waves of the pandemic and the recovery after the first one, but not the recovery after the second wave.This two-part series will track this impact and recovery. The first part will track the pandemic’s impact on income of rich and poor households from rural and urban areas.Second wave’s shock came before people recovered from the first wave’s impactThe intensity and spread of the pandemic itself varied for different regions at different points in time. Consequently, we study the impact and recovery in terms of the imposition of lockdowns. April 2020 was the first full month of the nationwide lockdown, and the time when economic parameters were the worst affected. The first lockdown was eased substantially starting June 2020, and the economy began to open up. There was a gap of roughly nine months between the end of the first wave and the coming of the second wave (June 2020 to February 2021). In the first wave, the average all-India monthly per capita household income fell by 44% between February 2020 and April 2020. There was a near-complete recovery in incomes by January 2021 – with per capita household incomes a mere 3% lower than the pre-pandemic level (February 2020). However, the impact of the second wave began being felt from February 2021, and incomes started falling again before a full recovery could be achieved. All-India per capita incomes fell by 19% over the second wave between January and May this year, with incomes in May continuing to remain 22% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Economic indicators such as income and employment were the worst affected in May 2021, beyond which recovery started. While the impact of the first wave was felt more acutely in urban areas, that of the second wave was more adverse in rural areas.The poor were affected disproportionately moreThe pandemic impacted incomes in a regressive manner. Poorer households were impacted more, suffering a sharper drop in their incomes as compared to richer ones. During the first wave of the pandemic, the top quartile (top 25%) of the all-India population suffered the least with average monthly incomes dropping by 33% between February and April 2020. The corresponding drop in incomes for the remaining three-quartiles of the population was 46% on average.The fall in incomes during the first wave was more pronounced in the urban sector, and spread monotonically over the distribution – the drop was the highest for the bottom quartile, followed by the second, followed by the third, and the least for the top quartile. Individuals belonging to households in the bottom quarter of the urban population saw an income drop of 57% between February and April 2020, while those in the top quartile suffered a drop of 40%.Recovery was sharper for the poorBefore the coming of the second wave in February 2021, income recovery was sharpest for individuals from households in the bottom quartile, and the least for those from the top quartile. To be sure, in absolute terms the latter’s incomes were more than three times higher that of the former. By January this year, incomes for the bottom two quartiles (bottom 50%) had recovered fully, i.e., gone back to pre-pandemic levels; while those for the top two quartiles continued to remain 5-6% below pre-pandemic levels. Urban incomes experienced a slower recovery.
15-12-2021||India||Farmers to vacate Ghazipur site today||Rakesh Tikait, the national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), and one of the key leaders of the farmers’ agitation against the three contentious farm laws, will lead the last batch of protesters at Ghazipur border on Wednesday morning, capping a more than a year-long protest on the eastern border of the Capital where a teary eyed Tikait rejuvenated the agitation after the violence during a tractor rally on Republic Day.“The other farmers have moved out, and the last batch will leave UP Gate on Wednesday morning. Rakesh Tikait will lead the last batch in a car, and the group will take the Hindon elevated road and then proceed on the Delhi Meerut Road towards Sisoli (Muzaffarnagar district). Midway, there will be group of farmers who will be waiting on roads to meet the last batch of farmers returning home,” said Gaurav Tikait, president of BKU’s youth wing, on Tuesday.Tikait, along with his hundreds of supporters, reached the UP Gate border on the Delhi Meerut Expressway on November 28 last year. He is expected to return from Punjab late Tuesday night, and perform a ‘havan’ on Wednesday morning before leaving for Sisoli.The protest was called off after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that his government would abandon the contentious laws, and Parliament repealed them on November 29.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) signed off on a final letter from the Centre on December 9, that contained key steps forward.After the agitation was called off on December 9, Tikait then said that he will be the last one to leave the protest site. As the farmers continued returning from borders of Delhi, Tikait has been attending several programmes in Punjab and Chandigarh.The BKU on Monday described the Wednesday’s morning event as “Fateh March”, and added that it will go through Modinagar, Khatauli and Mansoorpur to Sisoli.Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of BKU, said there were about 200 farmers at UP Gate who will leave with Tikait on Wednesday. “It is expected that the gathering will swell, as many people may come and meet the farmers. We have started dismantling the remaining tents at the UP Gate,” he said.The UP Gate was named by farmers as ’Kisan Kranti Gate’ in October, 2018 when hundreds of farmers clashed with the Delhi Police following their march from Haridwar in support of several demands such as a blanket loan waiver, revocation of National Green Tribunal (NGT) ban on 10-year-old diesel run tractors in NCR, reduction in electricity tariff, implementation of MS Swaminathan Commission recommendation on remunerative prices and payment of sugarcane arrears among others.Ever since the farmers have started moving out, teams of different agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India are inspecting the expressway stretch to ascertain any damage to the road infrastructure.“We have made elaborate police arrangements at various points on the Delhi Meerut road, and we will ensure that there is no inconvenience caused to commuters when farmers return home from UP Gate on Wednesday,” said Irja Raja, superintendent of police (rural).There was no word on when the carriageway on the expressway will open for traffic.

The attacker has been arrested.Witnesses said the doctor was stabbed when he tried to help the woman who appeared to be the attacker’s primary target.BK Tamang, deputy inspector general and spokesperson of Sikkim Police, said: “The attacker first stabbed Kala Chhetri, a safai karmachari, multiple times and then stabbed Sanjay Upreti, a doctor from the cardiology department.”Police suspect the attacker, identified as Thinley Bhutia, has a personal grudge against the woman, Tamang added.Chief minister PS Tamang expressed shock on the incident.“The murderous attack is highly condemnable. The attacker has been arrested. We will ensure that he gets stringent punishment,” he said.Eyewitnesses said it was lunchtime when the attacker appeared on the fourth-floor corridor and started shouting. “The man suddenly attacked the safai karmachari with a knife. She landed on the floor in a pool of blood. The man attacked the doctor when he tried to rescue the woman and ran away,” said a nurse who did not want to be identified.“I never saw this man inside the hospital in the past,” the nurse added.
15-12-2021||India||Tamil Nadu: Brand ‘Amma’ in a fix under DMK’s tenure||The flagship Amma Canteens have withstood several challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, since the death of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, after whom the food service was named. However, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) announcement to launch 500 ‘Kalaignar’ canteens, named after late leader M Karunanidhi, the Amma Canteens have been under serious threat.Many of products named after Jayalalithaa (her cadre call her Amma, which means mother in Tamil) such as Amma pharmacies, Amma clinics, Amma cement, Amma water are under the scanner after the DMK formed the government in May as Tamil Nadu’s history shows both the Dravidian parties have struck down each other’s schemes after coming to power. Though the DMK ensured that they do not want to meddle with the Amma Canteens, and even removed party cadre who attempted to vandalise these canteens soon after they came to power, the story inside is quite different, with women from self-help groups, who run the canteens, experiencing indirect pressure to quit. “We were 13 people working in this canteen in the morning and evening shift together, and five people have been shown the door now,” said a woman worker, who has been working in a Chennai canteen for 6 years and didn’t want to be identified. “They have cut down on the staff strength and our salaries. We used to earn a monthly salary of ₹9000 and in the past two months they have cut it down to ₹5,700. When we asked the canteen authorities about this, they said that it was due to sales being down.” A senior official of the Greater Chennai Corporation who did not wish to be identified admitted that they have had a man-power restoration. “We have not put anyone out of jobs. In some canteens, there are excess staff like 20 people and there isn’t work commensurate for that. We have only moved them to other canteens where more people are required because we are setting a benchmark for how many people are required in a canteen depending on its sales,” the official said. “The overall sales have not dropped. But in certain canteens where the work is less because sales are less, the number of working days are reduced and they are paid a wage per day. We have not cut their salaries.” The worker quoted above said that her working days have been reduced to 18 days from 30 days and they are paid ₹300 per day. The number of employees in each canteen is dynamic ranging between 12 and 25.Chennai presently runs 403 canteens. “None of the canteens have been closed. Daily about 1.75 lakh people visit the canteens. And our daily sales is approximately ₹5.75 lakhs,” the official said. According to the state government, around ₹3.5 lakh is being spent per month to run a kitchen in the Amma canteen. From June this year up to November 18, more than 20.15 million people have been patrons of the Amma canteens. Amma canteens provide one idly for ₹1, pongal for ₹5, variety rice (sambar rice, curry leaves rice and lemon rice) for ₹5 a plate and curd rice for ₹3; for dinner two 2 chapatis with dal are priced at ₹3. Women from self-help groups are employed in these canteens. The canteens also provide food for free during floods and Covid-19 lockdown. Chief minister M K Stalin announced earlier this month to offer free food until the end of the northeast monsoon season that flooded several parts of Tamil Nadu. Officials from Egypt, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra have visited Amma canteens in Chennai in the past to emulate the pro-poor scheme in their states. So, when the DMK announced 500 more Kalaignar canteens, opposition leader AIADMK’s O Panneerselvam was quick to react that this was an attempt to overshadow the Amma canteens. To be sure, the government has said that both will co-exist and that Kalaignar canteens will look to cover places where there are no Amma canteens. However, the AIADMK and its faction Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), led by expelled leader V K Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran with her supporters, have been accusing the DMK of trying to halt these schemes. The ruling party has refuted it all. The former chief minister and current leader of opposition Edappadi Palaniswami in November accused the DMK government of destroying and “destabilising Amma brand of schemes” and he added that there were reports of winding up of Amma pharmacies that has been helping the public to avail medicines at a discounted price. In response, the state’s cooperative societies department, which runs the pharmacy outlets, said that they have increased the number of Amma Pharmacy outlets from 126 to 131. The department said that they have not shut any pharmacy after assuming charge and that it’s a ‘wrong allegation’. The 131 Amma Pharmacies have sold medicines to the tune of ₹44.88 crores in the current fiscal up to October 31, said the officials. Besides this, the state also runs 174 cooperative medical stores where poor people can avail 20% discount. Just a few days ahead of this controversy, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin launched a new brand of cement named Valimai (strength), to be manufactured by the Tamil Nadu Cements Corporation (TANCEM) at a subsidised rate. Valimai is the second brand from TANCEM, which has been selling cement under the name Arasu. The previous AIADMK regime launched Amma cement. “Arasu cement was named as Amma cement, and it will be there,” clarified industries minister Thangam Thennarasu at that time.

15-12-2021||India||Another BJD leader in Odisha faces opposition heat over a murder case||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik government found itself under renewed attacks from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the family of a security guard assigned with Odisha planning board vice chairman Sanjay Kumar Das Burma blamed the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) politician for his death, a charge promptly denied by the politician.The body of 22-year-old security guard, Chittaranjan Palai, was found floating in Nuanai river in Puri district on December 13 afternoon, two days after he had gone missing after attending a function organised by an aide of Sanjay Kumar Das Burma on December 11 night. Police said there were multiple injury marks on the body.Chittaranjan Palai’s mother and wife have alleged that a close associate of the BJD leader, identified by them as Jaga, killed the guard. His wife, Priyanka Nayak, has demanded that Das Burma and Jaga should be investigated by the police for the security guard’s death.“I want the police to interrogate Das Burma too. They both have conspired to kill my husband,” she alleged.BJD leader Das Burma refuted the allegations and stressed hat he too has backed a fair police probe. He said he has requested the Puri superintendent of police (SP) to conduct an impartial probe.Puri SP Kanwar Vishal Singh said family members of the deceased youth met him to seek a probe by CID. “We are examining the demand. The police investigation is on and we have formed an SIT. This is a sensitive case. Nothing can be divulged at this juncture,” said Singh.Sanjay Kumar Das Burma’s rival and BJP MLA from Brahmagiri in Puri district, Lalitendua Bidyadhar Mohapatrra has demanded that the chief minister immediately expel the BJD leader from the party.”Mohapatra also said Das Burma was being extended privileges due to his position in the ruling BJD government. “He should resign from the position of vice chairman of the State Planning Board as soon as possible in the interest of fair investigation,” said Mohapatra.The ruling BJD government has already been targeted by the BJP over the state’s junior home minister Dibya Shankar Mishra and law minister Pratap Jena.Opposition parties have demanded that chief minister Naveen Patnaik drop Dibya Shankar Mishra from his council of ministers over his alleged proximity with Gobind Sahu, the main accused in the murder of Kalahandi school teacher Mamita Meher on October 8.Patnaik has already rejected the demand from opposition leaders who have disrupted Odisha assembly proceedings, underlining that there was no evidence to tie the minister to any crime.Law minister Pratap Jena was also targeted by the BJP over the murder of two local BJP leaders in Salipur area of Cuttack district in January this year.On January 2 this year, Kulamani Baral, 75, in-charge of Salepur mandal of BJP and former chairman of Mahanga panchayat Samiti and Dibyasingh Baral, 80, were hacked to death near Jankoti village of Cuttack district when they were coming home on a motorcycle. Kulamani Baral’s son alleged the minister was involved in the murder but the police did not find any evidence to back up the charge. A Cuttack court recently ordered the police to re-investigate the case and submit call data records of 3 aides of the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-bjd-leader-in-odisha-faces-opposition-heat-over-a-murder-case-101639509481684.html
15-12-2021||India||Excess representation against democracy: SC on OBC quota in Maha polls||Excess representation is the antithesis of democratic values, the Supreme Court observed on Tuesday, as the central government maintained the 2011 caste census was “unusable” for official purposes because of grave “inaccuracies” and cannot form the basis for reservations in admissions, promotions or local body elections.“Excess representation is also antithesis to democratic value,” remarked a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar as the Maharashtra government pressed for reserving adequate seats in zila parishads and panchayat samitis for other backward classes (OBCs).On December 6, the bench stayed the Maharashtra government’s ordinance through which the state sought to introduce 27% reservation for OBCs in all zilla parishads and panchayat samitis without collecting data on OBCs in every municipal body seat.“Your political compulsions cannot be the basis to undo our judgment,” the bench had remarked.The hearing on Tuesday started with solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appears for the Centre, emphasising that the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, was not made public as it was found to be flawed, and was bound to mislead. “No reliance can be placed on the SECC 2011, not only for reservation but also for employment, education or any other purpose,” he said.Reading out from the affidavit filed by the Centre in September, Mehta said that either due to the mistakes by enumerators, inherent flaws in the manner of conducting census, and several such other factors, there is no dependable caste-based census data available that can be the basis of a constitutional or statutory exercise like reservations in admissions, promotions or local body polls.The central government “fully supports” reservation for OBC, but the exercise will have to be in line with the verdict of the Constitution bench that had laid down triple conditions, including setting up a dedicated commission to conduct a contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness with respect to local bodies within a state, he said.During the hearing, at one point, the bench observed that one can go ahead with the reservation for OBC only if they comply with the triple test as mentioned in the Constitution bench verdict of 2010, and also the judgement delivered later by a three-judge bench in March. The hearing will resume on Wednesday.
15-12-2021||India||Cop injured in Kashmir terror attack succumbs to injuries, toll rises to 3||The death toll in the terrorist attack on a police bus in Jammu and Kashmir’s Zewan area rose to three on Tuesday after another cop succumbed to injuries, officials said.As many as 14 cops were injured after the bus carrying at least 24 officials of the 9th battalion of Jammu and Kashmir Indian Reserve Police Battalion came under fire from terrorists in Zewan’s Pantha Chowk area at 6.50pm on Monday. The officials were deployed in Srinagar city and were returning to the headquarters when the attack took place.While two policemen died on Monday, the third succumbed to his injuries during treatment on Tuesday morning. The deceased was identified as constable Rameez Ahmad of Ganderbal. The other deceased were assistant sub inspector Ghulam Hassan and constable Shafeeq Ali. Citing “credible sources”, Kashmir inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar earlier said that the attack was carried out by Kashmir Tigers, an offshoot of the Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the wreath-laying ceremony here on Tuesday, IGP Kumar said, “Three terrorists, including two foreign ones, were responsible for the attack. One of the terrorist was injured in the retaliatory firing. The attackers fled towards Pampore and Tral, and we will soon neutralise them,” he said. “The terrorists attacked the police bus after the Road Opening Party (RoP), that secures roads through which convoys pass during a particular time of a day, withdrew from the area. The area was dark and the terrorists took advantage of that. We are taking all preventive measures. The RoP duties will be extended and bulletproof vehicles will be deployed,” he added. The IGP also said that it appeared as though the terrorists must have recce the area before the attack.Following the attack, security around forces’ installations have been stepped up, officials said. Monday’s attack came days after two policemen were killed in an attack in Kashmir’s Bandipora district on December 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-injured-in-kashmir-terror-attack-succumbs-to-injuries-toll-rises-to-3-101639509182068.html
15-12-2021||India||BJP falls short of majority in Karnataka MLC polls, Congress bags 11 seats||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka on Tuesday suffered a setback in the Legislative Council elections as it bagged just 11 seats out of the total 25 seats, falling short of the majority. The main opposition Congress also won 11 seats. The Janata Dal (Secular) suffered a minor rout, winning just two seats, while an Independent candidate won from Belgaum, defeating the BJP rival.With these results, the BJP’s strength in the 75-member Council has gone up from 32 to 37, while the majority mark is 38. The Congress’ tally dipped from 29 to 26, and the JD(S)’ numbers came down from 12 to 11.The BJP managed to secure victories in Chikmagalur, Gulbarga and Vijayapura seats by a narrow margin where the Congress and an Independent candidate had put up a spirited fight.The Congress winning candidates include Channaraja Basavaraja Hattiholi (Belagavi), S. Ravi (Bengaluru Rural), Bhimarao B. Patil (Bidar), Sunilgouda Patil (Bijapura-Bagalakote), Manjunatha Bhandary (Dakshina Kannada), Saleem Ahmed (Hubli-Dharwad-Gadag-Haveri), M.L. Anil Kumar (Kolar), M.G. Gooligowda (Mandya), Dr D. Thimmaiah (Mysore-Chamaranagara), Saranagouda Annadana Gouda Patil (Raichur) and R. Rajendra (Tumkur).Suraj Revanna from the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) supremo, on Tuesday, became the eighth member of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda family to enter electoral politics as he was all set to be elected to the upper house of the Karnataka legislature. Suraj is the elder son of Gowda’s son and former minister, HD Revanna.Suraj’s younger brother is a member of parliament from Hassan, his mother was a former Zilla Panchayat member who is likely to seek reelection in the yet-to-be-announced local body polls early next year.Gowda’s other son, HD Kumaraswamy, was the former chief minister of Karnataka and is the JD(S) legislator from Channapatana. Kumaraswamy’s wife is the legislator from Ramanagara, and their actor son, Nikhil, unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Mandya, a stronghold of the regional party.The MLC polls were conducted on December 10 for 25 seats in the 75-member upper house of the state legislature. The Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government was hoping for a big win to overcome the loss it faced in the October 30 bypolls in Hanagal. The defeat at the hands of the Congress dealt a big blow to Bommai, who is from the adjoining Shiggaon constituency in Haveri district that had fueled speculation of a growing divide within the saffron outfit.Bommai was trying to secure control of the upper house to cement his position as the head of the government, which was hotly contested by members of his party who nurse the feeling of neglect for being overlooked to replace BS Yediyurappa in July this year.The results would also help Congress determine if they have any electoral advantages against the BJP’s juggernaut in upcoming polls like Zilla and taluka panchayat, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) and the 2023 assembly elections.The JD (S) has found it hard to bounce back since it was reduced to just one out of the 28 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The regional outfit has allowed its local leaders to ally with any party they think would “benefit the JD(S)”--tacitly extending support to the BJP as both parties consider the Congress as the “common enemy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpfalls-short-of-majority-in-karnataka-mlc-polls-congress-bags-11-seats-101639509064053.html
15-12-2021||India||Leaders recall service, sacrifice as Akali Dal marks its 100 years||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) marked its centennial commemoration day with a grand rally in Punjab’s Moga district on Tuesday, highlighting the party’s storied history in affirming federalism and securing farmers’ rights.At the rally held months before the assembly elections in Punjab, the SAD called for the formation of a joint front of regional parties to espouse the cause of federalism nationally. Leaders also recalled the party’s rich history, and sacrifice, in fighting for “Panth, Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat”.Former five-time CM Parkash Singh Badal said the SAD was the first party to raise the voice of federalism, and always fought for the rights of the oppressed.“Now all regional parties are also calling for strengthening federal rights. We are committing to strengthen federal nature of the country”, he declared. “It is time to recall the contributions and sacrifices made by Akalis for the quom (community) and Punjab,” said the 94-year-old leader.His son and party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said the SAD – the oldest regional political party – was often called “shaheedan da jatha” (band of martyrs) for its commitment to the struggle for the rights of the poor and peasants.That tradition of struggle continued till date, he added.“From holding ‘chabian da morcha’, a campaign for the recovery of the keys of the Sri Harmandir Sahib treasury in the early 1920s to the national Emergency and the recent farmers’ agitation, Akalis have always fought from the front. There is no other political front in the country that could match sacrifices made by the Akalis,” he added.The grand stage prominently displayed pictures of former heads of the party. Other prominent leaders present were former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Gujral, and Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee chief Harjinder Singh Dhami, and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Satish Mishra. SAD has tied up with the BSP for the 2022 state polls.Selfless serviceThe Akali leadership revived the party’s commitment to work on the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, first drafted in 1973, to achieve greater autonomy to states.“Celebrating 100 years of ‘nirswarth seva (selfless service),’balidan (sacrifice) and sangharsh (struggle) to preserve the pride and honour of Panth, Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat. These are our core values and we are committed to following the same path for peace, progress and prosperity of Punjab,” the SAD said in a tweet.Making a poll pitch, Sukhbir Singh Badal promised ₹50,000 per acre compensation for crop damage, restoration of old pension scheme for government employees and free power for all religious places if the SAD-BSP alliance comes to power in Punjab next year. He said even after 55 years of its bifurcation, Punjab still hadn’t got back Punjabi-speaking areas from Haryana. “Akalis spearheaded the movement of Punjabi Suba to meet aspirations of Punjabis. Respective central governments crushed the federal spirit but the party is committed to fighting it back,” he added.Parkash Singh Badal exuded confidence that in the coming assembly elections, the SAD-BSP alliance will repeat their performance in the 1996 polls. “In 1996, BSP supremo Kanshi Ram and Akalis fought Lok Sabha elections together and won 11 out of 13 seats in Punjab. The alliance will perform again. But we will have to fight against Congress government of Punjab, BJP-led Centre and the AAP to protect interests of Punjabis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-recall-service-sacrifice-as-shiromani-akali-dal-marks-its-100-years-101639508897806.html
15-12-2021||India||Uneasiness shrouds Christian community in Karnataka after recent attacks||The recent incident of a man barging into a church with a machete in his hand and the burning of some Christian religious books by right-wing groups have intensified fears and sense of insecurity among Christians in Karnataka, members of the community said.The police have clarified that the man was drunk, and that the Bible was not burnt, but there is a clear nervousness among Christians in the city. Father Francis D’Souza, parish priest of St Joseph in Belagavi’s Bauxite Road, was leaving the premises at around 2 pm, to return to his house adjacent to the church, on Saturday when he saw a man approaching him with a machete. In a video of the incident that went viral on social media, the man is seen following and chasing the priest for some time before fleeing the spot. “The church has been here for the past 30 years and I have been here for the last five years but it is for the first time that an incident like this has taken place,” said Father D’Souza. “I am still scared and the situation here continues to remain tense,” he added. Police from APMC station, about 3 km away from the church, were informed about the incident following which the accused, later identified as Mohammed Nizam Phulwale, was nabbed . He was in an inebriated state and entered the church “without motive”, police said. “He doesn’t even remember what he did and there was no motive behind the attack,” a police official from APMC station said, seeking anonymity. However, speculation is abuzz that the accused was provoked by some anti-social elements . The incident prompted the church to step up security measures such as fixing all dysfunctional CCTVs in the premises. On the same day, members of right-ring groups set ablaze Christian religious books alleging religious conversion by the church in Srinivaspur town of Kolar district, about 65 km from Bengaluru. Police later clarified that the Bible, the holy book of the Christians, was not among the items that were set on fire by the right-wing members. If Christians are worried it’s because of a November incident when members of the Bajrang Dal barged into a prayer hall and stopping a service midway in Hassan district, and a September one in Udupi where right-wing allegedly attacked devotees while a prayer meeting was underway in a hall. A fact finding report by several civil society organisations earlier this month claimed that Karnataka was witnessing one of the highest incidents of attack against Christians. The report by United Christian Forum (UCF), Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), and United Against Hate also claimed that Karnataka ranks third among states with the most number of attacks on the community and their places of worship in India.The spate of attacks on Christians and churches also come at a time the Basavaraj Bommai-led government is determined to pass an anti-conversion bill during the winter session of the state legislature in Belagavi which commenced on Monday.On Sunday, chief minister Bommai hinted that the draft of the anti-conversion bill would be approved by the state cabinet and it may be introduced in the session. Claiming that religious conversion was not good for the society, Bommai said the downtrodden people should not succumb to it.The chief minister, however, clarified that people of all religious communities need not panic with respect to the anti-conversion law. “Hindus, Christians, Muslims and Sikhs are the faiths recognised by the Constitution and there is no problem for people to pray or follow their respective religions. However, there is no scope for misusing someone’s poverty to lure them to change their faith,” he said. Pastor Thomas Johnson said the proposed bill and attacks were part of the “ tactics” of the Bharatiya Janata Party. “First it was Hindu-Muslim and now it is Hindu-Christian. They are injecting poison. I have never seen such anti-Christian sentiments in the state,” the pastor said while referring to attacks on minority communities. Christians have called for a hunger strike in Belagavi on December 17 to highlight the issues faced by the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uneasiness-shrouds-christian-community-in-karnataka-after-recent-attacks-101639508943686.html
15-12-2021||India||Karnataka: 39 cases of crime against Christians in 2021, says report||In 11 months, Karnataka reported 39 incidents of hate crimes against the Christian community in Karnataka in 2021, said a report by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) on Tuesday. The report, titled ‘Criminalizing the Practice of Faith’, listed out the 39 incidents and went on to add that in some cases the police department and some politicians colluded with right-wing organisations in carrying out these attacks.“Given the frequency and intensity of these attacks, our report relies on the Christian community’s narratives of surviving majoritarian violence. The members of the Christian community especially in rural Karnataka continue to face threats of violence, discrimination, and survival during their everyday lives,” the report stated.According to PUCL, the report documented attacks on pastors, believers, and Churches in Karnataka between January and November 2021, the modus operandi of the right-wing groups behind these attacks and the patterns that emerge from these attacks.“There have been attacks in Karnataka that have been sponsored by the state. Not only has the state failed to book perpetrators, but also booked the victims in several cases. We demand that the government should follow the Tahseen Poonawalla judgement and make sure justice is done to them (the Christian community). We also want to ensure that the (Anti-conversion) bill is opposed strongly,” said a former head of Amnesty International India, who was one of the members who launched the report. According to the report, in most cases, Christians have been forced to shut down their places of worship and stopped from assembling for their Sunday prayers. “Effectively, these attacks on praying in a gathering that is enforced by Hindutva groups with the complicity of the State function as a bar on the freedom to practice religion itself. Far from the right to propagate religion, today the attacks in Karnataka are on the right to freely profess and practise religion,” read the report.“In many cases of mob violence, the police arrested pastors and believers. They even issued formal notices to churches to stop prayer meetings. This failure of the State further marginalizes a minority community in how they live their lives struggling to access education, shelter, food, livelihood, and basic dignity during Covid,” it added. The report listed several right-wing organizations, alleging their role in the attack and it went on to say that two MLAs of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, were involved in the attacks. “In two instances of hate crimes in Karwar (October 4) and Mandya (January 25), Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Sunil Kumar and 3-time BJP MLA Narayana Gowda (currently Minister of State for Youth Empowerment and Sports, Planning, Program monitoring, and Statistics) were also named as people who supported the police in targeting Christians,” the report said. While the two BJP legislators were not available for comments, BJP spokesperson Ganesh Karnik denied these allegations. “Leaders mentioned in the report, especially Sunil Kumar, are leaders are who are bringing the cadre together in Karnataka for BJP, and this is an attempt to tarnish their reputation. The party has not indulged in any violence, but it only wants to bring a bill that stops force conversions in the state. The report is not factual,” said Karnik. Apart from the attacks and the role of the right-wing organisations, the report pointed out a larger issue of social boycott and dissemination faced by the Christian community. “What is particularly alarming is the discrimination and social boycott that the Christians have faced from persons who are not a part of these Hindutva organizations. Such as their neighbours, landowners, employers, small businesses like grocery stores, even schools, in their localities,” the report read.Pointing out the alleged involvement of authorities in the attack, the report claimed that during their research, PUCL observed in the chain of events in every case, that the police colluded with these groups. “With the overt guidance of the local leaders of BJP, RSS, Bajrang Dal, Hindu Jagran Vedike, and Banjara Nigama, the police actively work to criminalize the lives of Christians and stop them from organizing prayer meetings. This complicit role of the police emboldens a culture of intolerance and bigotry. Through the complicity, the police have become an arm of social segregation strengthening of such Hindutva forces,” it added.The report cited a case study of an attack that took place on September 19 to highlight this issue. “I was organising weekly prayers for 8 months in the same prayer hall for 15 believers. One such Sunday, 200 people came to our prayer hall and started raising slogans against Christianity… Within five minutes of the mob’s verbal abuse and shouting, the police came. Perhaps they were nearby because they knew that this was happening,” the report quoted pastor Jim, who was attacked during the incident. “The police detained 4 of us at the station till 8 PM before giving any of us any information. They filed a complaint against me, a woman, her husband and their son under 295A, but refused to file our complaint against the Hindutva mob that was abusing us verbally. Our lawyer came to the police station at 5 PM but the police refused to file our complaint even after he spoke to them. They told us that the Sub-Inspector has instructed them to not file any complaint on behalf of us. We were in jail for 3 days,” pastor Jim added in this statement.Responding to the report Karnataka police chief DG and IGP Praveen Sood denied the allegations. “We have been impartial in taking action against anyone who is indulged in such activities, irrespective of religion and caste. As reported by the media itself, there has been a considerable number of FIRs registered and people have been arrested. We have taken action,” he said Sood. Responding to the query on whether 39 instances in 11 months is a matter of concern, the police chief said that 39 instances is a claim made by the PUCL and it has to be verified. He said that the police department will go by the number of FIRs registered and that the number of cases registered in this regard was not readily available. The report highlighted the small share of the Christian population in India to deflate the claim of forced mass conversion. It said that according to the 1971 Census, Christians comprised 2.60% of the population of India. “In 1981 they [Christians] were 2.44%, in 1991 2.33%, in 2001 2.18% and at present, they are 2.30%,” the report said.The document added that as per the 2011 Census, Christians accounted for 1.87% of the population in Karnataka. “Thus, the statistics do nothing to suggest that the Christian population is increasing,” the report said.The report pointed out that Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has publicly spoken about his plan to table an anti-conversion Bill in the Assembly. “Evidently, without an increased population, there is nothing to substantiate the claim of forced mass conversions. At the very outset, these numbers are proof that forced mass conversion is a myth, a bogey that is being used to criminalize the practice of faith by Christians.” Responding to the allegations against increasing attacks on the Christians in the state and the anti-conversion bill, Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra said the government is not targeting any particular community “We are bringing it within the framework of the law. It is there in Article 25 of the Constitution that there cannot be forced conversions but there was no penal clause if such conversions take place,” said Jnanendra. “We are bringing punishment, penalty provisions (for forced conversions). One who wants to convert should submit an application two months prior to the Deputy Commissioner. The person performing the conversion will also have to apply. Those who are converting will have to lose the religion of their origin and facilities or benefits attached with it,” he added.Meanwhile, KPCC president DK Shivakumar called the attacks and the anti-conversion bill a political tactic of the BJP. “It is a political game from BJP, and we will oppose it. More than anything, I’m worried about its impact. Karnataka is an investment corridor. The entire world is looking at Karnataka and Bangalore. If such attacks continue, investments in the state will reduce. The government is not taking all sections of the society into confidence,” said Shivakumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka39-cases-of-crime-against-christians-in-2021-says-report-101639508761995.html
15-12-2021||India||Expert bodies studying booster shots: Govt to HC||The Union government has informed the Delhi high court that currently there are no guidelines for administering booster doses to fully vaccinated people and the priority is to cover the entire eligible population with both the doses.In an affidavit, the government told a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh that the appropriateness and necessity of booster dose of covid-19 vaccine is yet to be decided.“It is humbly submitted that the current knowledge about duration of immunity offered by Covid-19 vaccines in India is limited and will clearly be known over a period of time only,” the Centre said in an affidavit filed on December 10.In recent days, initial evidence has emerged of the need for a booster dose of Covid vaccines to combat a new strain of the Omicron variant of the virus causing the disease, but India is yet to take a call on boosters. Till Tuesday evening, the country had completely vaccinated 55.5% of its adult population of 940 million and partly vaccinated another 31.5% . Expert bodies National Technical Immunization (NTAGI) and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), responsible for advising the Centre on its immunisation policy, are deliberating and considering scientific evidence related to boosters. The government’s response came on a bunch of pleas, including one by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking better facilities to tackle Covid-19.On the last date of the hearing, on November 25, the court asked the union government to give a categorical reply on the necessity of booster doses to be administered to fully vaccinated people, saying that there was an increasing trend of advocacy for booster shots in western countries.To be sure, until recently, there was no strong scientific evidence in favour of boosters.The court also asked the Centre as to how the western world is encouraging boosters when the government was not permitting those who voluntarily want to take advanced dose.The court said decision of giving a booster dose should not be based on economics. The matter was listed on Tuesday but could not be taken up due to the paucity of time.
15-12-2021||India||Multiple mid-air close shaves for Air Marshal probing CDS chopper crash||Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, the man heading the probe into the chopper crash that killed India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and 12 others last week, has defied death multiple times in his 39-year military career, including once during one of the gravest emergencies in Indian Air Force history involving a Russian-origin Mi-17 helicopter, officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The Mi-17 flying Singh was seconds away from a crash in India’s North-East five years ago. His previous mid-air close shaves in Siachen were equally unsettling and dramatic, the officials said.Rawat and the others died when the Mi-17V5 went down near Coonoor on December 8, an accident that sent shock waves not only through the military establishment but the entire country, and is a devastating setback for the ongoing defence reforms and has raised questions about succession in the armed forces.The Mi-17V5 is an advanced variant of the Mi-17.Singh, a decorated helicopter pilot, narrowly escaped death in March 2016 when he was among the 16 people on board the Mi-17 helicopter flying from Shillong to a forward base in Arunachal Pradesh, and several times before during tough and perilous missions in Siachen in the late 1980s.He was awarded the hallowed Vir Chakra, India’s third-highest wartime gallantry medal, for multiple acts of heroism on the world’s highest battlefield.The stunning details of the rare Mi-17 emergency involving Singh, then an air vice marshal, and several other senior military officials, have been documented in India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes authored by military affairs journalist Shiv Aroor and this correspondent.Singh, then an Air Vice Marshal, was the senior officer-in-charge of administration at the Shillong-based Eastern Air Command when the Mi-17 incident took place on March 12, 2016. Eastern Air Command chief Air Marshal Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar, a top-notch fighter pilot, and his wife, Devika, were on board too.The chopper was airborne for 25 minutes, and was flying above the paddy fields south of the Brahmaputra when the unimaginable happened -- it lost both engines.The next two minutes were terrifying.“For a fraction of second, it was hard to believe that both the engines of our aircraft had failed and we were auto-rotating. It was something that happens next to never in a twin-engine aircraft. Both the engines going off together is perhaps the rarest of rare emergencies,” the book cited above quotes the pilot, Squadron Leader Vikas Puri, as saying.Autorotation is a when the main rotor turns by virtue of the air moving up through it, rather than powered by an engine. The helicopter was descending at an alarming rate and barely 600 feet above ground and less than a frightening 20 seconds from impact.In the death-defying moments that followed, Puri was able to revive the engines and recover the Mi-17 barely 15 seconds from impact and near-certain death or crippling injuries to all on board, including Singh. Puri was later awarded the Vayu Sena Medal for gallantry for not only saving lives but also a precious war-waging asset.Breaking the 120-second radio silence forced by the emergency, Puri contacted Tezpur air traffic control and informed a dumbstruck officer at the other end that his Mi-17 had just recovered from a twin-engine failure, the book records. The officer asked if the Mi-17 needed assistance.“What possible assistance could we get up there?” Puri said later. The Mi-17 landed in Tezpur.A few months after the incident that almost killed him, Manavendra Singh and his son Siddharth, then a flight lieutenant and a chopper pilot like his father, flew a sortie together in a Mi-17V5 helicopter.Singh was awarded Vir Chakra for uncommon courage and excellent flying skills in Siachen in 1988 in the face of heavy Pakistani artillery and automatic fire.Between June and August 1988, his helicopter came under intense hostile fire at least eight times at three different forward helipads on the Siachen glacier, but the pilot executed his missions with outstanding courage and determination, Singh’s Vir Chakra citation said. Then a flight lieutenant posted at the IAF’s 114 Helicopter Unit, Singh carried out more than 1,000 sorties in the area.Manavendra Singh is the best man to probe the CDS chopper crash, said Air Marshal NJS Dhillon (retd), a former commander-in-chief of the Strategic Forces Command who has handled aircraft safety matters in a previous role. “Singh brings to the table the credibility of his professionalism and the weight of his office,” Dhillon added.
15-12-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Stringent sections added to FIR||A court in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday added stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to the First Information Report (FIR) against 13 people accused of mowing down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in October.The decision of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) in Lakhimpur Kheri came a day after the special investigation team (SIT) looking into the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, where eight people were killed, told the court that incident was “well planned” and “deliberate”.The addition of charges triggered a political row, with the Opposition looking to corner the BJP government over the involvement of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra in the case.“According to the prosecution, the ongoing investigation and evidences collected in the FIR so far had established that October 3 violence leading to death of five people and injuries to several others was not an act of negligence or carelessness but an act of premeditated planning, hence charges under sections 279 (rash driving), 338 (causing grievous injuries by negligence) and 304 A (causing death due to negligence) as in the FIR did not stand,” said senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP YadavThe prosecution urged the court to drop these sections and add sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing injuries by dangerous weapons), 34 (acts by several persons with common intentions) and sections 3/25/30 of the Arms Act, Yadav added.The matter was heard in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Chinta Ram. All 13 accused, including Ashish Mishra, were produced in court.Four farmers and a journalist died when an SUV owned by Ajay Mishra ran over farmers from behind in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. In the ensuing violence, three more people -- two of whom were Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and one was the driver of the car -- were killed. In court, defence counsels Awadhesh Singh and Chandra Mohan Singh opposed the imposition of stringent sections. Awadhesh Singh said they objected to the sections 149 (unlawful assembly) and 34 against the accused.However, Yadav said section 34 was a rule of evidence while 149 was a penal section, and as such both sections could be promulgated simultaneously.Ajay Mishra visited his son at the Lakhimpur district jail on Tuesday. “I just went to meet my son. Can’t discuss in open what we talked about,” he said.Legal experts said the addition of new sections will make it difficult for them to get bail. “Apart from the existing bail application, the accused will now have to seek bail on the additional charges that have been added. This will further delay the possibility of them getting bail,” said Lucknow-based senior advocate Abhimanyu Singh.Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav, said the farmers will never forget the incident: “The farmers will never forget the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. First, this government introduced three black farm laws, then insulted the agitating farmers. Over 700 farmers lost their lives in the agitation. And then looking at the elections in UP and Punjab, the government withdrew the black laws. So many farmers would have not lost their lives had this government listened to us and farmers. BJP people mowed down farmers by SUVs.”Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra demanded that Ajay Mishra should be sacked with immediate effect.“The Minister of State for Home should be sacked from the Union Cabinet and his role in the Lakhimpur farmer massacre should be investigated,” she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-stringent-sections-added-to-fir-101639508041517.html
15-12-2021||India||New locally developed military hardware for armed forces||In a move aimed at self-reliance in India’s defence manufacturing sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday handed over to the armed forces locally developed military hardware including a smart air-launched weapon, anti-drone systems, and an advanced radar countermeasure system, officials familiar with the development said.The weapons and systems were developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation.Singh also handed over transfer of technology (ToT) agreements covering six systems, including the coastal surveillance radar, to seven public and private sector companies to bolster their defence manufacturing capabilities at an event organised as part of the countrywide celebrations to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence.This comes at a time when a time when the government is encouraging self-reliance is the defence sector through a slew of policy decisions.The notable systems handed over to the armed forces include the smart anti-airfield weapon (SAAW), which can target enemy airfield assets such as radars, bunkers, taxiways and runways; and counter-drone systems to swiftly detect, intercept, and destroy small drones that pose a security threat.SAAW has a range of 100km.The anti-drone system will give the military both “soft kill” and “hard kill” options to tackle the new and fast-emerging aerial threat, the officials said. The first refers to jamming the hostile drone, while the second involves a laser-based kill system. The drone threat was highlighted by the June 27 attack targeting the Jammu air force station, the first-ever offensive use of drones to hit an Indian military facility.The steps taken by the government to boost indigenisation include increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) from 49% to 74%, notifying two lists of 209 weapons and systems that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware.Singh identified the development of a hypersonic cruise missile as a key focus area.India took the first steps last year towards developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence, with DRDO carrying out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time.Only the US, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-manoeuvring hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept. Mach 6 translates into a speed of 7,408kmph.India could develop hypersonic cruise missiles powered by air-breathing scramjet engines in about four years, the officials said. Such engines operate efficiently at hypersonic speeds and allow supersonic combustion.

I will tell you where the money will come from. Uttarakhand budget is around ₹ 55,000 crore. Isn’t corruption there in state? In any work, how much corruption is there. Some say there is 60%, 80 % corruption in the state. Let us say there is 20% corruption. So, 20% of 55,000 crore is around ₹ 11,000 crore, which goes into pockets of politicians and then to Swiss Banks,” he said.Kejriwal added that his announcement will have a financial implication of ₹ 3000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-vows-1k-month-for-women-in-uttarakhand-101639507803140.html
15-12-2021||India||Integration of tri-services to advance seamlessly: Rajnath Singh||Integration of the armed forces to enhance their effectiveness and reshape the conduct of future operations will progress seamlessly, and achieving this target will be a top priority for the government, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday, while paying tribute to India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and 12 others killed last week in a chopper crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu.Rawat was spearheading the theaterisation drive to best utilise the military’s resources for future wars and operations. The CDS’s shocking demise is likely to have implications for the military reforms, and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan, officials said. Singh’s comments indicate the current vacuum created by Rawat’s death will not hit India’s theaterisation plans.The process of “integration and modernisation of the tri-services” was initiated with the creation of the post of CDS and the department of military affairs, and it will be carried forward to achieve the goals as early as possible, the defence minister said.Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years, making him the longest serving four-star general in India. As CDS, he wore multiple hats. He was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, headed the department of military affairs, and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.In November, Rawat asked the three services to expedite their studies on the creation of theatre commands and submit comprehensive reports within six months. The deadline for submitting the reports was advanced from September 2022 to April 2022. The current theaterisation model to enhance tri-service synergy seeks to set up four integrated commands – two land-centric theatres, an air defence command, and a maritime theatre command.All eyes are now on who will be appointed as Rawat’s successor at a time when the theaterisation plan is at a critical juncture and needs a man with vision to carry it forward.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane became the senior-most military officer in the country after Rawat’s demise. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him.
15-12-2021||India||Freedom struggle history left out many seers: PM Modi in UP||The contribution of spiritual gurus in the freedom movement had not been recorded in history the way it should have been but the younger generation was being introduced to their role, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday in Varanasi.Modi was speaking at the 98th anniversary celebrations of Sadguru Sadafal Dev Vihangam Yog Sansthan in Varanasi. The occasion also marked the 100th anniversary of freedom fighter Sadguru Sadafal Deo Ji Maharaj’s imprisonment for allegedly inciting mutiny against British rule.“There were many saints who left their spiritual practices and participated in the freedom struggle. Their contribution was not recorded in history the way it should have been. When we are celebrating Amrit Mahotsav, it is our responsibility to bring this contribution to light. So today, the country is remembering the contribution of its saints and gurus and introducing it to the young generation,” said Modi, referring to the celebrations marking 75 years of independence.The PM, speaking a day after inaugurating the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, highlighted that Sant Sadafal Dev was one of the first people to go to jail in the non-cooperation movement. He also greeted the citizens on the occasion of Gita Jayanti.“During freedom movement, Sadguru gave a mantra of Swadeshi. Now, the nation has started the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Mission. Local trade, business and products are being strengthened. Local is being made global,” said the PM. “By giving strength to the local business and focusing on employment generation, local is being made global.”He emphasised that cities like Varanasi preserved the seeds of India’s identity, art and entrepreneurship even in the toughest of times. “Where there is a seed, the tree begins to expand from there. And that is why, when we talk about the development of Banaras, it also forms the road map for the development of the entire India,” said Modi. “Embracing the novelty while retaining the old, Banaras is giving a new direction to the country,” he added.The PM also urged people to take a resolution to educate their daughters and develop their skills.“Along with their families, the people who can afford, should also take the responsibility of skill development of one or two daughters from financially weaker section families,” he said.Appealing to people to save water, he said, “We have to keep our rivers, Gangaji and all water sources clean.” These can be resolutions that should be given momentum in the next two years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-struggle-history-left-out-many-seers-modi-in-up-101639507501354.html
15-12-2021||India||Verify caste certificates while hiring: Parliament panel||Ministries and public enterprises must end the practice of verifying caste certificates at the end of one’s career to enable smooth disbursal of pension benefits, a House panel has suggested.Presenting a report in this regard on Tuesday, Parliament’s committee on welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) said it has “strongly recommended” the department of personnel and training to issue guidelines “whereby the caste certificate of an employee is verified within six months of his joining.” “If the organisation carries out the verification process immediately at the time of joining, then no person can gain employment on the basis of a false caste certificate,” the panel, headed by BJP’s Kirit Solanki, told Parliament.“The committee has observed that presently, the verification of caste certificate starts at the fag end of the career of the employee. Withholding pension benefits is gross harassment for the employee, both mentally and physically,” the panel added.The panel’s suggestions came following Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad’s claims that both ministries and public offices have withheld pension benefits for as many as 136 SC, STs. Of these, seven died while waiting for their benefits, it said.

The statement reflects his (Akhilesh’s) mindset and thought process and shows how frustrated he is. Before speaking, one should think twice over what kinds of words one is using and against whom. Using such words against someone who is older is unfortunate.” Soon after PM Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi, his parliamentary constituency, on Monday, Yadav remarked jeeringly that people stay in Varanasi during their “final days”. “This is very good, he (Modi) can stay there not for one month but two or even three months. That is a good place to stay, people spend their final days here,” he said. Several Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in Uttar Pradesh also condemned the remarks on Monday, with state chief Swatantra Dev Singh seeking an apology and asking Yadav to visit Kashi Vishwanath temple to seek forgiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anurag-thakur-attacks-akhilesh-yadav-over-remark-on-pm-modi-101639507261337.html
15-12-2021||India||TMC, MGP formalise alliance for Goa polls||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) on Wednesday formalised an alliance before the state assembly elections early next year, pledging to jointly take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Speaking at a rally where the alliance was announced, West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee said the alliance presented a “real alternative to the BJP”.“We are a joint family now. In a joint family, TMC and MGP has become a real alternative in Goa. Vote for us. TMC and MGP will rule in Goa. Those who want to defeat the BJP, we request them to not divide the vote,” Banerjee said at the rally.The MGP, which gave Goa its first chief minister, is the longest standing political party in the coastal state, albeit one that was reduced to a marginal player by the BJP that gained vote share in the state in the 1990s and 2000s largely at the expense of the MGP.The MGP currently has a single MLA in the legislative assembly after two of the three elected MLAs switched sides to the BJP, following which party leader Ramkrishna “Sudhin” Dhavalikar, who was deputy chief minister under former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, was dropped from the cabinet by his successor Pramod Sawant.The Dhavalikars, Sudin and his brother Pandurang “Deepak” Dhavalikar, who is party president, control the affairs of the MGP.“We formed the alliance for the good of Goa to offer Goa a new dawn and to take us to the zenith of development. To get to the mountain of happiness, we have to cross several hills of despair,” Sudin Dhavalikar said at the rally.“They (the BJP) stole two of our MLAs and 10 from the Congress (to ensure majority in the assembly). The voters should put an end to this,” Dhavalikar said.He recalled how present TMC Rajya Sabha MP Luizinho Faleiro, who switched to the TMC a few months ago from the Congress party, was involved in “stealing” MLAs from the MGP when he was chief minister of Goa in 1999.“Despite having a full majority of 22 (in the 40-member house), he stole two MGP MLAs,” Dhavalikar recalled, highlighting the differences that remain between the two parties despite the alliance.Banerjee on her part assured that local affairs will be decided by local leaders.“I have not come to control you. I do not want outsiders to control Goa. I want insiders,” she said.

The government gave its “in-principle” approval for its HLL’s disinvestment in July.HLL Lifecare, which played a key role in India’s family planning programme in the 1970s manufacturing condoms branded Nirodh, forayed into other contraceptive, hospital supplies and women’s health care products starting from the 1990s, according to the company website.According to the EoI document, the firm is also engaged in providing health care and diagnostic services, consultancy and contract services for health care infrastructure projects, and consultancy services for procurement of medical equipment and devices in the health care sector.The EoI document said the government “envisages the strategic disinvestment of HLL as a whole rather than separately in parts, where Interested bidders can bid individually or in the consortium”.“On completion of the transaction as well as the stipulated lock-in period, flexibility would be given to the strategic acquirer for an easy exit from a part of the business which is not in sync with the business plans of the acquirer,” the document added.Hindustan Latex Employees Union Congress general secretary Nisar Ahmad said they were stunned by the government move. “It was least expected… We were working 24x7 during the pandemic and some workers collapsed in the factory due to a heavy workload. It is the reward for our hard work and we feel cheated,” he said.A senior HLL official, asking not to be named, said that in 2020-21 the turnover of the company was ₹5,081.31 crores.“We are speechless. We never expected this now,” said a factory employee K Balakrishnan, adding that the company and its employees played a key role in tiding over shortages of PPE kits during Covid pandemic.
15-12-2021||India||Welfare schemes for informal sector under progress||The Union government is working on a range of social security and welfare schemes for the informal sector, particularly migrants and gig workers, covering basics such as food security, affordable accommodation, and medical benefits, higher order needs including skill upgradation, financial inclusion, and access to institutional credit, and which may also involve cash transfers to registered beneficiaries.Although still work in progress, some of these measures may find a mention in Union Budget 2022-23, with the government having already created a database of at least 110 million registered migrant workers, three people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.“The government is working on various welfare schemes, including creation of a social security fund to support welfare schemes for unorganised sector workers, including gig and platform workers,” one person said, adding that stakeholders’ feedback during the pre-budget consultations will be used to make such schemes inclusive and effective. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is starting virtual consultations from Wednesday, according to an official tweet. “Finance minister Smt @nsitharaman will be holding her 1st Pre-Budget consultations with experts of Agriculture and Agro-processing industry tomorrow afternoon, 15th Dec 2021,” the finance ministry posted on Tuesday. The Union Budget for 2022-23 is expected to be presented on February 1, 2022.Gig workers earn from work and activities outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship, and platform workers are engaged through an online platform by employers to provide specific tasks or services to customers. Gig workers such as freelancers, and platform workers earning through food delivery apps or cab aggregators, do not enjoy social security benefits like provident fund, gratuity and pension benefits provided to employees engaged in formal jobs.The effective implementation of welfare schemes for the unorganised sector will be possible with the help of state governments through an Aadhaar-linked database of unorganised workers through e-Shram portal, the person cited above said. On August 26, the government launched the e-Sharam portal for registration of unorganised workers with an objective of providing benefits of welfare schemes to migrant workers even when they move from one place to other.“The registration through Aadhaar may also help check influx of illegal migrants from porous international borders. Illegal migrants from neighbouring countries not only grab jobs meant for the Indian workforce, but also reduce their bargaining power as they are willing to work even below the official minimum wage,” a second person said.According to the government’s estimates in 2016, there were over 20 million illegal migrants in India.The government is working on a comprehensive social security plan to avoid a crisis such as the one witnessed after the lockdown was announced last year -- the mass migration of labour.After the Covid-19 pandemic hit India in March 2020, a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown from March 25 was enforced that shut down factories and business establishments.According to official data, around 11.43 million migrant workers returned to their home state during the pandemic period last year.“We have no social security. We are often exploited in terms of revenue-share, working hours and unreasonable conditions imposed by the intermediaries, who are often big companies and multinationals. We want the government to adequately protect us,” Telangana Gig and Platform Workers’ Union treasurer K Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2022-may-announce-social-security-welfare-schemes-for-informal-sector-101639506843772.html
15-12-2021||India||House passes bills on ED, CBI chiefs’ terms||Parliament on Tuesday passed two draft legislations to extend the terms of the directors of Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate to a maximum of five years, amid a walkout by the opposition, which wanted to discuss the suspension of 12 lawmakers.The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which were cleared by the Lok Sabha on December 9, was moved by junior personnel minister Jitendra Singh and passed by voice vote in the Upper House.The modified laws allow authorities to extend the tenures of the directors by one year at a time from the initial date of appointment till the completion of five years.Soon after Singh moved the motion, opposition leaders led by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, walked out of the House to protest the suspension of 12 MPs for unruly behaviour in the monsoon session. Kharge had asked the chair to revoke the suspension and allow the MPs to participate in the debate.Speaking in the House, Singh said the two bills will streamline and institutionalise the agencies. “I think, contrary to the popular impression in certain quarters, the amendment does not seek to increase the tenure. Rather, it seeks to put an embargo on the tenure, which is that of five years,” he said.“The existing law under the DSPE Act (relating to the Central Bureau of Investigation) prohibits for a tenure not less than two years. We are suggesting a tenure not more than five years. So, in a way, we are making it more streamlined, more institutionalised and more democratised,” he said.Several MPs, including Janata Dal (United)’s Ram Nath Thakur, GK Vasan of the Tamil Maanila Congress, Birendra Prasad Vaishya of Asom Gana Parishad, Brijlal of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose of YSR Congress Party, spoke in favour of the two bills.Several leaders, including Thakur, said a tenure should also be fixed for completing investigations by these agencies.BJP MP D P Vats cited examples from across the world where heads of investigative agencies have a tenure of five years or more.In his remarks, Singh attacked the opposition for not being present in the House.“The noble motive behind bringing this bill stands fully established. However, what is the motive of those who have chosen to walk away from the discussion or to shy away from the discussion, I leave that to the judgment of the history and the writers of history,” he said.Reacting to this, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “It is a misfortune that in the 75th year of our Independence, democracy is being so shamelessly decimated by the Modi government. They curb the voice of the opposition, they illegally suspend MPs and the PM proudly participates in the Summit for Democracy. This is the height of two-facedness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-bills-to-extend-terms-of-ed-cbi-chiefs-101639506601077.html
15-12-2021||India||International flights depend on Omicron cases: Scindia||The Omicron variant of Covid-19 has triggered concern over international travel across the world, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday, leading to fresh travel restrictions in several countries, including India.“International travel is completely dependent on the spread of the Omicron variant,” Scindia said. “Prior to Covid, our highest capacity was close to 4.2 lakh passengers daily. Now we are ranging between 3.7 lakh to 3.95 lakh. We currently have a seat load factor ranging from 75- 81%, which is a healthy factor.”The minister added: “Keeping this in mind, I was looking at opening up international travel, but the world got hit by Omicron, which has been raging virulently and violently across the world, and we decided to contain international exposure again.” India has put 12 regions, including all of Europe, on its “at-risk” list. Passengers arriving from these areas are tested at the airport and have to quarantine at home for seven days.“We are working closely with the health ministry. When we get over Omicron, we can go back to normalcy, but I cannot give you a date today. We must put the health of our citizens at the top of our priority list amid the new concerns,” Scindia said.He was speaking at a partnership summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry in association with the department for promotion of industry and internal trade of the commerce ministry.Speaking on the privatisation of Air India, Scindia said the transaction was a win-win situation for everyone. He said that the ministry and Centre is developing an ecosystem that includes maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft, leasing of planes, drones, helicopters and aerospace manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-flights-depend-on-omicron-spread-scindia-101639506421164.html
15-12-2021||India||18 opposition parties hold march against suspension of MPs from Parliament||Leaders of as many as 18 opposition parties on Tuesday held a protest march against the suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha MPs, from the entire winter session of Parliament, even as the government remained adamant that the legislators “express remorse and regret” for their behaviour in the last session.Opposition leaders from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha held a march from Parliament House to Vijay Chowk, holding placards and banners, and refusing to relent till the suspension was revoked.“This (suspension) is a symbol of the crushing of the voices of the people of India. They have remained suspended now for two weeks . They have been sitting outside. Their voices have been crushed. They have done nothing wrong,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said. He also alleged that the government was passing Bills without holding discussions or debates in the two Houses.Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not come to Parliament and “this is not the way to run a democracy”. “It is an unfortunate killing of democracy that is taking place,” he remarked.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader Tiruchi Siva said the government’s behaviour in Parliament was “undemocratic and in violation of all the Rules of Procedure” of the Upper House.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the government wants the opposition to join the House proceedings provided they “express remorse and regret”. “I call upon Congress leaders and others to express remorse and regret and come to the House. The government is in talks with them (suspended MPs) at an individual level for withdrawal of their suspension. I have made it clear that they should at least express regret,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-opposition-parties-hold-march-against-suspension-of-mps-from-parliament-101639506361434.html
15-12-2021||India||Travellers from ‘at-risk’ countries will have to pre-book tests: Centre||International travellers to India from “at-risk” countries will have to pre-book an RT-PCR test on arrival from December 20, initially at the airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, the civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday, as the country seeks to contain the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus first detected in South Africa.The Air Suvidha portal will be modified to allow overseas arrivals to book the test that will be conducted on arrival, the ministry said in a statement.Those unable to do so will still be allowed to board planes, but it will be the responsibility of the airlines to ensure those passengers are accompanied to the testing counters, it said.The ministry has asked the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, India’s aviation regulator, to issue an advisory to all airlines to check the mandatory pre-booking of tests by passengers before they board a flight.Earlier this month, the health and aviation ministries had mandated self-declaration at the Air Suvidha portal as alarm spreads about the Omicron variant. The exemption forms on Air Suvidha were discontinued, and filling all details was made compulsory for international passengers arriving in India.Overseas passengers coming into India have to declare their current health status on Air Suvidha, along with uploading copies of their passports, RT-PCR negative certificates conducted within 72 hours of departure and vaccine certificates.Task force chief pitches for vaccine platformsCovid Task Force chief VK Paul on Tuesday said India should have vaccine platforms that are “adaptable quickly” with changing nature of the variants.“There is a potential scenario that our vaccines may become ineffective in emerging situations. In the wake of the last three weeks of living with Omicron, we have seen how such doubts have come up, some of them may be genuine, we still do not have the final picture,” he said.“There is need for us that we have to be sure about having vaccine platforms that are adaptable quickly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travellers-from-at-risk-countries-will-have-to-pre-book-covid-testscentre-101639506301088.html
15-12-2021||India||Opposition leaders may urge Naidu to break impasse after Sonia meet||Senior Opposition leaders such as the Congress’s Mallikarjun Kharge and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar may collectively urge Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu to take the initiative to end the logjam in RS over the suspension of 12 MPs, a meeting chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi decided on Tuesday.According to people familiar with the developments, the leaders may also point out to Naidu how his predecessor, Hamid Ansari, often took the lead to end such logjams during his tenure.The strategy on the Opposition’s way forward in the Upper House, besides the upcoming assembly elections in several states, was decided at a key meeting of leaders of five parties at Gandhi’s residence.Besides Sonia Gandhi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Kharge and Pawar, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader TR Balu, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and Congress general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal were present at the meeting.At the meeting, Yechury pointed out Ansari’s role in a marathon logjam in 2015 over the passage of bills. “In such cases, it is always the chairman who takes the lead to bring the House in order,” Yechury was quoted as saying by one of the people cited above.Condemning the suspension move, Sonia said such a situation is unheard of. Rahul remained insistent that the matter be solved by the government and that there is no question of any apology from the members.When Yechury said that Opposition leaders should meet Naidu and seek his intervention, Kharge said he had met the House chairman two to three times in the last 10 days but no there was no development.The leaders decided that along with Kharge, senior leaders such as Pawar would meet Naidu — possibly on Wednesday — to tell him that the Chairman always has always taken the lead to resolve acrimonious matters, the people cited above said.Besides the MPs’ suspension, the Opposition leaders also discussed the upcoming assembly elections and insisted that their goal would be to maximise the Opposition votes in the poll-bound states through co-operation and strategic pacts.A senior Opposition leader described Tuesday’s meeting as a follow-up of the mega Opposition meeting chaired by Sonia on August 20. This time, a smaller meeting was favoured keeping in mind the growing rift between the Congress and Trinamool Congress, after the latter poached several lawmakers and senior leaders and attacked the former in recent months.“If you call all opposition parties and Mamata Banerjee (TMC chief) does not attend, the media headlines would scream that Mamata boycotted the Congress-led opposition. And if we don’t invite her, the headlines would suggest opposition boycotts Mamata. It’s a tricky situation both ways,” a senior Congress leader said, seeking anonymity. The Congress indicated that Sonia may hold similar meets in the future.
15-12-2021||India||WPI inflation rises to 12-year high of 14.23% on oil, food||India’s annual wholesale inflation surged to 14.23% in November over a year ago on account of the so-called base effect , and also a rise in prices of mineral oils, basic metals, crude petroleum, natural gas, chemicals and food products, official data showed on Tuesday.The surge in the wholesale price index (WPI), which measures factory-gate inflation, or what producers charge wholesalers, follows a rise in retail prices. On Monday, the consumer price index (CPI) for November climbed 4.91%, despite the central and several state governments reducing taxes on petrol and diesel early in the month to provide relief to the people.WPI captures the average movement of wholesale prices of goods and excludes taxes. Therefore, reduction in taxes will not be captured in WPI data, a commerce ministry spokesperson said.Fuel and power have also been the biggest contributors of higher inflation rate in November this year, and were almost 40% higher than a year ago.WPI inflation in November this year jumped from 12.54% in the previous month (October 2021). However, in November 2020 it was low at 2.29%. Hence the spike in November 2021 wholesale inflation November is also on account of the low base a year ago, the spokesperson added.“Countries which traditionally have reported low inflation rates such as the US are now reporting record inflation levels due to these global effects,” he said adding that Italy, Spain, Germany and Singapore are witnessing around 20% inflation.Pradeep Multani, president of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said WPI inflation has “increased to a record level” because of an increase in prices of food articles, including vegetables, fruits, egg and meat, along with high prices of fuel and power. “As some stability in vegetable prices has been observed in the recent weeks, we expect WPI inflation to subside in the coming months.”Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA Ltd said the weakening rupee would have adverse impact on containing inflation in December.Although the prices of various food items have displayed a seasonal downtrend and those of several commodities have corrected to an extent following the reality check provided by the Omicron variant, the rupee has depreciated in recent sessions, which may curtail the extent of moderation in the WPI inflation in December, she explained.The rupee on Tuesday closed at 75.88 against the US dollar, an 18-month low because of foreign fund outflows and concerns over inflation.“The hardening in the WPI inflation to 14.2% in November 2021 from 12.5% in October 2021, was dominated by the surge in primary food products to an inflation of 4.9% from the disinflation of 1.7%, respectively, in addition to the rise displayed by minerals, fuel and power, crude petroleum and natural gas as well as core-WPI,” she said.Only primary non-food articles and manufactured food products recorded a softening in the year-on-year inflation numbers in November, while continuing to remain in double digits, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wpi-inflation-rises-to-12-year-high-of-14-23-on-oil-food-101639505820141.html
15-12-2021||India||Variant watch: What we know about Omicron||Does the Omicron variant lead to milder Covid-19?It seems so, according to what may be the first large-scale analysis of cases in South Africa, where the newest variant of concern was first seen and is believed to have become widespread.Discovery South Africa, a private insurer, said the findings were preliminary and based on the first three weeks of the Omicron outbreak in the country where it now accounts for 90% of the cases, and the picture may yet change.But for the initial period involving over 200,000 cases, it was found the risk of hospitalisation among adults was 29% less compared with the first wave in mid-2020, when the D614G variant (the closest to the ancestor that spread out of Wuhan) caused a Covid-19 epidemic in the country.“Epidemiological tracking shows a steep trajectory of new infections, indicating Omicron’s rapid spread, but so far with a flatter trajectory of hospital admissions, possibly indicating lower severity,” the company quoted Ryan Noach, its chief executive, as saying. “This lesser severity could, however, be confounded by the high seroprevalence levels of Sars-Cov-2 antibodies in the general South African population, especially following an extensive Delta wave of infections.”In Gauteng province, where the variant first spread and quickly became widespread, at least 70% of the population is estimated to have had a previous coronavirus infection, the report noted.The analysis also mirrored a sharp drop in vaccine efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease reported by real-world studies in the UK. Two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are now only 33% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, down from 80% in the case of Delta, the Discovery SA study found.Crucially, in what is the first vaccine efficacy estimate for risk of hospitalisation, the analysis found a regular Pfizer vaccine regimen offered only 70% protection against severe complications in Omicron cases, significantly lower than the 93% protection if the infection was with the Delta variant.The Discovery South Africa analysis did not study the effect of booster doses.A study by the UK Health Security Agency last week showed a third dose of an mRNA vaccine lifted vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from 33% to 71-75%, which means a similar or better boost in protection against severe disease is likely with a booster.“It is important to note that these insights relate to data from the first three weeks of the Omicron-driven wave in South Africa. Therefore, the insights should be considered preliminary, since they may change as the wave progresses,” the insurer said.The report also flagged a 20% increased risk among children to be hospitalised due to Omicron, although this too could be skewed since most of the cases detected in all age groups were incidental; these people were already in the hospital for other diseases or procedures and were tested for Covid-19.The analysis also appeared to corroborate an increased risk of reinfection, finding a 40% relative risk with Omicron in people who were in the past infected with the Delta variant, and 60% chance of repeat infection in people who previously caught the Beta variant.
15-12-2021||India||Universities may soon offer maternity leave to undergrad students||Women pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in India may soon be entitled to 240 days of maternity and child care leave, similar to research scholars, once universities frame rules on directions by the country’s higher education regulator.All higher education institutions have been requested to frame appropriate rules through a letter sent on Tuesday by Rajnish Jain, secretary of the University Grants Commission.Women research scholars can take 240 days of maternity leave, according to the UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.Phil./Ph.D degrees) Regulations, 2016. “...the women candidates may be provided Maternity Leave/Child Care Leave once in the entire duration of M.Phil/Ph.D. for up to 240 days,” reads part of clause 4.4 of the regulation.“In addition to above (clause 4.4), all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are requested to frame appropriate rules/norms with regard to granting Maternity Leave to the women students enrolled in their respective institution / affiliated Colleges and also provide all relaxations/exemptions relating to attendance, extension in date for submitting examination forms or any other facility deemed necessary for women students pursuing Undergraduate and postgraduate programmes,” Jain wrote in his letter.Women enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes do not currently enjoy such benefits.“The provision is only available for MPhil and PhD students presently,” said Balaram Pani, dean of collages at Delhi University. “However, it looks like the reform has been introduced in line with the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, since it provides multiple exit and entry options to students. We are yet to seek more clarity over the communication.”Seema Das, a member of the university’s executive council and professor of political science at Hindu College, and the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) member Abha Dev Habib welcomed the move, while demanding similar provisions should be extended for the women working as guest teachers.“This is more beneficial for female students living in rural areas or areas where cases of early marriages are rampant because the age of marriage in urban areas has considerably increased over the years,” Das said.“However, the UGC should also take steps to extend maternity benefits to women working as guest teachers.”
15-12-2021||India||India facing highest labour work hour loss due to heat stress: Study||India already loses around 101 billion hours a year on account of heat, the most in the world, and risks seeing this number rise to 230 billion hours a year when global warming reaches 2 degrees C over pre-industrial levels, a paper published in Nature on Tuesday said. That’s the equivalent of the work done by around 35 million people each working an eight-hour day, in a year .At global warming of 2 degrees plus, the world will see the loss of 547 billion hours due to heat, the paper, lead-authored by Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University has estimated.Countries in Southwest Asia, South Asia, and Africa already experience per capita workday losses of over 200 hours a year. Qatar and Bahrain are recording the highest per capita losses of at least 300 hours a year, it added.“When we overlay per-capita labour losses on the working-age population in heavy outdoor labour, we find that countries with large populations in South and East Asia experience the most work hours lost, both in the coolest hours and in the full workday, with India showing the largest heat exposure impacts on heavy labour (>101 billion hours lost/year), despite its modest average per-capita labour losses (162 lost hours a year),” the paper stated.Large population-weighted labour losses are also recorded in countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China which may be driven by a combination of a huge working-age populations, seasonal heat exposure, and large fractions of population working in agriculture and construction. Under future warming scenarios India, China, Pakistan, and Indonesia will experience the largest such losses despite having lower national-average per-capita losses than other countries with smaller populations in Southeast Asia and tropical Africa, the study said.Heat exposure of labourers is linked to multiple health impacts, including premature death; workplace injuries; morbidity from heat-related illness; and acute kidney damage. Indeed, heat exposure is a potential contributing factor to an epidemic of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology in otherwise healthy, relatively young workers in Central America, Sri Lanka, India, and Egypt, and other parts of the world according to the paper which also added that heat exposure can raise the absorption of certain chemicals and is associated with adverse pregnancy and mental health conditions.“Many workers in the tropics are already stopping work in the afternoon because it’s too hot. Luckily, about 30% of this lost labour can still be recovered by moving it to the early morning. But with each additional degree of global warming, workers’ ability to adapt this way will swiftly decrease as even the coolest hours of the day quickly become too hot for continuous outdoor labour,” said Luke Parsons, a climate researcher at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment, who co-led the study. “Sadly, many of the countries and people most impacted by current and future labour losses are not responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions,” he added.The study showed that currently, approximately 30% of global heavy labour losses can be recovered by moving labour to cooler hours of the day. But this adaptation mechanism is likely to fail when there is higher warming.“We show that this particular work shift adaptation potential is lost at a rate of about 2% per degree of global warming as early morning heat exposure rises to unsafe levels for continuous work, with worker productivity losses accelerating under higher warming levels. These findings emphasise the importance of finding alternative adaptation mechanisms to keep workers safe, as well as the importance of limiting global warming,” it concluded.Global-mean temperatures are now around 1.1°C warmer than pre-industrial levels. An additional 1°C of global warming relative to the present could occur as early as 2037. Therefore, if warming is left unchecked, the globe will continue to move into a new, ‘less adaptable’ climate regime within the lifetime of many young and middle-aged workers, the paper flagged.“The impact of climate change is being felt and seen. Last decade is the warmest in the last 1.2 lakh years. To build adaptation need to plan short and long term measures. changes in working hours, creating infrastructure facilities at farm level to rest during peak day and creating knowledge and skills when people succumb to heat stress. Lack of tree cover is one of the major problems. Need to increase the tree cover. The yields in crops are also getting effected because of the increasing temperatures. Pollen dries up and yield goes down due to prolonged dry spells,” said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-facing-highest-labour-work-hour-loss-due-to-heat-stress-study-101639505641905.html

The matter is under investigation,” an IndiGo spokesperson said. The incident took place in an Airbus 320 aircraft that operated as 6E-1835 (Mumbai to Abu Dhabi) and took off around 2.59am on Sunday. After the cargo door was closed, the loader woke up while the aircraft was on its way to the United Arab Emirates capital, another official said, asking not to be named.Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) director general Arun Kumar said: “The cargo door was closed after the hold staff marked the headcount. This was learnt after arrival at Abu Dhabi. A medical examination of this loader was conducted by Abu Dhabi authorities and examination revealed that he was physically stable. After getting the requisite clearances from local authorities at Abu Dhabi, he was sent back as passenger to Mumbai on the return flight.” The man was taken off the roster after returning to Mumbai pending investigation, the DGCA official said.“I have never heard of any such incident in the past. It raised questions about not only the flight incharge of the airline, but also safety concerns,” said Mohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigo-loader-sleeping-in-cargo-flown-to-abu-dhabi-probe-launched-101639505580207.html
15-12-2021||India||PM Modi meets BJP CMs in governance push||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the chief ministers of 12 states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party to focus on development and last-mile delivery of welfare schemes, marking a major development push months before high-stakes state polls.The meeting in Varanasi, also attended by the deputy chief ministers of at least three states and BJP chief JP Nadda, came a day after Modi inaugurated the ₹700 crore Kashi Vishwanath Corridor.“Highlighting the importance of technology in governance, PM Modi called for governance to be data driven to ensure last mile delivery, speed and transparency,” said a press statement issued by the BJP.“He (Modi) called upon every BJP-headed government to carve a niche for itself in some or the other sector of governance. He urged governments to accord topmost priority to ease of living,” the statement added.The meeting was attended by the chief ministers of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Both the deputy CMs in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and the deputy CM of Nagaland also participated in the event.PM Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath reached the Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) auditorium for the meeting in the same vehicle from the Bareka guest house. Nadda welcomed the PM at the venue.Modi asked all the CMs to apprise people of various welfare and development schemes implemented by the government. “In a democracy, people are everything. In such a situation, it is very important to take care of the interest of public. There should be no laxity in implementing developmental schemes,” said the PM, according to senior BJP leaders who requested anonymity.The meeting came on the second day of the PM’s visit to his parliamentary constituency and hours after Modi and Adityanath conducted a surprise midnight inspection of several development projects, including the temple corridor and the city railway station.“Inspecting key development works in Kashi. It is our endeavour to create best possible infrastructure for this sacred city,” tweeted Modi at 12:52am on Tuesday.The BJP faces high-stakes elections in five states early next year, and is hoping to come back to power in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous and politically crucial state.On Monday, Modi opened the mega redevelopment project comprising 24 buildings built over 550,000 square feet, which aims to rejuvenate the centuries-old Kashi Vishwanath temple complex.In the meeting on Tuesday, the PM reaffirmed the principle of “minimum government, maximum governance” and urged the states to remove laws that had become archaic and reduce compliance burdens.The PM told the chief ministers to ensure 100% implementation of development schemes in their respective states. “Full benefits of the schemes should go to the people. Work on it and ensure it,” he added, according to BJP leaders present at the meeting.In his opening remarks, Nadda lauded Modi’s success in his two-decade-long stint, first as chief minister of Gujarat and then as PM. He also said that the BJP and good governance were synonymous.Earlier in the day, the PM held a meeting with the office-bearers of the Varanasi unit of the BJP and asked party lawmakers to stay in touch with the people.Modi told the BJP leaders to apprise people of welfare schemes of the state and central governments by organising street-corner meetings in villages, towns, localities and colonies.“During the meetings, do talk about the government’s vision of Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas (inclusive development for all),” he said.
15-12-2021||India||SC clears widening of Char Dham road||The Supreme Court on Tuesday permitted the Union government to construct all-weather roads with 10m width as part of its Char Dham project in Uttarakhand, underlining that “the recent past has thrown up serious challenges to national security”, and that wide strategic feeder roads to Indo-China border areas were required for the infrastructural needs of the armed forces.Lifting its September 2020 restraining order against widening of the roads in view of the region’s ecology, the top court held that the considerations governing the construction of highways that are strategic roads from a defence perspective, and may be used by the armed forces of the nation, cannot be the same as those for other roads in hilly and mountainous regions.“This court, in its exercise of judicial review, cannot second-guess the infrastructural needs of the armed forces... The submission of the appellants requires the court to interrogate the policy choice of the establishment which is entrusted by law with the defence of the nation. This is impermissible,” said a bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud.It further ruled that the need for the development of national highways of a double lane standard is proportionate to the object of fulfilling the security concerns of the nation, as assessed by the ministry of defence (MoD).However, the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath, clarified that the court’s approval is subject to compliance by authorities with all remedial measures in relation to hill-cutting, and landslides; muck disposal; dust and pollution control; and impact on wildlife and water resources.The bench said that the recommendations made by the court-mandated high-powered committee (HPC) in July 2020 must be adhered to in order to make the project environmentally sustainable, especially in wake of the fact that “the remedial measures in relation to hill-cutting and landslides have been tardy and limited” so far.The court set up a three-member oversight committee, to be headed by former Supreme Court judge AK Sikri, that would monitor compliance by authorities with the recommendations made by HPC, and would report on the progress undertaken to it every four months.The other two members of the committee will be from the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Forest Research Institute, Dehradun.Several concerns have been raised about the environmental viability of the Char Dham road project. Environmentalists including members of the Supreme Court constituted high powered committee had last year flagged that the project had made constructions and felled trees based on a conditional stage 1 forest clearance. Geologists have flagged that hill cutting for the project has made the stretches extremely vulnerable to landslides and slope destabilisation.The bench said on Tuesday that at stake were not just benefits directly to the armed forces but “also the health of the environment, and its effects on all individuals who inhabit the area” and therefore, it was imperative that the road transport ministry and defence ministry be transparent in the measures they adopt, in order for them to be held publicly accountable.The court was deciding two applications by separate departments of the Centre, MoD and Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to modify the September 2020 order, which relied on a 2018 MoRTH circular providing for roads in hilly regions to be 5.5m wide. However, another circular in December 2020 modified it by allowing 7m width, with a 1.5m paved shoulder on either side of the highway, for feeder roads to the Indo-China border.Through attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, the Centre stressed on the necessity of developing the feeder roads — Rishikesh to Mana (281km), Rishikesh to Gangotri (231 km) and Tanakpur to Pithoragarh (162 km) — for national security. Given the proximity of the roads to the Indo-China border, the AG, highlighted the necessity of free movement for transport of trucks, machines, equipment and personnel of the Indian Army while seeking a nod for double lane configuration for these roads.The Centre’s plea was opposed by NGO Citizens for Green Doon, on whose plea the road width was restricted to 5.5m. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the NGO, argued that the present road infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of the Indian Army. Any further development, it was urged, must be balanced keeping in mind the fragility of the Himalayas, the excessive damage caused to the environment and the need to ensure disaster-resilient roads.The bench, however, allowed the Centre’s plea.“The allegation that the application filed by the MoD seeks to re-litigate the matter or subvert the previous order of this court are unfounded inasmuch as MoD, as the specialised body of the Government of India, is entitled to decide on the operational requirements of the armed forces. These requirements include infrastructural support needed for facilitating the movement of troops, equipment and machines,” it noted.The bench added that the bona fides of the MoD are also evident from the fact that the issue of security concerns was raised during the discussions of the HPC and finds mention in the HPC Report. Thus, the MoD has maintained the need for double-laned roads to meet border security concerns.“The appellants (NGO) would have this court hold that the need of the army will be subserved better by disaster resistant roads of a smaller dimension. The submission of the appellants requires the Court to override the modalities decided upon by the Army and the MoD to safeguard the security of the nation’s borders...This is impermissible,” it noted.It underscored the need to arrive at a delicate balance of environmental considerations such that they do not impede infrastructural development, specifically in areas of strategic importance crucial to the security of the nation.“We find that the need for the development of national highways of a DL-PS standard is proportionate to the object of fulfilling the security concerns of the nation as assessed by the MoD. This is reinforced by the fact that the roads beyond the highways in the Project, beyond Gangotri, Mana and Pithoragarh are being developed by the MoD as double laned highways,” held the bench.It also declined to bind the MoD with a statement made by the then Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat in 2019 in a media interview regarding the adequacy of infrastructure for troop movement, saying reliance on a media interview would be uncalled for given the consistent stand of the MoD during the deliberations of HPC and before the top court.“The security concerns as assessed by the MoD may change over time. The recent past has thrown up serious challenges to national security. The armed forces cannot be held down to a statement made during a media interaction in 2019 as if it were a decree writ in stone,” maintained the court.Experts said the verdict will adversely impact the environmental issues in the region.“It is very strange that the Supreme Court has given a judgement approving DL-PS road width standard while the MoD in their application had only asked for a double lane. The increase of road-width is directly proportional to the connected impacts. Thus by giving such a verdict the environmental issues have been severely/devastatingly exacerbated,” said Mallika Bhanot, environmentalist and member of Ganga Ahvaan.“We have already highlighted the concerns with geological instability of the road project. Now since the judgment has come, I will only add that the implementing authorities are conscious and understand the concerns and make a disaster resilient road for our defence personnel which will be very important for our national security,” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and member of high powered committee on Char Dham road project.In January this year, the high-powered committee in its report to the SC presented a divided opinion with the majority in favour of the wider roads on the Char Dham route, considering the strategic requirement and snow removal needs.The majority report also took into account the state government’s focus on reversing the migration in border areas by providing ample livelihood opportunities and ease of transportation, and said that the latest MoRTH circular on wider roads should be accepted.The majority report added it is not “feasible” to revisit the entire project where work is already completed and reduce the road width from 10 m to 5.5 m, underlining that it was “impractical” to reclaim the already tarred road because it will not be possible to grow trees on the excavated parts.
15-12-2021||India||India, Iran and Uzbekistan hold discussion on Chabahar port||India, Iran and Uzbekistan on Tuesday discussed the further development of the transit and transportation corridor centred round the Iranian port of Chabahar during a trilateral meeting on the joint use of the port on the Gulf of Oman.This was the second virtual meeting of the trilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port, and it was held exactly a year after the first meeting.“The participants underlined the important role played by Chabahar Port during humanitarian crises as well as in enhancing regional connectivity,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “They also took note of the increase in transit traffic between Central Asia and South Asia through the Shahid Behesti Terminal, Chabahar Port and discussed further development of transportation corridor,” the statement added, referring to the terminal at the port operated by the Indian company, India Ports Global Limited. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan had triggered speculation about the viability of Chabahar port, but external affairs minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday that the port had emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region and was a “more economical and stable route” for landlocked countries to reach India and the global market.The Indian side agreed to send a high-level delegation to Chabahar next year at the invitation of the Iranian side.
15-12-2021||India||NIA makes first arrest after taking over Mundra port drug seizure case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested an Afghan national from South Delhi in connection with the 3,000 kg Afghan heroin seizure from Mundra port in September, officials said.The drug haul, worth ₹21,000 crore as estimated by agencies, was the largest ever seizure by Indian agencies. A narco-terror link is being probed in the delivery as it was sent to India from Kandahar after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan.The federal anti-terror probe agency said in a statement that 28-year-old Sobhan Aryanfar was arrested from Neb Sarai in South Delhi on December 12 (Sunday). “During the investigation, the arrested Afghan national was found to be involved in the conspiracy of transporting narcotic drugs concealed in import consignment of semi-processed talc stones originating from Afghanistan. Further investigation in the case is going on,” read the statement.Prior to this, at least eight people, including Chennai couple Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and Machavaram Sudhakar, who allegedly imported the heroin concealed in the semi-processed talc stones through their Vijaywada registered firm (Aashi Trading Company) from a Kandahar based company, four Afghan nationals, an Uzbek woman were arrested by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI).Vaishali and Sudhakar are said to be small players as they got only ₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh commission for allegedly allowing to use their talc stones containers for smuggling heroin. A larger network of Afghan nationals is suspected to be behind the consignment, said an officer.The ministry of home affairs transferred the case to the NIA on October 6 to probe the Taliban-Pakistan angle. On October 12, the NIA raided residential premises of some suspects and godowns at Lajpat Nagar, Alipur, Khera Kalan in New Delhi and Noida.The consignment was intercepted by the DRI on September 14 and 15 on the basis of specific intelligence that high-quality heroin was being smuggled in two containers from Afghanistan to Gujarat’s Mundra port via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port. The two containers checked by the DRI had 1,999.58 kg and 988.64 kg heroin packed and layered between the talc to avoid detection by security and customs officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-makes-first-arrest-after-taking-over-mundra-port-drug-seizure-case-101639493064921.html
