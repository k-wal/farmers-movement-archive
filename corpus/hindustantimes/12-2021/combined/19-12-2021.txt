19-12-2021||News||2021 in numbers: Rural wages||Official employment statistics, available for both rural and urban areas until June 2020 and for urban areas up to March 2021, suggest that a big impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market is qualitative. This means that if people did not become unemployed, they had to shift to low paying casual or agricultural jobs. Another way of tracking the quality of jobs is to look at the trends in wages. This is because wages can decline if the number of jobs of a particular kind decrease and job-seekers remain the same. Here’s what happened to wages in 2021.

19-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to spend bulk of clean air funds on electrifying public transport||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government plans to spend a significant majority of clean air funding obtained under the 15th Finance Commission (FC) on electrifying public transport under its Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy 2021. The policy aims at bringing at least 1,46,000 new battery-operated electric vehicles (BEVs) on state roads by 2025, estimated to comprise about 10% of all new vehicle registrations by that time.Maharashtra has been allotted a total corpus of ₹2981 crore, at the recommendation of the 15th FC, specifically to address air pollution in the state. The funds are to be utilised by the end of the financial year 2026. Of the ₹2773 crore which the state government plans to spend by the end of FY2025, a clean 80% (or ₹2218 crore) is proposed to be spent on the EV Policy, primarily on electrifying bus fleets in major urban clusters. “These buses will not be purchased, but the transport department will use the funds to subsidise contractors’ costs for one year,” said an MPCB official in the know of the matter.The balance ₹555 crore are to be spent on local interventions, such as increasing Maharashtra’s air quality monitoring network (3%), implementing dust control measures (8%), and regulating construction (4%), industries (2% ), bakeries and crematoria (3%).Confirming these details, Dr VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), said, “Since vehicular emissions are a leading cause of air pollution, we have decided to utilise the 15th FC funds to boost electrification of public vehicles in six urban agglomerations, including Greater Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Vasai-Virar. These funds are not the same as those obtained under the National Clean Air Program. That is a different corpus, and applies to different cities.”The move has drawn mixed reactions from experts. While some said the move is strategically sound, others feared that allotting a disproportionate amount of clean air funds to a macro-level policy will take away local resources to fight air pollution. Aarti Khosla, director of advocacy group Climate Trends, said, “ ₹2700 odd crore is not a huge amount to begin with, so perhaps the state has decided to put its heft behind a single goal. That makes sense, because public transport needs to be cleaned up. Alternate sources of funding for the EV Policy can be tapped into later. But the policy’s target, of converting 10% of new vehicle registrations in four years, could be more ambitious.”Others said that the move is an innovative one, and should be taken note of by other cities. Tanushree Ganguly, from the Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “ULBs tend to underestimate the contribution of road dust resuspension to air pollution, so it would be cautious to pay a little more attention to that. But at the same time no other state has tried this model, of using FC funds single-mindedly to clean up the public transport system. That is noteworthy.Not all agreed, though. “It is a no-brainer that the transport sector is one of the greatest contributors to air pollution. It’s a positive step that Maharashtra is planning to address the issue. But diverting about 80% of the FC funds towards EVs could be thought through. Cities also face other sources of air pollution, from poor waste management practices to rampant construction and industrial emissions. These areas are equally deserving of targeted policies and interventions. I would urge Maharashtra to balance out the funds among other sectors,” said Dr Anjal Prakash, research director at the Indian School of Business (ISB) and a lead author of the ongoing 6th Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (where he is involved in the chapter on cities, settlements and key infrastructure).A senior official in the transport department, seeking anonymity, said that the state government is also considering other modes of funding the EV Policy, such as levying green taxes on polluting vehicles, to subsidise private EV purchases under the new policy. “But the details of this are yet to be worked out. The governing committee will deliberate and seek inputs from other departments, including environment, revenue and transport,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-spend-bulk-of-clean-air-funds-on-electrifying-public-transport-101639938263878.html

Besides, the department has planned to test about 55,000 samples in the next 12 days of December, the officials said. “Since the start of this month, we have tried to maintain a daily average of testing 4,000 samples. On some days we have conducted over 4,200 tests also. We are aiming to conduct 125,000 tests this month. As Delhi is reporting cases of Omicron, our focus is completely on testing and samples of all those who test positive are being sent for genome sequencing. So far, none of the international travellers or locals tested positive for Omicron variant in Gurugram,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer. Till Sunday this month, the health department has tested 72,586 samples, the officials said, adding that they have increased testing this month. In the past two months, the health department tested over 90,000 samples for Covid-19. During the peak of second Covid-19 wave, in April and May, the district health department had conducted over 276,000 and 284,000 tests, respectively, according to data from the district health department. In June, the testing numbers had reduced to 119,000, shows the data. The district surveillance officer further said that along with testing at designated government and private centres, the district health department has also started setting up testing camps at markets and crowded areas once again. Last week, testing camps were organised at Sadar Bazar and Galleria market, among other places. Of 13,016 international travellers who entered the district since November 26, as many as 2,665 were from high-risk countries, the officials said. Meanwhile, the district administration has appealed to people to also take their second dose of vaccine against Covid-19 whenever their turn comes. Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “It is being noticed that some citizens in the district are not that interested in taking the second dose after taking their first jab. The thought of being safe from infection by taking a single dose of vaccine can prove to be a big mistake. Vaccine and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour are the only things that can prevent spread of the infection further.” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “The vaccination campaign has made a special contribution to the joint programme of the health department and the district administration to control the spread of Covid-19 infection. But a large number of people are not taking their second dose within the stipulated time frame. As of December 18, almost 55,000 people are yet to take their second dose.” On Sunday, 9,115 people were vaccinated in the district. Till now, over 4.10 million doses of vaccine have been administered in the district. Meanwhile, on Sunday, Gurugram recorded 16 fresh Covid-19 cases, along with 16 recoveries, according to data from the state government. At present, there are 99 active cases in the district, of which 97 are under home isolation and two are hospitalised, the officials said. In December so far, 234 positive cases have been reported, while a total of 278 cases were recorded in November. In October, the district had reported only 198 positive cases, shows the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-testing-camps-come-up-at-markets-crowded-places-101639938203866.html
19-12-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s air quality improves; one notch under ‘poor’ category||Mumbai: The city recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) value of 200 on Sunday, just one notch short of the ‘poor’ category. This was down from an AQI of 300 the previous day, which marked the worst air quality of the season. Mumbai had seen high pollution levels on Friday as well when the AQI touched 262.An AQI of 100 to 199 is considered ‘moderate’, while 50 to 99 is considered ‘satisfactory’ and below 50 is considered ‘good’. AQI over 200 is considered ‘poor’, above 300 is ‘very poor’, above 400 is ‘severe’ and above 500 is considered ‘severe+’.The improvement in air quality, officials said, was due to a slight increase in daytime temperature followed by faster winds during the afternoon. Sunday’s daytime maximum temperature was 32.6 degrees Celsius, up from 31.5 degrees Celsius the day prior.“When temperatures rise, wind speeds also pick up. The increase in daytime temperature on Sunday could have helped disperse the pollutants which had accumulated due to slightly cooler conditions on Friday and Saturday,” said an official with the India Meteorological Department’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.Malad and Andheri were the most polluted locations among SAFAR’s monitoring network, with AQIs of 323 and 301 respectively, in the ‘very poor’ category. This was followed by Mazagaon (297), Chembur (252), BKC (249), Bhandup (215), Colaba (176), Borivali (159, Navi Mumbai (150), Worli (121).The minimum temperature on Sunday morning stood at 19.8 degrees Celsius (up slightly from 19.6 the day prior). Mumbai has reported lower than normal temperatures since Tuesday this week, after the temporary onset of cooling, north-easterly winds.As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, there will be a gradual decrease in temperature over the next week. The daytime maximum is expected to settle around 28 degrees Celsius by December 24, while the minimum is expected to dip more sharply, touching 16 degrees Celsius by December 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-air-quality-improves-one-notch-under-poor-category-101639938083638.html

The officials said along with RT-PCR test for Covid-19 they have decided to get Hepatitis B and C, HIV and urine tests done as the prison department wants to ensure timely treatment of any substance abuse cases or any other ailments. Muhammad Akil, director general of police (prison), said on Sunday that this is the first time they are conducting these tests and rest of the jails will follow this initiative. “A thorough health check-up of every prisoner is done on the same day of his admission in the prison by the medical officer of prison department. Hepatitis B and C, HIV and urine tests of every newly admitted prisoner are being done to ensure timely treatment of any substance abuse or any other ailment,” he said. Earlier, the prison department used to conduct only RT-PCR test of an inmate during admission and other tests were conducted during regular health check-ups. Many inmates tested positive for HIV and Hepatitis and got delayed treatment due to late diagnosis, said the officials. Dr Gaurav Godara, medical officer of Bhondsi jail, said that on an average about 30 fresh inmates are getting admitted daily. “As soon as the inmates are brought to the jail in the evening, we conduct all the prescribed tests these days. The inmates are kept in isolation rooms unless their reports are out, and those who are found fit are sent to the barracks. Some of the tests are conducted through the Civil Hospital in Sector 10,” he said. The officials said it becomes difficult to diagnose medical issues as many a times inmates do not share their medical problems. Harinder Singh, jail superintendent, said that if any inmate is found positive for HIV they get their viral load test again and if still they test positive, they are sent for further treatment. “The positive report is only shared with the inmate and not even the family members and the inmate is kept in common barrack,” he said. Presently, there are about 3,100 inmates lodged at Bhondsi jail, the officials said.
19-12-2021||Mumbai||Petition filed in HC seeking removal of odium from father Stan Swamy’s name||MUMBAI: A petition has been filed in the Bombay high court (HC) by father Frazer Mascarenhas against the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the state of Maharashtra, seeking removal of the odium of guilt from the name of his deceased senior, father Stan Swamy, who passed away due to various medical complications at Holy Family hospital on July 5. The petition was filed after the counsels for father Swamy, appearing in the priest’s bail application, sought a declaration that father Swamy was innocent in the Elgar Parishad case as all accusations against him had been cleared due to his demise. The HC agreed that the deceased priest’s friends and close acquaintances were well within their rights to get his name cleared of the accusations however it directed them to file a separate petition for the declaration.The petition filed through senior advocate Mihir Desai and advocate Mihir Joshi, stated that apart from seeking clearing the name of the 83-year-old from the accusations against him in the Elgar Parishad case, the petition also sought a proper enquiry into his custodial death. The petition sought permission for father Mascarenhas, who has been authorised by the Jamshedpur Jesuit province to participate in the magisterial enquiry and to ensure that the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission are adhered to in the enquiry.The petition stated that the March 22 observation of the special NIA court that father Swamy was prima facie involved in the Elgar Parishad case had caused widespread hatred against the priest, which was evident from an incident at Mangaluru. The petition referred to the incident where a Jesuit institution was not allowed to name a garden after father Swamy due to the special NIA court’s observations. The petition stated that as father Swamy was not placed on trial before he passed away, he should be absolved of the accusations and his name should be cleared as per the rules.The petition also stated that the apathy of the NIA and the prison authorities had resulted in the health of the octogenarian priest deteriorating and resulting in his demise and hence, a judicial enquiry by a magistrate should be held and father Mascarenhas should be allowed to participate in it along with his legal representative.On November 24, the HC, which was hearing father Swamy’s appeals against the rejection of his bail application on medical grounds by the special NIA court, had agreed that an enquiry was necessary into the death of father Swamy. The court had held that as the appeals could not be maintained in the absence of the priest, it was disposing of the appeals but allowing father Mascarenhas to file a separate petition. The petition was registered in the HC on December 18, and is expected to come up for hearing in due course. In his application for bail on medical grounds filed in the HC in May, father Swamy had alleged that while he was able to carry out chores on his own before his arrest last year, soon after being lodged at Taloja jail his condition deteriorated and he had to take the help of his fellow inmates to carry out his chores. During a video conference appearance before the HC on May 21, father Swamy had stated that due to his failing health, he desired to go back home. He had also said that he would prefer to die in jail rather than being shifted to Sir J J hospital. Thereafter, the HC had allowed him to be shifted to Holy Family hospital where his condition had further deteriorated after the hearing of his bail application was adjourned from time to time. He passed away on July 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petition-filed-in-hc-seeking-removal-of-odium-from-father-stan-swamy-s-name-101639937363988.html

19-12-2021||Pune||76,899 beneficiaries still to take first Covid vax dose in rural Pune: CoWin||PUNE Despite the administration declaring 100 per cent vaccination in terms of the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in the rural areas of Pune district, officials of the health department updated the figures on Sunday and claimed that 69,409 in Pune district are still to get the first dose. As per the CoWin application, as of December 16, there are over 76,899 beneficiaries yet to get the first jab. Separate data furnished for each village from talukas in Pune district highlights that beneficiaries yet to receive the first dose number at least 90,000.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune Zilla Parishad, said that the pending list has been calculated against projected populations or number of voters registered from that village. “In some villages there are more villagers who are vaccinated and in some villages there are less. Data is updated every day. However, it is extremely difficult to point out exactly how many beneficiaries are yet to receive the first dose because of migration. The number that we have so far is just an indicative number as to how many beneficiaries are remaining. We are conducting door-to-door surveillance at the village level to inoculate the remaining population,” said Prasad.He added that if the number of people shown pending is shown in positive, it means that there are people on the voters’ list or in the projected population above the age of 18 who have not been vaccinated. “This data also indicates patterns of migration between villages of one taluka. In some villages fewer people are vaccinated. Some villages show negative numbers indicating that more people than the number of voters have been vaccinated,” said Prasad.In addition to this, as per the data shared by the officials, there are 1,255,182 beneficiaries who are yet to receive the second dose. “The second dose of vaccination is against the number of people who have taken the first dose and have completed 84 days. By sending local public representatives to their homes and encouraging them to take the second dose of vaccination, we expect to boost the number of people who have taken the vaccines,” said Prasad.“Our department has done a stupendous effort in identifying the number of people who may be pending for the first dose of vaccination in each village. No other district has managed to break it down to village level to identify people pending for vaccination,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/76899-beneficiaries-still-to-take-first-covid-vax-dose-in-rural-pune-cowin-101639937004107.html
19-12-2021||Delhi||Omicron could be behind Delhi's Covid cases spike; Feb, March ‘convenient’ for virus: AIIMS professor||After Delhi reported the biggest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases in six months on Sunday, a medicine expert from New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) said the spike could be due to the Omicron variant, news agency ANI reported.Sanjay Rai, a community medicine professor at AIIMS, said Omicron's infectivity is “very high” and pointed out that when the variant reaches a vulnerable population, it will “rise and fall quickly” similar to the situation during the second wave of the pandemic in India.Rai said though extreme temperature makes it hard for any microorganism to spread, exposure to cold leads to the weakening of a person's immunity, thereby making them vulnerable to the virus.“The best temperature for viruses is between 20 and 30 degrees…So, September, October, November, February and March would be more convenient for the virus,” the medical expert was quoted as saying by ANI.Delhi on Sunday logged as many as 107 new Covid-19 cases, even as the city continued to steadily witness a spike in the single-day infections. Moreover, a fresh death was also recorded after a gap of 10 days—the last one was reported on December 8.The city on Sunday also recorded the coldest winter day of the season so far after the mercury dipped to 4.6 degrees Celsius in the Safdarjung Observatory. The temperature in Lodhi Road was recorded at 3.6 degrees Celsius.Meanwhile, India's Omicron tally climbed to 154, after Maharashtra and Gujarat reported fresh infections. Maharashtra and Delhi with 54 and 22 cases, respectively, account for the most number of Omicron cases of Covid-19 variant in the country.To tackle the rising cases of the new ‘variant of concern’, the Delhi government on Saturday converted four private hospitals—Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Max Hospital in Saket, Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj and Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad—as dedicated centres. Along with Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital, the national capital now has five dedicated Omicron centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/omicron-could-be-behind-delhi-s-covid-cases-spike-aiims-professor-101639932996485.html

Fall in minimum temperature in North Madhya Maharashtra may be around eight to nine degree Celsius by that time. However, there are no chances of a cold wave in the State. Also, from December 22 there is expected to be a change in wind pattern and hence, slowly, an increase in minimum temperature can be seen from December 23,” said Kashyapi.He added that a drop of two to four degree Celsius in the minimum temperature is likely for Maharashtra and Pune city. There is no rainfall forecast. “Till December 19, there may be partly cloudy conditions during the afternoon for some time.

19-12-2021||Pune||MVA government is an example of “dealer, broker and transfer”, says Amit Shah in Pune||PUNE Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday called the Udhhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) “a punctured autorickshaw with three wheels which move in three different directions and does not function”. The home minister also termed the Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP, the three constituents of MVA, as representing the “dealer”, “broker” and “transfer” culture. “The state government is releasing only smoke which leads to pollution, but does not function. We have to go door-to-door questioning people of the state about whether this government can do any welfare for the people. Maharashtra had excelled in all fields in the past in the country, but can this government bring back the old glory. It is a ‘nikammi’ sarkar (useless government) and the forthcoming PMC elections will determine the fall of the state government,” he said, addressing a BJP party meet at Swargate. Shah added: “Modi had started DBT Direct Benefit Transfer scheme to help the poor and the needy aimed at eliminating agents. The MVA government has started its own DBT scheme where Congress considers itself as ‘dealer’, Shiv Sena as ‘broker’and NCP as ‘transfer’, to siphon off the money. This is the business of dealer, broker and transfer business and Maharashtra residents don’t want this government.” The Union home minister dared Uddhav Thackeray, saying: “ This is the city of Lokmanya Tilak who is known for Swaraj. It is my birthright, but Shiv Sena says government is its right If you have courage, give the resignation and face the polls. The BJP is ready to face all three parties in the elections .” “Petroleum prices were reduced by PM Modi, the state government reduced the price of liquor, but did not cut the petroleum prices and I question Thackeray. State government is an example of criminalisation of politics and extortion with vindictiveness against the BJP and its party workers,” he said. Recalling his visit to Maharashtra in 2019 at the legislative polls, Shah said, “I myself had a talk with Shiv Sena and we fought the elections under Devendra Fadnavis leadership and it was decided that he would be the CM. Shiv Sena has compromised with Hindutva and reached out to its two-decade old opponents for power. Both myself and PM Modi had said that Fadnavis will be the CM of Maharashtra, but as you (Thackeray) wanted to become the CM you committed treachery against us.” Earlier , Shah after formally inaugurating the statues of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj inside the PMC campus came down heavily on the Congress accusing the party of insulting Dr Ambedkar. “The Congress party did not leave any opportunity to insult Dr Ambedkar and it ensured that he did not reach the parliament. He got ‘ Bharat Ratna’ award when there was a non-Congress party in power. Constitution Day was not celebrated as the Congress feared that Dr Ambedkar’s ideal would come before the citizens of the country. We in the BJP under PM Narendra Modi started celebrating Constitution Day and when Modi celebrates the day, the Congress boycotts it. It is the same Congress which talks about Dr Ambedkar . BJP wants to take Dr Ambedkar before the nation and don’t fear the Congress. PM Narendra Modi is running the country’s affairs regarding the constitution as a sacred text for governance,” he said. The home minister further said thatDr Ambedkar played a key role in the formation of Indian Constitution as he was the Chairman of the drafting commission wherein he brought all oppressed classes including dalits and adivasis on one platform for their empowerment.

Shah, speaking at the Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of cooperative Management (VAMNICOM) Pune, on the occasion of the convocation ceremony on Sunday, said, “Now everyone wants to eat organic food. Many farmers have also adopted the method of organic farming, but they are not getting appropriate rates in return for their organic products, because there is no system certification. Through this department we have decided to establish a globally valid certification system for land and products so that a market chain for these products can be created.” Shah said that reforms such as amendments in the multi-state cooperative act, computerisation of Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), and coordination of pending policies for the cooperative sector have been planned. “First of all, we want to remove loopholes in the multi-state cooperative act by making amendments. Second, the computerisation of PACS, which are the soul of the cooperative sector, has to be done. There is a plan to create a transparent agriculture finance chain by connecting PACS to Nabard through district and state cooperative banks,” said Shah. He also announced the establishment of a national university with courses on cooperative training and formation of a special cooperative plan for the next 25 years. “We have decided that to expand the reach of the cooperative sector a policy will be framed which can be implemented for the next 25 years. We have started this work and soon it will be put before the country. Very soon, we’ll establish a university for courses on cooperative training, with its colleges in different locations across the country,” said Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/globally-valid-certificates-for-organic-products-part-of-coop-reforms-amit-shah-101639936404513.html
19-12-2021||Lucknow||BJP, SP two sides of the same coin: BSP leader SC Mishra||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary has alleged that there is an underhand deal between the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) to create communal tension in Uttar Pradesh before the assembly election to serve their vested political interests. Addressing a public meeting in Mohanlalganj assembly segment of Lucknow on Sunday, Mishra alleged, “Before the 2017 assembly election, the BJP and SP leaders planned communal violence in UP to polarise voters for political gains. Again, they are working on the same polarisation plan.” “However, voters have understood their tricks. They know that the BJP and the SP are two sides of the same coins,” he claimed. “In 2003, when Mayawati was the chief minister of UP, BJP leaders played an important role in toppling the BSP government and ensuring formation of the SP government with the defection of 37 BSP MLAs. The Congress had extended support to the SP government,” he further alleged. “The BSP government (2007-12) launched several development projects in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP leaders are now claiming those projects as their own. The foundation of Ganga Expressway project was laid by the BSP chief Mayawati. The BJP and SP leaders moved a petition in the court to stop the project,” Mishra claimed.“Jewar international airport project was also launched under the BSP government. Now before the assembly election, the foundation of the airport is laid. The BJP government is launching the projects before the assembly election whereas BSP chief Mayawati launched a number of development projects soon after forming the government in 2007,” the BSP leader claimed. “The development projects were launched in 29,000 Ambedkar villages. Several educational institutions were launched. Besides, medical colleges and hospitals were opened,” he said.“Under the SP rule, there was spurt in the cases of loot, murder, dacoity, rape, kidnapping, communal violence as mafia and goondas were active. People have got no respite under the BJP government as well. There is spurt in the crime cases and women are not safe. The members of Brahmin community are being targeted and around 500 people belonging to Brahmin community have been killed,” Mishra alleged. “In 2017, people were misguided with the promises made by the BJP but the BJP government failed to fulfil the aspirations of the people. There has been an increase in unemployment. The BJP government had promised two crore jobs. Instead, the youth are being lathi-charged. The question papers of the tests held for various recruitment examinations were leaked. Teachers working in unaided schools were suppressed when they demanded regularisation. Farmers and bank employees are being harassed,” he further alleged.“Bahujan Samaj Party leaders and workers should motivate their family members to campaign for the party. We are big Bahujan family. My wife, son and son-in-law are campaigning for the party. However, they will not contest election. They are coordinating with me in electioneering,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-sp-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-bsp-leader-sc-mishra-101639936167016.html
19-12-2021||Pune||Goal is to have mobile forensic science lab in every district: Amit Shah||PUNE Union home minister Amit Shah, on Sunday, emphasised the need to expand the capacity for forensic science in the country. The Union minister said that every state should set up a dedicated college for forensic science and affiliate such institutions with the National Forensic Science University in New Delhi and Gandhinagar. Shah said that with more trained manpower, the number of forensic science laboratories must increase in the country. “If we want to control crime, it is not possible till criminals are punished. The work of awarding punishment to criminals will take place when we have a place for scientific evidence in the process of investigation and prosecution. These things are not possible unless we have a chain of forensic science laboratories in the country,” said Shah who is also minister for cooperatives, while speaking at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory at Talegaon in Pune district, where he inaugurated a new campus of the facility on Sunday. Shah insisted on increasing expert manpower in forensic science. “Once there is at least one college in every state for forensic science, there will be no dearth of expert manpower required for forensic science laboratories, as people who step out from these colleges will fulfill the requirement,” he said.He explained how with more manpower the number of forensic science laboratories can be increased in the country. “With more manpower, we could set up more forensic science laboratories in the country at state and district levels, which will cover police stations. If we do this in the next five to six years, we could bring about a legal transformation in the country and we could make forensic science mobile facilities available for cases with the provision of a punishment of six years and above,” Shah said. The Central forensic science laboratory in Pune was established in 2013 and caters to the needs of central and state agencies. It has 11 divisions and four more divisions are under development. Since its inception, the laboratory has received 1,725 cases so far. Amit Shah said that several internal security challenges before the country can also be controlled with the help of forensic science laboratories and the conviction rate can also be increased. Shah lunches with NDRF jawans Amit Shah visited a unit of the National Disaster Response Force on Sunday, where he interacted with NDRF personnel and had lunch with the jawans. Addressing a joint event on the NDRF campus in Talegaon, Shah lauded the force’s work during natural disasters like floods, cyclones, and building collapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/goal-is-to-have-mobile-forensic-science-lab-in-every-district-amit-shah-101639936163948.html

19-12-2021||Pune||Costs of Christmas decorations head north||PUNE It’s a good thing that consumers are in a mood to spend heading into the holiday season. They may have to dish out more for a new Christmas tree or decorations.For many of the Christian and cosmopolitan homes, putting up the Christmas tree is a lot of fun, especially days the days leading upto Christmas, and shopping for decorations brings in a lot of camaraderie among family. However, for the past two years, thanks to the pandemic, families have been celebrating Christmas within the confines of their homes.While some consumers are in a mood to spend, others are not ready to dish out high prices for decor. On MG road one can see beautifully glazed coloured balls peeking out of the red festoons, a baby Jesus along with the crib smiling through while the three wise men look back from their plastic cover in a box. Furtados, D’ Mellos and Raves usually have their hands full with their shops overflowing with Christmas paraphernalia, this year too, their shops have stars, Santa caps and glittering reindeers but fewer people.“Most of the regulars tend to come early to pick up the best of the lot. In the past two years, there is not enough foreign stock coming in, and we have limited stock. With transportation cost also high, we are paying four times more. Hence a four feet Christmas tree will cost you ₹5,450 and above. Although we have decorations starting from ₹20 to ₹300, even local handmade decorations have increased their prices,” said Salvius Roy, of Raves.Some are also using heirloom decorations that have been in the family for generations. “We have lot of heirloom decorations that are used to decorate the Christmas tree but we also add new ornaments and every year. This year too we bought a few, but they are expensive and almost spent around ₹15,000 for some of best imported decorations. I buy my decorations from Raves, who is based out of Chennai but puts up a store on MG road and brings a lot of foreign stuff,” said Hycinth Arya, a Pune resident.Gloria Furtado, of Furtado’s said, “Usually, we have lot of people coming in to shop for some authentic locally made products, but this year it has been slow. Closer to Christmas, almost everything is sold out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/costs-of-christmas-decorations-head-north-101639935265010.html

From students to people who have newly moved to the city avail this service as it helps manage their expenses.Swapnil Padhatare, who has an auto spare part shop on SB road says, I have five bikes and five non-geared vehicles available for rent. We buy second hand bikes, repair them and then rent it out on a daily basis. During the lockdown, the footfall was low, but the rental service is popular among college students.”Padhatare said that all the paper work from regional transport office is done before vehicle is made available for rent. When one hires a bike for rent, a xerox copy of the identity card is kept with shop owner. A declaration form is also filled. “There is no standard rent fixed for renting a bike, it is decided by respective owners. Some people take rented bike as per kilometres while few take rent on full day basis,”added Padhatare.“I rent bike on weekends since we plan to roam around the city or visit places like Lonavala. I pay ₹300 for a day,” said Sagar Khiwsara,a resident from Baner.Nitin Pawar, general secretary of Rickshaw Panchayat said, “Even after so many complaints no action has been taken against companies and shop keepers who provides such service (bike on rent). All rules are applicable for auto rickshaw owners, while these people are running their vehicles illegally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/from-daily-commute-to-long-rides-bike-rental-in-pune-is-in-demand-101639935143495.html
19-12-2021||Pune||Bike-taxi, renting two-wheeler illegal: Pune RTO||PUNE Next time you plan to book a bike-taxi in the city, think twice. This is because, such services are illegal according to the Regional Transport Office (RTO) Pune.The Pune RTO has warned against the use of two-wheelers as a commercial transport mode for the commute of passengers. In a statement issued, RTO Pune, has called such transport service not in adherence with the state transport policy.The warning from RTO comes after many bike rental services which include popular transport apps have become operational in the city. As the traffic menace in Pune has been increasing, the idea of hiring a two-wheeler for a few days or as a taxi service for commuting instead of renting a cab, is slowly gaining ground among citizens.“If bike taxis registered under private category are used for renting purposes, then it violates the license and registration rules. While using such a service, passengers will not get any benefits such as insurance compensation after an accident. Companies are functioning through websites or apps. Drivers providing such services are violating transport and road safety norms like not wearing helmets,” said Sanjay Sasane, deputy RTO Pune.According to officials many youngsters are indulging in such business. “We need to make people aware of this. An organisation working for road safety brought this to our notice. For easy money, youngsters are getting involved in this business. No operator has been authorised to rent the two-wheelers. If such transactions are taking place, then it should be reported,” said Sasane.The pattern of a two-wheeler renting service differs with providers. Some offer two-wheeler on rent on a per day/week basis. While some platforms have offered taxi-like services for the passengers.“In Pune one cannot function without a two-wheeler. Locals own them but what about city visitors who have to live here only for a while ? For such people renting a bike for a day or using its pick-up and drop facility is a good option. Unless the condition of public transport improves in the cities, the need for private vehicles will persist,” said Chinmay Joshi, who visits Pune frequently.Citizens also raised an issue about identification of such practices. “How will officials identify if anyone has rented the vehicle or not? In day-to-day city traffic it is very difficult to pursue. Also, road safety is important. Everyone has to follow the rules. But such warnings won’t help if there is no proper reinforcement,” said Dhanashree Bhagat, an IT professional.The operators who offer such service remained unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/biketaxi-renting-two-wheeler-illegal-pune-rto-101639934963765.html

19-12-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka connects with women in Rae Bareli||Lucknow: A day after holding a 6-km foot march with her brother Rahul Gandhi to begin efforts to reclaim Amethi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reached Rae Bareli on Sunday to connect with the people there and launch her party’s ‘Shakti Samvad’ mega campaign to bring them to Congress fold ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. After Rahul Gandhi lost Amethi to union minister Smriti Irani in 2019, the BJP has been making consistent efforts to make deep inroads in Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha seat of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Both Amethi and Rae Bareli were considered to be Congress’ bastions till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “We are half of the population, yet political parties are not taking women seriously… Congress’s initiative of empowering the women has awakened the political parties now. Asha Bahu’s honorarium has been raised and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to hold an all-women meeting,” said Priyanka while addressing women at ‘Shakti Samvad’ interaction at the Town Hall in Rae Bareli on Sunday. She called upon women to rise and fight for themselves. “I will fight with you. Change is yet to come…We will bring the change together. Don’t vote for those who do not empower women,” she said. Priyanka heard women’s issues, listed promises that the Congress has made in the women manifesto and said the party, if voted to power, would bring about a legislation for action against police officers who failed to register an FIR in cases of rape within 10 days of the incident. She began her address referring to the Unnao and Hathras incidents of crime against women and said women were at the receiving end everywhere. There was need to bring about a change in the state, she said, calling upon on the women to vote the Congress to power to empower them in the state. Priyanka’s visit to Rae Bareli assumes significance as the party that won two out of the five assembly seats of Rae Bareli in 2017 assembly elections has no legislator from this area now. Rae Bareli MLA Aditi Singh has joined the BJP while another party MLA Rakesh Singh, who won from Harchandpur assembly seat, also owes allegiance to the BJP. After wresting the Amethi from the Congress, the BJP is making consistent efforts to make deep inroads into the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency. Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Avnish Tyagi said it was too late for the Congress. “It’s too late. If the Congress had cared for the people, its position would have been much better,” he said.

The third accused in the case is Anurag Bhatia,chief executive officer at Minance Technology Private Limited, according to the order issued by the court of Additional Sessions Judge KP Nandedkar. The case against the three are under Sections 406, 420, and 34 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Sections 3 and 4 of Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID), 1999.“When the case came to me, 50 days of investigation was already done. I was on leave when it happened. By the time I got the case status, the public prosecutor told me that a bail application has been approved. We have filed for addition of Section 409 of IPC,” said the investigating officer who did not wish to be named.The current in-charge of the police station, senior police inspector Vinayak Vetal, took charge of the station on the day when the order was passed and has been detailed on bandobast for Home Minister Amit Shah’s city visit, said officials.The complaint was lodged in December 2020 at Koregaon Park police station. Singh and Basu were arrested on October 7, 2021 after which they spent 12 days in police custody and have been in Yerawada central jail ever since, said officials. “Both my clients were roped in by the third and main accused Anurag Bhatia who was, at the time, in custody of Rajasthan police for a similar case registered in Jaipur. My clients were both cooperating with the police for a year after the case was registered as they had also been wrongfully involved in this,” said Advocate Pratik Rajopadhye who is representing the accused along with Advocate Ashish Patankar.The chargesheet in the case had to be registered on or before December 6 as the cases which carry less than seven years sentence upon conviction require chargesheet to be filed within 60 days of case registration. As that was not done, the defence lawyers filed for default bail on December 13. On December 15, the investigating officer filed for addition of Section 409 of IPC, which could have consequently given the officer more time to file the chargesheet.“Unfortunately, this application was registered and produced before this court on December 13 at 4:03pm and admittedly, the cahrgesheet is not filed in the court by this time also. Thus, I find that investigating officer cannot take the benefit of the report today in the court while passing this order and find that section 409 of IPC cannot be made applicable to this application,” read the order by Judge Nandedkar.The complainant in the case has invested ₹6,08,94,000 in the company of the accused identified as Minance Technology Private Limited. While the police failed to arrest Bhatia, the absent chargesheet also helped the two other accused to get bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-get-default-bail-in-mpid-as-pune-police-fail-to-register-chargesheet-within-60-days-101639933883944.html

19-12-2021||Patna||Manjhi’s ‘disparaging’ comment against communities create furore||A day after kicking up a storm by making disparaging remarks against Brahmins, former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) president Jitan Ram Manjhi on Sunday backtracked that the comments were directed towards his community—the Dalits—and not the Brahmins.Reacting sharply to Manjhi’s comments, All India Congress Committee (AICC) media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said that the HAM chief must offer a public apology for his outrageous remarks against Brahmins. “Manjhi’s clarification is also not justified. Where and how did he get the authority to revile the Dalits? Like any other castes, Brahmins and Dalits enjoyed a strong relationship since time immemorial. Hindu community has been idolising and worshipping even Dalits, be it Sabri or Rishi Valmiki, etc,” added.Mishra also questioned the silence of leaders of the ruling coalition, of which HAM is a part, on the issue and demanded a case should be lodged against the former CM.Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan too flayed Manjhi, saying that remarks against a particular community or the religious tradition were unacceptable. “He (Manjhi) may not have faith in the religion, but he does not have the authority to rebuke any community,” said Paswan.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) senior Shivanand Tiwari, however, defended Manjhi saying that his reaction might have been triggered by the injustice and atrocities meted out to the Dalits by the upper castes in the state or elsewhere in the country.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman Sanjay Tiger said that Manjhi should not make such demeaning comments against any community.Senior Congress leader and former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh said that chief minister Nitish Kumar had the habit of making others speak his mind. “Had he (the CM) been concerned about Manjhi’s reaction, he would have reacted by now,” said Singh.At a meeting of Bhuiyan community meeting at Kalidas Rangalaya on Saturday, Manjhi reportedly abused the Brahmin community saying that they have made the Dalits forget to pray to their community’s gods and follow the Hindus’ worship system instead. He also said that he did not believe in Lord Ram, who was an imaginary character. On Sunday, Manjhi clarified that he had rebuked his community members for forgetting their gods and falling back on those who conduct religious functions for the Dalits but don’t take food at their houses. He said he does not believe in the caste or varna system, which was evolved to destroy society..

19-12-2021||Patna||Sugar mills announce hike in SAP of sugarcane across varieties in Bihar||Sugar mills in Bihar have hiked the state agreed price (SAP) on all sugarcane varieties by ₹13 to ₹20 as compared to the last year’s procurement rates, officials said.The new price was declared by the Bihar Sugar Mills Association (BSMA) after a meeting with state sugarcane industries minister Pramod Kumar, departmental secretary N Saravana Kumar and other senior officers recently. In lieu of it, the state government has assured to arrange soft loans to the mills to bear the loss on purchase of sugarcane due to decline in selling price of sugar and allow them to bargain the selling price of molasses with buyers.Till now, sugar mills are compelled to sell molasses at ₹336/quintal, as fixed by the government, even as the byproduct of sugarcane is being sold at double the rate in other states.Association secretary Naresh Bhatt said that the farmers would be paid ₹335 per quintal on good variety sugarcane, ₹315 for general variety, and ₹285 for per quintal of low-quality sugarcane at the mills for the current crushing season. “The cost of high and general varieties of sugarcane is ₹20 per quintal higher than last season and ₹13 more in case of the lower quality sugarcane, despite losses incurred by mill owners in the last fiscal,” the BSMA secretary added.The SAP of sugarcane, however, will be ₹20 less per quintal, if farmers sell their produce at procurement centres located far from the sugar mills across different varieties.In a statement issued on Sunday, the association said that the state government had agreed to arrange soft loans from the nationalized banks for a period of six years from the coming fiscal and pay the interest on the loan amount to compensate the loss due to decline in sugar price. “The selling price of sugar has come down by ₹250 per quintal in the past one month. This would make the millers to bear an extra loss of ₹25/quintal in payment of revised SAP to farmers,” said Bhatt.The association claimed that the state government has agreed to relax the excise policy norms that let the former fix the selling price of molasses and allow the millers to sell the byproducts on the mutually agreed prices between them and the purchaser. Molasses are used in making ethanol, which is mixed and used in fossil fuel for automobiles.“Sugar mills would inform about the quantity of molasses produced by them and the selling cost agreed by the purchasers for raising the goods and services tax (GST) receipt and issuance of movement permits,” Bhatt added.Sugarcane department secretary N Saravana Kumar said the government had agreed to look into their demands for the soft loan in the next fiscal, as the state was undergoing a financial crunch owing to the Covid pandemic. “Sugar mills were arranged soft-loans earlier as well to offset the losses in payment of SAP to farmers,” said Kumar.Farmers to benefit from hike in sugarcane SAP: 5 lakhRevised SAP of good variety of sugarcane: ₹335/quintalDifference of SAP vis-à-vis last year: ₹13-20/quintalTotal sugarcane crushed last season: 458.01 lakh toneQuantity of sugar produced last season: 47.47 lakh tonne
19-12-2021||Pune||Jagannath Shetty, owner of iconic Vaishali restaurant in Pune passes away||PUNE Jagannath B Shetty (89), a renowned restaurateur from Pune, who established Vaishali, Roopali and Amrapali, passed away early Sunday morning.He was undergoing medical treatment at Prayag hospital. He is survived by his daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren.For many, the Vaishali restaurant on Fergusson College (FC) road has not just been an iconic Udupi joint but synonymous with the unique Puneri spirit since 1949. To the regular visitors, the warmth and taste Vaishali offered stayed forever. And the man who started it had a humble beginning.Shetty came to Pune around 58 years ago to join his maternal uncle Shridhar Shetty in his hotel business.Born on October 8, 1932, at Onimajali Mane in Ballur near Karkalla, Shetty came to work in Kalyan with his uncle to work for ₹3 per month when he was 13 years. Later at age of 17, he came to Pune in 1949 and started Cafe Madras (present-day Roopali) in 1951, which was followed by Madras health home, now the iconic Vaishali.Soon the restaurant became a household name and the go-to restaurant because of the quality of south Indian snacks.“For countless Punekars like me, Vaishali (and Roopali) is a lot more than just another restaurant. A bit difficult to describe the emotions associated with this place by many Punekars, across generations. Pune will always be thankful to Jagannath Shetty,” said Amit Paranjape, an entrepreneur and regular at these restaurants.The restaurant received the cleanest kitchen award from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and Tridal, a cultural organisation in Pune awarded Shetty the “Punya Bhushan award.”Ashok Gadgil, a resident, on the website of Vaishali has also mentioned that in the 1960s cup of tea was 10 paise in Vaishali and 15 paise in Roopali. Both hotels had a ‘katta’ to sit outside. “We used to sit outside till we felt hungry in the evening.”The fan club of Vaishali isn’t limited to residents from nearby areas but it included prominent personalities like Sharad Pawar, Raj Thackeray, and many from the film industry.According to the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP’s) Ankush Kakade, Sharad Pawar was a big fan of hotel Vaishali and during many public speeches have mentioned the restaurant.“While I was studying in Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), we would go to Vaishali. It brought many friends together and we enjoyed the coffee and snacks,” he said.Kakade’s recent memories are that of sharing a table with municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, police commissioner, Amitabh Gupta, on the morning of the Ganapati visarjan in September 2021 and enjoying the food.“It is true that I had heard a lot about Vaishali and I had not been there. One morning of the visarjan day, I went there along with Vikram Kumar and others and ordered everything on the menu as I wanted to try them all, which I did. I particularly liked the cutlets, Rava dosa and the filter coffee,” said Gupta.Although the restaurant is often buzzing with customers, Shetty was known to be reticent. “Many celebrities and public figures come to Vaishali. However, I normally avoid talking to them,” Shetty had said during a felicitation event in 2013 when he turned 80. The event was organised by leaders of all political parties.In Pune, Shetty found another home though he had not forgotten his native place. “He generously donated to his old school for development, and build the village Ganapathi temple,” said his son-in-law, Vishwajeet Jadhav.He was also an ardent golfer and has captained Poona Golf Club in the year 1997-98, and also started an annual “Vaishali Cup” for amateurs.“We all have lost a doyen of our hospitality industry. Jaganath Shetty of Vaishali restaurant was undoubtedly a successful businessman who set high standards in the hotel industry. Jagannath can rightfully claim to introduce South Indian cuisine to Punekars across many generations. He was also a great human being. He was forefront in donating a large part of his wealth to enumerable social causes,” Ganesh Shetty, President Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jagannath-shetty-owner-of-iconic-vaishali-restaurant-in-pune-passes-away-101639929143418.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Kejriwal accepts Sidhu’s challenge, fields Mann for debate||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday accepted the challenge given by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for a debate on liquor, mining and jobs in the state. Asking Sidhu to fix the place and time for the debate, Kejriwal nominated AAP’s Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann for it, stating that the choice made more sense as even Sidhu is the state chief of Congress in Punjab. “I accept Sidhu’s challenge for a debate and hope that the discussion is fruitful and on the various issues of development. Sidhu should choose the place and time,” Kejriwal, who is also the Delhi chief minister, told journalists at the Chandigarh airport. The AAP supremo said the Congress had five years to develop Punjab, but they betrayed the people and did nothing except “drama and excuses”. Expressing grief over the sacrilege incident at Golden Temple in Amritsar, Kejriwal said the incident could be part of a conspiracy. “Some wrong forces are plotting to spoil the peace and tranquillity of Punjab,” he alleged, blaming the Congress government for the incident. He said that if the culprits of the previous sacrilege cases had been punished severely, then no person would have dared to commit such a crime again. “I hope that the police will catch those who sent the criminal to Sri Harmandir Sahib for sacrilege at the earliest and punish all the conspirators behind it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-kejriwal-accepts-sidhu-s-challenge-fields-mann-for-debate-101639928123270.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Hang those guilty of sacrilege, says Navjot Sidhu||Alleging that some fundamentalist forces are trying to disturb peace in Punjab, state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu advocated capital punishment for all those accused of desecrating any religious text, while addressing a rally at Malerkotla on Sunday.“We need to establish a voice of unity. The fundamentalist forces are disturbing our unity. However, whenever one religion is projected as higher and the other lower across the nation, Punjab always stands against it. All people are equal in Punjab. If there is any incident of sacrilege, whether it is of Guru Granth Sahib, Gita or Quran, the guilty should be hanged,” said Sidhu. Also read: Man lynched over sacrilege at Golden TempleAccompanied by local MLA and cabinet minister Razia Sultana and her husband and former DGP Mohammad Mustafa, the Congress leader said that there was a “conspiracy to eradicate a community”, and Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims should show unity to defeat such forces.Protesters disrupt speechEarlier, when Sidhu was about to start his address, Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC) members and protesting aspiring teachers started raising slogans, but were removed by police. They were demanding reserved land for the SC community and jobs, respectively. Even anganwadi workers, accredited social health activists and other contractual workers staged protests outside the venue, seeking regularisation and fulfilment of other demands.
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM dares opposition to prove sand is being sold at higher rates||Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday asked his political opponents to put video evidence in public domain to prove that sand was being sold above the rates fixed by the Punjab government.Addressing a political rally at the Zira assembly segment in Ferozepur district, Channi hit out at the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aap Aadmi Party (AAP) for allegedly lying about various government initiatives. “The Punjab government has offered a cash reward of ₹25,000 to anyone proving that sand is being sold for more than ₹5.5 per cubic feet. I challenge the AAP and (SAD president) Sukhbir Badal to prove it and we will pay them the reward as well,” said Channi.The CM also laid the foundation stones of development and infrastructure projects worth ₹87 crore, including that of a civil hospital, administrative complex, bus stand and an ITI to be named after late Inderjit Singh Zira. Following a demand by local Congress MLA Kulbir Singh Zira, Channi also allocated ₹1 crore for a stadium at Zira town.Targeting the AAP, the CM said its Delhi-centric leadership has failed to maintain the confidence of legislators and parliamentarians elected from Punjab. “Most of them left the party as AAP leadership has no understanding of needs and aspirations of Punjabis. People of Punjab do not want the rule of a party controlled by politicians from outside,” he said.‘SAD should forget about returning to power’The CM also addressed a public rally at Patti in Tarn Taran, besides inaugurating a number of projects, including the construction of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Law University, District Education and Training Institution and Dr BR Ambedkar Public Park. Channi said that as long as the SAD remains under the control of Badals and Majithia, it should forget about coming back to power. “The people of Punjab have not forgotten the misdeeds of Badals even today,” he said, during the rally organised by local MLA Harminder Singh Gill.The CM also announced ₹10 crore for the development of villages in Patti constituency, ₹5 crore for the development of Patti city and ₹2 crore for the overall development of Kairon village. He also announced that a bronze statue of former CM Partap Singh Kairon would be erected at a cost of about ₹25 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-dares-opposition-to-prove-sand-being-sold-at-higher-rates-101639926323023.html

He said if the AAP is voted to power in the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (Chandigarh MC) polls, it will ease municipality-related works by making government officials come to the residences of the citizens.“For every municipality work, people spend money and take leaves from offices due to long queues. If AAP comes to power, municipality officials will come to your residences for work, like in Delhi,” he told the gathering.The Delhi chief minister also said the AAP will remove the mountain of garbage dumps in Daddu Majra Colony and make sure that Chandigarh becomes the most beautiful city in all of Asia once again.Explaining his point, he said such a garbage dump exists in the national capital as well since the Delhi civic bodies are under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“In the upcoming Delhi civic polls in April, the municipal corporations will come back to [the] AAP. Following that, we will get the garbage dumps in Delhi, as well as Chandigarh, removed,” Kejriwal told the crowd.Also Read | Channi, Kejriwal start campaign to reach out to Punjab voters via mobile phonesAs his third promise, Kejriwal said his party will ensure that not a single penny is spent on water bills by Chandigarh's citizens. “Water and electricity are free in Delhi. Chandigarh will also get free water,” he added.The AAP chief said at the moment, the Chandigarh MC cannot do any work for the housing societies of the city. However, if his party is elected to power, all work related to the cleanliness and maintenance, among others, of the city's housing societies will be done by the corporation.For his fifth and final promise, Kejriwal said that if the AAP is voted to power in the Chandigarh MC elections, it will install multiple CCTV cameras across the city for the safety and security of women.“In Delhi, we have installed double the number of CCTV cameras present in London and New York,” the Delhi CM told the gathering.Kejriwal also asked the citizens of Chandigarh not to vote for him if their friends and relatives living in Delhi say that the AAP government has worked for the people of the national capital.Also Read | Chandigarh MC polls: December 22-24 to be dry days“If they say the government hasn't worked, then do not vote for me,” Kejriwal noted, adding that he only knows how to work and not do politics.Saying that the AAP is a party defined by the youth of the country with most of its members below the age of 40, Kejriwal urged the youngsters of Chandigarh to come forward and join his party.The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation elections, which is being seen as a triangular contest with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and the AAP fielding their candidates, are scheduled to be held on December 24 from 7:30am to 5pm. The counting of votes will take place on December 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/free-water-no-garbage-kejriwal-s-5-promises-to-chandigarh-before-civic-poll-101639915726979.html

Apart from the 50 sites for the drive, the health department also constituted over 200 teams to carry out door-to-door vaccinations in 160 locations across the district. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that second dose of Sputnik V was available at polyclinic in Sector 31 where 100 people got their second jabs. “It was one-day drive aimed to cover the maximum possible population. We want to ensure that people who were not fully vaccinated should take their jabs at the earliest,” he said. “International travellers who are in Gurugram for education or business/job purposes can get inoculated at Sector 31’s polyclinic for their second dose of Covishield,” the CMO said. As part of the mega drive, in urban areas, three-member teams comprising accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers, auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) workers and data entry operators visited residential areas and waited in common spaces such as residents’ welfare association offices and community centres, where people came and got vaccinated, the officials said. In rural areas, the teams organised vaccination drive at chaupals and in centrally located buildings and open spaces. The officials said that all primary health centres in the district have conducted surveys at their levels to identify people who have still not taken the vaccine and teams are being formed accordingly. Dr Yadav said that each time they are conducting vaccination drive they share the information on social media platforms to inform people so that they can plan accordingly. “People should get their second dose as and when due and should not miss any drive or chance to get inoculated,” he said. The officials said they are also coordinating with resident welfare associations to ensure their residents are fully vaccinated. On Sunday, the department will conduct vaccinations at 44 sites for Covishield and four sites for Covaxin. Eleven new casesMeanwhile, Gurugram witnessed 11 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the caseload to 181,927 in the district so far. Now, the district has 99 active cases, of which 97 patients are in home isolation and two are hospitalised, the officials said. 
19-12-2021||Delhi||Drug prescriptions should be legible to avoid errors||New Delhi: A couple of years ago, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court imposed a penalty of ₹5,000 each on three doctors in three separate cases for illegible handwriting. Of course, the unreadable scrawls in question did not pertain to prescriptions given to patients, but to medico-legal reports pertaining to criminal cases and the judges were irked by the scribble and ordered that in future the reports be computer-generated. In case of prescriptions too, computer generated advisories are really the answer to indecipherable handwritings, but till such time that becomes a reality, consumers are dependent on pharmacists to give them what the doctor ordered and this puts a tremendous responsibility on chemists to ensure that they correctly decipher, not only the name of the medicine, but also its strength and any other details that the prescription may contain. A consumer recently complained about how he had an adverse reaction to a drug. On checking with the doctor, he realized that instead of the single active ingredient drug prescribed , the chemist had given a combination drug with two active ingredients. Since the brand name was the same for both, with an alphabet added as a suffix to indicate the additional drug, the consumer remained unaware of it. Such substitutions by the pharmacist, whether deliberate or by oversight, can turn out to be costly for the consumer. Conversely, ignoring those suffixes would also not augur well for the patient.Besides different strengths or potency, some of the drugs also vary in terms of how they are released, indicated by suffixes such as SR (sustained release), PR ( prolonged release) and so on. Since consumers are not aware of these , they are dependent on the chemist to give them the right medication. Similarly, there may be tablets meant for sublingual administration (to be taken by placing it under your tongue) rather than the usual gastrointestinal route by swallowing with water. A reader recently told me that the chemist changed her prescription of vitamin B12 and gave her sublingual B12 tablets, without informing her. She did not even know about sublingual pills. Since this was such a crucial information, the chemist ought to have informed her. Failure to do so was negligence.Even more serious are cases of dispensation of an entirely different medication than the one advised by the doctor, leading to very serious consequences for the patient-- many such cases have come up before the consumer courts. In Ashok Kumar Vs M/S Kumar Brothers(Chemists) Private Ltd, for example, dating back to 2017, the consumer was prescribed , among others, Metolar XR 50 mg. The chemist gave Gluformin XL 500 mg, a drug meant for diabetes. Consumption of the drug led to the consumer being admitted to a hospital in a serious condition. On learning that his ill health was the result of the wrong medication sold by the chemist, Kumar sought compensation for the suffering caused to him. The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, UT Chandigarh, directed the chemist to pay ₹50,000 as compensation and ₹10,000 as costs. ( CC No CC/281/2018, decided on October 23, 2018 ) While in some cases, sheer negligence on the part of the chemist leads to such medication errors, in some others, similar sounding names could be the cause. Hence the doctor’s diagnosis noted along with the prescription plays an extremely important role in the patient buying the right medication.In Mohammad Ali Purkait Vs Manager, Frank Ross Pharmacy, the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Baruipur, Kolkata, directed the pharmacy to pay only ₹5,000 as compensation for dispensing Concor-AM 2.5 instead of Concova-M prescribed by the doctor. One of the reasons for the poor compensation was that the doctor had not mentioned the diagnosis, which could have helped the pharmacist decipher the totally illegible prescription(Complaint No 07 of 2017, decided on March 30, 2021). So while chemists have a duty to sell only what is advised by the doctor, medical practitioners also have to abide by the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations that mandate that “every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters”. That would not only reduce medication errors, but also help consumers choose a generic drug at a much lower cost or even a cheaper brand.
19-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram multi-crore heist: Arrest warrant issued against suspended DCP||A local court on Thursday issued an arrest warrant against suspended deputy commissioner of police Dheeraj Setia for his alleged involvement in a multi-crore heist that took place in a housing society in Sector 84 on August 4, officials in the know of the matter said on Saturday. The special task force (STF) has been conducting searches at his office, as Setia is still on the run, they said.According to the officials, additional sessions judge Jasbir Singh, while hearing an application filed by the STF on Thursday, issued an arrest warrant against Setia and also directed to “rearrest” assistant sub-inspector Vikas Gulia of the Delhi Police’s special cell, who was previously arrested on October 9 for allegedly helping gangster Vikas Lagarpuria suspected to have planned the theft of ₹40 crore.The STF on Friday arrested an associate of Lagarpuria.Deputy inspector general of STF Satheesh Balan said on Saturday, “We had moved the application before the court for his (Setia’s) arrest warrant.”Earlier, the STF reportedly found “concrete evidence” regarding Setia’s involvement in the case and booked him under Section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gulia was arrested by Gurugram police in October but was released on bail. Setia was posted in Gurugram as DCP (south) and was holding additional charge of DCP (crime) when the crime branch of Gurgaon police was probing the matter. During a recent bureaucratic reshuffle, the IPS officer was posted as superintendent of police, Kurukshetra. In the meantime, the case was handed over to STF of Haryana Police, which arrested two doctors -- allegedly the masterminds of the theft. In their disclosure statements, the doctors named Setia, who was served a notice on the directions of the Gurugram court.On December 10, Setia was suspended by the Haryana government after being asked to join investigation on the basis of a confessional statement made by one of the doctors identified as Sachender Jain Nawal, a leading paediatrician accused in the multi-crore theft case. Setia had allegedly taken around ₹3.5 crore from Nawal for settling the case. After his transfer to Kurukshetra as SP, Sethia allegedly returned the money after keeping around ₹20 lakh. Balan said on Saturday they had summoned Setia and jail superintendent Shamsher Dahiya, who is posted in Panchkula. “Dahiya joined the investigation whereas Setia is still incommunicado, following which the court has issued his arrest warrant,” he said. On August 20, an employee of the maintenance company went to collect cash from the office to deposit it in the bank when he realised that the cash was missing. After scanning CCTV footage, the company discovered that the money had been stolen. “We collected money from customers for the services rendered to them and kept them at the office. On August 20, we found that the money had been stolen,” said an official of the company asking not to be named. Initially, the amount stolen was assumed to be around ₹50 lakh.The police have so far arrested 16 people for their involvement in the case. 
19-12-2021||Kolkata||Of those languishing in West Bengal jails for years without trial||Almost after 43 years, Dipak Joshi, 70, would meet his mother, 90, at their village in Nepal once he is released from a West Bengal jail, where he was incarcerated without a trial for 41 years, and is handed over to the Nepal consulate. Doctors had told the court that he was mentally unfit to face the court proceedings. Finally, on December 7, the Calcutta high court ordered his release and awarded him compensation for being kept behind cars for so long.“He was arrested on May 12, 1980, on charges of murder. His trial, however, never took off as he was mentally unfit to face the proceedings,” said Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, a high court advocate. Joshi was arrested from Darjeeling in the 80s for allegedly killing a local after a brawl. In these 41 years, he was transferred from one prison to another before finally landing at the Dum Dum Central Correctional Home in Kolkata, locked up in a foreign country with no one to meet or see.In late 2020, the then Chief Justice of Calcutta high court, TBN Radhakrishnan, who was also the patron of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority, noticed his case while reviewing the cases which had not been taken up in the court in want of a lawyer. On the court’s direction, the district legal services authorities took up the matter and Joshi was sent for a mental health checkup in a state-run hospital.“The committee found that even though he was physically 70 years old, his mental health age was that of a nine-year-old. He could only speak in Nepali and none understood what he was saying. He was just eating and surviving. He had no family or relatives in India. He has family in Nepal, who knows he is languishing in jail,” said a high court lawyer who didn’t wish to be named.Chatterjee, who appeared on behalf of the State Legal Services Authority for Joshi, said the then Chief Justice started a suo moto proceeding and in less than two months Joshi was set free. “The Nepal Consulate was made a party to the case. It was found that Joshi’s 90-year-old mother was living in his native village in Nepal. One of his relatives, who came to India, was asked to sign a bond and Joshi was reunited with his family after four decades in March 2021,” said Chatterjee.As the family was extremely poor and stayed in a remote village in Nepal, Radhakrsihnan requested the advocate general to address the court on the issue of compensation since Joshi had suffered incarceration for more than four decades. The state government submitted an affidavit saying there was no scheme for compensating undertrial, who did not get justice, the court decided to give compensation of ₹five lakh, which is granted to a family undertrial, who dies in jail. “The court ordered (on December 7) that compensation can be paid to Joshi through Nepal consulate,” the lawyer said.More like himJoshi is just one of the 103 undertrials still languishing in West Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar Islands jails without trial as they are not mentally fit to face court proceedings, according to the state legal services authority. And almost all of them come from a very poor economic background and many have been forgotten by their family in absence of financial resources to fight their case. Some are eagerly awaited by their family members. Andaman and Nicobar Islands come under the jurisdiction of the Calcutta high court.One of them, Asim Kumar Roy, 50 was arrested in December 2011 on charges of murdering a domestic help at Haringhata in Nadia. He is presently lodged in the Dum Dim Central Correctional Home in the northern fringes of Kolkata and is awaiting trial as a doctor from government-run hospitals said he was mentally weak and may not be able to bear the court trauma. “He was the youngest of the siblings. We really don’t know why he murdered the woman. We heard a thud and came running out of the room. The woman was lying on road and my brother was standing there. I ran to the police station to inform the cops. They came and took him away. Since then he is in jail. The doctors are yet to give him a fit certificate and that’s why the trial hasn’t started,” said Alok Kumar Roy, Asim Kumar Roy’s brother.All these years, Roy’s elder sister used to meet him in jail. After her death due to cancer in 2020, his elder brother Alok meets him. Asim has not been informed that his sister has died. He still knows that his sister is suffering from cancer and is critically ill. His father died the same year he was arrested.“Every time I meet him he cries. He begs me to get him out of the jail saying he can’t take it any longer and is not keeping well. He has started limping as he is having a pain in his leg. I can’t even see him properly as there are two mesh-wire walls between us with a gap of at least five feet in between. We both have to shout and speak as our voices get drowned. We have already spent more than one lakh rupees on lawyers’ fees all these years. We are still trying to bring him out,” he said.But, there are some like Biswanath Chatterjee, whose family appears to be losing interest in pursuing his case. Chatterjee, another under-trial lodged in Dum Dum central jail, was arrested in August 1992 on charges of murder. His case is pending before the district court in Bankura. In April, he was declared ‘not fit’ for trial by the medical board of Calcutta Pavlov Hospital.In records, his family is not traceable, said a jail official, adding that nobody has come to meet him for years. The official added that there are some of these mentally unfit undertrials who have not seen a visitor for years now. “The family loses interest as the trial cannot start because of their mental health condition,” he said. The case of Bankim Chakraborty, 70, who was arrested in connection with a dowry death of his daughter-in-law in 2017 at Haringhata in North 24 Parganas was arrested with his wife and two sons, is different. He was declared mentally unfit to face trial while trial started against his other family members. “I don’t know much about the case. Four of my family members are in jail. My father developed some mental problems. I have not met him for many days. The lawyer knows it,” said his youngest son Aparup Chakraborty. Lawyer Dipak Dey, whose number was provided by Aparup, said he was not aware of the case. When called again Aparup said he doesn’t want to talk about the case.“There are umpteen cases where a man’s family member and relative do not come and he continues to languish in jail. He can’t be freed. He has to stay in jail till the trial is completed,” said Raju Mukherjee, member secretary of the state legal services authority.Slow legal systemAccording to Prisoners Statistics of India, 2019, 7,394 inmates in Indian jails are suffering from mental health issues and 1.5% of them are undertrials in jails. Some studies in jails have indicated a higher number of prisoners suffering from mental health issues. A 2011 study published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry found that 23.8% of the 500 surveyed prisoners suffered from mental health issues.The Supreme Court in 2019 had recognised that every prisoner with mental illness has the right to live with dignity and asked jails to have counsellors for early detection of mental illness. In 1995, the apex court in the case of Sheela Barse vs the Union of India passed a direction for all high courts of India to institute a writ petition concerning the mental health of the under-trials and convicts. “But even after 25 years there were, however, no such writ petitions instituted in the Calcutta high court,” said a lawyer of the Calcutta high court, quoted above. Justice Radhakrishnan last year nominated Justice Shampa Sarkar as the judge to hear cases about the mental health of inmates of correctional homes. “The next date of hearing is on March 4, 2022,” said an advocate of the high court.The trial, however, does not start only if a government doctor certifies a person as mentally unfit. Raju Mukherjee said if a jail doctor suspects that an undertrial is mentally not fit, the court is informed. The court sets up a committee that gives a certificate – whether he or she is fit to face trial or unfit.Ganesh Prasad, superintendent of Calcutta Pavlov Hospital, said they examine a prisoner to find whether he or she is mentally fit to understand the proceedings and its ramifications in court against him. “We submit our report to court accordingly,” he said. Mukherjee said there are provisions in the law that if the court thinks then such an undertrial, who is mentally not stable to undergo trial, may also be freed. Unlike normal cases, in which a man is allowed to go out if he gets bail, in these cases a relative or a family member of the te undertrial has to come and sign a bond. Using that provision, Dipak Joshi was released and provided compensation on December 7.
19-12-2021||Delhi||Construction curbs likely to be eased in Delhi as air quality improves: Report||The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) is expected to give more relaxations to construction and demolition activities in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) in wake of the air quality index (AQI) improving over the last few days, an official told news agency PTI on Sunday.The CAQM on Friday stayed curbs on construction works across Delhi-NCR, allowing only the ones associated with healthcare, public utilities, railways, Metro, airports, national security, highways, roads, power transmission and defence, among others.The commission also permitted offline classes in schools to resume in a phased manner. Physical classes for students of Class 6 and above were allowed to reopen on Saturday, while the same for those up to Class 5, will resume on December 27.Classes have, however, been directed to be conducted in a hybrid nature with both online and offline teaching sessions.Notably, schools in the national capital were scheduled to reopen on November 29, but environment minister Gopal Rai announced on December 2 that they will remain shut till further orders owing to the sharp rise in Delhi's AQI.Delhi's air quality remained in the ‘poor’ category on Sunday with an overall AQI of 290, news agency ANI reported. However, as per the latest data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), several areas of the capital continue to have ‘very poor’ air quality. The AQI in Anand Vihar was at 328 at 3pm, in ITO at 308, in Mundka at 303, in Nehru Nagar at 317 and in Punjabi Bagh at 303, among others.According to CPCB, an AQI between zero and 50 falls in the ‘good’ category, between 51 and 100 in the ‘satisfactory’ category, between 101 and 200 in the ‘moderate’ category, between 201 and 300 in the ‘poor’ category, between 301 and 400 in the ‘very poor’ category, and between 401 and 500 in the ‘severe’ category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/construction-curbs-likely-to-be-eased-in-delhi-as-air-quality-improves-report-101639904617972.html
19-12-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh Gangsters bill to be tabled in winter session||Madhya Pradesh government will introduce MP Gangsters and Anti-social activities Prevention Bill 2021 this winter session of the legislative assembly, said home minister Narottam Mishra. Talking to HT, Mishra said Gangsters Bill will soon be approved by the cabinet and will be tabled in this winter session only and it will weed out mafias from Madhya Pradesh. The winter session is scheduled to be held from December 20 to 24. After Uttar Pradesh, MP will be the second state to have this bill. Recently, the MP cabinet also approved the prevention of damage of public and private property bill on Thursday. MP home department completed the draft which has a special provision of urging the court for custody of an accused up to two months, said an official of the home department. This bill will be implemented on organized criminals including mining mafia, land mafia, illicit liquor sellers, fake medicines sellers, human trafficking gangs, drug peddlers, adulteration in food products, illegal arms manufacturers and others. Police will invoke the bill in all the organized crimes which have more than two accused,” said the officer. “The bill will empower district collectors to inquire the matter of assets of the accused and if it is found disproportionate, they will have a right to seize it. The accused will have to prove the legal way of earning,” he added. The cases will be heard in a special court so that the hearing could be completed timely. There will also be provisions for the safety and security of eyewitnesses. Home department’s additional chief secretary Rajesh Rajora said, “The draft is being discussed and will be formalized soon.” Retired IPS officer Shailendra Shrivastava said, “This was not the first time when the provision of police remand for up to two months is going to be introduced. Earlier, it was introduced under Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA).” “This is a very necessary provision because it is very tough for police to interrogate hardcore criminals. According to law, as of now, there is a provision of maximum remand of 15 days but that is not enough to complete the interrogation,” he added. However, legal experts and human rights activists raised objections and said the act can be misused by the state government. Former advocate general Ravi Nandan Singh said, “What is the definition of a gangster and who will decide who is a gangster? There is a possibility that the act can be misused and stringent provisions like POTA and TADA will definitely upset the people of MP. It will also create problems for the government legally as how will they prove that the accused was a threat for humankind?”Human rights activist M Seema said, “MP government is copying UP in every law but they should understand that crime in MP is different than UP. I don’t know why the government need an extra law to control the crime. They should reinforce the existing law to stop mafias because these laws only violate human rights as we have seen in TADA and POTA. To keep a person in police custody just on the basis of suspicion that he is mafia will surely violate human rights.” The opposition leaders said this act is nothing but a copy of the UP government. “This act will prove the failure of the BJP-led state government in maintaining law and order in MP. Barring 15 months, BJP is leading the state and they allowed mafias to grow to such extent that now BJP-state government needs a separate law to deal with them, said PC Sharma, Congress MLA. However, BJP leaders said this law will bring peace to the state and will terrorise anti-social elements. “This law is against the anti-social elements, mafia and to maintain peace and harmony in the state, save the lives of people. The opposition leaders have made a habit to oppose everything without understanding the consequences and that’s why the Congress party is losing its trust among people,” said Rajneesh Agrawal, spokesperson, BJP.

19-12-2021||Lucknow||Quick border access for forces, integration of locals must: Ex-IRS officer||China’s expansionist moves can be tackled by a twin approach of quick access to the North and North-Eastern border for the Indian armed forces, and by an effort to integrate the people there with the nation, says author and wildlife-travel photographer Mahendra Singh.A true blue Lucknowite and the former La Martiniere College student’s recently released book Finding Shangri La – Visions of Ladakh and Spiti delves deep into myriad physical and cultural aspects of this unique corner of our country and provides a comprehensive picture of the land and its people. That he was able to document the region through photographs and well-researched text is not the interesting part, but that he was able to do it as a top serving Indian Revenue Service official. He retired from service a couple of months ago.“Of late, Chinese aggression has revived our border disputes with China and has thrust Ladakh and Spiti (also called the Little Tibet) into national focus. Like the Atal Tunnel at Rohtang that now permits all-weather movement, similar works are underway on the Srinagar-Leh segment to enable rapid access of the armed forces into Ladakh to face potential threats to our borders,” says Singh.Certain segments of the vast Tibetan Plateau fall within our national borders. Rudely forced into national consciousness on account of the Chinese aggression, the areas of Ladakh and Spiti remain strategically important.“With the adjoining areas turning volatile, the resident population of these border lands have become important collaborators in the defence of the territorial integrity of the nation. Better integration of the local people with the nation is, without a doubt, the need of the hour. Efforts at integrating the tradition-bound Ladakhi people with the general population must start with a thorough understanding of their existing environment and lifestyle,” says Singh, who has made numerous presentations for college students on Little Tibet.“These folk are mostly of the Tibetan genetic stock and adherents of the Tibetan culture in their lifestyle, social organisation, religion and culture. These are a hardy, warm and welcoming people, given to easy laughter,” he adds.Singh also said that to try and artificially preserve native cultures as some kind of laboratory specimens, deprived of the benefits of modern science and technology would be inappropriate.Giving credence to Singh’s line of thinking, a recent news agency reported (ANI, Oct 18) that the Indian army officers were studying Tibetan history, culture and language in a bid to counter Chinese influence, and to deepen the existing bond between the local population and the rest of the nation.The first batch of the two-month course on Tibetology involving culture, geopolitics, politics, demography and Buddhist philosophy began in March this year with 15 Indian army officers. The second batch began in November with 20 officers, and for the third course, there were more than 22 names received when that report was filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/quick-border-access-for-forces-integration-of-locals-must-ex-irs-officer-101639908681641.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Another unidentified youth lynched in Punjab village over suspected attempt to sacrilege||A day after a youth was beaten to death over an attempt to sacrilege in the Golden Temple, Amritsar, another unidentified youth, who is believed to be a migrant, was lynched by the Sikh activists at Nizampur village in Kapurthala on Sunday over the suspicion of an alleged attempt of sacrilege, in the presence of police. This was the second incident in the state since Sunday.Earlier, there was a standoff between police and Sikh organisation over the custody of the youth who was kept in a room inside Gurdwara since morning. Sikh activists then went inside the room forcefully amid the scuffle with police and lynched the man. As per the initial details, the youth, believed to be in his 20s, had short hair and was wearing a red shirt. There have been no other traces of his identification so far. In the morning, senior police officials, including Kapurthala senior superintendent of police, Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh, and others, rushed to the spot where they were trying to strike a dialogue with Sikh organisations to hand over the accused. Heavy police deployment was in place outside the room where the youth was under custody to prevent the members of Sikh groups from entering the room forcefully. A top police official supervising the matter denied any matter of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib or other religious textbooks like Gutka Sahib and others in the Gurdwara.Gurdwara manager Amarjit Singh alleged that the youth was in a bid of sacrilege and also disrespected the Nishan Sahib (a Sikh flag) inside the Gurdwara. They caught the accused during the wee hours as he managed to escape from the premises. “The youth was sent by someone from the New Delhi to attempt sacrilege for money, he confessed the same,” added Amarjit Singh. The Sikh groups staged protests outside Gurdwara and demanded the custody of the youth as they wanted to punish him. They claimed that the respective governments failed to deliver justice in the sacrilege cases, especially in Bargari and other cases.Police, however, said the man may have the intent of theft. In a press briefing, Kapurthala SSP Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh, said, “as per facts gathered by the police, Amarjit Singh, manager of the Gurdwara, woke up at 4 am and saw a man inside the Gurdwara who fled the spot. Later, Amarjit sent his two sewadars (co-workers) who nabbed the youth. The Gurdwara manager and others thrashed the youth. The youth was wearing the jacket of Gurdwara students. It meant that the youth had the intention of theft.” “The mob gathered after the video got viral and under the religious emotion, they killed the youth. The police tried their best to handle the situation. We will register the criminal case under the charges of murder against the accused who killed the youth,” said Khakh, reiterating that as per their probe and clues gathered from the spot, it looks like a case of theft and no sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikhs, was committed. Khakh further said that there were one or two ID cards found which belonged to two local kids and were stolen. On Sunday, a man, who allegedly tried to desecrate the Guru Granth Sahib inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple during the evening rituals on Saturday, was beaten to death by the devotees. The incident happened during the ‘paath’ of Rehras Sahib (hymn recited in the evening as per Sikh tenets). Giani Baljit Singh was reciting the hymns when a man rushed towards the holy book after jumping the railings and picked a ‘kirpan’. However, before he could do something sacrilegious, SGPC staffers got hold of him.Acting Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh said that some agencies are behind these incidents in the season of elections. Government must expose the forces behind these conspiracies because the Sikhs will not tolerate such acts anymore, he said.

But, for the first time, it is being seen that such agencies will be used to ensure that the Samajwadi Party does not form the government in Uttar Pradesh,” Yadav said at a press meet.The former UP chief minister said that whenever the BJP realises that it is losing an election anywhere in India, it unleashes the I-T department, the ED and the CBI.“We (Samajwadi Party) have experience of presenting documents to the ED and CBI, because the BJP is using central agencies to threaten, just like the Congress party did before,” the SP president added.Yadav said the present situation in UP shows the Yogi Adityanath government will not be able to survive for long.

19-12-2021||Kolkata||Munawar Faruqui set to make comeback, to perform new show in Kolkata||Stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui, who was last month denied a nod to hold a show in Bengaluru amid protests by some right-wing outfits, is set to perform in Kolkata in January.The comedian took to Twitter on Saturday evening and shared a link to book tickets for his two-hour comedy act "Dhandho", to be held on January 16.According to online ticket booking platform BookMyShow, the tickets -- priced at ₹799 -- were "filling fast".In November, Faruqui was under fire after the Bengaluru Police denied permission to his stand-up comedy show in the city amid protest by Hindu right-wing outfits, who alleged that he had hurt the Hindu sentiments in one of his shows.The 29-year-old comic had said his show – which had sold more than 600 tickets – was cancelled in the wake of the "threats to venue vandalism". The proceeds from the show were supposed to be donated to late Kannada star Puneeth Rajkumar's charitable organisation.Faruqui also claimed that 12 of his shows were called off in the last two months because of the threats to the venue and audiences."My name is Munawar Faruqui. And that's been my time, you guys were (a) wonderful audience. Good bye, I'm done," he had tweeted.A few days later, stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra, a vocal critic of the government, also said his shows, scheduled to be held in Bengaluru, were cancelled after the organisers received threats.Earlier this year, Faruqui had spent a month in jail at Indore after a BJP MLA's son lodged an FIR in January accusing the comedian of hurting religious sentiments through his show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/munawar-faruqui-set-to-make-comeback-to-perform-new-show-in-kolkata-101639900751585.html

19-12-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata civic polls: TMC accuses BJP of tempting voters with Biryani||The Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have once again locked horns in a war of words as they contest the high-stakes Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections on Sunday. In a bizarre allegation, the TMC camp has accused its saffron opponents of tempting voters with Biryani – a dish much popular in the city for its distinctive mix. The incident, reported from north Kolkata's Maniktala area, has now generated considerable excitement in the region, reported Hindustan Times' sister publication HT Bangla.Also Read | One injured by crude bomb during Kolkata civic polls; low turnout till afternoonAccording to the allegations, cited by the publication, the Trinamool has accused the BJP of influencing prospective voters on the promise of Biryani. Elaborate cooking arrangements in this regard have also been made on the rooftop of a private hospital in the area, the ruling party claims, adding that the mixed rice dish is being delivered to voters from there.An official of the aforementioned hospital, however, has denied the charges. According to the hospital staffer, cited by a mainstream Bengali-language daily, the Biryani is being prepared for patients and other salaried workers of the medical facility.Local Trinamool Congress workers have now organised a sit-in before the hospital, demanding that not a single plate of Biryani should go outside the hospital premises.Meanwhile, TMC and Congress supporters got into a fistfight inside the premises of Sri Jain Vidyalaya on Brabourne Road in central Kolkata where a polling station was set up in ward No 45. Another incident, where a crude bomb went off and subsequently injured a man, was reported from the north-eastern part of the city this morning. The blast occurred near the polling station at Taki Boy’s School in KMC ward No 36, and both the TMC and the BJP later traded charges and accused each other of ferrying in outsiders to create trouble.Security has been tightened all over the Bengal capital and its entry points because of the polls. Ahead of the voting, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were clamped within 100 meters of all polling stations.More than 23,500 policemen were deployed to ensure the safety of voters and the candidates contesting in the city’s 144 civic wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-civic-polls-tmc-accuses-bjp-of-tempting-voters-with-biryani-101639896956063.html
19-12-2021||Kolkata||3 injured in crude bomb explosion during Kolkata civic polls, one arrested||Kolkata police on Sunday confirmed that three people were injured in the bomb explosion which took place in the north-eastern part of Kolkata on Sunday morning during the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections. One person has been arrested in the case, officials said.The incident took place near the polling station at Taki Boy’s School in KMC ward No 36. “The incident took place around 200 metres from the polling station. The election process has not been affected by this. A huge police contingent has been deployed in the area. We have appealed to voters to exercise their right to franchise without fear. The injured man has been taken to hospital,” Priyabrata Roy, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), told the media. The Kolkata Police said at 2.30 pm that one man was arrested in connection with the bomb explosion near Taki Boy’s School in which three local people were injured. “We have also identified the other miscreants but their names cannot be disclosed for the sake of investigation. As many as 72 people were arrested from all over Kolkata till 2 pm. Four of them were held for the trouble at Sri Jain Vidyalaya on Brabourne Road in ward No 45. The elections have been overall peaceful so far. Police took prompt action wherever allegations were raised. None of the 4559 polling booths were left unguarded,” said Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, joint commissioner of police (headquarters) “Complaints came from many people. The SEC also received complaints and forwarded these to us. We have filed action-taken reports,” said Sarkar. Shortly after Sarkar held the press conference at the police headquarters, the opposition parties alleged that TMC workers ransacked a polling booth (no 19) in ward no 23. Polling was also stalled at a booth in CIT Park Community Hall polling station in ward no 22 where the polling agent of the Congress was found with bleeding injuries. There were more clashes between Congress and TMC workers near Marwari Vidyalaya in ward no 23 in the business district of Burrabazar. The EVM machine was allegedly thrown on the ground. An officer of the SEC said on condition of anonymity that according to the report submitted by the police on the incident at Marwari Vidyalaya, the EVM machine was not damaged and its counting unit was thrown on the ground. The booth was not taken over by outsiders, as alleged, but polling was interrupted for some time,” the officer said. The CPI(M) alleged that a woman who was working as the party’s polling agent in one of the booths in ward No 33 was punched on the face and the car of its candidate from the port area was ransacked. Neither the police nor the SEC commented on these incidents till 3 pm when the polling rate stood at 52 %.Leaders of opposition parties, as well as the TMC, levelled allegations of intimidation and booth jamming in several areas. BJP leader Meena Devi Purohit, who has won from ward No 22 thrice since 2005 because of her popularity, alleged that she and her followers were attacked by TMC supporters at the polling station in Maheswari Boy’s School in central Kolkata in the morning. “A woman assaulted me and tore my blouse. They did not let me enter the booth,” Purohit said. Dismissing allegations that TMC was orchestrating all the violence, transport minister Firhad Hakim, who is contesting the polls, said, “They brought similar charges during the March-April assembly polls in Kolkata. The Election Commission of India looked into all the allegations and found them to be baseless.” Reacting to the BJP’s allegation that its polling agents were being driven out from many booths, Hakim said, “The BJP has not even read the manual issued by the election commission. It clearly says an agent has to be a resident of the area where the booth is located. The BJP cannot hire people from anywhere and send them as polling agents. The party has no organisation.”“I am very happy with the performance of the Kolkata Police. Polling is going on peacefully. The BJP’s allegation, that security cameras were deactivated in many places, is baseless. I personally visited some booths,” said Hakim. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee dismissed the BJP’s allegations and said strong action will be taken if any TMC worker is found to be involved in the alleged violence and electoral malpractice.“The TMC cannot do anything if the BJP does not have the organisational strength to deploy polling agents in all the booths. The polls are being held peacefully barring some stray incidents. If the media has any photo or video footage, showing our workers involved in violence or electoral malpractice, please provide it. Our party will give them exemplary punishment and so will the state administration. I am saying this as the TMC national general secretary,” Banerjee said after casting his vote at a school near his home at Harish Mukherjee Road in south Kolkata at 2 pm. There are more than 4500 polling booths in around 370 main and auxiliary polling stations in Kolkata. The BJP, Congress and CPI(M) raised allegations of violence and electoral malpratice at around 100 polling stations till 1 pm when the polling rate stood at 36.8 %. “The presiding officers in all polling booths are sitting as silent spectators. The TMC has shown how low its confidence is even after winning 213 of the state’s 294 assembly seats six months ago. Hundreds of our workers are still homeless because of the violence that took place after May,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. “The Kolkata Police has proved that it is an organ of the ruling party and not a law enforcement agency. We started our agitation at 1 pm. It will spread to all districts after the polls,” Bhattacharya added. Governor Jadgeep Dhankhar and his wife cast their votes in a booth set up at the office of the principal accountant general. The governor said he asked his security personnel not to enter the polling station. “Last night the state election commission issued a directive saying only the security personnel of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee can enter polling booths,” said Dhankhar. Two crude bombs also went off near Khanna cinema in north Kolkata but there was no report of injury. Security was tightened all over the Bengal capital and its entry points because of the polls. Prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was clamped within 100 metres of all polling stations. More than 23,500 policemen were deployed to ensure the safety of voters and the candidates contesting in the city’s 144 civic wards. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) currently controls 126 of these seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won five seats in the 2015 polls, alleged that the ruling party had ferried in outsiders to create trouble. “Our leaders spotted people from the districts coming to Kolkata in buses. We apprehend trouble. The TMC never allows free and fair elections,” Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said on Saturday. The BJP also lodged a complaint with the state election commission saying the ruling party unleashed violence all over the city so that voters stayed away from polling stations. The party announced that its workers will start an agitation from 1 pm and intensify the protest after polling was over. “People can see for themselves that we did not right thing by demanding deployment of CAPF. We will file a report before the Calcutta high court division bench during the next hearing on December 23,” said senior BJP leader Shishir Bajoria. The state election commission (SEC) installed security cameras inside all polling booths, counting centres and facilities to be used for storing around 6500 electronic voting machines (EVMs) following an order passed by the Calcutta high court on December 16. The petition was filed by the BJP. The BJP had also moved the high court seeking deployment of central armed police forces (CAPF). It told the court that BJP candidates and voters may face violence on Sunday and cited the alleged killings after the March-April assembly polls as the ground for such apprehension. The BJP’s petition was rejected by a single bench on Thursday and the division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj on Friday night. The party challenged the order in the Supreme Court but no hearing was held. Meanwhile, TMC and Congress supporters got into a fistfight inside the premises of Sri Jain Vidyalaya on Brabourne Road in central Kolkata where a polling station was set up in ward No 45. This, however, did not affect the polling process, said policemen deployed at the spot. The troublemakers were removed by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/one-injured-by-crude-bomb-during-kolkata-civic-polls-low-turnout-till-afternoon-101639897342182.html
19-12-2021||Delhi||DU drops cut offs: Less stress for aspirants now?||Delhi University’s Executive Committee (EC) has given its nod to conducting entrance exam-based admission, and ever since, aspirants are in a fix, wondering if this is good news or something to fret about. DU will do away with the system of cut-offs from the academic year 2022, and aspirants can seek admission through entrance exams. So, does doing away with sky-rocketing cut offs imply less stress? “It is quite revolutionary,” says Adveer Singh, a Delhi-based aspirant, while Khushi Gupta, also from Delhi, adds: “To those in class XII, people would say, ‘You have to get 100% no matter what, because you’ve to get into DU’. It’s not that we won’t work hard now; we’ll enjoy the process.” Whether DU will have its own exam or adopt the central test pattern is yet to be decided. But Singh opines: “An entrance exam tests your aptitude while cut off system tests memory. The approach of studying for boards and entrance is way different. It’s great that the central education system will finally test our aptitude, rather than memory.” Aarushi Pandey, an aspirant from IBDP board, feels this decision will give candidates a better shot at getting into DU. Considering how several students from the Kerala board made it to DU due to their high percentages, she adds, “The new approach may add to the pressure of giving exams, but it’s surely better than how the cut offs have been skyrocketing to nearly unattainable levels in the past few years.” Veer Khanna, a Gurugram-based aspirant, feels the move will ease the inherent stress and pressure for class XII board exams. “I don’t know what the syllabus for entrance exams would be, but if it allows for slightly more specialised testing, I am all for it,” he adds.Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

In the 2017 panchayat polls, Nayak was elected uncontested from the panchayat as hers was the only Dalit family living and the post of sarpanch was reserved for a Dalit woman.But her getting elected as sarpanch did not usher in any change in her living standard as she continued to seek alms from people of neighbouring villages of Manikpur, Maheswarpur and Kairash. As a sarpanch she gets a monthly honorarium of ₹2350, but she continued to beg even after getting elected.Panchayat extension officer of Badapalli, K Jogendra Reddy said he tried several times in the past to get her to stop begging. “But after a few days she would again start begging,” Reddy said.Hema’s husband Ghana Nayak works as a peon with the local grampanchayat office. The landless Nayak family, comprising Hema, her husband, younger son and two daughters-in-law live in a dilapidated house. Her elder son is a migrant worker while the younger one is a daily wager. On Thursday, Hema was seen attending a function in which Khallikote MLA Suryamani Baidya distributed Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojna health smart cards. After the function, she again resumed begging.“In the last 5 years, I have gone to the panchayat office only 4-5 times. I have no idea of the work that happens in panchayat. I don’t know how much salary I get. My husband draws it from the panchayat office,” said Nayak, who did not even know who the local Block Development Officer is. Locals said the sarpanch knows nothing except writing a few words in Odia.Elected sarpanchs in Odisha are responsible for several things in villages including construction, repair and maintenance of water supply, lighting of public streets, protection of public properties and establishment, management and maintenance of common grounds among others. They are also supposed to supervise soil conservation works and regulate fairs and festivals in the panchayat apart from implementing schemes for social justice and economic development.Last year, at the height of the pandemic, sarpanchs were given the power of district collectors for the management of Covid-19 in their respective areas.Block Development Officer of Khallikote, Mitali Patra, said the sarpanch did not need to beg as she gets a monthly honorarium. “She has been allotted a house under Indira Awas Yojana. We are trying to find out the reason behind her begging,” said the BDO. On Saturday, the sarpanch was given ₹10,000 from the District Red Cross Fund by the local administration.Sandeep Patnaik, who works with Pune-based National Centre for Advocacy Studies that works on people-centred advocacy, said the incidence of a Dalit sarpanch begging for survival was a symptom of a larger malaise that is affecting , Odisha’s panchayati raj governance.“Though Odisha has announced 50 per cent reservation for women in PRI institutions since 2012 and claims of devolution of power to panchayats, in real terms such institutions have no power. All the power is exercised either by the district collector or the BDOs. The three Acts that the state government passed for gram panchayats, panchayat samitis and zilla parishads have so many rules that it is difficult for even an educated functionary to know the intricacies, forget about illiterate sarpanch.

Today, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has once again locked horns with the opposing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – all for the control of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) in the civic polls.The December 19 KMC elections are a crucial test for the BJP, which had to yield to the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool at the assembly polls earlier this year and consequently face a series of defections from its ranks to the ruling party. However, Banerjee's side looks formidable ahead of the KMC polls; not only had the TMC won all 17 Vidhan Sabha seats in Kolkata in the assembly elections, but they also displayed dominance in the city during the Lok Sabha elections less than three years ago. Most pre-poll surveys, too, have pitched the Trinamool Congress as the winning contender in these KMC elections.Elections to all the 144 wards of the KMC are being held on Sunday, with the voting process commencing at 7am and concluding at 5pm.The counting of votes will take place on December 21.Meanwhile, the Kolkata Police has heightened vigil across the city and its neighbouring areas, deploying around 23,000 personnel in view of the civic polls.Apart from initiating stringent checks at hotels and various entry points from last evening, officers of the force have also been visiting hotels and guest houses in the metropolis to keep a tab on the number of guests who have checked in and those due to arrive in the next two days.“We want to ensure that the elections are totally peaceful and we have strengthened vigil in Kolkata, Salt Lake, Howrah, and North and South 24 Parganas districts for that purpose,” a senior police official told the PTI news agency. “Areas of focus are Esplanade, New Market, Central Avenue, Gariahat, Ballygunge, Tollygunge, Garia, and Salt Lake.”Route march and area domination has also started at various key locations of the city, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-municipal-corporation-election-today-tmc-bjp-fight-for-144-wards-101639876161860.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Assistant professors’ association issues memorandum as protest enters Day 47||Ludhiana The Guest Faculty-cum-Assistant Professors’ Association’s protest against the state government’s advertisement for recruitment of new assistant professors on Saturday entered its 47th day.Demanding regularisation of jobs, a panel of the protesters handed over a memorandum to Bharat Bhushan Ashu, state minister for food and consumer affairs, at his office.According to them, the new posts would cost the guest faculty their positions. “The new candidates will get the job and we will lose our employment. Government should have created the new posts. We will have to expedite our protest now as it is the matter of life and death for us,” Falwinder Verma, a protester, said.The protesters claimed that the government is looking to replace the 906-strong workforce of guest faculty, who have been working in state colleges for over two decades. Verma said the new policy would require guest faculty to compete with the new candidates in the common test scheduled for later this month. A professor added that the protesting faculty throughout the state would gherao the house of Pargat Singh, state education minister, if their demands are not heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-assistant-professors-association-issues-memorandum-as-protest-enters-day-47-101639873157814.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Contractual workers lift roadblock after 26 hours||Twenty-six hours after contractual workers, seeking regularisation, laid siege to the national highway near Khanna, the blockade was finally lifted after receiving assurances from Cabinet minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli on Saturday. The contractual staff, who were protesting under the banner of the ‘Theka Karamchari Sangharsh Morcha’ did not allow any vehicle to pass the area for 24 hours, inconveniencing commuters. Police have diverted the traffic from Mandi Gobindgarh and Doraha to other roads to avoid traffic jams.Meeting the contractual workers, who along with their family members, including women and children, had been protesting in the extreme cold and fog, Kotli said he will fix a meeting of their representatives with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi at the Punjab Bhawan in Chandigarh on Sunday. Contractual employees of 11 different departments had participated in the protest near village Bhattian. Earlier, too, the police officials had tried to pacify the protestors, but in vain. Contractual workers’ leaders Varinder Singh Momi, Jagrup Singh and Gurwinder Singh Pannu said a further course of action would be decided after meeting the chief minister.During the protest Yadwinder Singh Yadu, a member of central working committee of Shiromani Akali Dal along with his supporters, arranged langar for the protesting contractual employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-contractual-workers-lift-roadblock-after-26-hours-101639868714614.html

I pray from the bottom of my heart that the new year is abundantly prosperous for all of us. This is the seventh consecutive year of Christmas celebrations in the Vidhan Sabha. When we came to power in 2015, we had decided that our country is a bouquet of all kinds of religions and cultures. We decided that we must celebrate this unique aspect of our country and started celebrating all festivals in the Vidhan Sabha premises,” he said at the event.On the Omicron variant, he said, “Now we are hearing news regarding the Omicron strain, which is spreading very quickly and has already arrived in India. Several cases have also been discovered in most major cities in the country. The updates from Europe state that since this virus is so easily transmitted, it could be overwhelming to deal with once it spreads. However, I want to assure you all that the Delhi government is doing everything in its capacity to keep the situation under control. Ever since the news of Omicron arrived, I have been taking repeated review meetings with all concerned departments so that we are well prepared to deal with the probable threat. It’s also being said that this particular strain is not as dangerous – has mild symptoms, but spreads easily. So there’s no need to stress over it or be afraid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-leads-assembly-christmas-celebrations-says-govt-working-to-keep-covid-in-control-101639867635956.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Obituary: Surinder Singh Dosanj will live on through his teachings||In an age, when arguments run long and tempers short, eminent author and academician Surinder Singh Dosanj stood out like a natural rose among rows upon rows of artificial flowers. This is the fragrance that Dosanj , who was also a journalist, political ideologue and interpreter of scriptures, brought to the lives of his students and colleagues. When I joined the Punjab Agricultural University as an assistant professor in the department of journalism, languages and culture, I was more of a colt than a teacher, while Dosanj was already a name that commanded respect in intellectual and ideological spheres. As is typical of me, I inevitably began by challenging his opinions and beliefs and as he had a reputation of a firebrand orator, I expected him to come down hard at me. Instead, in the days and years that followed he not only educated me on how meaningless opinions are without a matching persona to back them, but also to help me live my childhood a second time over. I could also see that this was exactly what he would make hundreds if not thousands of others – his students, colleagues and rivals – experience his presence. He was to remain a close friend, guide, father-like patron and above all a gurudev, who taught me (and countless others) like a sober and patient seer. Dr Dosanj’s reputation as a liberal, left-leaning intellectual owed a lot to the passionate manner in which he had championed the cause of an ideologically-inspired generation of youngsters around what is known in Punjab as the Moga agitation. We often had strong ideological conflicts invariably stretching into late nights. But amid all the heat and passion of these debates, he never stopped being a warm and loving “fatherly host” nor lost patience with my youthful ways, literally hand-holding me through my arrogant convictions. One of his biggest assets was his ability, even while taking a contrarian position, to help his critics understand their own ideas and intellectual positions on key issues more clearly than before. At a time when social media has rendered patient, meaningful debates an almost an archival species, Dosanj kept producing students well-versed in calmly working through the maze of diverse ideas and opinions, using debate and discussions not to win arguments but to understand life and issues better. This is now forgotten art, though this is just the art which has been handed down to us through rich traditions since the era of the Upanishads and of the roving seers. In modern times, Guru Nanak turned debate and discussion – goshat – into a sublime art form, and a means to unravel the mysteries of the universe and its creator. It was this tradition that Dosanj followed, turning each one of his disciples into a seeker or a student (a sishya or a Sikh) rather than a claimant of knowledge of truth. The great Guru showed us the glory of humility in the face of the infinite unknown. This was the essential teaching of the great gurus which Dosanj seemed to focus the most on. With teachers like him, learning is never a goal but a process – a lifelong romance. As an author, an intellectual activist and later as a teacher, Dosanj encouraged keeping passions calm amid stormy events. And it is this quality which strikes first whenever you come across his students. I was always deeply pained by the intellectual dishonesty that I had the misfortune of seeing in many of his highly celebrated acquaintances-cum-friends who benefited immensely from his magnanimity only to repay with the proverbial dagger that loves a friend’s back. But I also learnt from him how to treat “motiveless malignity” with tolerance and even with limitless love and an indescribable warmth so real that you could actually touch it. He simply refused to allow ingratitude to provoke him away from his composure, no matter how deeply that ingratitude must have hurt, as ingratitude always does. My mother used to say, “The only way to pay reverence to a scripture is to live it.” I found in Dosanj these words revealing themselves as truth walking in human form. These I believe are the qualities which almost all of his students, many of whom rose to occupy high positions in the world journalism, civil service and academia, have inherited from him. Many of them would be turning to Ludhiana to pay homage to a fragrance that will always tip-toe through their hearts as long as they find a moment away from the “confused and confusing din of towns and cities” in which men and women have time for everything except what lives within them –compassion. It was this last word that defined the man who will never go away from the lives of those who shared but a moment with him. Farewell, but no farewell , Gurudev( The writer is a long-time close aide of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal is media adviser to the Shiromani Akali Dal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/obituary-surinder-singh-dosanj-will-live-on-through-his-teachings-101639867514270.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Nurses take out protest march on 3rd day of strike||Continuing their strike for the third consecutive day against the recommendations of the sixth pay commission, staff nurses deputed at civil and government hospitals took out a protest march from the Civil Hospital to Jagraon Bridge on Saturday.On the call of the Punjab Nurses Association, around 200 staff nurses have been striking to seek pay parity, and payment of certain allowances among other assorted demands. During the protest march, movement of traffic was also interrupted in the Field Ganj area and the Jagraon Bridge.In the absence of nurses, the working of the civil hospital, especially the mother and child hospital, was severely hampered. The emergency caesarean (c-section) cases had to be referred to Christian Medical College & Hospital, Ludhiana, as hospitals in other districts including Rajindra Hospital,Patiala, were unable to provide services in absence of nurses.The department is now dependent on the contractual nursing staff and final year nursing students who have been called from Mohan Dai Oswal hospital due to the emergency. But they cannot perform c-section delivery for which trained staff is required.Senior medical officer (SMO), mother and child hospital, RS Chahal said footfall in the hospital had decreased as the public is aware of the strike. Punjab Nurses’ Association district president Asha said,” Rather than increase the pay grade of nurses, our pay has been reduced under the sixth pay commission. Our strike will continue till our demands are fulfilled by the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-nurses-take-out-protest-march-on-3rd-day-of-strike-101639867273797.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Heating lamps to keep birds warm in Chandigarh’s aviary this winter||With the plunging mercury in the city, UT forest department has decided to install heating lamps inside the Chandigarh Bird Park to keep the birds warm, said officials. UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai said, “We have been running trials to see which kind of heating lamps would work best inside these enclosures. The lamps need to be of good quality to ensure no accidents take place and the final decision will be made in the next couple of days after which the heating lamps will be installed.”Dalai added that extra precautions will be taken to ensure that birds don’t come in direct contact with the lamps, which are likely to raise the temperature inside the enclosures up to 10 degrees. The department currently is also using clear polythene sheets to cover the sides and top of the enclosure from where the cold winds enter in order to keep the birds warm. Over 60,000 visitors in first month at bird parkIt has now been over a month since the first lady of India, Savita Kovind, inaugurated the Chandigarh Bird Park on November 16, and as per officials, over 60,000 people have visited the park ever since.Dalai said, “On an average, we get 1,500 visitors on a weekday. The number goes over 5,000 on weekends. On a weekly basis, we are getting about 15,000 visitors here so it has been a great success with the locals and tourists alike.”The facility remains closed on Monday and Tuesday, which Dalai said is due to the fact that Sunday remains one of their most popular days and the birds need another day to rest before they are ready for the visitors at the walk-through facility. As per the staff present there, the terrestrial birds’ enclosure has been the most popular and especially children enjoy this the most. The bird park is spread over 6.5 acres in Nagar Van and comprises two small aviaries and two walk-through aviaries. It is open between 10am and 5pm from Wednesday to Sunday. There are 250 pairs of birds with 48 total species and subspecies and the main attractions are African Love Birds, Budgerigars, White Swan, Black Swan, Wood duck, Golden Pheasant, Yellow Golden Pheasant, Green Wing Macaw, Sun Conure, African Grey Parrot, Finches and Melanistic Pheasant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heating-lamps-to-keep-birds-warm-in-chandigarh-s-aviary-this-winter-101639867033773.html

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Out, damned temptation!||To excel at bird photography may entail navigating treacherous terrain, and stumbling through a veritable minefield of temptation and unethical practices. Ordeals and violations, little known to receptive audiences far away on social media. The ‘likes clickers’ absorb only carefully-curated digitalised triumphs, often posted from the spot itself!Panchkula-based Anu Garg is a doughty birder but she has had to strain at every sinew of her moral being to desist from exploiting birds to bag an ‘awsum pic’ that attracts ‘likes’, like houseflies. “The crested kingfisher is pursued relentlessly by photographers for days and weeks. I got a chance to photograph it at Chakki Modh and was tempted to go back to secure more angles of this enigmatic species. But then, I paused, I had to strain hard to resist temptation. I did not go back after the first time. I had got a decent photo, I was content, I did not want to indulge in an ethics-free and a repetitive, ruthless pursuit of unattainable image perfection. Going back again and again, and poking my lens into the bird’s ambient environment, would have disrupted its natural rhythms,” Garg told this writer.Garg confesses with rare candour that she finds it an uphill task to abide by her precept: ‘Nature is not for you. If you truly love nature, then do not exploit. At the end of the day, if you have bagged no worthwhile or exotic photograph but have not disturbed the birds, take it in your stride, be joyous, for Nature’s wellbeing is supreme.’ What disturbs her no end is the odious spectacle of photographers using lures or bird calls (easily available on smartphones). “At the Thapli forests, I saw photographers – young, impatient ones and some veterans, too – using lures to attract the Indian pitta. The poor pitta was conned and virtually flew into their lap. Initially, I, too, was tempted to use the lure because the photographic opportunity was very rewarding but my daughter, Aasha, objected and resolved my dilemma. ‘Why should you follow the pack, Mama?’ was Aasha’s searching question. The pitta, which had its plate full with the ongoing courtship, mating and nesting season, was totally disoriented by lures and kept calling for 30 minutes to a supposed mate or a territorial rival who just did not exist,” added Garg. Yikes!Snake! Can winter be far behind Householders, whose lives are intertwined with snake habitats due to colonisation and fragmentation of the wilderness, may not spot them during monsoons when burrows get flooded and snakes are all over, or so as the popular perception goes. This is because dense vegetation reduces snake visibility, and the reptiles are engaged with the secretive tasks of hunting and breeding.However, come winter, Rock pythons, Rat snakes, Russell’s vipers and cobras get exposed in the very same locations because these large-bodied snakes seek open, dry areas to bask. Then, these hitherto invisible snakes or ghosts of the monsoons, are spotted and rescue teams rush to nab the so-called intruders who have, unexpectedly, jarred civilisation’s nerves and added to the shivers of winter.With deepening frost and withering vegetation, pythons slide out of burrows to bask in the Sukhna Lake area, and rescue teams have to speedily shed their winter sloth. In Panchkula, vipers are nabbed, absorbing warmth in the open before they can stage a retreat to burrows/hideouts.The above species do not go into complete hibernation but alternate their dormancy in burrows with a few hours of basking. On the other hand, species such as the common krait resort to near-complete dormancy through winter. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-out-damned-temptation-101639866254081.html

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Make your child fall in love with books||“There is more treasure in books than in all the pirates’ loot on Treasure Island” - Walt Disney “Did you ever have trouble teaching me the alphabet or making me finish homework when I was little?” my precocious daughter asked me. “Never,” I asserted, “I made you readers first and students later.” This has always been my advice to anxious mothers, who have approached me over the years asking me how to inculcate the reading habit in their children or how to make them fall in love with books. As a mother and as an educationist, here are a few tips that I have found useful in developing reading as a lifestyle. Read out loud: Children are made readers on the laps of their parents. Both parents should take turns to read out loud to their wards. In India, most parents undermine the importance of this activity. Also, there is a myth that it is the mother’s responsibility to develop the reading habit in children. Remember, parenting is a shared responsibility. So, fathers, don the reading cap if you wish to see your kids grow up to be “readers”. Catch them young: Do not wait for them to grow up. Ignite the passion of reading in children at a tender age. Thomas Paine once said, “The mind once enlightened cannot again become dark.” I remember, I began singing nursery rhymes to my daughters when they were in their cradles, and could hardly make any head or tail of it. My perseverance paid off when they could recite all the rhymes before they started kindergarten. It is the same for reading too. Read out to them even if they are too young to comprehend anything. One day they will be grateful to you for your time and effort. A gift that keeps on giving:  On every occasion, and for every little achievement, gift your child a book. After all, “a book is a gift, you can open again and again.” Teach the child to value a book by giving and receiving books on all happy occasions. The child would learn to relate happy memories to the books he or she received and would cherish them throughout his life. Similarly, encourage them to buy books for you for your special occasions as well. Ask them to scribble a note for you and do the same for them to turn ordinary books into lifelong memories. Better a bookaholic than shopaholic: You can never buy enough books! In fact, the best blessing you can give your child is to wish for their shelves to always overflow with books. Take them on a trip to a bookstore or a library and let them spend “happy hours” in the company of books. These days, you can find seating areas in good bookstores where the child can spend hours ‘leafing’ through books. He may or may not end up buying those books, but would definitely come back for more. ‘Monkey and cap’ approach: It is said that children are great imitators. So, give them something great to imitate. Children become imitators by the age of three. Little girls imitate their mothers by putting on lipstick or nail polish and little boys imitate their fathers in mannerisms . So, implement the ‘monkey and the cap seller approach’ if you wish them to develop a reading habit. Pick up a book in front of them and they will imitate you. Parents often spend their free time surfing internet or scrolling through their mobile phones and then wonder who taught their children to do the same. Put away your mobile phones after dinner time and instead sit with your children with a book in hand and see the difference. “All people are the same, only their habits differ,” the wise man, Confucius had rightly said. Do not foist your choice: Do not force your child to read what you want, let him read what he wants. Often parents complain, “I want my child to read motivational books or biographies of great men but he prefers to read science fiction or comics.” My humble suggestion to such parents is: don’t make choices for your child. Men become great by making independent choices and not by following blindly. The world does not need reason alone. Let there be some place for imagination too for it is Einstein who said, “Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.” sonrok15@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-make-your-child-fall-in-love-with-books-101639865053426.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity Buzz: Charuni faces tough questions from media||Chaduni faces tough questions from media When Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni launched his political party, the Sanyukt Sangharsh Party, in Chandigarh on Saturday and announced his decision to contest the Punjab assembly elections, he was subjected to some tough questions from mediapersons. One of the members of his party present at the press conference had to face backlash from the journalists when she referred to them as “Godi media”, a pejorative term for a sensationalist and biased media. When the party member didn’t stop, the mediapersons objected and she had to apologise. Chandigarh MC poll: Parties in race to outdo each other With the race for the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh in its final leg, all parties are desperate to outdo each other. If one of them decides to organise a press conference, the others follow suit at the same time. When the Congress called a press conference to announce the “chargesheet” against the BJP rule in town, the saffron party held a press conference to announce its achievements. “It’s about grabbing eyeballs and finding space in the media. Everyone is fighting for the same space. It’s a zero sum game, one’s gain is another’s loss,” said a local Aam Aadm Party leader. Blame game boomerangs on former Congress leaders Former UT Congress leaders Pardeep Chhabra and Chandermukhi Sharma tore into the party’s performance when it was at the helm in the municipal corporation. The next day, an English daily published a report with their photo on its front page, giving vent to their criticism of the party they once represented. A few days later while interacting with the media, a senior Congress leader and associate of Chhabra and Sharma said, “I’ll get this report and photo framed. The period for which they are criticising the Congress was in fact when they were the main representatives at the MC’s helm. It means they are now blaming themselves for inefficiency. B-Team of Congress or B-Team of BJP? The Aam Aadmi Party is fighting its first civic election in Chandigarh and taking on two formidable rivals in the Congress and the BJP. Incidentally, both rivals claim that the AAP is the B-Team of the other. BJP leaders say that the AAP is the “B-Team” of the Congress since 20 of the 35 candidates fighting the election are former Congress workers. The Congress in turn claims that the AAP is the “B-Team” of the BJP as it is expected to make a dent into the Congress’ share of anti-incumbency votes against the six-year rule of the BJP. Brazen theft: Locked for two hours, Zirakpur house burgled In a brazen burglary, a house in Royal Estate Society of Zirakpur was burgled when the owner was away for less than two hours on December 14 morning. Owner Ashish Chadha said his family left at 9.40am and was back at 11.30am only to find door locks broken and the house ransacked. A shocked Chadha lost ₹35,000 and ornaments worth ₹2 lakh in just two hours. Controlling crime: Cop gets praise, predecessor warning Amid rising incidents of drug smuggling and illegal sale of liquor, senior Chandigarh Police officials have asked station house officers (SHOs) to pull up their socks. At a recent crime review meeting, an SHO won praise from his senior colleagues for cracking down on the supply of drugs, gambling and liquor in a colony under his jurisdiction. At the same time, his predecessor was issued a warning for giving a free hand to those involved in these illegal activities. Temporary rotaries in city of roundabouts Two temporary rotaries have been set up by the Chandigarh Traffic Police to avoid congestion and accidents. The mini circles have been come up in Industrial Area and Sector 17, while more will be installed at busy intersections in the coming days, it is learnt. The aim is to ease commuting between sectors and facilitate smooth flow of traffic. This is a temporary measure till small permanent rotaries are built. PU Senate hasn’t met in two years It’s been two years since the Panjab University (PU) senate, the varsity’s apex governing body, last met on December 14, 2019. Being the apex governing body, all matters concerning the university are taken up by the senate for approval. Matters have been piling up in the absence of a meeting, affecting the university’s functioning, especially after the term of the syndicate also ended in December last year. Though the senate elections were held this year, a gazette notification of the elected members is awaited.

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Crusaders of the war room||Congress hopes for a comebackAfter three successive elections losses since 2014, the Chandigarh Congress is hoping to make a comeback in a city, once considered to be its stronghold. Seven years ago, having majority in the MC house, the Congress lost the mayoral election to the BJP. Later in the 2016 MC polls, it suffered a major drubbing, securing only four seats while the BJP alliance won 21 seats.The grand old party is banking on the anti-incumbency factor and city’s slipping Swachh Survekshan rankings for a return to power. Inflation, “high” tax burden on city residents, “poor” development record of BJP, and the MC’s financial crunch are other major issues the Congress is counting on this election. The entry of the AAP, in a traditionally two-pronged battle, has particularly disturbed the party’s election strategy. In many wards, both the parties are vying for the same anti-BJP votes. Unlike BJP and AAP, which are spending heavily on advertisements, the party is focusing more on individual contacts with voters and social media. POWER CENTREPawan Kumar Bansal, national party treasurerFour-time member of parliament from Chandigarh and the party’s power centre in the city, Bansal is dictating the party’s overall election strategy –the key election issues, party’s response to rival parties’ tactics, and overall management of party affairs during the election. The former union railway minister also played a key role in the selection of candidates. Being the party’s most recognisable face, Bansal is also actively participating in door-to-door campaignS and public rallies.THE TROUBLESHOOTERRajinder Rana, coordinator, MC electionsThe MLA from Himachal Pradesh, Rajinder Rana is mobilising the party workers, bringing in additional campaign hands from Himachal Pradesh and Delhi to prop the party’s campaign. Rana, appointed as the coordinator for Chandigarh election by the Congress high command, is the party’s crisis manager-in-chief, dousing rebellions within the party and also pulling in crucial leaders from rival parties. Rana is actively working on bringing in the crucial Himachali voters to the party’s side. Rana is also holding public meetings in wards in support of the party candidates. STRATEGISTSubhash Chawla, Congress state presidentA seasoned city politician and former mayor, Subhash Chawla, who took over as the party’s city president only nine months ago, is at the centre of the party’s strategy making. He is coordinating and managing all different cells of the party. Chawla is also responsible for ensuring that candidates’ field requirements are met. He decides the party’s star campaigners’ meeting schedule and places they are to be best utilised. PUBLICISTAbhishek Dutt, coordinatorNational spokesperson Abhishek Dutt is looking after the media and communication strategy of the party in the municipal corporation elections. The councillor from South Delhi municipal corporation, Dutt is managing the crucial social media campaign and the advertisement messaging of the party.AAP’s debut on MC battleground The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had made its election debut in the city in the 2014 Lok Sabha election when its candidate Gul Panag secured nearly 23.97% of the total votes polled, and was in close contest with the runner up, veteran Congress leader Pawan Kumar Bansal who had polled 26.84% votes. But thereafter, the party lost major ground in the city’s with its cadres fragmenting and residents’ interest fading. Result, it got a thrashing in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, with its candidate former MP Harmohan Dhawan managing only 3.9% of the total votes polled. THE ANCHOR Jarnail Singh, Chandigarh state in-charge With the party banking heavily on the “Delhi Model” for winning elections in Chandigarh, the Delhi MLA is the direct link between the party’s national leadership, including Arvind Kejriwal, and the local leadership. Singh is directly involved in the party’s campaign, candidates’ selection and making the Delhi Model a cornerstone of the party’s election strategy. A good communicator, Singh takes centrestage in party’s attempts at positive public perception management. THE ORGANISER Prem Garg, AAP’s Chandigarh unit president A charted accountant by profession, AAP’s local president Prem Garg has been mobilising party workers involved in boardroom planning, besides looking into the party’s finances. He has been associated with the party ever since it was formed in 2012. He is the face of the party, building links with different citizens’ groups like residents’ welfare associations, non-government organisations and professional groups, and administration and the election commission. THE MASS MOBILISER Pardeep Chhabra, co-incharge Chhabra joined the AAP only around four months ago but has come to dominate the party’s political direction in the city. He has played a key role in the selection of candidates. Chhabra’s unceremonious exit from the Congress brought along a major swell in AAP’s grassroot-level workers’ strength. Chhabra, a former city mayor and former Congress president, has a strong network in the city and is actively mobilising support for the party’s candidates. THE STRATEGIST Chander Mukhi Sharma, campaign chairman Acknowledged even by his opponent as a shrewd election strategist, Sharma is shaping the party’s election strategy even at the micro-level. Sharma played a key role in the party’s manifesto formation – bringing in local flavour to the “Delhi Model” based freebies after he ran a survey on “what city residents want from parties”. He is the main proponent of the party’s “alternative revenue generation model” thrust. Contesting from Ward 13, Sharma is also assisting other candidates in their feedback loop with voters and adapting their campaign as per voters’ needs. BJP fighting anti-incumbency The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is gunning to better its performance from the last MC polls wherein its alliance secured 21 out of 26 seats. “Development” works and its “achievements” in the last five years are the cornerstone of its election strategy. The party has listed more than 50 such achievements and it is the key message the party is aggressively putting across different media platforms and door-to-door campaigns. Known for its cadre strength, the party is facing a stiff challenge from more than a dozen rebel candidates as it tries to surmount once again the endemic party factionalism before the poll day. There is also the issue of six-year long accumulating anti-incumbency factor. Issues like consistent poor show by Chandigarh under the Swachh Survekshan rankings is also a major challenge for the party. A three-cornered fight between Congress, BJP and AAP makes its attempt at a win that much more complex and harder. ALL IN ONEArun Sood, state president The driving force of the BJP’s move to retain power, the city party chief Arun Sood is having a hands-on approach in the party’s election campaign. Sood is involved in the day-to-day management of campaign, coordinating with different party cells and deciding the daily tactics of candidates’ campaign. Sood is also a key player in party’s overall media and election campaign strategies. Selection of candidates, preparation of manifesto and responding to rival parties also comes under the party president’s role. CRISIS MANAGER Sanjay Tandon, former state president Tandon, who served as the city chief for 10 years, is putting his knowledge and experience of the party’s grassroots-level to mobilise the party workers. He chairs multiple party meetings every day to ensure that the party ranks give their all as the poll day comes nearer. Tandon is an integral part of the party think-tank on various issues from campaign strategy to management. He also acts as crisis-manager, persuading rebel candidates to come back into the party fold. LINK TO DELHI Vinod Tawde, party’s national general secretary and election in-charge The main link between the city unit and the party’s national leadership, Tawde is the overall in-charge of the party election campaign. He is also keeping all the factions of the party in-line, ensuring that they all work unison for party’s victory. He plays a key role in streamlining interventions from outside--central leaders, leaders from other states, and makes changes in campaigns, based on the intelligence and survey inputs. IN-HOUSE COMMUNICATORSaudan Singh, national vice-president In-charge of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, Saudan Singh is devising the party’s strategy and tactics for winning the election. He is actively involved in imparting these strategies to party workers, from top to bottom. Singh’s work centres around organisation and workers. He also had the final say in the selection of candidates. The party’s overall vision and the central leadership’s directions are also communicated to the party worker in the city unit through him.
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays | The three cardinal ‘Ws’ for health, happiness||In olden days, younger men were often told to avoid chasing the three ‘Ws’ — wine, women and wealth. This saying unfortunately and disparagingly also brackets the fairer and more evolved half of our species with materialistic pursuits. Nonetheless, the message to aspiring achievers was clear: work was the only ‘W’ to worship and one had to forget the rest. While the divine jury is still out on whether mankind as a whole has been able to follow the said dictum, it is time to focus on three other ‘Ws’, without which we cannot hope to live healthy and happy lives: walking, water and wellness. Wellness is of course a term that has permeated our very consciousness. From emotional wellness to physical, mental and spiritual wellness, there are many forms in which the word is applied. It is no surprise then that wellness coaches are doing pretty well these days, and the wellness economy is cruising in boom times as well!However, if we take wellness seriously and apply it assiduously to our own existence, it can envelope us with a true sense of wellbeing. Thus, by focussing sensibly on our diet, our exercise and mental hygiene, we can pretty much ensure that we are living towards the top of the health pyramid, if not at its very pinnacle. Wellness in my personal viewpoint should necessarily also include regular yoga, meditation and detoxification of the mind from the vitriol that our berserk social media keeps spewing at it.Wellness should also cover the charming act of reading books, being surrounded by music in some manner and also a vigorous outdoor sport. The pursuit of wellness might even include keeping good company and engaging in uplifting conversations.I have separated water and the act of walking from the world of wellness as these two stand out as essentials without which our health may just go for a toss. Bollywood legend, Rekha, when asked the secret to her youthfulness, said inner peace and drinking lots of water were the keys. In fact, doctors have recently been advising dengue patients and those suffering from a plethora of ailments to simply “rest a lot and drink a lot” (water, of course). Around 10 to 12 glasses of water a day are essential, even if the weather is cool and we do not feel thirsty. Walking is the third, but equally important W. Without keeping our legs busy and the circulation going, we will be like sedentary sloths. The modern man, with a multitude of gadgets at his disposal, has obviated the need to walk for most necessities, making it imperative that we make the considered choice to walk every day. By avoiding lifts, escalators and walkalators et al when possible, we can do ourselves a big favour. Even if that elusive target of 10,000 steps rarely seems attainable, we must walk as much as we can each day. I shall take the liberty of adding another W. Having a ‘worry-free nature’ is an amazing plus point in our lives. Worries are like brakes, said the saint. They unnecessarily throttle our quest to press the accelerator and gain momentum in our lives. Acquiring wisdom, that rather ungetatable rarity, is worth our while as well. To be truly wise is to choose happiness and calmness over the dizzying tizzies that tend to overtake our minds. Easy to write, difficult to implement? Indeed.At a relatively uncomplicated level, we must wisely choose silence over speech when we should. As the old sage put it, “A smart person knows what to say, a wise person knows whether to say it or not!”Be that as we may, most human beings do try to follow some sort of regularity and structure in their quest for leading healthful and joyful lives. Nobody on this planet is perfect, or we would not be here! Thus, with all kinds of Ws to choose from, we must do our best, and leave the rest, to the one who matters the most.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-the-three-cardinal-ws-for-health-happiness-101639864633353.html

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | To see or not to see Mandu: Was that the question?||It happens sometimes that the Bard of Avon, whom one had to learn by heart in senior school and college, returns at some uncanny moment as of now. Tonight as I click at the typewriter, sorry I meant the keyboard, when I sit with both the copies of Swadesh’s book placed on the desk in front of me, Mian Shakespeare makes a visitation with his most famous line from Hamlet: To be or not to be. Critics, whom the bard has kept busy for hundreds of years, say that this line from his soliloquy is which talks of life and death in deep existentialist thought.But now ask me how does Mandu the love-nest of the ill-fated lovers, Rani Roopmati and Baaz Bahadur, figure in this theory of existential brooding? Well for one, Mandu seems to be visiting me often in my column as I grow older. It is not my doing but that of writers who seem to be obsessed with it. Just last month it was Priyadarshi Thakur acting scribe to the Rani and now it is Swadesh’s forgotten rendezvous with a woman of letters who had not seen Mandu and that’s how this ‘Fractured Soul-Memoir’ got this mysterious name.Writer with a differenceBefore moving onto this amazing account by a writer who made a place for himself in the world of Hindi fiction in the times of all-time greats like Nirmal Verma , Krishna Sobti and many others. Not just that, he was cherished by his seniors and equals for venturing into the disturbed areas of life with rare courage and returning each time with a seething story a reader would. A very popular and elegant professor of English in GMN College, Ambala Cantt, adept in teaching romantic poetry of Shelley and Keats, his manner in encountering his own stories was very different. It was often said of this fiction writer and dramatist that he hunted his characters with a gun.An author of 15 published books, including stories and novels and greatly successful plays like ‘Court Martial’, ‘Kaal Kothri’ and ‘Sabse Udaas Kavita’, this writer with aristocratic good looks and demeanour, found great adulation. In fact, his was the fan following which had hitherto been reserved for poets a la Majaz or Sahir Ludhianvi. When his first book of stories Ashwarohi came out in 1973, he got letters signed in blood from his female readers for the title story which looked through the eyes of a girl at a sensitive and handsome young man who was insane to others. Picking out the extraordinary in the most mundane of situations was his special talent and he was at equal ease in dealing with characters drawn from the aristocracy or the urban slums. This so because it was the human psyche he explored with great finesse.Lunatic, lover and poetHowever, in the early 90s he had a mental breakdown with a recurrence of suicidal attempts. The memoirs are set in the wards of the specialty hospital. He had battled illness and came out and at the suggestions of writer friends, who thought he would overcome the destructive phase of life thus, started penning the seven-year journey from insanity to sanity. Thus, Mandu was born and the trigger that pressed it was a fair woman asking him to accompany him to Mandu. It was rejection of this proposition that led to the delusion of the woman haunting him and as a professor of literature he knew well that ‘hell hath no fury like a woman scorned’.Between the hallucinatory visions of the Mayavani are the snippets of scenes from the days of agony in the hospital ranging from the demeaning to the reassuring. His young son, Sukant, holding his hand, a senior writer, Varinder Mendiratta, visiting him and feeding him apple stew, a family friend, Renu, leaving some money under his pillow and many more. A dark humour also underlines the musings of the patient. By the end of the book even the Mayavani, perhaps the Maya Memsahib of past life is forgiven in a poetic realisation. Standing in front of the haunted man she asks, “Swadesh, was it my fault?Fleeing the nestI glance again at the two books kept on my desk. The eyes of women in white veils peep out of a painting by Jehangir Sabavala on the cover of the Hindi original. From the cover of the English translation peeps a dimmed version of a classic photograph of the author, clicked by his friend Soumitra Mohan, stares at you. Swadesh says about these memoirs: “I Have Not Seen Mandu’ is not a history of the external world. Nor is it a paper written for a medical journal. It is a soul-memoir, a fractured one.”Pinto says of this book: “ I hate it when people talk about instant classics but I have not read anything like this, so completely naked, so dependent on the kindness of others, so raw”. Like Jerry everyone feels that the book should have had a happy ending but that was not to be. The waves of depression lashed on. On June 2, 2006, he left home early in the morning to be with the lost ones. Ask Sukant and he will say: ‘Papa is Elsewhere…’ The readers of Swadesh thank Ravi Singh of the Speaking Tiger for the book and wait for the plays and stories that are to follow because the best place to find the writer is in his writings. nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-to-see-or-not-to-see-mandu-was-that-the-question-101639864273302.html

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Congress will stop dumping waste at Dadumajra site, says Bansal||The Congress will stop dumping of garbage at Dadumajra within six months, if voted to power in the municipal corporation (MC), All-India Congress Committee treasurer and former Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said while holding a press conference at the dump site on Saturday.Flanked by the party’s national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and other leaders, Bansal said, “We will look into alternative ways by setting up a new plant following the right process and disposal of garbage in a scientific way.”“In the past six years, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led MC has turned the life of around two lakh people residing near the ground into a mess by dumping garbage here without proper management,” said Bansal.“During the Congress’ time, MC had dumped loose soil at the dumping ground, resulting in growing of grass there. Those were days when children and even international cricketers, including Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Mongia, used to play there. But ironically, the ground now has eagles and crows hovering over it,” said Surjewala.He said, “India’s City Beautiful, carved out of the vision and dreams of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, has been converted into a garbage mountain of the city by Modi and BJP government.”“The only bigger garbage mountain of the height of Taj Mahal (73 metres) is in the Kejriwal government-run Delhi,” said Surjewala.Bansal said, “BJP-ruled MC has neither conducted an inquiry into the affairs of the private company responsible for running the solid waste processing plant nor has it imposed a single rupee as penalty on this company. Collusion & corruption is, thus, writ large, he maintained.”EC serves notice on CongThe election commission served a show-cause notice on the Congress for organising a political campaign without permission. The party has been asked to give a reply in a day, said Pradhuman Singh, returning officer.Protest at the siteParallel to the Congress press conference, a protest against the party was held at the site. While the protesting group claimed to be local residents, the Congress alleged they were BJP workers. Heated arguments and a minor altercation also ensued on the press conference sidelines between the group and Congress workers, though police intervened immediately and broke up the two groups. BJP state president Arun Sood, said, “It was not a BJP protest, but it was common residents of the Dadumajra who were venting their anger against the Congress. The garbage dump is because of Congress, and most of it is before the BJP’s rule. Now, they have to face people’s anger for their misdeeds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-will-stop-dumping-waste-at-dadumajra-site-says-bansal-101639862413040.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: ‘Biscuit’ man arrested for robbing people after sedating them||A 54-year-old man, who used to allegedly rob people by offering them biscuits laced with intoxicants, has been nabbed from the inter-state bus terminus in Sector 17, Chandigarh. As per the police, he has been active for over a decade and has targeted at least 100 people using the same modus operandi. He used to tell the victims that the biscuits were prashad from Vaishno Devi, to win over their confidence. The accused has been identified as Krishan Lal, 54, a native of Jammu. He was nabbed after an auto-rickshaw driver approached the police after being robbed in a similar fashion. Complainant, Sagar, 23, told the police that on the night of December 17, he had picked up a male passenger from the Sector 43 bus stand and dropped him off at the bus stand in Sector 17. The passenger offered him a biscuit. After eating it, he fell unconscious. The next morning when he woke up, he realised his purse, which was carrying about ₹3,500 and some important documents, was missing.Following his complaint, the UT police nabbed the accused from the gates of the Sector 17 bus stand on the basis of a tip-off. Police found a strip of Lorazepam tablets and seven packets of Bonn Biscuits in his possession. They have also recovered a stolen mobile phone, a purse and ₹1,500 from him.A case under Section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and Section 379 (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the accused. He will be produced in the court on Sunday.How he won over the confidence of his victimsDuring preliminary probe, the accused told the police that he used to grind the Lorazepam tablets and mix it in the biscuits. He used to stack the biscuits in such a manner that the odd-numbered biscuits were clean while the even-numbered ones were laced with sedatives. He would consume one himself and then offer to his victims, so they don’t suspect something fishy. He used to target people mainly from UP, Bihar and Jammu, telling them that the biscuits were prashad from Vaishno Devi. The accused specifically targeted inter-state passengers, who boarded buses from different bus stands in Delhi and Chandigarh. Superintendent of police, Ketan Bansal said, “Krishan has been active for the last 10 years at ISBT-17 and confessed that he had committed the crime near about 100 times.” How he got the ideaInvestigations pointed out that Krishan started robbing people after he was robbed in similar manner in Ludhiana. “After being robbed, he tracked the accused and trapped him. But instead of informing the police, he learnt the tricks of trade from the accused and started targeting people to make easy money,” said Om Prakash, station house officer, Sector 17, Chandigarh. So far, he was arrested only once in a case in Sirhind. SHO Om Prakash added, “The accused keeps shuttling between Delhi and Chandigarh to avoid being caught. We have shared information with Delhi police to get details of cases against him.” Has 3 wivesA native of Jammu, he reportedly has three wives—one stays in Jammu, the second is in Punjab while the third is in Meghalaya.

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Rape convict Jammu and Kashmir sub-judge dismissed from service||The J&K government dismissed from service suspended sub-judge Rajesh Kumar Abrol on Friday. On October 23, the judge was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail for raping and cheating a woman petitioner, who had appeared in his court in 2018 to seek justice in case of a matrimonial dispute. “The lieutenant governor is pleased to accord sanction to the dismissal of the services of Rajesh Kumar Abrol as civil judge (senior division) sub-judge (under suspension) with effect from October 21, 2021,” read an order issued by secretary, law, Achal Sethi. The government invoked Article 311 of the Constitution following recommendations of the full court of the high court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. On October 21, a fast-track court had convicted Abrol in Jammu for rape and cheating a woman who had sought legal help from him in 2018. “The conclusion that emerges from the discussion is that all the evidence on record unerringly points toward the guilt of the accused,” Khalil Choudhary, presiding officer of the fast-track court, Jammu, had observed in his judgment. The court had observed that all the evidence on record unerringly point toward the guilt of the accused. The court observed: “Persons of influence, keeping in view their reach, impact and authority they wield on the general public or the specific class to which they belong owe a duty and have to be more responsible they are expected to know and perceive the meaning of authority and law with experience and knowledge. It is reasonable to hold that they would be careful in their lives the reasonable man’s test would always be taken into consideration.” The victim woman was a resident of Ramban and met Abrol of Lower Roop Nagar, Jammu, while she was contesting a case. Being a judicial officer, Abrol promised legal help and sought domestic support from her. Having a minor girl to support, the woman started working in the house of the sub-judge, who also promised better education to her daughter. The accused promised her to pay ₹5,000 per month as salary. For seeking legal support, the accused dissolved her marriage with her husband by getting a divorce deed which was notarised and the accused told one of his PSOs to be the witness to it, the prosecution said. But the woman’s parents wanted her back with them. When Abrol got to know this, he filled her “maang” with “babuti” and told her that she was his wife now. “By doing so, the accused secured her consent to have sexual intercourse with her. She succumbed to his pressure and did not share the same with anyone around,” the prosecution had submitted then. As per the prosecution, after one year, the woman came to know that he had betrayed her by marrying her while being married to his second wife as he had already divorced his first wife.

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Delimitation commission is BJP’s panel; no faith in it: Mehbooba Mufti||President of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday said that “delimitation commission is BJP’s commission” and that “we have no faith in it”. The panel mandated to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir are scheduled to convene its second meeting with the associate members at Delhi on December 20. Mehbooba also asked the youth to join the struggle for the restoration of their rights “snatched” by the BJP government via non-violent means and not with stones and guns. Responding to media queries at Rajouri, the PDP president said, “As far as the delimitation commission is concerned, it is BJP’s commission and it will try to redraw boundaries in a way to disempower the people and create a rift between the majority and minority communities. It will increase seats in a way that could help the BJP. Therefore, we have no faith in it.” On change brought in land use in J&K, she described it a bad move, which “smacked of conspiracy to bring a demographic change in the Muslim majority region”. “The new law is very bad. It is another conspiracy and part of a hidden agenda. The land use title has been changed because they want that more people from outside to buy land in J&K and bring a demographic change,” she said. “We had a law --land to the tiller but they want to weaken it further and they want to bring a change in population ratio between majority and minority,” she added. On the arrest of PDP leaders and summons by the NIA, she attributed it to the politics of the PDP, which has raised its voice against the BJP narrative. “This is because PDP raises the voice against the BJP’s narrative. We debunk their claims of normalcy in J&K and, therefore, they use the ED and the NIA, but we won’t give up. Politically they can’t fight us and that is why they use ED and NIA,” she said. Earlier, at the rally, she called on the youth to join the struggle for restoration of their rights “snatched” by the Centre and said non-violence, not “stones or guns”, was the way ahead.

However, it has already delayed the questionnaires which could be sent to the local bodies only at the end of June, said Satti.Despite efforts to collect information from the local bodies about their income and expenditure, only 20% of municipalities have submitted their response.Later, the submission of filled-up questionnaires by the local bodies was affected by the byelections in October and November as a majority of field staff was engaged in poll duties.After considering all these facts, it has been decided to recommend to the state government to extend the term of the commission up to October 2022, Satti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6th-himachal-finance-commission-seeks-extension-of-term-101639860914014.html

19-12-2021||Chandigarh||HC: Female victim’s statement is sufficient to proceed against accused||The testimony of a prosecutrix in a case of crime against women does not require any corroboration and is sufficient to proceed against an accused, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said. The trial court is not required to look for any other supportive or new material at the time of framing of charges, the court added. The high court bench of justice Suvir Sehgal was dealing with a plea from one Balkar Singh of Mansa. According to allegations levelled by a woman, he had a property dispute with her. On spotting the woman working in the courtyard of her house on October 25, 2016, he allegedly stopped his tractor and co-accused Bhola Singh instigated him to disgrace her. Upon this, both allegedly entered her house, and Balkar Singh molested her and tried to drag her inside. When she resisted his attempts, he assaulted her and inflicted injuries on her, it was alleged, following which an FIR was registered for outraging woman’s modesty, house trespass and voluntarily causing hurt.The woman had named Balkar consistently, and categorically deposed regarding his role. However, police filed the chargesheet only against the co-accused, Bhola Singh. The police probe had concluded that Balkar was not in the village at the time of the incident on the basis of the tower location of his mobile phone. The trial court framed charges against the co-accused, but on the basis of the woman’s plea, the revisional court ordered Balkar’s summoning as an additional accused. He had challenged this order before the high court, claiming that order passed by the revisional court is not sustainable as it ignored that the investigation found him innocent.The high court said the apex court has spelt out that what trial court has to examine at the time of framing of charges is whether prime facie case is made out for framing of charge. It further said that the material on record has to be examined in this background. Since, the woman has consistently and categorically deposed regarding Balkar’s role, he ought to be summoned, said the high court. “The evidence of the prosecutrix has been placed on a much higher pedestal than that of an injured witness by the Supreme Court,” the bench observed, adding that her testimony does not require any corroboration and is sufficient to proceed against the accused. Dismissing Balkar’s plea, it directed the trial court to frame fresh charges and conduct the trial again. 
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||BSF shoots down drone along Pak border in Punjab||The Border Security Force (BSF) shot down a drone along the India-Pakistan border in Punjab late on Friday night. BSF officials said the Chinese-made drone was detected and downed near the Wan border post in the Ferozepur sector around 11:10 pm on Friday. The black colour flying object was shot at a distance of about 300 metres from the international border and 150 metres from the border fence, they said. The drone, a hexa-copter with four power batteries, weighed around 23 kg and could carry a payload of around 10 kg, it is learnt. However, it was not carrying any payload like drugs, arms or ammunition, said the BSF. India’s border guarding organisation said a search operation is being carried out in the incident area. In the recent past, the BSF has shot down two such drones that originated in Pakistan and were carrying arms and ammunition.Captain targets Congress govt Meanwhile, the incident resulted in a political slugfest in Punjab with former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh targeting the incumbent, Charanjit Singh Channi, home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.“Instead of doing bhangra all day, Punjab CM should advise his home minister to get active and come out of denial mode. Also tell your party president (if he listens to you) to ask his elder brother Imran Khan to stop trying to disturb our border state of Punjab,” Amarinder wrote on Twitter.Hitting back at Amarinder, Randhawa reminded him that the BSF comes under the Union home ministry and not the Punjab government. “Instead of beating around bush, you (Amarinder) should call spade a spade and blame the NDA (central government) for failing to protect borders,” Randhawa wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-shoots-down-drone-along-pak-border-in-punjab-101639857194574.html
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Election manifesto should get legal status, says Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday said the election manifesto should be given the status of a legal document to ensure political parties were made liable for promises made by them. He said that the SAD will approach court to get legal status for poll manifesto as both the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party were making false promises to woo voters. The former Punjab deputy chief minister was speaking to newsmen after holding a massive rally in support of SAD candidate Surjit Singh Rakhra at Samana. He said the Akali Dal had also written to the Election Commission to devise ways and means to get the election manifesto enforced. “We will also move court if need be to ensure no political party befools people by making wild promises and gets away with it. We also feel that this clause should be included in the Representation of the People Act,” said Sukhbir, adding that Congress and AAP leaders were making promises that are not feasible.  “Kejriwal does not have any intention of implementing even one of the promises made by him as he has not implemented them in Delhi too,” he alleged, while also targeting former chief minister Amarinder Singh for failing to fulfil promises made ahead of the previous elections. Speaking about the Congress government, Badal said its days were numbered. “CM Charanjit Singh Channi is being greeted with empty chairs and protests by various sections of people, including employees. This is because Channi promised big but did not deliver anything. People will not forgive him for playing with their sentiments,” he said. 
19-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: After Captain’s exit, it’s a tall order for Congress to hold on to its Patiala bastion||When Captain Amarinder Singh led the Congress to a decisive win in the 2017 assembly elections, he also cemented the party’s position in his royal constituency of Patiala. The Congress won from seven out of the eight assembly segments in the district, but holding on to these seats won’t be a cakewalk this time. It’s also a test of clout for Amarinder, whose newly floated Punjab Lok Congress will fight the elections in alliance with the BJP. Meanwhile, the SAD-BSP alliance and AAP raise the stakes and make the contest multi-cornered. Hindustan Times looks at the political landscape and key issues in each of the assembly segments in the district:Patiala: A test of clout between Capt and Cong An urban segment, it is the stronghold of Patiala royals since Captain Amarinder Singh joined the Congress. Though Hindus comprise a majority, urban Sikhs hold an equivalent sway. After Surjit Singh Kohli, who won in 1997, SAD has experimented with Bhagwan Dass Juneja (2014 bypoll) and General JJ Singh (2017 polls), but none could revive its fortune. Now, it has fielded Juneja’s son Harpal. Amarinder commands respect from all communities, as mostly all were settled here by his forefathers. However, the voters have traditionally supported the Congress, and with Amarinder parting ways with the party, it might be tough for him to enjoy the same old clout. However, the BJP’s entry might tilt the balance in Amarinder’s favour once again, as the RSS holds sway in the walled city and the former two-time CM has forged an alliance with the saffron party. Meanwhile, the Royal City has not seen much development, with most works just being cosmetic. Nabha: Dropped from cabinet, MLA still holds sway Nabha comprises the erstwhile royal town and almost 150 villages. While the town is dominated by Hindus, Jat Sikhs and Dalits are dominant communities in the rural belt. Traditionally a Congress stronghold, the segment is represented by Sadhu Singh Dharamsot. Brought in after the seat was reserved in 2012, he has won twice and was also awarded with a place in the cabinet. Even as he was dropped from the cabinet amid corruption charges, the Dalit leader still remains dominant in Nabha. The SAD, in 2012, had fielded Kabir Dass, another Dalit face poached from the Congress. Though he lost, he has made inroads and will contest against Dharamsot again. Even the AAP has a strong support base, and Gurdev Singh Dev Mann, who finished second in 2017, is eyeing the party ticket. However, with Captain Amarinder Singh floating a new party, the fight will be four-cornered, as the royal family also holds sway in the area. As for local issues, sewerage disposal is the key one in the city, while unemployment is the major one in rural areas. Patiala Rural: Mayor vs Mohindra makes it tight battleThough named rural, only 25% of the voters in this segment reside in the 70-odd villages. Tripuri and Urban Estate comprise the significant vote bank, and are a Congress stronghold, with Hindus and Bahwalpur community holding the sway. Brahm Mohindra has won the past two elections from here, and after a patch-up with Captain Amarinder Singh, he had enjoyed maximum influence under his government. Mohindra has pumped in a lot of funds in the constituency and ensured overall development, but there is still a strong anti-incumbency. As Mohindra is not in the pink of his health, his son Mohit is holding the fort for the past two years. Meanwhile, Patiala mayor Sanjiv Bittu, who was earlier eyeing the Congress ticket, has joined Captain Amarinder’s Punjab Lok Congress and might spell trouble for Mohindras and Congress. The SAD has fielded Jaspal Singh Bittu Chahta, a former councillor, but winning the seat is a tall order for him. Even as the AAP secured the second position in 2017, a repeat might be difficult. Rajpura: A Hindu dominant seat with familiar faces in frayRajpura and Banur towns along with a number of villages form this assembly segment. Hindus, especially the Bahwalpur community, decides the fate of candidates. After the demise of Balramji Das Tandon, the saffron party has failed to capitalise in this Hindu dominant town. After him, Raj Khurana was the only leader having support of the Bahwalpur community, and he won the seat on both BJP (2007) and Congress (2012) ticket. The BJP’s 2017 nominee, Harjit Singh Grewal, is in the centre of controversies over his support to farm laws. For the Congress, Hardial Singh Kamboj is a familiar face and he has done the ground work. His only problem is the emergence of Punjab Lok Congress, as Preneet Kaur’s loyalist Jagdev Singh Jagga has already thrown his hat in the ring to cut the Congress vote share. The AAP has strong support in both rural and urban areas, and has fielded Neena Mittal, another familiar face. Drugs and illegal lottery are biggest problems in the area. Due to a massive increase in population, locals are also demanding improvement in civic amenities.Samana: A rural seat shuttling between Congress, AkalisThe Aggarwal community owns key businesses, and thus wields strong political influence in Samana, a predominantly rural segment. In 2017, Rajinder Singh, son of the Mandi Board chairman Laal Singh, won the seat for the Congress. He is banking upon the Congress vote bank, personal rapport of his father, and development works undertaken in the past five years. Surjit Singh Rakhra, one of the liberal faces of the SAD, enjoys support in both rural and urban areas and even defeated Raninder Singh, son of Captain Amarinder Singh, in the 2007 elections. A member of a US-based business family, the soft-spoken former rural development minister is known for his development agenda as he had infused a lot of funds in Samana. The Dera Sacha Sauda also holds sway in the area, and its followers had voted for Rakhra last time. The RSS and BJP also have a significant support base in Samana town. A BJP candidate or Sandeep Singla, who is being projected by Captain Amarinder’s party, will make the contest multidimensional. As for the AAP, no prominent leader has been active here in recent times. Lack of civic amenities is a major issue in urban areas, while the SAD is projecting the lack of development in rural areas as the major issue. Ghanaur: A keen contest as Akali veteran enters the frayGhanuar is a rural segment that shares border with Haryana. It is the first area in Punjab where residents will get canal-based water supply, for which work is in the final stages. A hub of illegal mining and liquor smuggling, it also suffers from frequent flooding in the Ghaggar. Politically, the Congress and SAD have remained neck and neck in this constituency. The seat is set for a tough fight as the SAD has fielded its senior leader and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, who is known for his aggressive politics, while ignoring former MLA Harpreet Kaur Mukhmailpur, whose family enjoys a significant support. Mukhmailpur is in touch with Captain Amarinder and might contest on the Punjab Lok Congress ticket, denting the vote share of both the Congress and Akalis. Meanwhile, sitting Congress MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur, a staunch supporter-turned-critic of Preneet Kaur, has risen in clout after the ouster of Captain Amarinder Singh and is popular among the masses. With kabaddi player Gurlal Singh Ghanaur contesting on the AAP ticket, the winning margins are likely to be very thin this time. Shutrana: Capt’s party expected to change political landscape Sitting Congress MLA Nirmal Singh is a seasoned politician and has won the Shutrana seat thrice, either as an Akali or Congress candidate. However, age has taken its toll on this Dalit leader, and the Congress is looking for a new face. Though Nirmal Singh wants the party ticket for his son, a retired excise official and a former MLA are also in the fray. In this mostly rural segment, Aggarwal and Brahmin business communities of Patran town hold the sway and have traditionally voted for the Congress. The SAD has fielded Vaninder Kaur Loomba, whose father was also active in politics and enjoys a good rapport. She is the wife of transport department official Karan Singh. Even the AAP has a strong presence in the area. However, the personal rapport of Preneet Kaur in the area will be the key in the election. She has personally supervised development works, and the entry of Punjab Lok Congress is expected to change the political landscape in Shutrana. Sanour: Two Congress power centres leave workers confusedSanour, a rural segment, was once the stronghold of former SGPC chief and Akali stalwart Gurcharan Singh Tohra, but with the passage of time, Laal Singh made it a Congress bastion. In view of the “one family, one ticket” policy, Laal Singh had to sit out as his son was fielded from Samana in 2017. The party fielded Harinderpal Singh Harry Mann from Sanour, but he lost to Akali leader Prem Singh Chandumajra’s son Harinderpal, who remains a strong candidate even this time. After the Congress managed an impressive lead of nearly 42,000 votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from this assembly segment — highest in Punjab — Harry Mann was back in the reckoning. However, Laal Singh’s return has left the party workers confused and divided. Last time, the AAP has fielded Kuldeep Kaur Tohra, daughter of Gurcharan Tohra, but she failed to do anything remarkable. Thus, the AAP has now fielded SAD turncoat Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra. What makes the poll battle more interesting is the entry of son of Bikram Singh Chahal, son of Captain Amarinder Singh’s adviser Bharat Inder Singh Chahal, who has projected himself as the Punjab Lok Congress candidate from Sanour. For the voters, lack of development, water contamination, poor health facilities and Ghaggar floods are the key issues.

If I lose the debate, I will leave politics,” said Sidhu, addressing a rally in Sultanpur Lodhi in favour of sitting MLA, Navtej Singh Cheema; he categorically backed him as the party candidate in 2022 tate assembly polls. “Kejriwal is a liar, as he has announced generation of ₹20,000 crore from mining. The fact is that the previous Akali government deposited ₹40 crore a year in treasury from mining; the Congress government is earning between ₹200 crore and ₹300 crore. Where will Kejriwal get the remaining ₹20,000? No state is earning over ₹3,000 crore from mining,” he claimed, alleging that Kejriwal had also allowed sale of liquor on streets of Delhi. “I am not in favour of liquor but if liquor has to sell then why not it would be through government channels,” he claimed, adding, “My battle is for the state and either the mafia will stay in Punjab or I.” He also announced that if voted to power, the new Congress government in Punjab will provide ₹400 per day allowance to marginal farmers (under 5 acres) and farm labourers under his Punjab model. He also accused Kejriwal of allowing only private buses of the Badal family to ply to the Delhi international airport. “Why are only private buses of Sukhbir being allowed to ply to Delhi. Is it because you are conniving with the Badals. Why did you apologise from ex-Akali minister, Bikram Singh Majithia,” alleged Sidhu, a former cabinet minister.

19-12-2021||Delhi||Cops to examine security lapses in Rohini court after blast exposes loopholes||Delhi Police on Saturday said that they have launched a probe into the major security lapse at the Rohini court complex where a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientist was allegedly able to smuggle in an improvised explosive device (IED) without raising any suspicion. Police said the suspect, Bharat Bhushan Kataria, wanted to murder his former neighbour, a lawyer, over a decade-long rivalry.According to police, CCTV footage from the entrance gate on December 9 showed that Kataria, who was dressed as a lawyer, entered the court complex carrying two bags, one of them containing the IED in a steel tiffin box, and even passed through the door frame metal detector (DFMD) at gate number 7 without raising any suspicion. The video footage from the entry gate showed that Kataria also raised the bag containing the bomb, keeping it away from the hand-held metal detector, during frisking.Officials said there was a baggage scanner installed at the gate but it was not clear if Kataria’s bags went through it.“The statements of the security personnel present at the gates will be recorded to ascertain if the DFMD or the hand held metal detector had beeped when Kataria was frisked during his entry. If the machines were functioning properly and had beeped after detecting the metal item (the steel tiffin box), why did they not bother to open the bag and search. Prime facie, it seems that the personnel ignored the beep, thinking that it was just a lawyer carrying his lunch box,” said a police officer, who asked not to be named.A double-layer security arrangement was put in place at all the nine entry and exit gates of the Rohini court complex, after dreaded gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi, was shot dead by two gunmen dressed as lawyers in courtroom number 207 on September 24 this year.Apart from increasing the deployment of police personnel, the number of CCTV cameras installed in the premises were increased and baggage scanners, DFMD and hand-held metal detectors were also provided to assist the security personnel.How the scientist sneaked inDeputy commissioner of police (special cell) Rajeev Ranjan Singh said that Kataria, dressed as a lawyer and carrying two bags, arrived outside the court in his Ertiga car around 9.30am and entered the premises through gate number 7.“Kataria left the bags at a booth selling milk products in the court complex and left the premises using the same gate. The footage shows that a few minutes later, he tried to enter using gate number 9 but failed. Thereafter, he went to gate number 8 and entered the court premises again. He was actually trying to weave an evasive pattern,” said DCP Singh.Police said Kataria retrieved the bags from the booth and went inside the court building, from where his movements could not be captured as there are no cameras installed inside. He is later seen leaving the court complex in a hurry at 10.35am, nearly 10 minutes after the blast, from gate number 8 with only one bag on his shoulders. Kataria was finally seen leaving in his car using the Ring Road.Logo on bag turns crucial leadPolice said that a damaged laptop bag recovered from the spot turned a crucial lead as it contained the logo of a Mumbai-based company, which made the bag for distribution to the employees of another Delhi-based multinational medical equipment firm in 2006.“We found that one Anil Kataria, a relative of the DRDO scientist, was the company’s director (sales and marketing). Analysis of all cases listed in the courtroom on December 9 revealed that the scientist’s case was also up for hearing on that day. We dug further and learnt that the scientist’s opponent in the case, lawyer Amit Vashisht, was seated on a chair closest to the blast site and he had received minor leg injury apart from the shock,” said an investigator.After establishing a possible link, the investigating team scanned the video footage and identified Kataria entering the court complex with two bags but leaving with only one. Some other witnesses also confirmed Kataria’s presence, said DCP Singh.“After careful scrutiny of all available evidence, Kataria was questioned on Friday and subsequently arrested the same day. We searched his house and found several file covers, identical to those which were in the IED bag, similar screws that were used as shrapnel in the IED, and remnants of the black adhesive tape used in assembling the IED. The black coat and trouser worn by him on that day were also recovered. Some incriminating documents and other electronic devices including laptops and mobile phones have also been seized for further investigation,” added Singh.
19-12-2021||Delhi||Most pvt schools wait, may reopen tomorrow||A day after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR and regional areas announced several relaxations to pollution curbs, a few government schools restarted physical classes even as public infrastructure projects in the city awaited more clarity from the Delhi government.CAQM on Friday allowed schools and other educational institutions to be reopened in a phased manner from Saturday, and allowed resumption of work on “linear public projects”, including roads, highways, underpasses, overbridges, flyovers and pipelines along with projects related to health infrastructure, sanitation and public utility, even as the ban continued to be in place for other construction projects.While the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DOE) subsequently issued directions to restart classes from Class 6 onwards in city schools from December 18 within minutes of the CAQM order, officials from the Public Works Department (PWD) — the primary Delhi government construction agency — said they were waiting for similar orders regarding resumption of construction work.“We needed some clarity around the exemptions so work has not started immediately on our sites,” a senior PWD official confirmed.Delhi environment department officials later clarified that there will not be a separate order for resuming construction of public projects. “We will not be issuing a separate order on construction exemptions. CAQM order issued on Friday will be considered as the final word,” a senior environment department official said.Meanwhile, Delhi government schools welcomed senior students back on campus on Saturday while many private schools began seeking permission from students’ parents to restart classes from Monday.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that classes will resume from Monday, adding that the school will take some time to resume transport services. “We map the bus routes and work out the modalities but there is some disruption or closure each time, due to which the process gets derailed. We will wait for another 10 days before resuming services,” said Arora.Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, and the chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said that her school had informed parents and was in the process of taking their consents.“Students are excited and we hope to see them back in the classrooms next week. While we are yet to decide the winter vacation, we hope to hold online classes during the break for students in grades above 9,” She said.On November 16, on the directions of the Supreme Court, the CAQM banned construction and demolition activities in Delhi and NCR, along with calling in other curbs on polluting sources, such as banning the entry of trucks, except those carrying essential items, into Delhi; ordering action against industries operating on unclean fuels; and allowing only scheduled operations for thermal power plants.
19-12-2021||Delhi||4 dead after truck topples onto auto near IGI Stadium||Four persons, including a 13-year-old boy, were crushed to death after an allegedly speeding container truck loaded with rice fell on the autorickshaw they were travelling in near the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on the Ring Road in central Delhi on Saturday morning, police said.Though the driver and the helper of the truck -- identified as Pratish Choudhary (29) and Nitish (24), respectively -- fled the spot immediately after the accident, police said they were arrested by Saturday evening.The accident affected traffic movement on the road through the day as the loaded container could not be removed till late evening.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Singh Chauhan said that the four deceased were identified as auto driver Surender Yadav (40), his nephew Jay Yadav (32), and two other passengers Komal Singh (35) and his nephew Tata Prakash (13). Police said the driver and his nephew hailed from Madhubani in Bihar, and the two passengers were from Uttar Pradesh.Police said the auto driver had picked up the two passengers from Seelampur and was going to drop them at Srinivaspuri, where Singh had landed a job as a cook in a police chowki and was reporting for his first day of work.Singh came to the city on Friday with Prakash, who came along for sightseeing, said his relative Neeraj.Although police have not established the exact reason for the accident, preliminary investigation suggests that the truck -- heading towards Tughlaqabad container depot from Sonepat -- was descending the Salimgarh bypass flyover at a high speed when the driver lost control of the vehicle and fell on the auto on its right. Officials said marks on the road suggest that the truck skid for a few metres with the crushed auto under it before coming to a stop.DCP Chauhan said that the accident took place at around 7am on the Ring Road outside gate number 16 of the stadium.A police patrol team tried unsuccessfully to move the container with the help of some passersby, following which rescue teams from the fire department and other rescue agencies used a crane to lift the container truck.“The auto had turned into a mangled heap and we had to cut the frame to recover the bodies. Except the driver, the other three occupants were crushed beyond recognition. Initially, only the driver and his nephew were identified. The other two were identified with the help of the documents found in their pockets,” said a police officer, who asked not to be named.Family members of the deceased reached Lok Nayak hospital mortuary after being informed about the deaths by the police.This is the second accident in Delhi in the last 10 days -- on the night of December 8, a 37-year-old legal consultant of a private firm and his 32-year-old wife were killed when a truck carrying building material toppled on their car in south Delhi’s RK Puram area. Their six-year-old daughter, who was also with them in the car, survived the accident.Data from Delhi Traffic Police shows that till September 15 this year, 99 people lost their lives in 91 accidents caused by trucks on the city’s streets.
19-12-2021||Delhi||In blast build-up, 11-yr-long tussle played out on streets, inside court||The low-intensity explosion at the Rohini court complex on December 9, executed by a DRDO scientist to kill his former neighbour — an advocate, was a result of a 11-year-old legal battle between them that played out on the roads, courts, police stations, and offices of the Ministry of Defence and the Central Information Commission. According to police, the two men lived with their families in the same building in Ashok Vihar’s A-block until three years ago, and initially fought over the construction of a water tank on the terrace of their building in 2011.Documents seen by HT showed that on March 11, 2015, the arrested blast suspect, Bharat Bhushan Kataria (47), had filed a police complaint against the neighbour, lawyer Amit Vashisht, alleging that the latter had sent goons to kill him in a road accident. Kataria had filed the complaint after he was allegedly hit by a Wagon R car in northwest Delhi’s Keshav Puram while returning home on his motorcycle. In his complaint, he alleged that the men in the Wagon R car had shouted, “Amit se panga padega mehanga (a fight with Amit will be costly)” before fleeing from the scene.Calling the allegations false, Vashisht subsequently wrote to senior Delhi Police officers, seeking to change the investigating officer of the case.Delhi Police officers, who interrogated Kataria after his latest arrest, said the suspect claimed that Vashisht filed complaints with the DRDO, alleging that he took a bribe from a private lift management company, engaged by the Ministry of Defence, to install an elevator in their building.Kataria further told police said that Vashisht and his family had also filed RTI appeals with the Central Information Commission when the defence ministry refused to share details about Kataria’s alleged conflict of interest in hiring a DRDO-appointed company for the private work. On October 24, 2016, CIC directed DRDO to share with Vashisht the names of vendors hired by DRDO.To be sure, the Delhi Police special cell probing the Rohini court blast case is not involved or concerned with the allegations or counter allegations between the two men in the past.Police officers, who questioned Kataria, said that he has filed at least four criminal cases -- ranging from assault and criminal intimidation to wrongful restraint and molestation -- against Vashisht at Ashok Vihar, Keshav Puram and Jahangirpuri police stations.“From fights over parking their vehicles and throwing water at one another’s house to allegations of molestation and attempted murder, the two men and their families were fighting for over a decade,” said a police officer. Vashisht was not available for comment as his cellphone was switched off and a text message sent to him remained unanswered. 
19-12-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Auto driver booked for allegedly molesting 28-year-old passenger||An auto driver was booked on Saturday for allegedly molesting a 28-year-old woman, who was travelling with her four-year old daughter, when she objected to him taking a “wrong route” in Greater Noida on Thursday night. The woman eventually jumped off the auto with her child, and raised an alarm.The auto driver managed to escape before the police could reach the spot, said officials.The woman is a resident of Delhi’s Ashram, and lives with her husband and daughter. The woman had gone to Surajpur on Thursday to meet her unwell brother.“I am an auto driver in Delhi... so, I do not have a permit to run my auto in the National Capital Region (NCR). I booked a shared auto for my wife and daughter from Rajnigandha Chowk in Noida Sector 16 at 10:50pm to Greater Noida, and noted down the registration number of the auto,” the victim’s husband said, adding that the auto driver picked up some other passengers and left for Greater Noida.“The auto driver dropped all other passengers on the way, except for the mother-daughter duo, and got a CNG from a fuel station. From there, another auto driver started the ride,” he added.The victim said in her complaint that the auto driver took a wrong route near the CRPF camp in Greater Noida. “When I objected, he molested and beat me. I jumped off the auto with my child, and sought help from passersby. Meanwhile, the driver escaped with the auto,” she said.The husband said, “My wife made a phone call to me immediately after the incident. We reported the matter to the police. An official team from the Ecotech 3 police station reached the spot and launched a search, but the suspect had managed to escape by then. We provided the police with the registration number of the auto, and hope that the suspect is arrested at the earliest.”Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said a case has been registered against the unidentified auto driver under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) on Friday. “We have identified the auto used in the incident, and the auto driver will be arrested soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-auto-driver-booked-for-allegedly-molesting-28-year-old-passenger-101639855693002.html
19-12-2021||Noida||Five arrested for robbing driver of tractor-trolley in Greater Noida||The police arrested five people on Saturday for allegedly robbing a tractor-trolley after offering a driver a beverage laced with sedatives in Greater Noida nearly five months ago, said officials.Sudhir Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Kasna police station, said the victim — Ranpal Bhati, 50, a resident of Dada village — filed a complaint against the suspects at the police station on July 5.Police identified the suspects as Sher Singh, 21, Mahtab, 30, Monu Kumar, 36 — all residents of Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh; and Kanhaiya, 36, and Hari Shankar, 27 — residents of Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur and Mathura, who have been involved in similar crimes.Bhati told the police that Sher had called him on July 5 and booked a tractor-trolley to transport goods from Greater Noida’s Acher to Kasna. “My driver Sunny Deol, 30, had gone for the assignment with the tractor. However, the suspect’s cellphone was switched off when we tried to reach him. After two hours, when we searched for Deol, we found him unconscious in Acher, and the vehicle was missing,” Bhati said in his complaint.Later, Deol told the police that three suspects — Sher, Kanhaiya and Shankar — had offered him a cold drink laced with sedatives after he met them for the service. “Deol consumed the cold drink and was unconscious. The three suspects then escaped with the tractor-trolley, leaving Deol in Acher,” said SHO Kumar.A case was registered against three suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc, with intent to commit an offence) and 379 (theft) at the Kasna police station on July 5.“On Saturday, we received a tip about the suspects’ movement near Sirsa Cut in Kasna. A police team reached the spot and arrested all the five suspects from there,” said SHO Kumar.Police have also recovered two countrymade guns, two knives, two tractors, and a stolen cellphone from their possession. They were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-arrested-for-robbing-driver-of-tractor-trolley-in-greater-noida-101639855691567.html
19-12-2021||Noida||Homebuyers continue to demand vigilance dept, grievance cell in Noida authority||Many homebuyers in the city alleged on Saturday that the “Noida authority officials do not bother about transparency, and ignore issues faced by the people”.This came one day after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in its performance audit report, claimed “gaps in the governance structure of the Noida authority”, which has translated into extremely poor outcomes for all principal stakeholders including the authority, the government of Uttar Pradesh, industries, and the public, specifically the homebuyers.The homebuyers said that the state government kept ignoring their demands of setting up a dedicated vigilance department in the Noida authority, to handle corruption complaints filed against the authority officials. In 2017, they wrote a letter to the state government and officials concerned, demanding an independent vigilance body and a grievance cell be set up in the Noida authority for the homebuyers. “But nothing has happened so far, because it seems that the Uttar Pradesh government has not bothered to act on these issues, or take action against corrupt officials,” said SK Nagrath, president of Jaypee Aman homebuyers welfare association, who is also a resident of Noida Sector 41.“We had written a letter to Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding an independent vigilance body and a grievance cell in the Noida authority, , but no action was taken,” Nagrath said, adding that public representatives and senior officers should ensure that “residents as well as homebuyers in Noida are not unduly troubled by the authority”.Mangeram Bhati, an advocate and member of Gautam Budh Nagar Bar Council, said, “For example, if any clerk asks for a bribe, where should we file a complaint? We have to go to the same corrupt officials to file a complaint. There is an immediate need for a separate vigilance team, which can probe and act on such complaints.”Uttar Pradesh industry minister Satish Mahana, however, refuted the allegations that their government has not been taking action in corruption cases from Noida. “We launch probes in corruption cases, be it against any official or department of the Noida authority. We have addressed all issues faced by the homebuyers and others too in the past... Our government has zero tolerance against corruption,” Mahana said.

Raising question over the delay in taking charge, in an open letter, NSUI (BHU) president Rana Rohit asked, “Prof Jain should make it clear as to why he is not taking charge despite being appointed the new V-C around a month ago. He visited the campus few days back, stayed for six days here and held meetings with BHU officials, and went back thereafter.” Former V-C Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar’s term ended on March 28. Since then, Prof VK Shukla is serving as the officiating vice-chancellor.Many faculty members also raised questions over delay in taking the charge by him. Prof Om Shankar, HoD, cardiology at the Institute of Medical Sciences-BHU (IMS-BHU), said, “It is surprising that over a month has passed since appointment of new V-C Prof Sudhir Jain. He should make it clear as to why he hasn’t yet taken charge.” Former officer on special duty of BHU, Vishwanath Pandey said, “Government should take note of it and ask him to join at the earliest. For the last nine months, the BHU doesn’t have a regular vice-chancellor due to which several policy decisions such as promotions of teachers are getting delayed.

To note, several teams of the income tax department raided offices and residences of the state’s main opposition party leaders on Saturday. “We were wondering where the I-T department was. This (raids) was awaited. First big leaders from Delhi have been coming to UP (poll scene) and now I-T has come. Soon ED and other agencies will come in. I had always been saying that as imminent defeat is nagging the BJP, such things would begin. Anyone who takes on this government will be victimized. Look at Azam Khan (SP MP who is in jail for land grabbing issue), look at farmers, what the BJP government has done to them.” “Now the income tax department has come into the election fray. This is not CBI or I-T elections. It’s peoples’ election. People have made up their mind to oust this government that has caused Killat, Dikkat, and Zillat (scarcity, adversity, and humiliation) to people”, he said. “Rajiv Rai is a spokesperson of the party. Why did the raid come shortly before the elections? Why didn’t the I-T department act when he submitted his balance sheet and other documents?” Akhilesh also attacked the Congress over the “ tactics of using ED, CBI, I-T against rivals” and said, “The BJP is treading the path shown by the Congress, which started this culture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-attacks-bjp-govt-overi-t-raids-on-party-men-s-premises-101639853411349.html

19-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra forms eight mental health review boards||Mumbai: Maharashtra has formed eight Mental Health Review Boards (MHRB) under the mandate of the Mental Healthcare Act (2017), which provides for a review board for each district in the country. Starting February 2022, three of the boards will function from the state’s regional mental hospitals in Thane, Pune and Nagpur, while the other five will operate from Kolhapur, Nashik, Akola, Aurangabad, and Latur. One of the board’s main functions will be to register, review, alter, modify or cancel an advance directive made by an individual. As per the Act, a mentally-ill person shall have the right to make an advance directive that states how he wants to be treated for the illness during a mental health situation and who his nominated representative shall be. Each review board will be helmed by a chief judicial magistrate and include other members such as a medical practitioner, a psychiatrist, two recovered psychiatric patients or care-givers and a representative of the district collector or district magistrate or deputy commissioner among others. “Before the 2017 Act was implemented, if a patient had to be admitted to a mental health facility, the relatives of the care giver would require an order from the magistrate. Now, the patients can be evaluated by the psychiatrists and the admission has to be informed to the review board,” said Dr Vijay Maskar, a medical officer with the Directorate of Health Services. “The board can be approached for appeals, review admissions and look into conflicts if any,” he said adding that prior permission of the board has to be sought in case of a minor or a woman has to undergo Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). The state has issued appointment letters to members of the board who were chosen after calling for applications through advertisements followed by interviews.Psychiatrist Dr Bharat Vatwani who has been appointed as the review board member for Thane district said that the boards will serve as checkpoints to ensure that patient’s rights are safeguarded. Dr Sanjay Kumawat, a psychiatrist who practices in Thane and Mulund and has worked with the state health department for nearly three decades expressed concern about the lack of budgeting and the workload as only eight review boards will have to cater to 36 districts in the state. “If implemented thoroughly, the boards will have an important role to play to ensure that patients don’t languish in institutions for a long time. For instance, the boards will have to mandatorily take an update on the number of days a patient spends in a facility and review the situation on a case-to-case basis,” said Kumavat. “We will gradually cover all districts, but for now, we are working to make these eight boards functional from February,” a state health official said. “We are currently working out their remuneration and other logistics for their everyday functioning,” the official said.The law came into force in 2017, repealing an earlier version, and offers wide-ranging protections of rights to persons requiring mental health care and services. According to a study in 2017 in Lancet Psychiatry, 14.3% of India’s population (or 197.3 million people) suffer from mental illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forms-eight-mental-health-review-boards-101639852272796.html

Ecogreen, the subsidiary of a Chinese firm, is the MCG’s concessionaire for the WTE project.The development comes a week after Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar laid the foundation stone for the WTE plant at Bandhwari on December 10.“The construction of the WTE project will commence in March. Our technical experts from China will arrive around this time and oversee the project. We are targeting to complete the project within an 18-month time frame, and meet the December 2023 deadline set by the MCG,” said Sanjeev Sharma, spokesperson, Ecogreen.According to MCG officials, during a Swachh Survekshan 2022 meeting held at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Friday, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja asked Ecogreen for an update on the WTE project, to which the company said that the construction can only commence in March next year as they need technical experts from China to come to Gurugram and oversee the project.However, the MCG officials said that they will meet the December 2023 deadline for the project.

The 59.77km-long expressway, starting from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Kashi toll plaza in Meerut, was made fully operational for commuters in April. NHAI officials said vehicles, such as jeeps/cars, will be charged ₹140 for travelling the entire distance (on one side) from Sarai Kale Khan to Kashi toll plaza while the toll rate would be somewhere between ₹225 and ₹900 for different categories of light and heavy commercial vehicles for plying on the same stretch. According to the toll rate chart, the per kilometre distance for the entire stretch (one side) would be about ₹2.34. “The DME has entry points at Sarai Kale Khan, Indirapuram, Dundahera, Dasna, Rasoolpur-Sikrod, Bhojpur and Kashi toll plaza. The toll will be directly deducted from the bank accounts of commuters, whose vehicles are fitted with FASTags. Such vehicles will be detected with the help of the automatic number plate readers (ANPRs) installed at the entry/exit exit points,” said Arvind Kumar, project director of NHAI. In case of vehicles which do not have Fastags, the authority will recover double the toll at the exit points. Earlier in February, the Union government had made it mandatory for all vehicles to be linked to the FASTag system, which enables a vehicle to pass through toll plazas without having to pay toll in cash and cut traffic queues. “If a car travels full distance, its owner will have to pay ₹140 for covering one side of the expressway. If it returns within 24 hours, the toll rate for the return journey will be halved. The rates will come into effect from December 25. Commuters will not have to pay any toll for the routes which have not been mentioned in the rate chart,” added Kumar. One such route mentioned in the rate chart is Sarai Kale Khan, for which toll rates have been fixed for exit to only three points at Rasoolpur-Sikrod, Bhojpur and Kashi toll plaza. No rates have been defined for exit at Indirapuram, Dundahera and Dasna in Ghaziabad. According to NHAI, the annual toll collection on the expressway is estimated to be about ₹111.39 crore with cars/jeeps/light motor vehicles accounting for about 82% of the revenue and buses/trucks etc accounting for the remaining 14%. The DME has three phases — Phase 1 links Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and UP Gate in Ghaziabad; Phase 2 connects UP Gate and Dasna in Ghaziabad while Phase 4 connects Dasna to Meerut. Phase 4 is a six-lane 32-km access-controlled alignment between Dasna and Meerut. According to official estimates, Phase 1 caters to about 120,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day while Phase 2 caters to about 60,000 PCUs per day. Phase 4 caters to about 40,000 PCUs. Officials said no two-wheelers, three-wheelers or slow-moving vehicles will be allowed on expressway lanes. The inner three lanes on each side have been dedicated as expressway lanes under the DME project.

The diversity of culture and religion in the tourism-dependent country has at times been at odds with its Islamic laws and traditions.But that's changing as the nation promotes its socially liberal environment to lure international workers.

Appearing for NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’, Fauci said the new variant of concern has the extraordinary capability of spreading, adding that the United States is going to see breakthrough infections."We are going to see breakthrough infection - there is no doubt about that," the top immunologist said.The White House medical adviser has, however, ruled out the possibility of complete lockdown.“I don’t foresee the kind of lockdowns that we’ve seen before but I certainly see the potential for stress on our hospital system,” he said in a separate interview with ABC’s “This Week.”Speaking to CNN, Fauci predicted that stress on the medical system will be particularly acute in regions with low levels of vaccination.Fauci’s remarks came a day the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed Omicron circulating in at least 89 countries. The UN health agency said Covid cases involving the new variant of concern are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days in places with community transmission. It warned that Omicron is likely to soon overtake Delta as the dominant variant in countries where local transmission has taken place.The worrying rate of transmission of the Omicron variant has prompted countries around the world to tighten travel restrictions. The United Kingdom has been witnessing a record number of confirmed cases of the new variant of concern.

It displaced more than 400,000 people, damaged homes and toppled power and communication lines.The national disaster agency had already reported 31 casualties following the storm, but those figures did not include casualties in Bohol. The agency said it was still awaiting official reports from Bohol and other regions.In the southern province of Dinagat Islands, the local government on Sunday reported 10 deaths, but it was also unclear if those fatalities had already been included in the official tally from the disaster agency.Most deaths were due to fallen trees and drowning, officials said.The widespread destruction has made it difficult for authorities to immediately provide a clear picture about the extent of damage, as communication and power lines have yet to be fully restored in many areas.Rai, which at one point was a category 5 storm, made nine landfalls, with a massive trail of destruction also reported in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, Surigao del Norte, including the popular Siargao surfing destination, and Dinagat Islands.It uprooted trees, toppled roofs, flattened houses, destroyed infrastructure and flooded many towns, hampering efforts to send much needed food and water to victims.The directive from President Rodrigo Duterte was to "use all government resources to ensure that all goods are delivered as soon as possible" to calamity-stricken areas, presidential spokesperson Karlo Nograles told a radio station.Rai had displaced nearly 490,000 people in the Philippines before it moved toward the South China Sea over the weekend.In Bohol, home to some of the country's popular tourist destinations, such as the Loboc River, which overflowed, Governor Arthur Yap said the number of deaths was based only on partial reports, suggesting the death toll could still rise."It is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing," he said in video posted on his Facebook account. "People have suffered greatly in terms of destroyed homes and agricultural losses."About 20 tropical storms hit the Philippines every year, usually causing floods and landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-due-to-typhoon-rai-rises-to-100-in-philippines-101639914374145.html
19-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: These European countries have tightened Covid restrictions during Christmas||The rising cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), fuelled by the Omicron variant, in Europe has prompted several countries in the region to take precautionary measures to prevent another outbreak.Omicron is spreading across the sovereign and thriving in busy cities like London. A two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown plan has been devised to be implemented post-Christmas to prevent widespread damage across the country, as per The Times.Experts have predicted there may be more than 3,000 hospitalisations in the United Kingdom each day if a lockdown isn’t implemented by January 1.Health minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday analysis of the data suggested around 60% of all new Covid-19 cases in England are the fast-spreading Omicron variant, but the country was in a better position than last Christmas thanks to things such as vaccinations and testing."We will do what is necessary but it has got to be backed up by the data ... we are watching the data, discussing it with our scientists and our best advisers almost on an hourly basis and we will monitor that very carefully we will keep the situation under review."Also Read| UK health minister declines to commit stricter Covid rules amid lockdown reportsAfter an increase in Covid-19 cases with a hike of more than 15,000 infections daily in the Netherlands, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the country will be going into lockdown over the Christmas period.All non-essential restaurants, shops, bars, cinemas and theatres will be closed in the country from December 19 to January 14. Only two guests would be allowed to visit a house during this period, with exception of four guests on Christmas, Christmas Eve and New Year.“All this, exactly one week before Christmas. Another Christmas that is completely different from what we want. Very bad news again for all those businesses and cultural institutions that rely on the holidays,” Prime Minister Rutte said.Also Read| Netherlands 'going into lockdown again' to curb OmicronAccording to German health minister Karl Lauterbach, Germany’s health service is worried about a “massive fifth wave” coming from the Omicron variant.Travellers from the UK have been banned from entering the country, except for German nationals who regardless of their vaccination status, must quarantine for two weeks and get a negative Covid test.France has implemented similar curbs on Saturday, by banning tourists from Britain from journeying between the two countries.Also Read| Covid: Germany hits UK travellers with new restrictionsSpain’s coronavirus disease cases have risen to a ‘very high risk’ level. However, there have been no new announcements of an impending lockdown.On the other hand, Austria seems to be in a better situation with the country finally loosening its restrictions on the unvaccinated.“Christmas should show us once again how important contact with our loved ones is and how precious time together is,” health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said.Austria was the first western European country to impose a lockdown last month and seems to be among a limited few opening up in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-these-european-countries-have-tightened-covid-restrictions-during-christmas-101639910346780.html
19-12-2021||World||Over 30,000 people displaced amid Malaysia's worst flooding in years||More than 30,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Malaysia on Sunday as the country battles some of its worst flooding in years.The tropical Southeast Asian nation often sees stormy monsoon seasons towards the end of the year, with flooding regularly prompting mass evacuations.Downpours since Friday have caused rivers to overflow, submerging many urban areas and cutting off major roads, leaving thousands of motorists stranded.More than 30,000 flood victims across eight states and territories were recorded on an official government website, with over 14,000 of them in the central state of Pahang.Nearly 10,000 people fled their homes in the country's richest state of Selangor -- which surrounds the capital Kuala Lumpur -- with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressing surprise at the severe flooding there."The amount of rain that fell in Selangor yesterday, what fell in one day would usually fall in one month," he told a Sunday press conference.The premier promised swift aid for the flood victims and initial funding of 100 million ringgit ($23.7 million) to repair damaged houses and infrastructure.A government website showed water exceeding dangerous levels in six central and northeastern states Sunday afternoon.As floodwaters receded from the capital, business owners went back to their shops to clean up the damage left by the downpours.Lee Joon Kee, the owner of a tourist information centre and souvenir shop, said he had only reopened a few days ago after closing for nearly two years due to coronavirus restrictions."It's very sad but we have no choice. The only choice (we have is) to move on and clean out the mess, then we will continue our new chapter."Dozens of bus routes in and around the capital have been suspended along with train services to the port city of Klang.Operations at three water treatment plants in Selangor were also disrupted, with taps expected to run dry for tens of thousands of people in parts of the state as well as the capital.Malaysia's worst flooding in decades took place in 2014, forcing about 118,000 people to flee their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-30-000-people-displaced-amid-malaysia-s-worst-flooding-in-years-101639910413618.html
19-12-2021||World||UK health minister declines to commit stricter Covid rules amid lockdown reports||UK health secretary Sajid Javid on Sunday declined to commit to stricter rules to contain Omicron variant after top scientific advisers recommended stringent measures in view of resurgence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. Speaking to Sky News, Javid argued the government needs to strike a balance between scientific advice and the impact of stringent measures like lockdown on businesses and people.“We will keep the situation under review, but I can’t stress enough how the situation today in terms of our defences is very different,” he said, referring to the high vaccination rate and expansion of the booster program.On Saturday, British media reported that the government was drawing up plans for a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown after Christmas to break the chain of the new, highly-transmissible variant of concern. Citing the minutes of a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the reports suggested that draft regulations were being drawn up to ban indoor mixing except for work purposes.UK's confirmed Omicron tally jumps by 10,000 cases in 24 hours; now at 24,968UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was reportedly presented with a number of options ranging from "mild guidance to nudge people, right through to lockdown". The Sage advised that strong measures are needed without any delay to prevent the number of daily hospitalisations from reaching the levels of January when Britain was reporting over 3,700 hospital admissions a day."If the aim is to reduce the levels of infection in the population and prevent hospitalisations reaching these levels, more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon," the Sage minutes said, as quoted by BBC.Highlighting the high vaccination coverage and booster program, the UK health secretary said the government would “recall parliament” if there was a “need to take any further action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-declines-to-commit-stricter-covid-rules-amid-lockdown-reports-101639909458724.html

On Aug. 24 alone, 709 people died of the illness. The number of deaths has decreased in recent months due to the vaccination, experts say.Iran accelerated vaccinations in recent weeks. More than 50 million Iranians have received their second shots, and 3.5 million have received the third shots.Only 7 million Iranians had received vaccinations when President Ebrahin Raisi formed his administration in late August.Iran generally uses the China-made Sinopharm vaccine, though the Russian Sputnik-V and the vaccine made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca are also in use.Iranian officials urged people who got two doses of vaccine to get their third dose as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-reports-first-case-of-omicron-variant-of-covid-19-report-101639907901488.html
19-12-2021||World||Hundreds queue for passports in bid to leave Afghanistan||Hundreds of people braved sub-zero temperatures in Afghanistan's capital to queue outside the passport office early Sunday, a day after the Taliban government announced it would resume issuing travel documents.Many began their wait the previous night and most stood patiently in single file -- some desperate to leave the country for medical treatment, others to escape the Islamists' renewed rule.Tense Taliban personnel periodically charged crowds that formed at the front of the queue and at a nearby roadblock."We don't want any suicide attack or explosion to happen," said Taliban security operative Ajmal Toofan, 22, expressing concerns about the dangers of crowding.The local branch of the Islamic State group, the Taliban's principal enemy, killed more than 150 people in late August when citizens massed at Kabul airport in a desperate bid to leave during the early days of the new regime."Our responsibility here is to protect people," Toofan added calmly, his gun pointed professionally towards the ground. "But the people are not cooperating."He spoke to AFP as one of his colleagues pushed a man who then fell headlong just short of a coil of barbed wire.Mohammed Osman Akbari, 60, said he was urgently trying to reach Pakistan, because dilapidated hospitals at home were unable to complete his heart surgery.Medics "put springs in my heart", he said, referring to a stent. "They need to be removed and it's not possible here."Nearby, ambulances containing people too sick to queue were parked at the side of the road."The patient has a heart problem," said ambulance driver Muslim Fakhri, 21, referring to a 43-year-old man lying on a stretcher inside his vehicle.An applicant has to be present to ensure the passport is issued, he explained.'No one cares'The Taliban initially stopped issuing passports shortly after their return to power, which came as the previous, Western-backed regime imploded in the final stages of a US military withdrawal.In October, authorities reopened the passport office in Kabul only to suspend workdays later as a flood of applications caused the biometric equipment to break down.But the office said Saturday that the issue has been resolved and those whose applications were already in the process can now get their documents.Mursal Rasooli, 26, said she was happy to hear the news."The situation here is not peaceful," she told AFP, hugging her two-year-old daughter Bibi Hawa close for dual relief against the biting cold."If the situation gets worse than this, then we have the passport" and can flee, she said.Her husband is in Iran because he could not find work here, she added, before expressing concern about skyrocketing prices and a lack of jobs and education for women and girls.Issuing passports -- and allowing people to leave amid a humanitarian crisis the UN has called an "avalanche of hunger" -- is seen as a test of the Taliban's commitment to the international community.The Taliban are meanwhile pressing donors to restore billions of dollars in aid that was suspended when they came to power.Local musician Omid Naseer, sporting a leather jacket, short beard and unkempt hair, was desperate to leave.For "months now, since the Taliban came (to power), we've had no work", he said."The artists are most vulnerable, but no one cares."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-queue-for-passports-in-bid-to-leave-afghanistan-101639903419460.html
19-12-2021||World||Israeli military arrests 4 Palestinian suspects in West Bank shooting||The Israeli military said Sunday that its forces apprehended four Palestinian suspects believed to have taken part in a deadly shooting in the occupied West Bank.In Thursday’s incident, at least one Palestinian gunman opened fire on a car filled with Jewish seminary students next to a West Bank settlement outpost. Yehuda Dimentman, 25, was killed and two others were wounded near Homesh, which is considered illegal by the Israeli government.The army said the suspects were arrested in the northern West Bank village of Silat al-Haaretia, near Jenin, and “were transferred to the security forces for further investigation and the weapon of the suspect who carried out the shooting was captured.”The Israeli authorities did not immediately identify the suspects.The Israeli border police released a photo of a cache of assault rifles and ammunition it said belonged to the suspects.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett congratulated the security forces for the arrest, adding that “every terrorist should know that the state of Israel will settle the score with him.”The developments come after weeks of spiking Israeli-Palestinian violence. Earlier this month, a Palestinian attacker stabbed and seriously wounded an ultra-Orthodox Jew outside Jerusalem’s Old City. And just over a week before that, a Hamas militant opened fire in the Old City, killing an Israeli man.At the same time, settler violence against Palestinians has risen, particularly in the northern West Bank.Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the territories are now home to over 700,000 Israel settlers. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements illegal obstacles to peace.The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem and the West Bank as parts of a future independent state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-military-arrests-4-palestinian-suspects-in-dec-16-west-bank-shooting-101639900274799.html

The passengers are yet to be identified.Police inspector Craig White described it as a "tragic accident" in the lead-up to Christmas."This is the last thing that any family need to go through this time of the year," he said.Local media images showed the four-seater plane upside down in the water.Early reports indicated it crashed shortly after take-off, authorities said, but a full investigation had been ordered to determine the cause.The Air Transport Safety Bureau said additional investigators would be sent from the national capital Canberra to assist in the probe.Queensland police commissioner Katarina Carroll earlier told local media the initial response had encountered challenging conditions."The plane is in a very, very difficult situation, (a) difficult position in the wetland area," she said.Authorities said it could take some time to retrieve the wreckage from the crash site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plane-crash-in-australia-kills-4-including-two-children-101639892910442.html
19-12-2021||World||Aid for Afghanistan discussed in Islamic countries meet||Envoys from 57 Islamic nations were meeting in Pakistan Sunday for a summit aimed at relieving the humanitarian crisis in neighbouring Afghanistan while testing diplomatic ties with its new Taliban rulers.The meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is the biggest major conference on Afghanistan since the US-backed government fell in August.After the Taliban's lightning return to power, billions of dollars in aid and assets were frozen by the international community, and the nation of 38 million now faces a bitter winter.The United Nations has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan is on the brink of the world's worst humanitarian emergency with a combined food, fuel and cash crisis.On Sunday Pakistan's capital was on lockdown, ring-fenced with barbed wire barriers and shipping-container roadblocks where police and soldiers stood guard.Any aid pledges were set to be announced Sunday evening.Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is among the delegates, alongside others from the United States, China, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations.No nations have yet formally recognised the Taliban government and diplomats face the delicate task of channelling aid to the stricken Afghan economy without also propping up the hardline Islamists.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the meeting would speak "for the people of Afghanistan" rather than "a particular group".Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were the only three countries to recognise the previous Taliban government of 1996 to 2001.Qureshi said there was a difference between "recognition and engagement" with the new order in Kabul."Let us nudge them through persuasion, through incentives, to move in the right direction," he told reporters ahead of the OIC meeting."A policy of coercion and intimidation did not work. If it had worked, we wouldn't have been in this situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aid-for-afghanistan-discussed-in-islamic-countries-meet-101639890432596.html
19-12-2021||World||Typhoon Rai death toll in Philippines nearing 100||The governor of an island province in the central Philippines said at least 49 people died in the devastation wrought by Typhoon Rai in just half of the towns that managed to contact him, bringing the death toll in the strongest typhoon to batter the country this year to nearly 100.Gov. Arthur Yap of Bohol province said 10 other people were missing and 13 injured, and suggested the death toll may still considerably increase with many mayors unable to reach him due to downed communications.In a statement posted on Facebook early Sunday, Yap ordered provincial mayors to spend money to rapidly secure food packs and drinking water, which was an urgent problem given that water stations have not been able to operate during power outage.After joining a military aerial survey of typhoon-ravaged towns, Yap said “it is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing.”He said the inspection did not cover four towns, where the typhoon blew in as it rampaged on Thursday and Friday through central island provinces. The government said about 780,000 people were affected, including more than 300,000 residents who had to evacuate their homes.At least 39 other typhoon deaths were reported by the disaster-response agency and the national police. Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the southeastern provinces first pounded by the typhoon, separately reported 10 deaths just from a few towns, bringing the overall fatalities so far to 98.President Rodrigo Duterte flew to the region Saturday and promised 2 billion pesos ($40 million) in new aid.At its strongest, the typhoon packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.Floodwaters rose rapidly in Bohol’s riverside town of Loboc, where residents were trapped on their roofs and trees. They were rescued by the coast guard the following day. On Dinagat Islands, an official said the roofs of nearly all the houses, including emergency shelters, were either damaged or blown away.At least 227 cities and towns lost electricity, which has since been restored in only 21 areas, officials said, adding three regional airports were damaged, including two that remain closed.The deaths and widespread damage left by the typhoon ahead of Christmas in the largely Roman Catholic nation brought back memories of the catastrophe inflicted by another typhoon, Haiyan, one of the most powerful on record. It hit many of the central provinces that were pummeled last week, leaving more than 6,300 people dead in November 2013.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago is located in the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” region, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-death-toll-in-philippines-nearing-100-101639889116615.html
19-12-2021||World||Death toll climbs to 75 in Philippines Typhoon, reports officials||At least 75 people have been reported killed in the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, official tallies showed Sunday, as efforts to deliver water and food to devastated islands ramped up.More than 300,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Typhoon Rai ravaged the southern and central regions of the archipelago.The storm knocked out communications and electricity in many areas, ripping off roofs and toppling concrete power poles.Arthur Yap, governor of the popular tourist destination Bohol, said on his official Facebook page that mayors on the devastated island had reported 49 deaths in their towns.That took the overall number of reported deaths to 75, according to the latest official figures.Yap said 10 people were still missing on the island and 13 were injured after the storm smashed into the country Thursday as a super typhoon packing wind speeds of 195 kilometres (120 miles) per hour."Communications are still down. Only 21 mayors out of 48 have reached out to us," Yap said, raising fears the death toll could rise in the flood-hit province.Thousands of military, police, coast guard and fire personnel are being deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts in the worst-affected areas.A Philippine Navy ship carrying goods and other relief would depart for Bohol on Monday, Yap said, after he earlier declared a state of calamity on the island.There has also been widespread destruction on Siargao, Dinagat and Mindanao islands, which bore the brunt of Rai when it slammed into the Philippines.Aerial photos shared by the military showed severe damage in the Siargao town of General Luna, where many surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, with buildings stripped of roofs and debris littering the ground.Dinagat Governor Arlene Bag-ao said Saturday the damage to the island's landscape was "reminiscent if not worse" than that caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.Haiyan, which is called Yolanda in the Philippines, was the deadliest cyclone on record in the country, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing.Rai's wind speeds eased to 150 kph as it barrelled across the country, dumping torrential rain that inundated villages, uprooting trees and shattering wooden structures.It emerged over the South China Sea on Saturday and headed towards Vietnam.The Philippines -- ranked one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-climbs-to-75-in-philippines-typhoon-reports-officials-101639883795464.html
19-12-2021||World||Omicron looms large in Britain: Cases surge in 24 hours, London rings the alarm||The Omicron variant of the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus is spreading at a remarkable pace in the United Kingdom (UK). According to British government data, a marked surge in cases was reported in a span of mere 24 hours. Moreover, London's mayor Sadiq Khan has also declared a “major incident” to help the city's hospitals cope with the Omicron surge.The UK health security agency (UKHSA) said that the number of Omicron cases recorded across Britain hit almost 25,000 by Friday evening, an increase of more than 10,000 cases from 24 hours earlier.To make matters worse, as many as seven people, who were believed to have been infected with the Omicron variant, died as of Thursday, up from the one death in the UKHSA's previous data which ran up to Tuesday. Hospitalisation numbers also increased during this span – admissions of people thought to have been infected with Omicron increased to 85 from 65.However, the real number of Omicron cases eludes government data, authorities acknowledged. Hundreds of thousands of people were “almost certainly” being infected with the variant every day and were not being picked up in the figures, the British government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said.If the current trend for the Omicron surge continues in England, a peak of at least 3,000 hospital admissions per day is to be expected, SAGE said, advising a further tightening of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-necessitated rules.  Notably, daily hospitalisations in the UK had surged above 4,000 last January, before the nationwide vaccination programme gathered steam and brought the numbers down.London declares ‘major emergency’ over OmicronMeanwhile, London mayor Sadiq Khan declared a “major incident” over Omicron to allow for closer coordination between public agencies and possibly more central government support, as Covid-19 hospital admissions in the city rose by nearly 30 per cent this week.London has now logged the highest number of new Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic – over 26,000.“I've taken the decision, in consultation with our partners, to declare a major incident today,” Khan, the city's mayor, said in a Sky News broadcast.Germany puts UK on list of high-risk countriesGermany's health authority announced late Saturday that Britain had been added to its list of Covid high-risk countries, which will mean tighter travel restrictions.“The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are very strongly affected by Covid-19. A new variant, very contagious, has also been found,” the Germany Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on its website.The change, which takes effect at the end of the day Sunday at midnight, means arrivals from Britain will have to observe a two-week quarantine regardless of whether they are vaccinated, said the country's health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).In addition to the quarantine measure, only German nationals or foreigners residing in Germany will be allowed to come to the country from Britain. The rule applies to all means of transport and a PCR test will be required for all persons travelling to Germany.  (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-looms-large-in-britain-cases-surge-in-24-hours-london-rings-the-alarm-101639880167455.html
19-12-2021||World||Pakistan to hold summit of OIC leaders to discuss Afghan humanitarian crisis||Pakistan is set to host the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit on Sunday to discuss the Afghanistan situation and help the war-ravaged country garner humanitarian assistance as its economy remains in shambles after the pull out of the US troops and the subsequent takeover by the Taliban government. Pakistan is also aiming to soften the Taliban's image globally and pave the way for the global acceptance of their government in Kabul.In addition to the members of the OIC, delegations from the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, the European Union, the World Bank and humanitarian organisations have also been invited to the conference. Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also arrived in Islamabad on Saturday to attend the summit.According to local media, the summit will have various sessions focused on Afghanistan. During this, the leaders will discuss ways to mobilise support for providing adequate food, medicine, and shelter to millions of people in Afghanistan who are in dire need after the fall of Kabul in mid-August.Taliban took over Afghanistan in a military offensive in the aftermath of troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the United States and its other Nato allies. The chaotic exit led to a major humanitarian crisis for Afghanistan as it brought the country back to 1991 when the group was ousted by the US troops.The country is now on the verge of economic collapse as the international community froze billions of dollars worth of assets abroad and stopped all assistance. Afghanistan is also facing a threat from the Islamic State, which has ramped up attacks in the country over the last few months.It has been more than 100 days since the Taliban seized control over Afghanistan but it has not been recognised by any nation of the world yet.On Saturday, Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the message to the gathering is: "Please do not abandon Afghanistan. Please engage. We are speaking for the people of Afghanistan. We're not speaking of a particular group. We are talking about the people of Afghanistan," news agency AP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-hold-summit-of-oic-leaders-to-discuss-afghan-humanitarian-crisis-101639878821152.html

It laid out for the first time in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine.“I think we did not hit the lowest point, thank God, and there is a progress in some aspects at the very least and not everything is hopeless,” Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying on Saturday. Moscow needs stable and predictable relations with Washington, he said.“The situation can be stabilized and improved with the help of such agreements. Without them the situation will remain extremely difficult and tense,” Ryabkov said, Interfax reported.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday that the US is prepared for dialogue with Russia over its security demands and will present its own concerns.Nuclear-capable bombers on patrol over BelarusA pair of nuclear-capable Russian long-range bombers patrolled the skies over Belarus on a mission Saturday intended to underline close defence ties between the two allies amid tensions with the West.The Russian defence ministry said two Tu-22M3 flew a four-hour mission to practice “performing joint tasks with the Belarusian air force and air defense.” The bombers were escorted by Belarus’ Su-30 fighter jets, which Russia has supplied to its ally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-proposals-can-fix-relations-with-us-official-101639868176164.html

A governor said her island has been “leveled to the ground."Typhoon Rai blew away Friday night into the South China Sea after rampaging through southern and central island provinces, where more than 300,000 people in its path were evacuated to safety in advance in a pre-emptive move officials say may have saved a lot of lives.At its strongest, Rai packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. The typhoon slammed into the country's southeastern coast Thursday but the extent of casualties and destruction remained unclear two days after with entire provinces still without power and cellphone connection.The government's main disaster-response agency said at least 31 people were reported killed, many after being hit by falling trees, but it added it was validating most of the deaths. At least three were injured and one was missing.Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the first provinces to be lashed by the typhoon's ferocious winds, remained cut off Saturday due to downed power and communication lines. But its governor, Arlene Bag-ao, managed to post a statement on the province's website to say that the island of about 180,000 “has been leveled to the ground.” She pleaded for food, water, temporary shelters, fuel, hygiene kits and medical supplies. She said only a few casualties have been reported in the capital so far because other towns remain isolated.“We may have survived, but we cannot do the same in the coming days because of our limited capacities as an island province,” Bag-ao said, adding some of Dinagat's hospitals could not open due to damage. “Most of our commercial and cargo vessels ... are now unsuitable for sea voyages, effectively cutting us off from the rest of the country.”Vice Gov. Nilo Demerey managed to reach a nearby province and told DZMM radio network that at least six residents died and that “almost 95% of houses in Dinagat have no roof,” and even emergency shelters were destroyed.“We're currently doing repairs because even our evacuation centers were destroyed. There are no shelters, the churches, gymnasium, schools, public markets and even the capitol were all shattered,” Demerey said.Pictures posted on Dinagat's website show low-slung houses with roofs either blown off or damaged and surrounded by tin roof sheets and debris. The nearby island of Siargao, known as the surfing capital of the Philippines, also was pummeled by the typhoon.In central Bohol province, which was directly hit by the typhoon, the coast guard said its personnel on board rubber boats rescued residents who were trapped on roofs and trees, as waters rose rapidly. It released footage showing coast guard staff helping people from the roof of a house nearly engulfed by brownish floodwater to a rubber boat. They also help a villager climb down from a tree above the floodwater while another man, also wearing an orange life vest, waits for his turn.With government contingency funds used for the coronavirus pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would look for money to help the provinces. He planned to visit the devastated region this weekend.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago is located in the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” region, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-leaves-31-dead-many-homes-roofless-in-philippines-101639867185986.html
19-12-2021||World||‘Omicron spreading faster than Delta’||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading significantly faster than the Delta strain in countries with documented community transmission, with a doubling time of 1.5–3 days, the World Health Organization said on Saturday.The Omicron variant, which was designated as a variant of concern on November 26, has been identified in 89 countries across all six WHO regions as of December 16, it said.Omicron is spreading rapidly in countries with high levels of population immunity, but it is unclear if this is due to the virus’ ability to evade immunity, its inherent increased transmissibility or a combination of both, the WHO said in an update.“There are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron,” the WHO said. “More data are needed to understand the severity profile and how severity is impacted by vaccination and pre-existing immunity.”It added, “There are still limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for Omicron”.The WHO warned that with cases rising so rapidly, hospitals could be overwhelmed in some places.“Hospitalisations in the UK and South Africa continue to rise, and given rapidly increasing case counts, it is possible that many healthcare systems may become quickly overwhelmed.”Seven to 10% of new confirmed coronavirus cases in France are suspected to be of new the Omicron variant, health minister Olivier Veran said on Saturday.He said the rapid spread of the new variant was the main reason for the planned introduction of a new vaccination pass early next year, which will require that people show proof of vaccination to enter restaurants and long-distance public transport.Under the current health pass regulation, a recent negative Covid test is sufficient for entering public places. France is also set to curb New Year’s Eve celebrations.New York state reported a one-day record of more than 21,000 infections as the spread of the Omicron variant accelerates across the US.London declares ‘major incident’ to aid hospitalsBritain reported a surge in cases of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday, and London’s mayor declared a “major incident” to help the capital’s hospitals following a sharp rise in Covid-19 admissions.The total number of Omicron cases recorded across the country hit almost 25,000 as of 7:00pm on Friday, up by more than 10,000 cases from 24 hours earlier, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said in its latest data. Seven people believed to have had the Omicron variant had died as of Thursday, up from one death in the UKHSA’s previous data which ran up to Tuesday. Hospitalisations of people thought to have the variant increased to 85 from 65.London Mayor Sadiq Khan declared a “major incident” - which allows for closer coordination between different public agencies and possibly more central government support - as Covid-19 hospital admissions in the city rose by nearly 30% this week. He said health worker absences had also increased.Sky News said government ministers were being briefed on the latest coronavirus data on Saturday. The Times newspaper reported that officials were preparing draft new rules that, if introduced, would ban indoor mixing in England except for work for two weeks after Christmas when pubs and restaurants would be limited to table service outdoors.People would be able to meet in groups of up to six outdoors, the newspaper said. But ministers were yet to formally consider the plans, The Times said.China’s local cases rise to highest this monthChina reported 125 new coronavirus cases for Friday, of which 89 are local, according to the National Health Commission.That’s the biggest daily tally for local infections since November 30 when the country had 91 domestic cases, all in Inner Mongolia. The nation is facing heightened pressure as it seeks to stamp out recent flareups of the Delta variant, while having detected its first Omicron cases, putting its Covid Zero approach to the test.The latest outbreak forced closures of more than a dozen factories in China’s eastern manufacturing hub of Zhejiang province, the epicentre.Separately, Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales reported a record 2,482 Covid-19 cases Saturday, a day after easing international arrival rules for vaccinated travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spreading-faster-than-delta-101639866904426.html
19-12-2021||World||UK Brexit supremo Frost resigns in blow to Johnson||Britain's Brexit minister David Frost has resigned due to disillusionment with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, including the imposition of tax rises and additional Covid-19 restrictions, the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported."Frost has sensationally resigned from Boris Johnson's government," the newspaper said.Downing Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The newspaper said Frost's departure had been prompted by the introduction of additional Covid-19 measures, including Covid-19 passes, a broader discontent with tax rises and the cost of 'net zero' environmental policies.The departure of the British government's most senior Brexit negotiator is yet another blow to Johnson who has faced warnings from some of his own lawmakers that he must improve his leadership or face a challenge.Johnson said on Friday he took personal responsibility for the loss of a Conservative stronghold in an election defeat that showed public dismay over a litany of scandals and stepped up pressure from mutinous lawmakers.Frost, a supporter of Brexit, has led the attempts by London to renegotiate the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union."Lord Frost tendered his resignation a week ago - but was persuaded to stay until January," the newspaper said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-brexit-supremo-frost-resigns-in-blow-to-johnson-101639862557994.html
19-12-2021||World||Netherlands 'going into lockdown again' to curb Omicron||Nations across Europe moved to reimpose tougher measures to stem a new wave of Covid-19 infections spurred by the highly transmissible omicron variant, including a new nationwide lockdown introduced by the Dutch government.Schools, universities, and all non-essential stores, bars and restaurants in the Netherlands will be closed until Jan. 14 starting Sunday, caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Saturday night. Residents only will be permitted two visitors except for Christmas and New Year's, when four will be allowed, he said.“The Netherlands is going into lockdown again from tomorrow,” Rutte said, adding that the move was “unavoidable because of the fifth wave caused by the omicron variant that is bearing down on us.”Before the Dutch announcement, alarmed ministers in France, Cyprus and Austria tightened travel restrictions. Paris canceled its New Year's Eve fireworks. Denmark closed theaters, concert halls, amusement parks and museums. Ireland imposed an 8 p.m. curfew on pubs and bars and limited attendance at indoor and outdoor events.London Mayor Sadiq Khan underscored the official concern about the climbing cases and their potential to overwhelm the health care system by declaring a major incident Saturday, a move that allows local councils in Britain's capital to coordinate work more closely with emergency services.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin captured the sense of the continent in an address to the nation, saying the new restrictions were needed to protect lives and livelihoods from the resurgent virus.“None of this is easy,” Martin said Friday night. “We are all exhausted with Covid-19 and the restrictions it requires. The twists and turns, the disappointments and the frustrations take a heavy toll on everyone. But it is the reality that we are dealing with.”The World Health Organization reported Saturday that the omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detected in 89 countries, and Covid-19 cases involving the variant are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days in places with community transmission and not just infections acquired abroad.Major questions about omicron remain unanswered, including how effective existing Covid-19 vaccines are against it and whether the variant produces severe illness in many infected individuals, WHO noted.Yet omicron’s “substantial growth advantage” over the delta variant means it is likely to soon overtake delta as the dominant form of the virus in countries where the new variant is spreading locally, the UN health agency said.In the Netherlands, anticipation a government meeting Saturday would result in tougher restrictions caused shoppers to swarm commercial areas of Dutch cities, fearing it would be their last chance to buy Christmas gifts.Rotterdam municipality tweeted that it was “too busy in the center” of the port city and told people: “Don’t come to the city.” Amsterdam also warned that the city’s main shopping street was busy and urged people to stick to coronavirus rules.In the U.K., where confirmed daily cases soared to record numbers this week, the government has reimposed a requirement for masks to be worn indoors and ordered people to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test when going to nightclubs and large events.But the moves are causing anger.Critics of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s latest coronavirus restrictions flooded Oxford Street, a popular London shopping area, on Saturday. The maskless protesters blew whistles, yelled “Freedom!” and told passersby to remove their face coverings.Hundreds of people blocked traffic as they marched with signs bearing slogans such as “Vaccine passports kill our freedoms” and “Don’t comply.” Other signs had the faces of Johnson or U.K. Health Secretary Sajid Javid and read, “Give them the boot.”Scientists are warning the British government it needs to go further to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.Leaked minutes from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested a ban on indoor mixing and hospitality, the BBC reported.Britain and other nations are also accelerating the pace of booster shots after early data showed that two doses of vaccine were less effective against the omicron variant. Shopping centers, cathedrals and soccer stadiums in Britain have been converted into mass vaccination centers.During a visit to a mass vaccination pop-up clinic at London soccer team Chelsea's stadium on Saturday, Khan said the running of public services could be impeded by the rapidly spreading variant.“The big issue we have is the number of Londoners who have this virus and that’s leading to big issues in relation to staff absences and the ability of our public services to run at the optimum levels,'' he told the BBC. “I’m incredibly worried about staff absences in the (National Health Service), in the fire brigade, in the police service, in our councils across London.''Omicron is now the dominant coronavirus variant in London and efforts were stepped up to reach people who haven't yet been vaccinated or boosted.“I want to make a direct appeal to the more than 1 million Londoners who are yet to come forward for any Covid-19 vaccinations — it’s never too late to get your first or second dose,'' the mayor said. “It will help to protect you, your loved ones and our NHS.”In France, the government announced that it will start giving the vaccine to children in the 5 to 11 age group beginning Wednesday. Prime Minister Jean Castex said Friday that with the omicron variant spreading like “lightning,” the government proposed requiring proof of vaccination for those entering restaurants, cafes and other public establishments. The pending measure requires parliamentary approval.Demonstrations were planned in Paris to oppose the vaccine pass proposal and ongoing government restrictions.Thousands of opponents of vaccine requirements and mask mandates protested Saturday in Hamburg, Berlin, Düsseldorf and other German cities. In Austria, local media reported the crowds swelled to tens of thousands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-going-into-lockdown-again-to-curb-omicron-101639854437345.html
19-12-2021||India||Nagaland assembly to convene emergent session on December 20||The Nagaland Governor has summoned the 10th session (emergent) of the 13th Nagaland Legislative Assembly (NLA) on December 20. The emergent session was convened against the backdrop of massive public outcry demanding the removal of the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958 (AFSPA) from Nagaland following the killing of 13 civilians in Oting village of Mon district on December 4. The killing of another youth on December 5 in Mon town by security forces also led to mass protests against the controversial act. The session is expected to see the adoption of a state government resolution for the repeal of the contentious Act which grants certain powers to armed forces to “maintain” law and order in “disturbed areas”.Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and his lawmaker colleagues have also been vocal about the need for the repeal of AFSPA, calling it a “draconian” Act and that it does not have a place in the world’s largest democracy. The Nagaland cabinet had also announced its decision on December 7 to strongly recommend to the Centre to repeal the Act.Various tribal, women, youth and students’ bodies across Nagaland have been holding peaceful public rallies to protest against the Act and demanding its withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-assembly-to-convene-emergent-session-on-december-20-101639938383813.html

There is no proper response from the government so far. With regards to creation of Infrastructure there is no response either. I raise these issues whenever I get a chance at various forums when the Prime Minister and President are present,” Justice Ramana vented his dissatisfaction.In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Law Minister Kiren Rijiju recently said a proposal has been received from the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for setting up a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India for arrangement of adequate infrastructure for courts.“The three main issues in the country are lack of basic infrastructure, to increase the number of judges and financial help to deserving lawyers. Only when we overcome these problems can we reach out to people. There would be a meaning to “access to justice,” he said.For piling up pending cases, not only the shortage of judges is the reason, but also necessary infrastructure. Without providing necessary infrastructure expecting judges and lawyers sitting in dilapidated court buildings to deliver justice is not fair. Governments, especially the centre should note this, he further said.Justice Ramana said he wrote a letter to the centre and the Law minister seeking setting up mobile network on vans to facilitate lawyers in the rural areas to attend court duties virtually. According to him, though lawyers who can afford and in cities and towns will be able to attend court through video conferencing, advocates in rural areas and who cannot afford the network would eventually lose their profession.“If necessary, the government can rope in big corporate to set up network stations under corporate social responsibility funds so that they can attend court duties virtually. The suggestion so far has not translated into action. I am waiting for the government to do something about it,” the CJI said. He said many states in the country are shying away from allocating funds to build court complexes. He however appreciated the Telangana government for sanctioning funds to build a complex here without waiting for the central government amounts to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-response-from-centre-on-judicial-infrastructure-corp-aid-to-lawyers-so-far-cji-ramana-101639938023756.html

Later, when the case reopened, four of the 15 terrorists were hanged to death and the rest got life imprisonment… Inko aaram do, Yogi ji ko kaam do,” the BJP chief was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read | After BJP came in UP, not Hindus only gangsters, criminals left state: CMNadda was apparently referring to the 2006 Varanasi bombings case when Yadav was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. The SP chief took back cases against terrorists involved in the serial blasts at Varanasi's Sankat Mochan Temple and Cantt railway station.As many as 14 cases lodged in seven districts of the northern state were withdrawn, with the then SP government claiming that innocent Muslim men were booked under terror charges. The act invited criticism from the Allahabad high court as well.Akhilesh Yadav and the BJP have been exchanging heated comments lately as assembly polls in the northern state draw closer. This received fresh steam on Saturday when the income tax (IT) department conducted raids at the residences of Yadav's aide Jainendra Yadav and SP spokesperson Rajiv Rai, among others.Following this, the SP chief said the BJP is misusing central agencies to intimidate just like what the Congress party did in the past. “Turn back the pages and you will see that whenever the Congress had to intimidate anyone, they would misuse the central agencies,” he added.Notably, in the last assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, the BJP won 312 of the total 403 seats, while the SP bagged 47 and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 19. Congress was able to win only seven seats, while the remaining seats were bagged by other candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-ko-aaram-do-yogi-ji-ko-kaam-do-nadda-s-fresh-attack-on-sp-chief-101639931284859.html
19-12-2021||India||PM Modi pays tribute to Goa’s freedom fighters on Liberation Jubilee||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid tribute to the freedom fighters of Goa both from within Goa and outside, due to whose sacrifices; he said Goa never forgot its Indian origin and India never forgot Goa. During a day-long visit to the coastal state which is celebrating its 60th year since liberation, the Prime Minister said, “People from all corners of India came together and joined hands. Goa had been conquered by the Portuguese at a time when in another part of the country, the Mughals had an empire. Since then, the country has seen so many political storms. How many times has power changed hands, but despite the passage of time and changes in power, Goa did not forget its Indianness nor did India forget its Goa,” he said. “From the Cuncolim rebellion to the Maratha conflict led by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji there were efforts to free Goa. The Pinto revolt was led by the native Christians. This is the identity of India. It is service to humanity. The efforts were made from so many corners. The country became independent before Goa. Most people of India had got their rights. Now they had the time to live their own dream, yet so many freedom fighters gave up on all this and continued to struggle and sacrifice themselves for Goa’s freedom,” he said. “This is because India is not just about political power; India is that thought, a family which protects human rights. 21 freedom fighters had to give up their lives like Veer Karnail Singh Benipal from Punjab. They were restless because a part of India was still under foreign rule. Some countrymen still had not obtained freedom,” he added. “Names likes Luis de Menezes Bragança, Tristão Bragança da Cunha, Julião Menezes, Purushottam Kakodkar, Laxmikant Bhembre, Bala Raya Mapari, so many of our freedom fighters carried out an agitation after Independence, they suffered, offered sacrifice, but did not let the movement stop,” he added. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister paid tribute to those who laid down their lives for the Liberation Movement at the martyr’s memorial in the state capital as well as felicitated freedom fighters and veterans of ‘Operation Vijay’ at the function.Goa was freed through armed action by the Indian Army on December 19, 1961 in an operation codenamed Operation Vijay after all diplomatic efforts between India and Portugal to get the former imperial power to relinquish control of Goa failed. “If Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had lived for some years more, then Goa would not have had to wait for so long for its freedom,” the PM said. “Goa needs to make a new resolution. You should ask yourselves where you want Goa to be by the time it celebrates 75 years of Liberation. Make new resolutions. It needs continuity. It should stay the same in the future. We should not stop, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister also witnessed a parade of sails by boats of the Indian Navy, Coast Guard and civil agencies; and a flypast by aircraft of the Indian Navy, from the Miramar beach. During his visit, the Prime Minister also inaugurated projects worth ₹650 crore including a super speciality block of the Goa Medical College and Hospital, a restoration of a historical fort among other projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pays-tribute-to-goa-s-freedom-fighters-on-liberation-jubilee-101639936944363.html
19-12-2021||India||Bommai says no post or position is permanent, triggers speculation of early exit||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday triggered speculation of an early exit from the top post after he delivered an emotional address in his home district of Haveri, stating that no post is permanent.“Nothing is permanent in this world. This life is also not forever. In such a situation, these posts and positions are also not permanent is something we should always be aware of all the time,” Bommai said in Shiggaon, his home constituency in Haveri district, about 366 km from Bengaluru on Sunday.The statements come at a time when speculation is rife of a possible change in leadership in Karnataka barely five months since Bommai replaced BS Yediyurappa, who was forced to step down as CM in July.According to multiple people aware of the developments, there are chances that Bommai is likely to be replaced early next year, though there is no official confirmation on the same as it would further dent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its chances in the upcoming polls, including Zilla and Taluka Panchayat, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) and the 2023 assembly polls.Bommai has been under extreme pressure after a poor show in the October 30 bypolls in which the BJP lost Hanagal, the chief minister’s neighbouring constituency in his home district of Haveri.The Bommai government was also unable to bag a majority in the December 10 polls for 25 seats in the upper house of the state legislature in which it shared an equal number of seats with the Congress who also managed to win 11 with the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) getting just two.The Bommai government is also under pressure after multiple charges of corruption levelled against them, including the Bitcoin scandal in which senior BJP leaders and officials are believed to have laundered large sums of ill-gotten money using crypto currencies. A section of the public work contractors have also alleged that they are forced to cough up almost 35-40% commission for getting any projects, highlighting the growing corruption under the Bommai government.If rumour mills are to be believed, then Bommai is expected to go abroad to get a knee-related surgery and a change is expected to happen around this time. However, there is no official confirmation on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-says-no-post-or-position-is-permanent-triggers-speculation-of-early-exit-101639934303538.html
19-12-2021||India||'No post is permanent': Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai triggers his exit rumours||Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in an emotional address to the people of his constituency Shiggaon in this district said nothing is permanent in this world including posts and positions, fuelling speculation in some quarters about his possible exit. "Nothing is eternal in this world. This life itself is not forever. We don't know how long we will be here in such a situation, these posts and positions are also not forever. I am aware of this fact every moment," he said. In an expression of gratitude to the people of his constituency, Bommai said he is only 'Basavaraj' for them and not the Chief Minister. The CM was addressing people after inaugurating the statue of Kittur Rani Chennamma, the 19th Century queen of Kittur in Belagavi district, who fought against the British. "I have always been saying that outside this place (Shiggaon) I was Home Minister and Irrigation Minister in the past, but once I was in, I remained just 'Basavaraj' for you all. Today as a Chief Minister I am saying that once I come to Shiggaon, I may be Chief Minister outside but amongst you, I will remain as the same Basavaraj Bommai because the name Basavaraj is permanent and not the posts", he said. There have been rumours in some quarters that Bommai is likely to be replaced. The CM is reportedly suffering from a knee-related problem and may undergo treatment abroad but there was no official word on this. The Chief Minister who turned emotional twice recalled how affectionately he was fed 'Rotti' (Jowar Roti) and 'Navane' (foxtail millet) rice every time he came to his constituency as Basavaraj. "I don't have great things to say. If I could live up to your expectations, that's enough for me. I believe that no power is bigger than your love and trust. I try my best not to talk to you in an emotional way but sentiments overwhelm me after seeing you all," Bommai said in a choking manner. Noting that there was a huge responsibility on his shoulders to plan a comprehensive development of the state and to respond to the demands and requests of every community. The Chief Minister said, "he always kept his conscience awake every moment and in his every deed". Bommai took over as Chief Minister on July 28 after B S Yediyurappa resigned on the day he completed two years in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-post-is-permanent-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-triggers-his-exit-rumours-101639932406361.html
19-12-2021||India||Unfortunate and unfair, says Kharge after Centre calls 4 parties for meeting||The NDA government has invited four Opposition parties—whose MPs are among the 12 suspended lawmakers—for talks on Monday but a section of the Opposition is skeptical about the outreach and wants an all-party meeting instead. Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge wrote a letter to parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi later in the evening and termed the decision to invite just four parties as “unfair and unfortunate”. The proposed meeting will be held on Monday at 10 am at Rajya Sabha leader Piyush Goyal’s office. But the Opposition parties are meeting at 9.45 am to take a final call on attending the meeting. In the letter to Joshi, Kharge said, “All Opposition parties are united in the protest against the suspension of the 12 MPs. We have been requesting from the evening of November 29 itself that either the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the Leader of the House Shri Piyush Goyal should call leaders of all Opposition parties for a discussion to break the stalemate.” “This reasonable request of ours has not been agreed to, further inviting only leaders of four Opposition parties instead of inviting leaders of all Opposition parties is unfair and unfortunate.” The Congress, Trinamool, Shiv Sena and CPIM have been invited for the meeting. On November 29, six Congress MPs, two lawmakers each from Trinamool Congress and Shiv Sena and one each of CPIM and CPI were suspended for the entire winter session for unprecedented acts of misconduct and violent behaviour. Since CPI’s Binoy Viswom, the lone MP from his party in the Upper House, is suspended, he has not been invited for the meeting. Even as Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu had been regularly meeting Opposition leaders over the continuing logjam induced by the suspension, this is the first formal approach from the government to the Opposition outfits in a bid for resolution. The government managers including Union minister Piyush Goyal and Pralhad Joshi had been asking for an apology from the Opposition to revoke the suspension. But the Opposition is skeptical of this new initiative with just four days left of the winter session. Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien termed the government’s approach as a stunt. “Monday morning STUNT from a Government which does not want #Parliament to function. Government calls leaders of the 4 Opposition parties whose 12 RS MPs have been arbitrarily suspended. Government leaves other 10 Opposition parties out. Failed stunt. Why is the govt not calling all opposition parties?” he tweeted. CPIM leader Elamaram Kareem also flagged the absence of other parties and said, “Opposition would meet Monday morning to decide. But we wanted an all-party meeting while the government is offering to meet a select group of leaders.” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told HT, “We have already said no to the proposal.” On December 15, in an otherwise heated discussion with four Opposition leaders, Naidu had observed that an all-party meeting will be called when it is appropriate. “It implied that a meeting would serve no purpose when either the suspended MPs or leaders of their respective parties are not willing to reflect on their conduct and regret the same in an appropriate manner,” said a Rajya Sabha official.

19-12-2021||India||India’s latest destroyer kicks off maiden trials in Arabian Sea||An indigenously built stealth destroyer --- one of the four warships being built under an important navy project called P-15B, on Sunday kicked off maiden trials in the Arabian Sea, the event coinciding with the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Goa from Portuguese rule. Mormugao is the second stealth destroyer under P-15B --- the first, INS Visakhapatnam, was commissioned in the navy on November 21 in Mumbai. Mormugao is expected to join the naval fleet by mid-2022, with the remaining two to be commissioned by 2025.The ships are being built at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd in Mumbai. The commissioning of Visakhapatnam, armed with a variety of locally built weapons and sensors, reaffirmed India’s presence among an elite group of nations with capability to design and build advanced warships, the officials said. “December 19 is perhaps the most befitting date for the ship to put to sea for trials. The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in the liberation of Goa and dedicating the ship’s name to the maritime state will not just enhance the bonding between the Indian Navy and the people of Goa, but also link the ship’s identity permanently to the crucial role the navy played in nation-building,” the navy said in a statement. Mormugao will add significantly to the Indian Navy’s combat capabilities, it added. The navy is focused on strengthening its capabilities amid changing power dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region. Last month, it also inducted a French-designed Kalvari class diesel-electric attack submarine, Vela. INS Vela is the fourth of the six Kalvari class submarines being constructed in the country with technology transfer from French firm Naval Group under a ₹23,562-crore programme called P-75. The remaining two submarines will be commissioned in two years. India is also pursuing a project (P-75I) worth ₹40,000 crore for building six more advanced submarines in the country under the government’s strategic partnership (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet. The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign players are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.

They were involved in killing of over 250 dogs||Two monkeys, reportedly involved in the “revenge killing” of more than 250 dogs, have been captured by the forest department in Maharashtra's Beed, news agency ANI reported on Sunday."Two monkeys involved in the killing of dogs have been captured by a Nagpur forest department team in Beed,” Beed forest officer Sachin Kand was quoted as saying by the news agency.“Both the monkeys are being shifted to Nagpur to be released in a nearby forest,” Kand also told ANI.According to several reports, the dogs were killed in an act of revenge by the simians after a few dogs killed an infant monkey. Villagers have said the monkeys had been raising their children in the Lavool village."In the last two-three months, there have been incidents where the langurs roaming in the area would catch puppies and take them to a place with considerable height to throw them from there. At least 250 dogs have been killed so far,” a villager told ANI.The villagers then contacted Dharur's forest department after the monkeys began picking up school-going children as well.The incident has given way to memes on social media even as the hashtag #MonkeyvsDog started trending on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-monkeys-captured-in-maharashtra-they-were-involved-in-killing-of-dogs-101639923502957.html

19-12-2021||India||CJI Ramana says Centre yet to respond to aid for pandemic-hit lawyers||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Sunday said the central government has not yet responded to issues like setting up a judicial infrastructure corporation and providing financial help to lawyers who lost livelihood due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Justice Ramana, who inaugurated a court complex at Warangal in Telangana said even the proposal of setting up mobile internet facilities in rural areas was sent earlier this year, nothing has been done yet, even as he expressed hope that the Centre would bring in a legislation in the ongoing winter session of Parliament for creating the Judicial Infrastructure Corporation."I asked the Centre to financially help families of lawyers who lost their livelihood due to Covid. There is no proper response from the government so far. With regards to creation of infrastructure there is no response either. I raise these issues whenever I get a chance at various forums when the Prime Minister and President are present," Justice Ramana said.In a recent written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Law Minister Kiren Rijiju said a proposal has been received from the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for setting up a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India for arrangement of adequate infrastructure for courts."The three main issues in the country are lack of basic infrastructure, increasing the number of judges and financial help to deserving lawyers. Only when we overcome these problems, can we reach out to people. There would be a meaning to "access to justice," he said.Regarding piling up of pending cases, he said not only the shortage of judges is the reason, but also necessary infrastructure. Expecting judges and lawyers sitting in dilapidated court buildings to deliver justice without providing adequate facilities is not fair. Governments, especially the centre should note this, he added.Justice Ramana said he wrote a letter to the centre and the law minister seeking setting up of a mobile network on vans to facilitate lawyers in the rural areas to attend court duties virtually. According to him, though lawyers who can afford and in cities and towns will be able to attend court through video conferencing, advocates in rural areas and who cannot afford the network would eventually lose their profession. "If necessary, the government can rope in big corporate houses to set up network stations under corporate social responsibility funds so that they can attend court duties virtually. The suggestion so far has not translated into action. I am waiting for the government to do something about it," the CJI said.He said many states in the country are shying away from allocating funds to build court complexes. He, however, appreciated the Telangana government for sanctioning funds to build a complex here without waiting for the central government amounts to come.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-ramana-says-centre-yet-to-respond-to-aid-for-covid-hit-lawyers-101639915371618.html
19-12-2021||India||Bangalore Talkies: Women, Work and the Covid-19 pandemic||It is exactly two years since Covid-19 showed up in China and then in our lives. What are some memorable incidents or takeaways from it? Well, here’s one. In the throes of the lockdown, a strange event happened in our privileged apartment community in Bengaluru. What was strange was how normal we thought it to be at that time. Like most apartment buildings, ours too banned all external help from entering the community unless they were essential. Covid was raging all through Bengaluru. News of unnamed Covid-positive corpses being thrown into common Covid-burial sites made the rounds. We were all petrified of catching the virus. Household help for the elderly who lived in our building was allowed. But pretty much everyone else had to fend for themselves. Then came a request. A young man wrote to the building committee asking if his cook could be allowed inside the building. He was a single working man, he said and needed food. This was discussed. “Tenant in Apartment 845 wants his cook to come-- on alternate days at least-- to cook for him,” was the gist of the discussion on the committee Whatsapp group. What was interesting was that most people in the ten-person committee, including the women, thought this to be a normal request. Most were inclined to view it favourably and allow the cook to “help” the young man. “Why should he starve?” was the view. Till one male member of the committee called him out. Why were we allowing the man to get a cook? Just because he was a man and couldn’t cook for himself? In short, yes. That was the implicit bias that all of us were operating under. Men needed help cooking – nothing wrong with asking for support in that area.As the pandemic hopefully says goodbye, the ‘gendered impact’ of the pandemic is well-known. How now to take stock and make changes? For women, the pandemic has been a source of more work and more angst. Many of us have been asked the question: has the lockdown opened the eyes of society to the “multitasking capabilities” of women? It is meant as a compliment, but it is actually a curse. Thanks to the pandemic, women have been forced to multitask more than ever, taking care of school-age children who are fed up with virtual classes, caring for elders who are driving them batty, enabling their husbands who usually tend to earn more money and are therefore necessary to bolster the household’s finances. But what about the working woman herself? Who is going to enable her?A harder and more necessary stance might be the opposite. Yes, women can multitask, but men can too. Thanks to being home-bound during the lockdown, some men found that they loved to cook and were terrific at it. Others found new purpose in helping their sons and daughters with art projects or math homework and took delight in being indispensable to their kids-- “for a change,” as one said.In my view, praising a woman’s ability to multitask confines her to the stereotypical role of a caregiver and enabler-- which in turn puts less pressure on men and society to admit that there is a problem in how disproportionately women shoulder the burden of the household. Unlike at companies where jobs can afford to be specialized, households require flexibility, fluidity and agility-- from all partners. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that men can be great Moms-- packing the kids off to school while their mother takes a zoom call from the US team. Rather than celebrating the woman’s ability to do more, I think it is time for society to celebrate the man’s ability to do something-- inside the home. Men can and should step up and own up to household chores. It should no longer be acceptable to say, “Oh, thanks to the pandemic, my son has learned to make tea.” As if a simple tea deserves a crown. India has among the lowest participation of women in the workplace. As a nation, our economy needs to bounce back from the Covid-19 recession. Supporting women in both roles – at home and the workplace – is not just good for the soul of society. It is great for the economy too. Here is the thing: the pandemic only highlighted what we all knew. The fact that Indian society penalizes working women – doesn’t support them – was known even before the pandemic. It is what medical doctors call a pre-existing condition. The sooner corporates, governments and businesses act to nudge women back to the workplace, the better it is for India. Even the most traditional ministers who talk about “Bharatiya sanskar” can buy into this. Yes, a woman’s place is at home, but also at the workplace if they so desire. Frankly, other than the delivery of a baby and breastfeeding, every other function can be shared by the husband and wife-- without prejudice or stereotype. As for the man in my building, he could jolly well learn to cook for himself. About time. At least that is what the building committee decided, and we all lauded them for it.

19-12-2021||India||Two political murders in 12 hours shock Kerala||There was tension in many areas of Kerala after two state-level leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of the Popular Front of India, were killed in an apparent retaliatory attack in Alappuzha on Sunday. Police have rounded up at least 50 people in connection with the twin political murders that happened in less than 12 hours in a radius of 10 km, said Inspector General of Police Harshita Attaluri. Prohibitory orders (Section 144) were clamped in the district for two days and many senior police officials are staying in the area to avoid further clashes. SDPI state secretary K S Shan (38) was stabbed to death by an alleged group of RSS-BJP workers on Saturday night and in less than 12 hours BJP OBC Morch state secretary Ranjith Sreenivasan was hacked to death in his house allegedly by SDPI workers. Both leaders received more than 40 stab wounds, police said. The SDPI leader was attacked while he was returning home in Mannacherry on his scooter. Assailants who came in a car first hit the two-wheeler and when he fell down they stabbed him repeatedly, police said. He received multiple fractures and head injuries and later he succumbed to his wounds in a private hospital in Ernakulam. He is survived by his wife and two children. Minutes after the murder, SDPI alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was behind the attack. Both RSS and SDPI have blamed each other for the twin murders. “The RSS is trying to create mayhem by eliminating political opponents and silencing minority community members. It is a well planned and executed murder,” said Popular Front state president C P Mohammad Basheer. He also said RSS state leader Valsan Thillankeri was in the district on Saturday and he was aware of the cold-blooded murder. But Thillankeri denied this saying he attended a function in the district which was announced much earlier. He said the RSS has no role in the murder. According to the police, there was no immediate provocation for the SDPI leader’s murder but they suspect that it may be in retaliation to the murder of an ABVP worker V Nandu in Vayalar in February this year. Clashes between RSS and SDPI workers take place regularly in many parts of the state and last month a RSS leader S Sanjith was stabbed to death in Palakkad in a similar way. The BJP leader was attacked on Sunday morning while he was coming out of his house for a morning stroll. He was pounced on by an eight-member team and stabbed before his mother in his house. He died on the way to the hospital. Viswanathan (40) had contested the April assembly elections unsuccessfully. BJP state president K Surendran said the state government’s open support to the communal outfit led to the gruesome murder. He sought an investigation by a central agency saying the party will not get justice from the state police. “The ruling CPI(M) is running many local bodies with the help of SDPI. It supports the communal outfit to checkmate the RSS,” he said. “Pinarayi Vijayan’s goonda raj took another precious life. No law and order and killers go scot-free,” tweeted Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has condemned the twin murders. “The government will not allow anyone to take the law into their hands. We will not tolerate any attempt to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of the state,” he said in the state capital. The government has also announced a special investigation team to probe both killings and Additional DGP Vijay Sakhre will supervise it. CPI(M) leader J Chittaranjan, also a local legislator, asked both parties to shed politics of violence. Opposition leader V D Satheesan and state Congress president K Sudhakaran also condemned the murders. “If police were alert, the second murder should have been avoided. The police should have been given a free hand to investigate both,” said Satheesan.

On the occasion of Goa Liberation Day, PM Modi inaugurated a super speciality block at Goa Medical College, New South Goa District Hospital, aviation skill development centre at Mopa Airport and the gas-insulated substation at Dabolim-Navelim in Margao.During the event organised at Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium, Modi also felicitated the freedom fighters and veterans of ‘Operation Vijay’ as part of Goa Liberation Day celebrations.Speaking at the event, the prime minister said the land and sea of Goa have been blessed with nature's boon.“Goa came under Portugal rule when the other major part of the country was ruled by the Mughals. But even centuries later, neither Goa has forgotten its Indianness, nor India has forgotten its Goa,” he added.Recalling his recent meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City, Modi said the sentiments of the head of the Catholic Church was overwhelming for him."I must tell you what he said after my invitation.

The second indigenous stealth destroyer of the Project 15B class is planned for commissioning in mid-2022, and, according to the ministry of defence, December 19 was “perhaps the most befitting date” for the ship to be taken out for maiden sea trial as India celebrates 60 years of Goa’s liberation from Portuguese rule.Mormugao, which incorporates several niche indigenous technologies, has been built at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDSL) as part of the P15B destroyers.“The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in the liberation and dedicating the ship's name to the maritime state of Goa will not just enhance the bonding between the Indian Navy and the people of Goa, but also link the ship's identity permanently to the crucial role the Navy played in nation-building,” the defence ministry said in a statement.In pics: Mormugao, Indian Navy’s guided missile destroyer, launchedThe destroyer is expected to add significantly to the capabilities of the Indian Navy, which got a major booster in the form of INS Visakhapatnam’s and the fourth stealth scorpene class submarine INS Vela’s commissioning. INS Vela was also constructed at MDSL Mumbai in collaboration with M/s Naval Group, France, and was delivered to the Indian Navy on November 9, 2021. A total of six submarines are to be built under the project.“With the recent commissioning in November 2021 of INS Visakhapatnam and the fourth P75 submarine INS Vela, commencement of sea trials of Mormugao is testimony to the cutting-edge capabilities of MDSL and the strong indigenous shipbuilding tradition of a modern and vibrant India,” the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mormugao-a-stealth-destroyer-sails-for-maiden-sea-trials-on-goa-liberation-day-101639906078206.html

According to the J&K Police, the slain terrorist has been identified as one Saifulla alias Abu Khalid, who was a resident of Pakistan's Karachi and affiliated with the proscribed terror outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT).According to Vijay Kumar, the inspector-general of Kashmir Police (IGP), the terrorist had infiltrated India back in 2016 and was through all these years active in the general area of Harwan. He had also been involved in several terrorism-related crimes, the official added.The police said the encounter broke out after security forces launched a cordon and search operation in the Harwan area of Srinagar, following specific inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area. The encounter, which brought down Saifulla, took place overnight.According to the J&K Police, about three Pakistani terrorists were killed within Srinagar city limits within the past 33 days. “They were involved in several terror crimes including attacks on police, security forces, and also connected with civilian killings,” the IGP Kashmir said. “It shows that Pakistan is hell-bent on disturbing the peace in the Valley, especially in Srinagar city.”Earlier this week, a terrorist was killed in a similar encounter with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama.

"It seems that the person came with the target of sacrilege only as he was there for 9-10 hours. He had not been identified yet," the deputy CM said adding that the investigation is on."In 2018, the state government passed and sent a proposal to the Centre to make minimum 10 years of imprisonment under Section 295A to whoever causes injury, damage or sacrilege to Guru Granth Sahib, Bhagavad Gita, Quran and Bible. I will write again to the Centre," the deputy CM said.The incident drew sharp reactions from political leaders condemning the attempt to sacrilege bid. "Strongly condemn the horrific incident of attempted sacrilege of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji at Darbar Sahib. Govt must get to the bottom of what led this man to act in such a despicable manner!" former chief minister Amarinder Singh tweeted on Saturday.A man hailing from Uttar Pradesh was beaten to death after an alleged attempt to commit sacrilege inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple. According to reports, the man jumped the golden grills inside the sanctum sanctorum and picked a sword and reached near the place where a Sikh priest was reciting the holy Guru Granth Sahib. The man was caught by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) task force members. When he was being taken to the SGPC office, an angry crowd thrashed him leading to his death. It is being probed how many people were with him and exactly at what time he entered the temple.Another alleged incident of disrespect of Nissan Sahib (Sikh flag) was reported from Nizampur village in Punjab's Kapurthala district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-perhaps-came-with-the-target-of-sacrilege-only-punjab-deputy-cm-101639901183595.html

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that while the main people are working in the government, they would continue to remain a part of the Sangh."They have different executives, different policies, different working methods. Thoughts and culture are of the Sangh and that is effective. The main people are working there (in the government), they belong to the Sangh and will remain so. There is only such relation and nothing like the media says 'Direct Remote Control', no such control," Bhagwat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Bhagwat said this while addressing an event of ex-servicemen in Dharamshala. About one thousand ex-servicemen attended the event in Dharamshala on Saturday evening and the RSS chief urged them to know more about Sangh."Governments were against us. There has always been opposition. The Sangh has been running for 96 years by overcoming all obstacles and since so many volunteers are getting ready so they will not keep quiet or sit idle. Wherever there is a need to work in society, they are always available. The work done by the swayamsevaks prove they do not just run Parliament, they take the people of society along, they are independent and autonomous."In another context, Bhagwat said the DNA of all Indians is the same. "The DNA of all the people of India from 40,000 years ago is the same as that of the people of today. The ancestors of all of us are one, because of those ancestors our country flourished, our culture continued," he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-doesn-t-have-remote-control-of-modi-govt-mohan-bhagwat-101639900093661.html

19-12-2021||India||India, Central Asian states have similar concerns, objectives in Afghanistan: Jaishankar||The impact of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan on regional security, post-pandemic recovery and steps to boost regional connectivity and trade were in focus as the foreign ministers of India and the five Central Asian states held their third dialogue on Sunday.External affairs minister S Jaishankar set the stage for the discussions, saying in his televised opening remarks that India and the Central Asian states have similar concerns and objectives in Afghanistan, including the formation of an inclusive government, the fight against terrorism, and ensuring unhindered humanitarian assistance.Jaishankar called for diversified supply chains and regional solutions to overcome the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and bolster economic recovery. He also called for a focus on 4Cs – commerce, capacity enhancement, connectivity and contacts – to take ties between India and Central Asia to the next level.India is hosting the third edition of the dialogue, which began in 2019. This year’s event was joined by the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, who skipped a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Afghanistan hosted by Pakistan on Sunday. All the Central Asian states are members of the OIC and were represented at the meet in Islamabad by deputy foreign ministers or other ministers.Most of the Central Asian foreign ministers spoke of the need to build on the historical and cultural ties of their region with India and highlighted the potential for cooperation in areas such as connectivity, transport, transit and energy. They also referred to the security cooperation between Central Asia and India, including in the context of Afghanistan.“We all...share deep-rooted historical and civilisational ties with Afghanistan. Our concerns and objectives in that country are similar: a truly inclusive and representative government, the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking, ensuring unhindered humanitarian assistance and preserving the rights of women, children and the minorities,” Jaishankar said in his opening remarks. “We must find ways of helping the people of Afghanistan,” he added.Uzbekistan’s foreign minister Abdulaziz Kamilov, in his opening remarks, pointed to the “challenging situation in neighbouring Afghanistan” and spoke of the “need to develop a unified and coordinated approach towards this country”. Kyrgyz foreign minister Ruslan Kazakbaev described India as a strategic partner for all the Central Asian states. He noted security has a special place in this relationship and said Kyrgyzstan will collaborate on all measures to make the region safer.With the leaders of the five Central Asian states expected to be the chief guests at next year’s Republic Day celebrations, Turkmenistan’s foreign minister Rashid Meredov said Sunday’s meeting would be a “key event in the preparation process for the upcoming Central Asia-India Summit in January”.Jaishankar called for a collective response to the challenges facing the region, including the impact of Covid-19 on global health and economy, and said the pandemic had changed societies, supply chains and governance. It had also highlighted the inadequacy of existing multilateral structures to meet new and emerging threats, he said.“We need diversified supply chains and more regional solutions. India has been steadfast in its resolve for the fight against Covid-19,” he said, noting that India had supplied Covid-19 vaccines to more than 90 countries, including Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.He thanked all the Central Asian states for taking care of Indian students amid the pandemic.With India and Central Asia facing the test of rebuilding their economies, Jaishankar said, “But together we can do this better and India, I assure you, will be your steadfast partner.“We already have a good history of cooperation. But my message to you today is a readiness to take it to the next level. Our ties must now focus around 4Cs – commerce, capacity enhancement, connectivity and contacts.”Kazakhstan foreign minister Mukhtar Tileuberdi said the India-Central Asia Dialogue is a great platform for discussions on topical issues and has boosted regional connectivity. He said Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is expected to visit India next year, coinciding with 30 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties.“We welcome India’s active role and growing interest in Central Asia. Our region is now on a new development stage towards unprecedented convergence in politics, economy, trade and security... India has huge potential for Central Asia’s development,” Tileuberdi said.Tajikistan foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin said a growing trend of regional integration in Central Asia has created new opportunities for expanding cooperation between the region and India.

19-12-2021||India||Long Covid: Range of symptoms, medical burden||On December 3, Sangeeta Gharat went back to work seven months after she contracted Covid-19. A 51-year-old assistant administrative officer with the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), Gharat took her 24-year-old daughter, Priya, with her on the first day.The mother and daughter spent the first few hours conducting a trial of sorts: Priya stood by, ready to help, as her mother pushed open the main door of her first-floor office in Mumbai’s Nariman Point. It took Gharat all the strength she could muster. Priya watched as her mother struggled to grip the handles of her swivel chair. Gharat couldn’t push the pile of files — gathered on her desk over the months she was away — and moved each one out of her way. When she opened the drawer, Gharat let out a painful sigh. “I feel like I have to re-learn basic movements. I am no longer sure of my strength,” Gharat said.A resident of Airoli, Gharat contracted Covid-19 in April as the pandemic’s second wave raged across the country and hospitals struggled to accommodate patients and ensure adequate oxygen supply. Before the infection, Gharat lived a healthy life and she had no comorbidities. Her infection was a severe one: she spent 74 days in hospital, including nearly 50 days in the intensive care unit (ICU). During her hospital stay, Gharat also contracted a fungal infection leading to septicaemia — a secondary infection often seen in severe patients hospitalised for a longer time, or those who have extremely low immunity.Six months after her discharge from the hospital, Gharat is still not healthy.A range of symptomsGharat is a patient of Long Covid, where symptoms linger for weeks or months after the person is Covid negative.Around the world, scientists and medical professionals are trying to pin this down. Starting last year, experts began to use the term to refer to patients who, having recovered from the primary infection, continued to struggle with its after-effects. These were linked to the virus’s ability to impact all organs and body systems.A November 2020 study published in the British Medical Journal that followed up on 201 patients in the United Kingdom stated that “Almost 70% had impairments in one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection”.Long Covid symptoms occur more frequently in women, middle-aged, and in those with more symptoms initially, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) definition.Here’s what’s confounding the medical experts: Long Covid does not depend on the severity of the infection. It doesn’t manifest uniformly across different people. Little is known about how it varies from other post-viral symptoms, or what parameters should medics use to ascertain it. A Lancet editorial published in August called Long Covid “a modern medical challenge of the first order.”“The effect on society, from the increased health-care burden and economic and productivity losses, is substantial,” it stated.International studies show a high prevalence of post-acute symptoms. For instance, a UK study published in Plos Medicine journal in September looked at electronic health records of 273,618 Covid survivors and found that nearly 57% had one or more Long Covid features recorded during a six-month period.Another research published in The Lancet in July looked at a cohort of 3,762 patients from 56 countries and found that the time to recovery exceeded 35 weeks in almost 91% of the patients. Almost 45% of the patients required a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness, the study noted.As the virus continues to mutate, cause re-infections and breakthrough infections across the world, there is a growing concern about the medical burden of Long Covid. Survivors and experts have formed advocacy groups to understand the condition in greater depth, many have taken to chronicling their struggle on social media platforms.There is a lack of data on long Covid from India. A tele-interview-based study carried out by Max Super Speciality Hospital among 1000 acute patients in July showed that 40% had Long Covid symptoms — 31.8% had symptoms beyond three months after their discharge from the hospital.There have been varying estimates of the burden of Long Covid from different parts of the world, but once again, data from India, which has recorded over 34.7 million Covid cases, is largely absent. This doesn’t mean that the doctors on ground aren’t confronting it.“Covid-19 not just impacts the lungs but it also attacks other organs in the body, one after another,” said physician Dr Jalil Parker, who treated Gharat at the Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital. In addition to the damage caused by the virus, patients are pumped in with a range of antibiotics, steroids, antiviral medications that put pressure on the kidneys. “Kidney injury among such patients is therefore very common,” said Parker.Parker said that he has seen patients like Gharat with severe Covid grapple with the long-term impact, as well as patients who had mild to moderate Covid, battle fatigue, brain fog, hair loss, anxiety and other symptoms that affect their everyday functions.Some doctors describe Covid’s ability to impact a patient from head to toe — many suffer from what is known as Covid toes, with painful rashes and blisters on them.“At times I feel long-term impact of Covid in a few patients are worse than a cardiac bypass, as the virus has a tendency to affect every organ and function of the body,” said Parker.“When we look at major illnesses in general, the inflammatory parameters in the body tend to be high,” said Dr Anita Mathew, an infectious disease specialist from Fortis Hospital in Mulund. “In Covid, the inflammation is often seen throughout the body and not just within the lungs which the virus affects first. Therefore, the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are fairly high in many patients,” she said.Mathew has observed such inflammation even in mild Covid patients who turn out to be long haulers.A post-Covid house“This is something different. It’s extremely debilitating,” Gharat said. She offers instances of what’s going on with her: she struggles to grip a cushion and the tips of a bed sheet. She enters the kitchen to give a stir to something cooking on the stove only to realise that she can’t hold on the spatula.Her house is testimony to her post-Covid struggle. Two jumbo oxygen cylinders stand in a corner next to a walker. In another room, a stack of medicines offers a daily reminder of how at the height of her illness, Gharat required two litres of oxygen every minute for nearly three months even after she was discharged. When she started undergoing physiotherapy on her doctor’s advise, her oxygen requirement increased to three litres per minute, for at least 20 hours a day.She was weaned off oxygen therapy in October, but the medication multivitamins, minerals and supplements continues. New ones were added. Gharat was diagnosed with renal hypertension, or high blood pressure caused by kidney disease, soon after her discharge.Unknown medical burdenInfectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal, who treats patients at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri, said that tiredness and fatigue are the most common complaints among Long Covid patients.However, not many patients seek help for long Covid. “The problem is not non-existent, but its real burden is unclear,” Singhal said.Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious disease expert and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said that long Covid can sometimes be trivialised, but it can make fully functional people redundant. “I have seen patients grappling with facial palsy, unable to swallow food properly, muscle disorders and even involvement of the spine and brain,” he said.Twenty months into the pandemic, it is still hard to define what Covid does to the body, what is the kind of residual damage it leaves behind, said Dr Srivastava. “We will know its true impact only years from now,” he said.Priya Gharat, however, notices the impact of her mother’s condition every day. “She is doing her activities, but not as quickly as she once did,” she said. “Like, getting out of the cab while holding her purse and tiffin bag in one hand is not possible for her. Opening heavy drawers in the office is also difficult,” she said.“Opening the door of the office and the washroom felt as though I was moving a heavy object,” Gharat recalled of her first day back at work earlier this month.Seeing her mother’s experience on her first day, Priya decided to accompany her every day. “I will continue to do so for the remaining month,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-covid-range-of-symptoms-medical-burden-101639894995286.html
19-12-2021||India||Conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar took names of Shilpa Shetty, Kartik Aryan, Shraddha Kapoor: ED||The case of ₹200 crore money laundering involving conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar has taken several new twists and turns with new names of Bollywood celebrities coming out every day. While Jacqueline Fernandez and Nora Fatehi received expensive gifts from the conman, it has been learnt that Sukesh was in touch with several Bollywood personalities, as he claimed to ED, news agency ANI reported.Sukesh Chandrashekhar is a conman who used to call people using a spoofing app, impersonating government officials. The ₹200 crore money laundering took place when Sukesh was in Rohini jail in connection with his previous cases. While this revelation led to action against jail officials, it came to the fore that Sukesh has been following the same modus operandi in all his conning cases. Actor Jacqueline Fernandez told ED a similar account that Sukesh told her that he belonged to a political family, owned Sun TV and wanted her to feature in films produced by him.According to an ANI report, Chandrashekhar has named many Bollywood personalities. ED officials will look into the matter of whether these Bollywood personalities were the conman's target or whether they share any connection with Sukesh. Sukesh reportedly told ED that he knew Shradhha Kapoor since 2015 and even helped her in an NCB case. Sukesh also claimed that he was planning to co-produce his next movie 'Captain India' starring Kartik Aryan.When Raj Kundra was in jail in connection with a porn racket case, Sukesh reportedly contacted Shilpa Shetty for Kundra's conditional release.While this particular case of ₹200 crore money laundering took place early this year, Sukesh has several charges against him. His aide Pinky Irani has recently been arrested and revealed that Sukesh had paid her a lot of money to get introduced to Jacqueline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conman-sukesh-chandrashekhar-took-names-of-shilpa-shetty-kartik-aryan-shraddha-101639895875724.html

Although India attained independence from British rule back in 1947, it would still take Goa – which was a Portuguese colony at the time – 14 more years to be liberated from foreign control. Finally, on December 19, 1961, Indian armed personnel managed to wrest control of Goa from the Portuguese, ending around 450 years of colonial rule.On December 19 each year, various programmes are organised across Goa to mark the Liberation Day celebrations. This year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the coastal town to celebrate the completion of six decades of its independence.Prime Minister Modi will be felicitating freedom fighters and veterans of 'Operation Vijay,' the very mission undertaken by the Indian armed forces that liberated Goa from Portuguese rule.

"In politics even one week is a very long time. So there is still two and a half years to go for the next Lok Sabha poll. We are hopeful that those who are speaking in different voices will come together to defeat BJP. The goal is to defeat not just the BJP but also its policies and politics," he said at the sideline of his book launch event on Saturday. Trinamool MP Mimi Chakraborty was present at the book launch event. "My big problem with this government is that there is no good governance for 52 weeks of the year. So having good governance for just one week may not be enough. They (NDA) need to get their act together and serve the entire time of the year and not just once. The problem with this government is that all these (Good Governance Week) are gestures, the politics of symbolism, the politics of slogans. What you need to see is the substance of good governance, which has been missing. All we have is politics of slogans and symbolism.The assertion of the senior Congress leader comes at a time when the Grand Old Party is struggling to retain its old-timers who are crossing over to the Trinamool Congress in hoards. Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee in her recent visit to Mumbai even questioned the existence of the UPA. “What is UPA? There is no UPA,” Mamata said pushing forward for a third front without Congress being the guardian. “Considering today’s situation and the ongoing fascism, a strong alternative force is required in the country against it. No one can do it alone. We all need a strong alternative and if someone is not ready to fight, then what can be done,” Banerjee said.Countering Mamata's offensive, Congress president Sonia Gandhi recently called a meeting of the opposition parties to discuss the suspension of 12 MPs in the Rajya Sabha. No invitation was extended to Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-2-5-years-for-lok-sabha-shashi-tharoor-hopeful-of-opposition-unity-101639889804640.html

According to the police, eleven people have been arrested in the BJP leader’s murder case. Some of them are suspected to be directly involved in the case.Tension gripped the district after back to back political murders and senior police officers have rushed to the district to avert further clashes. Two political murders in less than 12 hours shocked the state and prohibitory orders (Section 144) were clamped in the district for two days.SDPI state secretary Shan KS (38) was stabbed to death by an unidentified gang on Saturday night and in less than 12 hours BJP OBC Morcha leader Ranjith Sreenivasan was hacked to death outside his house on Sunday. Police said the BJP leader was out for a morning stroll when an eight-member team of assailants pounced on him and stabbed him. He died on way to the hospital.The SDPI leader was attacked while he was returning home in Mannacherry on his scooter. Assailants who came in a car first hit his two-wheeler and stabbed him repeatedly when he fell down, police said. The victim received multiple fractures and head injuries and later succumbed to his wounds in a private hospital in Ernakulam. He is survived by his wife and two children.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned the twin political murders in Alappuzha and said, “the government will not allow anyone to take law into their hands. Such perpetrators will be dealt with sternly”. The SDPI, political wing of the Popular Front of India (PFI), alleged Rashtriyaswayam Sewak Sangh’s (RSS) involvement in the attack but district leaders of the RSS denied any role. “The RSS is trying to create mayhem by eliminating political opponents and silencing minority community members. It is a well planned and executed murder,” said Popular Front state president CP Mohammad Basheer. Police said they have identified the vehicles used in both the attacks. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithalaas asked leaders to rein in their workers and blamed police for recurring political murders. “It seems both are planned killings. Police should give a free hand to investigate such murders,” he said. CPI(M) leader J Chittaranjan, a local legislator, said parties should shed politics of violence.Police said there was no immediate provocation for the SDPI leader’s murder but they suspect it could be a retaliation to the murder of an RSS worker in Vayalar last year. Clashes between RSS and SDPI workers take place regularly in many parts of the state. Last month, an RSS leader was stabbed to death in Palakkad in a similar manner.

On Saturday, Delhi witnessed its first cold day of the season with the mercury dipping to 6 degree Celsius. According to IMD, the lowest minimum temperatures recorded at 8.30am on Sunday over the plains of North India are: Churu (minus 2.6), Ganganagar (3.5), Narnaul (1.2), Hissar (2.0), Delhi (Safdarjung) (4.6).According to the IMD, when the minimum temperature is less than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum temperature is at least 4.5 degrees Celsius below the normal, it is said to be a 'cold day'.Cold conditions prevailed in the capital owing to a strong, dry northwesterly cold wind which was blowing at 10-20 kmph during the first half of Saturday. The wind speed increased to 25kmph, gusting to 40kmph in the afternoon. The IMD said cold to severe cold wave conditions are likely to continue over some Northwest parts of the country till December 21. Mercury is likely to dip in Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan, north Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The high-velocity winds, however, dispersed fog and led to better visibility in the Capital. At the airport, visibility improved from 200-400 metres at around 8.30am to 1,800-2,000 metres in the afternoon, local officials said. There was dense to light fog in other parts of northwest India.“In many cities north of Delhi, temperatures fell below zero degrees. Since we are receiving winds from that side, it is pushing Delhi’s temperatures down,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at private forecaster Skymet Weather Services. “The forecast is that temperatures will fall in the next two days, and under the impact of a fresh western disturbance on December 21-22, there will be a marginal increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-temperature-dips-to-4-6-on-sunday-morning-churu-freezes-at-minus-26-101639886596971.html

"There is a debate on the wisdom of raising the age of marriage to 21 for girls and making it the same as it is for boys. My view is that the age of marriage should be common for both girls and boys at 21 years. But the amended law should come into force on 1-1-2023 or later. The year 2022 should be used for a massive educational campaign on the benefits of marrying only after a boy or girl attained the age of 21 years," Chidambaram said.But the amended law should come into force on 1-1-2023 or laterThe year 2022 should be used for a massive educational campaign on the benefits of marrying only after a boy or girl attained the age of 21 yearsThe Union Cabinet is believed to have cleared a proposal to bring uniformity in the marriageable age of men and women. The government is likely to bring a bill in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The proposed bill may also seek to make consequential changes to various personal laws relating to the marriage of different communities to ensure a uniform marriage age, reports said.As of now, the legal age of women to get married is 18 while that for men is 21 years.The proposal, however, has already courted controversies. AIMIM president and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the proposal and said both men and women should be allowed to legally marry at 18 as they're treated as adults by the law for all other purposes."Modi government has decided to increase the age of marriage for women to 21. This is typical paternalism that we have come to expect from the govt. 18-year-old men and women can sign contracts, start businesses, choose Prime Ministers and elect MPs and MLAs but not marry? They can consent to sexual relationships and live-in partnerships but cannot choose their life partners? Just ridiculous," said AIMIM chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-raising-marriage-age-for-girls-to-21-chidambaram-has-an-advice-101639878442013.html

The incident took place during the first round of the Under-15 National Wrestling Championship at Shaheed Gannpat Rai Indoor Stadium in Ranchi. Uttar Pradesh MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is also the president of the Wrestling Federation of India, was present at the event. The championship was concluded on Friday. It is believed that the slapping incident might have taken place during the inaugural day.The wrestler was from UP and was not allowed to take part in the wrestling event as he was over-age for the event. But as he persuaded the MP for allowing him to take part, the MP lost his cool and slapped the wrestler twice, after which the wrestler was removed from the stage. JHARKHAND:Fresh shocker from the BJP!BJP MP & Wrestling Federation of India President, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh slaps young wrestler on stage.Can a public servant (BJP MP) manhandle the common man?

"This boy came over to the stage and urged to take part in the championship while he was found guilty of age fraud. I didn't allow him and politely told him to go down from the stage as we already disqualified 5 more wrestlers who were found guilty of doing age fraud and all they belong from UP, not only from UP, I didn't allow any player who is over age whether he belongs from Delhi, Haryana or any state, If I start doing this on basis of states then I can't develop wrestling in country," Singh told ANI."Our president clearly told that he cannot take part in this but he starts misbehaving with him and starts arguing to let him allow to play as he belongs to his own state UP but he clearly denied him by saying if he allows him to play then he has to give immunity to other states wrestlers," Vindo Tomar, secretary, Wrestling Federation of India, said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrestler-wants-to-contest-despite-being-over-age-bjp-mp-slaps-video-goes-viral-101639875507490.html

On both Tuesday and Wednesday, there were 12 cases.Omicron cases have been detected in 12 of India’s regions – Maharashtra has reported 48 cases, Delhi has seen 22, Telangana has reported 20, Rajasthan has 17, Karnataka has 14, Kerala 11, Gujarat has seen seven, Uttar Pradesh two, and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.Earlier on Sunday, health officials in Uttar Pradesh confirmed that the state had detected its first two cases a day earlier (on Saturday) when a couple tested positive in Ghaziabad. “Contact tracing of nearly 100 people was conducted, and no further infections were found,” said UP additional chief secretary Amit Mohan Prasad.The 12 new cases detected in Telangana were all among international passengers, officials said, adding that the reports of genome sequencing of samples from three more is awaited. “Of them, six persons came from Kenya, two each from Somalia and the UAE and one each from Ghana and Tanzania,” local officials said.Maharashtra reported eight new Omicron infections, officials said, adding that 28 of these have already recovered.

19-12-2021||India||Shah says India recovering from Covid-19, hails PM Modi||India is steadily recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic although the situation is fluctuating in many countries, home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday.“Many governments fought against Covid-19 in the world, but in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ensured that people would join the government’s fight against the pandemic. Even at present, many countries are reporting ups and down in Covid-19 cases, but India is steadily coming out of it,” Shah said at the National Awards for Excellence in Corporate Governance 2021 organised by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India in Mumbai.“When the entire world was wary about India because of the comparatively weak health infrastructure, the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi fought the battle effectively. This could happen because we joined hands with the 130 crore people of the country. India was the only country in the world which saw people standing by the Prime Minister when he gave the call of Janata curfew,” he said.Calling India’s growth as it emerges from an economy ravaged by Covid-19 “promising”, the home minister said the following year will see “double-digit” growth. “The current growth rate is in a single-digit, but I can assure you all that it would be in a double-digit by March 2022. It is because we were trying to win the war against Covid-19 but the economic reforms that we had envisioned would need to overcome various challenges posed by the pandemic,” Shah said, attributing it to steps taken by the central government.“These two years, 2020 and 2021, will prove important in economic history as the period 25 to 50 years from today will be divided in pre- and post-Covid era. The growth we could achieve today is because of the economic policies undertaken by the government,” he said.India’s national vaccination programme has changed the course of the pandemic, Shah said. “Today when the graph of the Covid-19 cases in many countries is moving upward and downward, India is moving steady towards endemic stage,” he said.At another event earlier in the day, in a veiled attack on the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state, he said, “I have seen some state governments are not giving bank guarantees to sugar mills whose management is politically linked to opposition parties.”Countering Shah, Maharashtra cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil said: “We have been treating all the sugar factories equally when it comes to giving bank guarantees. We have given it to sugar factories under Bharatiya Janata Party leaders including Pankaja Munde.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-says-india-recovering-from-covid-19-hails-pm-modi-101639864772868.html

19-12-2021||India||France to jointly make aero engines in India: Singh at industry event||France has agreed to jointly manufacture aero engines in India under the government’s strategic partnership model to boost self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday.“A big French company will manufacture an engine in India, thus far not made in the country, in collaboration with an Indian firm,” Singh said at an event organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. His comments coming a day after he held the 3rd annual defence dialogue with his French counterpart Florence Parly.Singh did not divulge details of the proposed cooperation with France. Aircraft engines are a glaring capability gap in India’s defence manufacturing sector, with major indigenous flying platforms equipped with imported engines.The strategic partnership model Singh referred to is an important element of the country’s defence procurement procedure, and seeks to provide fillip to the government’s Make in India programme. It aims at bringing high-end military technology into the country, and lays down the template for partnership between Indian companies and foreign military contractors to build advanced platforms.The current reforms undertaken by the government will help the Indian defence and aerospace sector clock a turnover of ₹5 trillion by 2047, compared to the current ₹850 billion, the defence minister said.The steps taken by the government to boost indigenisation include increasing foreign direct investment limit from 49% to 74%, notifying two lists of 209 weapons and systems that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware.“For the security of India, it is necessary that we develop our defence capacity and capability (to a level) that even the most powerful country in the world has to think a thousand times before planning anything that endangers our interests. Our government’s aim is not to attack anyone, but prepare our armed forces to be ready at all times to give a befitting reply to the country’s enemies,” he said.Referring to the recent deal with Russia to build assault rifles in the country, Singh said the government was focused on Make in India, Make for India and Make for the world. India and Russia on December 6 concluded a much-awaited ₹5,100-crore deal for the joint production of more than 600,000 AK-203 assault rifles at a facility in UP’s Amethi district.
19-12-2021||India||Beginning Dec 22, Nitish Kumar to start state-wide social reforms yatra||With the Opposition and the allies alike raising questions over Bihar’s biggest social reform initiative of ‘prohibition’, which is into its sixth year despite unabated challenges of smuggling, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is set for what has been his trademark all through his long stint as CM - to be in the midst of people to get direct feedback, create awareness and review governance and development work.Staring December 22, a day after the last cabinet meeting of the year in Valmikinagar, Kumar, known for embarking on state-wide visits through his well-drafted ‘yatras’ attached with a cause that the masses can identify with, will be on ‘social reforms yatra‘ from Motihari in East Champaran to tell the people about the benefits of prohibition. He imposed prohibition responding to the call of women ahead of the 2015 assembly elections.The yatra, according to a cabinet coordination department notification, will cover one district each in six divisions and two districts each in three divisions. Kumar will also address public rallies in all the divisions and all the districts falling under the division will attend it. The yatra will culminate on January 15 with Patna and Nalanda programmes. The strong force of woman volunteers of the Jeevika self-help groups will participate in the CM’s programme, besides others.On Friday, Kumar said in Madhubani while launching a ₹731-crore worth project for construction of a barrage over Kamla Balan river and other flood protection work, that he would be on his ‘yatra’ till January 15 to make people understand the rationale of prohibition, how it is directly linked to their well-being and that of the society and why public awakening was a prerequisite for state’s meaningful progress. “I know that barring a small percentage, most people welcome prohibition. Women are a happy lot and it has restored family bliss,” he added, exhorting women to use their empowerment in the last one decade to keep a vigil on illicit liquor manufacturers and traders so that wrongdoers could be nabbed.But it is not just about prohibition, which Kumar does not feel the need to back out from. Also on his agenda are two other big social reforms initiatives which he initiated - anti-dowry and anti-child marriage campaigns. Besides, all through his yatra he will review the agriculture, development and welfare programmes with top officials and seek direct feedback from the people on governance issues, including law and order. All the officials have been asked to be ready with facts and figures for the review meetings. The local people’s representatives and in-charge ministers will also be present at the review meetings.In 2019 December, his last state-wide tour ahead of the 2020 assembly elections, he had embarked ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Yatra’ to champion the environmental cause and feel the pulse of the masses. That had started from Bettiah in West Champaran.

The alliance would jointly take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the forthcoming elections in the coastal state, Dinesh Gundu Rao, All India Congress Committee (AICC) member in-charge of Goa, said at a media briefing. “The Congress and the Goa Forward Party have entered into an alliance for the forthcoming Goa assembly elections. After (GFP chief) Vijai Sardesai met our leader Rahul Gandhi in Delhi and expressed his support to the Congress, saying he wants to work with us to defeat the communal and corrupt BJP government in Goa and to bring about a change in the state, we welcomed his move,” Rao said. “We ironed out whatever small issues were there between us, and we are looking at a new beginning.” Notably, the GFP had earlier shared power with the BJP in Goa, but withdrew support in July 2019 after all three of its legislators, including party president Sardesai, who was then deputy chief minister in the Pramod Sawant-led government, were dropped from the cabinet. The alliance will liberate the state from the “autocratic government,” Sardesai said. “There is a need for like-minded people to team up. This is the team Goa. We will liberate Goa and give Goans justice.” He added that political strategists are of the opinion that any political alternative in Goa cannot be envisaged without the Congress as the principal opposition. “The entire public of Goa is against this government. But elected representatives are surprisingly joining it because of the high-handedness of the central leadership of the party… We will defeat these forces.” Goa BJP spokesperson Urfan Mulla, however, questioned the state Congress chief’s change of mind to join hands with the GFP.“State Congress president Girish Chodankar needs to explain how he changed his mind after repeatedly insisting that the Congress will not align with the Goa Forward Party and having accused the party of betraying the mandate and other misdeeds. The people of Goa will show this unholy alliance the door,” Mulla added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-goa-forward-party-seal-alliance-ahead-of-goa-elections-101639857852087.html
19-12-2021||India||The two musical towers of Bangalore||Bengaluru: In the letters to his father, Mozart referred to the pipe organ as ‘’the king of instruments”. The characterisation clung ever since to this big, complex, expensive and mystifying musical instrument. Over centuries several of such “kings of instruments” have been created, used and preserved, mostly by churches.In Bengaluru, a wish to hear an organ would take you to two churches – St Mark’s Cathedral and St Andrew’s church -- which continue to preserve the only organ pianos from the pre-independence era.The huge pipe organ in St Mark’s Cathedral off MG Road is in startlingly original condition, though some parts of the instrument, a bit worse for the 93 years of wear and tear, have been restored. Avinash Grubb is so accustomed to showing off the abilities of this marvel of an instrument that he can explain the instrument even while using all four of his limbs to play a hymn or two -- his hands play keyboard while his feet dance on the foot pedals.It was in 2004, Grubb took over from David Sebastian, the former organist at St Mark’s Cathedral. But before that, at the age of 18, Grubb began training under Sebastian to play the instrument. As much as playing music, he is passionate about the history that comes with the organ pipe.The foundation stone of church was laid in 1808, and construction was completed in 1812. But on 17 February 1923, the church building was ravaged by fire. Reconstruction of the church started in 1926 and was completed in 1928.In the year 1929, the pipe organ was installed. “The pipe organ was as a gift by Avis Cowdrey of the Cowdrey family (father of cricketer Michael Colin Cowdrey). The organ is designed by two British builders, with only the metal pipes being built in England, while other parts were built in Bangalore. The cost of construction then was ₹80,000, which was a large sum for that era,” said Grubb.“The name pipe organ comes with the fact that it is a wind instrument and the pipes produce the music. The keyboard has 61 notes and there is a pipe for each corresponding note. Now the pipes, the eight pipes are sound on the pitch, four feet will one octave higher, two feet pipes will two octaves higher and you 16 feet pipes which one octave lower. Essentially, we are playing at multiple octaves at the same time, which is not possible on any other instrument,” he explained.One of the important parts of the instrument is the reservoir of air, which help produce the music. In the earlier days, three to four men had to pump wind with organ bellows while the instrument was played to produce the required wind, but when the organ was installed at St Mark’s Cathedral, a motor was brought in from the United Kingdom for the job, which remains even till date.It is very difficult to master the art of playing the organ. It requires all the senses on alert to hear the sound and maintain a simultaneous motion of the hands and feet, and most importantly to keep an eye on the choir. For this, there are three mirrors. The pianist facing the massive instrument can keep an eye on the priest, co-conductor and in case of the marriage at the bride walking towards the altar, with these three mirrors.Even the music played on the organ piano keeps the heritage of the instrument in mind, said Grubb while discussing the responsibility that comes with playing an instrument with such historic value. “We follow the Gregorian chants, which symbolises solemnity and reverence. Even though singing the churches have changed over time, we have kept this century-old tradition. Moreover, our choir sings a lot of music that be accompanied by the organ piano. Organ music is very difficult to play with the choir because it is classical music, but we continue that tradition because of the heritage we have with us,” he said.Just a few kilometres away from St Mark’s Cathedral, overlooking the South Parade ground, is a magnificent structure – St Andrew’s church. The church, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in November 2014, was started on 18 November 1866. Initially, it was started for Scottish officers, the British Madras Army and civilians of Scottish origin. Kannada services began in 1965.The church with a Scottish heritage is frequented by musicians, artists and architects. Apart from the gothic architecture and beautiful stained glass, the church houses an elegant 140-year-old pipe organ. This old pipe organ, called the ‘great little monster’ of St. Andrew’s Church, was installed by builders Peter Gonacher and Co. in 1881. this is the oldest pipe organ in the city.According to the old-timers of the church, during the British era, the music from the organ could be heard from at Cubbon Park located more than 1.5 km away, but the traffic drowned it over time.

19-12-2021||India||CEC was not invited to electoral reform meeting on Nov 16, says law ministry||The Union law ministry said on Saturday that the chief election commissioner (CEC) was not invited to attend a meeting on electoral reforms held on November 16 and the legislative department had, instead, asked the secretary of the poll watchdog or a representative for the event.In a press communiqué, the ministry said that the after the official meeting, a subsequent “informal interaction” was held virtually with the CEC and the two ECs for “ironing out two or three aspects” for the final proposal on electoral reforms.“The meeting of 16.11.2021 was to finalise the cabinet note on some of the reforms and it was held virtually. The subsequent interaction with the chief election commissioner and two election commissioners was an informal one and meant for ironing out two or three aspects for the final proposal,” said the communiqué, in response to media reports.In its statement, the ministry said that several EC proposals regarding electoral reforms were pending and the CEC had written to the Union law minister several times to consider the reforms expeditiously. The statement also noted that the legislative department was the nodal department regarding EC matters and “regular interaction” took place between EC officials and the department.The communiqué said several meetings were held by the cabinet secretary and the PMO on a common electoral roll.“The PMO ID dated 12.11.2021 regarding a meeting on common electoral roll to be held on 16.11.2021 was addressed to the cabinet secretary, law secretary and secretary, legislative department. it was not addressed to the chief election commissioner. Since Election Commission Of India has the necessary expertise and mandate regarding electoral roll and in the light of the previous letters of the chief election commissioner addressed to the law minister, secretary, legislative department thought it appropriate to invite officials of election commission to this meeting,” said the statement.The undersecretary of the legislative department sent a letter dated November 15 to the secretary of the EC to attend the meeting the next day. The letter was addressed to secretary and also requested the EC secretary to attend the meeting, said the communiqué.“After receipt of the letter by the ECI, the chief election commissioner spoke to secretary, legislative department expressing his displeasure over the expression in the middle part of the letter which gave an impression that it was expected of the CEC to attend the meeting.

19-12-2021||India||Attacks on Christian groups expose fault lines in Karnataka||Bengaluru: Karnataka has witnessed at least 39 incidents of attacks on Christian community members this year till November, according to data compiled by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a human rights body. While official figures on attacks of Christians last year are not available, several activists have claimed the cases have increased this year. Activists have also drawn a parallel between the rise in attacks on the Christian community and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) push for an “anti-conversion” bill in the state. The chief minister Basavaraj Bommai-led Karnataka government has created a draft “anti-conversion” bill to check “forced religious conversions” in the state, activists argued. “Compared to now, there were fewer attacks. The increase in these attacks has happened especially after the new chief minister (Basavaraj Bommai) took over. The CM giving assurance to pass the anti-conversion bill has made it seem like Christians are a threat to the Hindu community,” said B Rajasekhar, president of the Christian Forum for Human Rights. Rajasekhar had filed multiple cases against the state government led by former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, for not taking action against multiple cases of attack on Christians between 2003 and 2018. The Archbishop of Bengaluru, Peter Machado, also claimed the attitude of the government was a reason for the “increase in attacks” on the Christian community. “Certain behaviour or certain utterances from the government, certain attitude from the government is the reason that this (attacks) is allowed and tolerated. This can go on and is sad for us,” said the Archbishop. He added that earlier such incidents were reported from interior places where there were fewer members of the community and small churches. “But to happen in Hubballi, Dharwad, Bengaluru means people are taking the law into their hands,” Machado said. The issue of forcible conversions gained momentum after BJP legislator Goolihatti Shekar recently made an appeal against the practice, claiming his mother was also a “victim” of it. In September, Shekar had said his mother was among those in Chitradurga district who was “brainwashed” by the “missionaries”. He had claimed that people from “marginalised communities and even Muslims were being converted”, or they were slapped with false charges, and around 15,000-20,000 people in his constituency were possibly converted. Shekar had presided over an event in which at least five families “were brought back” into the Hindu fold, including his mother, on September 11. However, an investigation done by a tehsildar in Hosadurga debunked this claim. In his report, the tehsildar said all the “believers who attend prayers in the five churches in the Hosadurga taluk do so voluntarily and nobody has been coerced”. In addition, the tehsildar also visited two areas where social media reports alleged forced conversions were being conducted. His report stated that while eight people who had converted to Christianity reconverted to their original religion, nobody complained of having been forced to convert. The tehsildar was transferred without posting on December 16. A report by the PUCL, titled ‘Criminalizing the Practice of Faith’, listed out the 39 incidents of hate crime against the Christian community stating that in some cases the “police department and some politicians colluded with right-wing organisations in carrying out these attacks”. Karnataka Director General of Police Praveen Sood, however, rejected the allegations. “We have been impartial in taking action against anyone who is indulged in such activities, irrespective of religion and caste. As reported by the media itself, there has been a considerable number of FIRs (first information reports) registered and people have been arrested. We have taken action,” Sood said. The PUCL report also highlighted the change in Christian population in India to deflate the claim of forced mass conversion. It said that according to the 1971 Census, Christians comprised 2.60% of the population of India. “In 1981, they [Christians] were 2.44%; in 1991, 2.33%; in 2001, 2.18% and at present, they are 2.30%,” the report said. The document added that as per the 2011 Census, Christians accounted for 1.87% of the population in Karnataka. “Thus, the statistics do nothing to suggest that the Christian population is increasing,” the report said. Aakar Patel, author and former executive director of Amnesty International India, said “anti-conversion” laws being introduced in BJP-ruled states across the country was “part of a deliberate plan”. “Post 2018, five BJP governments have passed these (anti-conversion) laws. The freedom of religion, particularly the fundamental right to propagate religion, has been taken away from the Christians over the years. Now Karnataka has become the first southern state to draft a bill for such a law. Since hate crime is not a category in the official records, we don’t have the exact numbers, but anecdotal evidence suggests that these attacks are on the rise. We can also assume that these (attacks) in concert with the passing of the laws are deliberate,” said Patel. Similarly, Karnataka has also reported a rise in cases of vigilantism by Hindu groups, especially in coastal parts of the state. According to PUCL data, Karnataka witnessed at least 22 instances of moral policing by Hindu vigilantes in the 11 months this year till November, a 175% jump from eight cases reported in 2020. Activists claimed an increase in such cases after Bommai took over as the chief minister in July. In October, Bommai stoked a controversy with his statements that appeared to justify incidents of moral policing and communal disharmony in the state. However, the Karnataka BJP has rejected all allegations as baseless and a “fear-mongering” attempt by some “sections of a community”. Former MLC Ganesh Karnik, who is the chief spokesperson for the BJP in Karnataka, said, “This is a propaganda by select sections of this (Christian) community, who wants to spread some fear-mongering within the minorities. There are issues within the community. In Mangaluru, a few years ago the Roman Catholic community had claimed that some Christian fringe elements were trying to convert within the Christian community. In the name of the prayer meetings, they are involved in the religious conversion. The organisation releasing studies should study this as well.” He added, “Regarding allegations made against the senior leaders in the government and party, it is just an attempt to tarnish their image and divert attention from the work they are doing.”
19-12-2021||India||After tension in Belagavi, Bommai says will take strict action against vandals||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday said that police have been instructed to take strict action against those indulging in vandalism in the state.The statement comes days after a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji in Bengaluru was vandalised and a protest by pro-Maharashtra activists in Belagavi resulted in vandalism, including an attack on the statue of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna.Speaking to media persons in Hubballi, the chief minister said he has instructed the home minister to take stringent action against those who violate law and order. “The home minister too has issued orders in this regard to police officers. Already a few persons have been arrested. Those indulging in acts of vandalism like stone pelting, destroying public property and damaging government vehicles would be dealt with sternly. More stringent and long-term measures would be taken to ensure that such acts do not recur. Police have been instructed to take all measures in this regard,” he said.Talking about attack on Shivaji statue, he said vandalisation of the statutes of the patriots, who have made sacrifices for the country, could not be tolerated. “Statues are erected to pay respects to them, not to cause social unrest in their name. A few elements are indulging in such intolerable acts. They would be crushed. Investigation would find whether it was perpetrated intentionally,” Bommai said.Speaking to media persons about incidents of vandalism in Belagavi on Friday night, he said, “Maintaining law and order in Karnataka is our responsibility. Similarly, It is the responsibility of the Maharashtra government to maintain law and order there.”He said that the director general of police will speak to his counterpart in Maharashtra about security of Kannadigas there and attack on buses and private vehicles from Karnataka. “Our home minister will take up the issue with his Maharashtra counterpart. Then, if necessary, I will speak to the Maharashtra chief minister,” he said.Replying to a question about Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut giving a call for Marathas to unite, Bommai said: “Responsible people should never incite anyone under any circumstances. Chatrapati Shivaji, Sangolli Rayanna and Kitturu Rani Chennamma fought against the British for freedom. They fought to unite the country. We will be doing a disservice to them if we fight to divide the society. Nobody should incite people to take law into their own hands.”Prohibitory orders were issued in Belagavi on Saturday following incidents of vandalisation of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna’s statue and hurling of stones at government vehicles. According to the police commissioner’s office, the prohibitory order was imposed under Section 144 of CrPC from 8 am on December 18 to 6 pm on December19 in Belagavi police commissionerate area, which comprises Belagavi taluk.On Monday the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) organised a protest against the assembly session being held at Belagavi, which is a disputed territory. Pro-Kannada protesters subsequently threw black ink on MES leader Deepak Dalvi, following which MES supporters burnt a Karnataka flag in Kolhapur on Tuesday. The MES also issued a bandh call in Belagavi.The act of burning Karnataka’s flag led to the state legislative assembly passing a censure motion on Thursday, with Opposition parties demanding action against MES. Allegedly in retaliation to the burning of the Karnataka flag, unidentified persons poured ink on a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji in Bengaluru on Friday. Suspected MES supporters then allegedly damaged a statue of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna and indulged in stone-pelting on Karnataka government vehicles in Belagavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-tension-in-belagavi-cm-bommai-says-will-take-strict-action-against-vandals-101639857431949.html

The chief minister has even given a call to the party cadre to burn effigies of the state and central BJP leaders on Monday in protest against the Centre’s “anti-farmer policies” and hound them away if they entered villages.KTR took a dig at the BJP government in Bengaluru for cancelling the show of Kamra and Faruqui last month on the ground of “law and order” issues and describing Faruqui a “controversial figure.”He said: “People from Bengaluru claim their city to be cosmopolitan and then end up taking comedy very seriously. We (Hyderabad) are a truly cosmopolitan city that is welcoming of all cultures, welcoming of criticism. You can come here, criticise the government… in fact, we receive a lot of brickbats from our opposition every day. We are very tolerant.”

His comments coming a day after he held the 3rd annual defence dialogue with his French counterpart Florence Parly.Singh did not divulge details of the proposed cooperation with France. Aircraft engines are a glaring capability gap in India’s defence manufacturing sector, with major indigenous flying platforms equipped with imported engines. The strategic partnership model Singh referred to is an important element of the country’s defence procurement procedure, and seeks to provide fillip to the government’s Make in India programme. It aims at bringing high-end military technology into the country, and lays down the template for partnership between Indian companies and foreign military contractors to build advanced platforms. The current reforms undertaken by the government will help the Indian defence and aerospace sector clock a turnover of ₹5 trillion by 2047, compared to the current ₹850 billion, the defence minister said. The steps taken by the government to boost indigenisation include increasing foreign direct investment limit from 49% to 74%, notifying two lists of 209 weapons and systems that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware. “For the security of India, it is necessary that we develop our defence capacity and capability (to a level) that even the most powerful country in the world has to think a thousand times before planning anything that endangers our interests. Our government’s aim is not to attack anyone, but prepare our armed forces to be ready at all times to give a befitting reply to the country’s enemies,” Singh said. Referring to the recent deal with Russia to build assault rifles in the country, the minister said the government was focused on Make in India, Make for India and Make for the world. India and Russia on December 6 concluded a much-awaited ₹5,100-crore deal for the joint production of more than 600,000 AK-203 assault rifles at a facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi district. The deal was finalised at the 20th meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation led by Singh and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoigu.
19-12-2021||India||‘You have my apology and gratitude’: Smriti Irani pays tribute to soldiers, families||NEW DELHI: Union minister Smriti Irani paid a tribute to India’s soldiers and their families, saying their sacrifices are rarely acknowledged. She was speaking at a literature festival organised by the Army Wives Welfare Association on Friday.“Today as a civilian, I am here to say sorry that we do not look at you till such time when a challenge comes upon the country. You not only have my apology but my gratitude on behalf of every Indian,” the women and child development minister said.She made the comments while paying homage to India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat and 12 others who were killed in a helicopter crash. Those killed included the only survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, who died on Wednesday. The others were instantly killed.The December 8 Mi-17V5 near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, which sent shock waves through the Indian military establishment, has been dubbed a devastating setback for the ongoing military reforms and raised questions about succession in the armed forces.Irani said soldiers and their families are remembered only when the country faces a challenge or when some tragedy strikes. “We see you only when you step up to take the posthumous honour... We salute you and shower you with petals when a man in uniform comes back home in a box... We, as civilians, presume it’s a given that you’ve chosen to serve the armed forces... For that, you have my apology,” she said.“While we stood to pay homage to Madhulika ji…when I saw her on the pyre with Gen Rawat…as a civilian, I thought we don’t spare all of you a thought…When I say all of you, it included the wives and children too, till such time a tragedy strikes. You are unacknowledged by us. And for that, you have my apology,” she added.Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, the senior-most helicopter pilot in the Indian Air Force (IAF) and serving as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, is probing the CDS chopper crash. 
19-12-2021||India||Farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni floats party ahead of Punjab polls||Senior farm leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni launched a new political party on Saturday and said his outfit was aimed at battling corruption and will contest all seats in the upcoming Punjab elections.Chaduni, who leads the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) in Haryana, gained prominence by helping farm unions protesting against three now-scrapped central laws to mobilize and reach the Capital. He is a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of 40 farm unions that led the yearlong stir against the three laws. The laws were repealed in November.Chaduni called his outfit the “Sanyukt Sangharsh Party” and said he will not contest the polsl from Punjab. “Our objective will be to purify politics and bring good people forward,” said the leader.The announcement came on a day the SKM was holding a meeting to strategise for the upcoming elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, where agriculture issues are expected to have an impact on the polls.Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur are expected to go the polls early next year.Earlier in the day in Chandigarh, Chaduni said there was no decision on alliances and stressed on bringing changes in the farming sector for more employment.“Every political party is here to make money. They have made it a business and polluted it. The politicians are responsible for the capitalism, poverty and inequality in the country,” he said. “Hence we are launching our party today, which will be free of casteism and won’t bend towards any particular religion,” he added.He also backed opium farming in Punjab. “If opium farming is allowed, Punjab can progress a lot,” he said. “The purpose of the party will be to bring equality, making the state drugs free, making education and health facilities free for all,” he said.Jaspal Singh Joramajra, who was introduced as head of the party in Punjab, said they thought of forming a new party after seeing ‘atrocities” during the farmers’ protest.“Punjab has always taken a lead whenever there is a revolution; hence we are starting from Punjab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-leader-gurnam-singh-chaduni-floats-party-ahead-of-punjab-polls-101639856831706.html

His Vishal Khand, Gomtinagar residence in the state capital was searched. Others whose premises were searched were party spokesperson Rajiv Rai (Mau district’s Sahadatpura premises) and contractor Manoj Yadav from Punjabi Bagh locality of Mainpuri, who is believed to be close to the SP chief.Income tax searches are usually carried out on tipoffs about tax evasion.“I am a leader with no criminal record. Yet these raids are being carried out,” Rai said. “I want to tell my supporters to maintain calm and give no excuse to police to make a case against you on the pretext of disturbing law and order.” The spokesperson blamed income tax officials for “unnecessarily” delaying the entire exercise.The taxmen were not available for a comment. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has not spoken on the development so far.“The income tax department has jumped into election fray (from the BJP government’s side),” SP national president Akhilesh Yadav said while on the election trail in Rae Bareli before starting on the second day of his Vijay Yatra.“We were wondering where the IT department was. This (raids on SP leaders) was awaited. Now IT has come, soon ED (Enforcement Directorate that investigates financial irregularities) and other agencies will come in,” Yadav said sarcastically at a media briefing.“I had always been saying that as imminent defeat is nagging BJP, such things would begin,” the SP chief alleged. “And they have begun. Anyone who takes on this government will be victimized. Look at Azam Khan (SP parliamentarian who is in jail on charges of grabbing land), look at farmers, what this BJP government did to them.”“Now the IT department has come into the election fray. This is not CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), IT elections. It’s a people’s election,” he said. “People have made up their mind to oust this government that has caused killat, dikkat and zillat (scarcity, adversity and humiliation) to the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-uttar-pradesh-elections-income-tax-department-raids-samajwadi-party-leaders-akhilesh-slams-centre-101639856591713.html

On the other is Hindutvawadi. On one side is truth, love and non-violence, and on the other is falsehood, hatred and violence,” he said, referring to Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party.“A Hindutvavadi bathes alone in Ganga, while a Hindu bathes with crores of people... Narendra Modi says he is a Hindu, but when did he protect the truth? He said he would give two crore youth jobs, where did he do so? He asked people to bang thalis to get rid of Covid... Hindu or Hindutvawadi?” the former Congress president said, accusing the Prime Minister of speaking lies and misleading people.Amethi is my home, Gandhi declared at the rally, trying to reclaim the lost bastion and launching the Congress party’s election campaign. “I told my sister that I will visit my home (Amethi) before going to Lucknow,” Gandhi said after a 6km march from Jagdishpur to Harimau in Amethi. “ I wanted to speak to my family.” He had won in the parliamentary constituency for three times since 2004 but lost to BJP’s Smriti Irani in the 2019 general elections. Accompanied by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, he referred to his family’s close ties with the people in Amethi. His father, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has won from the seat four times. “Our relationship will continue longer and longer,” he said amid applause. Gandhi accused Modi of not working for the people but for only a few industrialists, citing the example of the contentious farm laws that were repealed by the central government. “PM introduced farm laws and said that they are going to benefit farmers. After one year, when all farmers stood together against the laws, PM had to apologise,” he said. “It was not a mistake. It was done to benefit some industrialists.” Meanwhile, Union minister Smriti Irani said the Congress leaders had to “get people from Lucknow and Chhattisgarh” which “speaks volumes about their relationship” with her constituency.“Today the siblings were in Amethi. They had to amass crowd from Lucknow, Sant Kabir Nagar and Chhattisgarh... someone had to burn a lot of fuel… The fact that you (Nehru-Gandhi family) were in a constituency for 50 years and have to drive 50 people from Lucknow to Amethi speaks volumes about them and their relationship with my constituency. That ‘yatra’ is going nowhere,” Irani said when asked about the foot march in Amethi at the launch of her novel ‘Lal Salaam’.(with agency inputs)

19-12-2021||India||Man killed over sacrilege in Golden Temple: Police||A man was beaten to death by pilgrims at the Golden Temple in Amritsar on Saturday evening after he allegedly stepped inside the central enclosure of the sanctum sanctorum where the holy book Guru Granth Sahib is placed, picked up a diamond-encrusted sword and committed sacrilege, police said.As the man’s act was telecast on live television during the broadcast of evening prayers at the shrine, word spread fast and angry pilgrims grabbed him even as he was being taken away by employees of the SGPC, the committee that manages gurdwara affairs, and beat him to death before police arrived, officials said.The incident came months ahead of assembly elections in the state, in the campaign for which the issue of sacrilege of Sikh scriptures is already centre stage. Justice over police firing at peaceful demonstrators protesting sacrilege in Bargari village during which two people were killed in 2015 remains a key issue raised by all parties in Punjab.Also read | 'Deep-rooted conspiracy': SAD after alleged sacrilege attempt at Golden TempleAs the Golden Temple granthi (priest) Giani Baljit Singh was reciting evening hymns on Saturday, a young man dressed in a brown suit rushed towards the scripture, jumped over the railing around it, trampled on a rumala (the decorative cloth on which the holy book is installed), and picked up a sword before he was overpowered by staff, police said.“Before he could go any further, the SGPC employees caught him to take him to the SGPC head office in the Teja Singh Samundri Hall. While the employees were taking him to the office, some of the other devotees present in the shrine beat him up so much that he died upon reaching the office,” deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Parminder Singh Bhandal said.“As per the CCTV footage, the man had come alone and seemed to be around 23 year old. The body has been sent to the civil hospital and a post-mortem examination will be held on Sunday. His identity is still unknown. We have all the CCTV footage and will investigate each and every aspect related to the incident,” Bhandal said.SGPC officials said the sword that was picked up by the man menacingly was encrusted with diamonds and was donated by 19th century ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh. They said by appearance the man did not look like a local, but police said the claim needed further investigation.The officials said this was the second such incident in four days. On December 15, a person threw a Gutka Sahib (a booklet of selected religious hymns) in the Golden Temple sarovar (pond). With the help of CCTV footage, members of a task force of the SGPC caught the person, who was then handed over to police. A case was registered against him for hurting religious sentiments.“Earlier, sacrilege incidents happened at other places, but now this is being done at the Golden Temple itself,” SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami said.Speaking of the December 15 incident, he said, “While handing over the accused, we asked police to ascertain who was behind the offence. But, he was sent to judicial remand and police did nothing concrete.”“I feel as the state elections are coming, there may be a deep-rooted conspiracy behind these incidents.

She also suggested that people should be wary of such announcements made ahead of polls.“During the BSP government’s tenure, an effort was made to come up with a Noida-Ballia 8 lane expressway that would have linked Delhi with eastern UP and help end problems of poverty, exodus and unemployment. Then the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Samajwadi Party all had opposed it,” she tweeted on Saturday.“Now, nearer to the elections, despite five years of a double engine government, meaning 10 years in all, the foundation stone of the Ganga Expressway has been laid after bifurcating it into two phases. For how long will people continue to be duped by such selfish politics? People need to exercise caution as it is important to do so during elections,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-wary-of-selfish-politics-before-polls-mayawati-on-ganga-eway-101639856053165.html
19-12-2021||India||Man lynched over sacrilege at Golden Temple||A man was beaten to death by pilgrims at the Golden Temple in Amritsar on Saturday evening after he allegedly stepped inside the central enclosure of the sanctum sanctorum where the holy book Guru Granth Sahib is placed, picked up a diamond-encrusted sword and committed sacrilege, police said.As the man’s act was telecast on live television during the broadcast of evening prayers at the shrine, word spread fast and angry pilgrims grabbed him even as he was being taken away by employees of the SGPC, the committee that manages gurdwara affairs, and beat him to death before police arrived, officials said.The incident came months ahead of assembly elections in the state, in the campaign for which the issue of sacrilege of Sikh scriptures is already centre stage. Justice over police firing at peaceful demonstrators protesting sacrilege in Bargari village during which two people were killed in 2015 remains a key issue raised by all parties in Punjab.As the Golden Temple granthi (priest) Giani Baljit Singh was reciting evening hymns on Saturday, a young man dressed in a brown suit rushed towards the scripture, jumped over the railing around it, trampled on a rumala (the decorative cloth on which the holy book is installed), and picked up a sword before he was overpowered by staff, police officials said.“Before he could go any further, the SGPC employees caught him to take him to the SGPC head office in the Teja Singh Samundri Hall. While the employees were taking him to the office, some of the other devotees present in the shrine beat him up so much that he died upon reaching the office,” deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Parminder Singh Bhandal said.“As per the CCTV footage, the man had come alone and seemed to be around 23 year old. The body has been sent to the civil hospital and a post-mortem examination will be held on Sunday. His identity is still unknown. We have all the CCTV footage and will investigate each and every aspect related to the incident,” Bhandal said.SGPC officials said the sword that was picked up by the man menacingly was encrusted with diamonds and was donated by 19th century ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh. They said by appearance the man did not look like a local, but police said the claim needed further investigation.The officials said this was the second such incident in four days. On December 15, a person threw a Gutka Sahib (a booklet of selected religious hymns) in the Golden Temple sarovar (pond). With the help of CCTV footage, members of a task force of the SGPC caught the person, who was then handed over to police. A case was registered against him for hurting religious sentiments.“Earlier, sacrilege incidents happened at other places, but now this is being done at the Golden Temple itself,” SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami said.Speaking of the December 15 incident, he said, “While handing over the accused, we asked police to ascertain who was behind the offence. But, he was sent to judicial remand and police did nothing concrete.”“I feel as the state elections are coming, there may be a deep-rooted conspiracy behind these incidents. Police often shrug off their responsibility by saying that the accused was mentally disturbed.”Police tightened security around the shrine complex on Saturday to ensure peace.

The CM was speaking at an event in Shahjahanpur after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the Ganga Expressway. During the event , PM Modi credited Yogi Adityanath of doing away with the “katta culture” (culture of firearms) that he said used to be prevalent in western UP during the tenure of past governments. “The foundation stone laying event by Prime Minister Modi will usher in new opportunities of growth and development. From 1947 to 2017, just one expressway was built in the state, but since then six expressways are being made,” the CM said. “For the first time, labourers are being felicitated,” he said recalling how after the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi on December 13, the PM had honoured those labourers who had played a part in the project.“During Prayagraj Kumbh, too, the PM had washed the feet of those workers who had kept the Kumbh venue clean,” Adityanath said. On the occasion, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya urged the people to help the BJP form the government after the next election with an even bigger majority than in 2017. UP ministers Suresh Khanna, Satish Mahana and Jitin Prasada were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-one-expressway-in-uttar-pradesh-till-2017-six-being-built-now-yogi-adityanath-101639854971552.html

The chief minister has even given a call to party cadres to burn effigies of the state and central BJP leaders on Monday in protest against the Centre’s anti-farmer policies. KTR took a dig at the BJP government in Bengaluru for cancelling the show of Kamra and Faruqui last month citing “law and order” issues and describing Faruqui as a “controversial figure.”“People from Bengaluru claim their city is cosmopolitan and then end up taking comedy very seriously. We (Hyderabad) are a truly cosmopolitan city that welcomes all cultures and also welcomes criticism. You can come here, criticise the government… in fact, we receive a lot of brickbats from our opposition every day. We are very tolerant,” KTR said.

The review will be based on the findings of the court of inquiry into the crash,” the IAF chief said on the sidelines of a graduation parade at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal near Hyderabad.Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, the IAF’s senior-most helicopter pilot and currently serving as the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, is probing the chopper crash. Singh has defied death multiple times in his 39-year military career, including once during one of the gravest emergencies in IAF history involving the Russian-origin Mi-17 helicopter.Also read | When will India get remaining Rafale jets? IAF chief provides a timelineRawat and the others were killed in a Mi-17V5, an advanced variant of the Mi-17, crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu. Those killed included the only survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, who died on Wednesday after battling for his life for a week. The others died instantly on December 8.The inquiry into the crash is likely to be concluded in a few weeks.“I wouldn’t like to pre-empt the findings of the court of inquiry as it’s a thorough process. It will investigate every single angle and look into every single aspect of what could have gone wrong, and come out with suitable recommendations and findings,” Chaudhari said.The CDS helicopter crash sent shock waves not only through the Indian military establishment but the entire country, and has been dubbed a devastating setback for the ongoing military reforms and raised questions about succession in the armed forces.At this point, it is not clear what went wrong with the helicopter in the final moments of the crash though the weather in the area where it went down did not have good visibility.Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to deliver a talk when the chopper crashed.The Mi-17V5 took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am, and was scheduled to land in Wellington at 12.15pm. But air traffic control at Sulur lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08pm when it was just seven minutes from its destination.The air force currently operates around 145 such choppers that are considered advanced, reliable and safe. India contracted 151 Mi-17V5 helicopters from Russia, and at least six of them have been lost in accidents since their induction a decade ago.Developed by Russian Helicopters, the Mi-17V5 is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment. It can also airdrop assault forces behind enemy lines.The helicopter, capable of day and night missions in adverse weather, is equipped with modern avionics, a self-defence system and advanced features that significantly enhance its survivability.The Mi-17V5, which has an armoured cockpit, can be fitted with rockets, cannons and small arms for offensive roles. It has service ceiling of 6,000 metre, top speed of 250 kmph and a maximum range of 1,180km with additional fuel tanks.Chaudhari said India was continuously evaluating the threats from Pakistan and China and was well aware of the situation at the borders. “The stand-off with China still continues. Though disengagement of troops has taken place in certain areas in Ladakh, complete disengagement has not taken place. IAF will continue to maintain deployment at forward locations. We are prepared to take on any challenge that we may face in that area,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vvip-flying-protocols-will-change-iaf-chief-101639849870158.html
19-12-2021||India||Security beefed up in Kolkata ahead of civic body polls on Sunday||Security was tightened all over the Bengal capital and its entry points as the city geared up for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections on Sunday. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were clamped within 100 metres of all polling stations. More than 23,500 policemen have been deployed to ensure the safety of voters and the candidates contesting in the city’s 144 civic wards. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) currently controls 126 of these seats and is expected to repeat its performance because of being in power, political observers feel. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won five seats in the 2015 polls, alleged that the ruling party had ferried in outsiders to create trouble on Sunday. “Our leaders have spotted people from the districts coming to Kolkata in buses. We apprehend trouble. The TMC never allows free and fair elections,” said Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar. Kolkata police commissioner Soumen Mitra, who inspected the security arrangements and ordered random inspection of vehicles in the city at its entry points, told the media that all precautions have been taken. “We are confident that the elections will be peaceful,” Mitra said. The state election commission (SEC) has installed security cameras inside all polling booths, counting centres and facilities to be used for storing around 6,500 electronic voting machines (EVMs) following an order of the Calcutta high court passed on December 16. The petition was filed by the BJP. The BJP had also moved the high court seeking deployment of central armed police forces (CAPF). It told the court that BJP candidates and voters may face violence on Sunday and cited the alleged killings after the March-April assembly polls as the ground for such apprehension. The BJP’s petition was rejected by a single bench on Thursday and the division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj on Friday night. The party challenged the order in the Supreme Court but no hearing was held till Saturday evening. “The high court orders have proved that the BJP is making baseless allegations to divert people’s attention. The party could not even find any strong candidate,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. The police on Saturday evening arrested three men from the Taratala area when they were found to be carrying firearms. State BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “If there is even one spot of trouble during the polls, we will move the court and file a complaint with the special investigation team that the high court formed to probe the violence after the assembly elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-beefed-up-in-kolkata-ahead-of-civic-body-polls-on-sunday-101639842970279.html

He is correct. However, India cannot look the other way when the United States (US) seems to be going all out to haul up the Sheikh Hasina government. The American hostility became evident when Washington did not invite Bangladesh to the Democracy Summit.

The students are now in Class 12, having been promoted en masse as the final exam could not be held in April due to the raging second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The exams were the first serious one after educational institutions closed on March 25, 2020. The results are yet another illustration of the severe learning loss that has happened across different educational segments and social classes (due to the lack of inadequate online learning infrastructure) — and it is almost a certainty that the situation is the same in all states. The worst hit have been the primary class students. Around 320 million students have not stepped into a classroom for more than a year. Schools started reopening only in July and they have been plagued by closures.
