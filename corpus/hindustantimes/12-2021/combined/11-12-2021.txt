The man was identified as Sudesh Kumar, a grocey shop owner and a resident of Karawal Nagar in Delhi. Police said his wife Anupama Kumar (38), who facilitated him in executing the murder, was also arrested. The body was later identified to be that of 42-year-old Doman Ravidas, a native of Bihar. On November 20, Ghaziabad police launched an investigation after they received information that a dead body of a man was lying at a vacant plot in Indirapuri locality in Loni. A police team reached the spot and on frisking the body, they found an Aadhaar Card, which belonged to Kumar. Police said the face was reportedly burnt to hide identity.When police contacted his family members for identification of the body, Kumar’s wife Anupama reached the spot and identified the body as that of her husband in haste. Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural), said, “The police got suspicious on two accounts. First, Anupama identified the body immediately as that of her husband even though the face was defaced. Secondly, it looked like the man’s face was burnt to hide his identity and the Aadhaar card was left with the body on purpose. These two factors led the police to suspect that there was some foul play.” Police said while unearthing Kumar’s past history, they found he had obtained bail in May from Delhi in connection with the murder of his daughter, who had allegedly eloped with a man. Besides, they also came across CCTV footage near Kumar’s house where he could be seen carrying a gunny bag on his bicycle on the night of the murder. Based on electronic surveillance and local information, police established that Kumar was alive and arrested him when he came to meet his wife on late Friday night. Following his arrest, Kumar told police he wanted to avoid going back to jail and planned the murder when he found that the deceased mason had body features similar to his. He wanted to project that he was murdered by some unidentified assailants. “Kumar called the mason to repair the roof of his house. On November 18, he gave the mason his clothes and asked him to wear it next day before coming to work. On the night of November 19, he offered liquor to the mason, which the latter consumed, and murdered him while hitting his head with a heavy log of wood. Thereafter, he packed the body in a gunny bag and carried it to Loni on a bicycle. As per plan, later, his wife identified the body as that of her husband,” said Raja. Police said Kumar allegedly burnt the face of the mason and went into hiding after dumping the body in Loni. Police registered a case against the couple under sections 302 (murder), 204 (destruction of evidence), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 416 (cheating by personation) of the IPC at Loni Border police station in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-fakes-his-murder-to-avoid-going-back-to-prison-101639247322821.html

Residents in the neighbourhood had to bear foul smell and the filthy sight while passing through the locality. Pune Municipal Corporation has been unable to check pig menace with increasing population of the scavenger in core areas of the city like Katraj, Baner, Wanowrie, Kothrud and Mundhwa. As per a corporator, the civic administration has not taken adequate measures to address the issue. Akash Mirdhe, a resident of Nancy Lake said, “The pig menace is across the city. Most of the vacant plots are turned into garbage dumping grounds with neither residents nor PMC solid waste department taking notice of it.” “The department is taking steps to clear residential areas of pigs. Solid waste management department is also removing waste from dumping spots on a regular basis,” said PMC health department junior officer on request of anonymity. Ajeet Deshmukh, deputy commissioner, who has been given charge of solid waste management department in PMC did not respond to calls. Pune ranks as fifth cleanest city in the Swachh Survekshan 2021, but ground reality belies the survey, residents claim. Corporator Vasant More who is also president of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena Pune unit tweeted, “A nice selfie point has been set up along the main road at Nancy Lake Homes, where only pigs used to live two months ago.

11-12-2021||Mumbai||At 81, Sharad Pawar takes on the task of uniting opposition against BJP||As he turns 81 on Sunday, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is busy preparing to unite opposition parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the next general elections. His close aides say the Maratha strongman is willing to take an initiative in bringing opposition parties together and even play the role of a mediator between the Congress and Trinamool Congress, provided he is given a prominent role by the opposition parties for these efforts. In its national executive held at New Delhi on December 7, the NCP called for the creation of an anti-BJP opposition front in the country based on the principle of “collective leadership.” In her visit to Mumbai, while Pawar stood next to her, West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee, said there was no United Progressive Alliance (UPA) left in the country and pitched for unifying opposition parties to take on the BJP. Pawar, however, maintained that the intention was not to keep the Congress away but to unify everyone in an “anti-BJP front”.While he remains a tricky partner for the Congress, Pawar is also in touch with key opposition parties like Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party. His close aides in the party as well as ally Shiv Sena would like him to head the opposition front though Congress, which is traditionally the fulcrum of such efforts, is not willing to accept this. Back in Maharashtra, Pawar’s NCP is also looking at taking over Congress’ support base even though the two parties are part of the ruling MVA coalition. “Politically, the Congress is not what it was a decade ago, and it must come to terms with this. For instance, in Maharashtra, which had a Congress chief minister till 2014, it does not even have its deputy chief minister in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,” explained a senior NCP minister who has worked closely with Pawar. He however added that they do want the Congress to be part of the anti-BJP alliance. In the past, Pawar has likened the Congress to the impoverished landlords in Uttar Pradesh, who lost their landholdings to ceiling laws, yet reminisce about past glories. Expectedly, many in Congress look at Pawar with suspicion. A Congress Rajya Sabha MP said that, like always, Pawar seemed to be keeping his options open for any future realignments. Much would depend on the outcome of the 2022 state assembly elections, and the verdict of the 2024 polls. The MP pointed at how Pawar never burns bridges. In 1999, he formed the NCP after being expelled from the Congress, but allied with the Congress to form the government in Maharashtra months later.However, he was unlikely to do anything that could rock the MVA’s boat in Maharashtra, considering that Banerjee has no presence here. “Banerjee is a fighter, but is a maverick. Pawar has never gone with maverick politicians considering his long-term stakes,” he explained. A former Congress MP said the NCP’s manoeuvres may be aimed at weaning away sections like the Muslims and the Dalits, who resented the growth of political Hindutva. Since Pawar is seen as the anchor of the MVA, which kept the BJP out of power, the NCP may be positioning itself as the real opposition to the BJP, to gain the support of these groups. At the same time, Pawar may be trying to pitch himself as the chairperson of the UPA or making a case for the UPA to be replaced with another front. The octogenarian Pawar has also nursed Prime Ministerial ambitions since the 1990s when he was in the Congress. However, these plans may be hobbled by the NCP’s inherent limitations. As a Congress minister notes, the party is seen as an outfit of the dominant Marathas. It has negligible presence across the country, unlike the Congress, which has a formidable footprint. The Dalits, who were often at odds with the Marathas, would continue to support the Congress instead of switching to the NCP, he averred.Political analyst Prakash Pawar said that while Sharad Pawar seemed to send a message that since senior leader Rahul Gandhi was unwilling to lead the Congress and the UPA, it was time for “collective leadership”. But, he had not called for the Congress to be kept away from the front, unlike Banerjee, who wanted to replace the Congress. He added that Pawar had traditionally taken a centrist approach, and had always opposed the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-81-sharad-pawar-takes-on-the-task-of-uniting-opposition-against-bjp-101639246063381.html

Officials from the health department said the three new cases, which emerged on Saturday, are the contacts of the 14-year-old girl who tested positive for the viral infection on Friday. Among the girl’s contacts who tested positive on Saturday are a 10-year-old girl, a 42-year-old man and a woman aged 40. “All the three patients are family members of the girl who tested positive on Friday. They all have been asked to stay in home isolation. The two adult members, who samples returned positive for Covid on Saturday, have taken both the vaccine doses. It is encouraging to see that none of the four family members have any severe conditions. All the 15 active cases are in home isolation and have not required hospitalisation till date,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. The 14-year-old girl and her family members stay in a high-rise in Crossings Republik township in Ghaziabad. The head of the family has a travel history from Gujarat. According to official data, till December 11, there are 96 people in the district who have acquired the infection after being fully vaccinated. Officials said of the 96 cases, 24 developed mild symptoms while the rest were asymptomatic. “Our teams are trying to increase testing as there is a minor rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. We have already prepared a contingency plan for the district and the hospitals have also been asked to be ready if there is a spike in Covid-19 cases in future,” said Dr Gupta. According to the official records of the district health department, there have been 55,695 Covid cases since March last year, which include 461 deaths. So far, in the current month, the district has conducted total 44,441 Covid tests. The daily target given by the state government is 3,900 RT-PCR tests and 3,500 tests through rapid antigen kits. “We have observed a trend that people are not coming out to get themselves tested. It is vital that testing be increased and anyone suffering symptoms such as cough and cold should take the Covid test. The figures show a minor increase in cases and it is time that hospitals be kept on standby with all the necessary infrastructure and facilities in place. The vaccination is still lagging behind with regard to the administration of first doses to eligible beneficiaries and it should be expedited,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to data available on the CoWIN portal, till Saturday evening, the district administered 4,047,239 vaccine doses, which includes 2,502,298 first doses against the target of administering 2,702,167 doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-family-members-of-covid-infected-14-yr-old-girl-test-positive-in-ghaziabad-101639245402884.html

Also, the education qualification of the medical staff at the centre should be checked and if the inspecting official finds any lacunae in the same then legal action could be initiated against the centre.The PMC will also check for the biowaste disposal system at the centre.The action comes in the light of the fake gang of doctors busted by the Pune police crime branch unit running illegally at Viman nagar. The bogus doctors were found to have duped over 300 patients. The doctors were running the clinic without any medical qualifications.The accused were booked under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-police-bust-an-illegal-hair-treatment-centre-pmc-seeks-validation-of-all-such-clinics-101639243902689.html
11-12-2021||Mumbai||Missing Swedish minor found in Mumbai||Mumbai: Responding to an Interpol’s Yellow Notice (pertaining to a missing person), the Mumbai Crime Branch traced a 17-year-old Swedish girl who had come to Mumbai to meet a 19-year-old friend whom she first interacted with on social media platform, Instagram.The teenager was traced to a house in Subhash Nagar, Cheetah Camp, and reunited with her father who flew down on Friday, an official said. The duo returned to Sweden on Saturday. The girl’s father, Sardar Tomar, filed a missing person’s complaint at the Skepepparbacken police station in Sweden on November 27, after failing to locate his daughter for several hours. By analysing the teen’s social media activity, the Swedish police found that she was in regular touch with a Mumbai-based teenager on photo-sharing platform, Instagram. Her passport details revealed that she had travelled to Mumbai. The Unit 6 of the Mumbai CB received a ‘Yellow Notice’ through their Interpol coordination cell. Unit in-charge, senior inspector Ravindra Salunkhe and his team conducted extensive search and located the girl’s friend, an 18-year-old college student, in Chembur. His sustained enquiry led the police team to a house in Cheetah Camp, Chembur where the girl had been staying for the past week. CB Interpol co-ordinator, inspector Yogesh Sable informed the Delhi Interpol and the Swedish Embassy about her, Salunkhe said. The girl was also sent to the Dongri children’s home. The girl’s father and other family members reached Mumbai on Friday to take her back home. Another police officer said the girl came in contact with the Mumbai man in January 2020 and the duo were in regular contact.Last month, following a domestic spat, the teenager applied for a tourist visa and flew to India last month. The young man had helped his friend find a place to stay at his relative’s home, and asked his sister to stay with her.“On Friday, the girl’s father arrived in Mumbai and produced relevant documents. After due verification and securing NOCs from concerned authorities, Sweden embassy and central government officers, the girl was handed over to her father after due counselling by the officers at the children home,” said Crime Branch DCP (detection) Neelotpal.The father-daughter duo on Saturday travelled back to Sweden.

It is noticed that the residents of Dharavi often hesitate to take Covid tests. They have a hand to mouth existence and feel they cannot afford one. So, we are organising free testing camps as well.”BMC has also approached private practitioners in Dharavi and roped in non-governmental organisations who are already working in Dharavi to inoculate its residents, to conduct surveys and to coach unvaccinated residents.Dighavkar said, “We have asked doctors who operate clinics in Dharavi to speak to those who visit them. Door-to-door surveys to check vaccination will also be done, and we have roped in NGOs to help with this.”A 49-year-old male, who returned from Tanzania and landed in Mumbai on December 4, had tested positive for Covid in his RT-PCR test done at the airport on arrival. He was tested even though Tanzania is not among the at-risk countries categorised by the Indian government, as a part of tests done randomly for 2% of international passengers.While on his way to Dharavi, the person received his positive RTPCR report. He was quarantined, and his sample was sent for genome sequencing. On Friday, the genome sequencing results revealed he tested positive for the Omicron variant.Dighavkar said, “On December 4 itself, all protocol was followed and two high-risk contacts of this person were tested. They tested negative. No more procedure is remaining. The person is being treated at the Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri, and is asymptomatic.”At the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, Dharavi was a Covid hotspot in Mumbai. BMC had then adopted its 3T approach to successfully contain the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-starts-three-point-response-after-dharavi-reports-one-omicron-case-101639242643827.html

11-12-2021||Lucknow||75% work of UP’s Saryu canal project was done under SP rule: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday exchanged barbs over the Saryu Nahar (canal) National Project and BJP’s new catchphrase for 2022 UP assembly polls—”Farq Saaf Hai” (difference is clear).Hours before PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the ₹9800 crore project in east UP’s Balrampur district, Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav in two tweets in Hindi claimed that three-fourth the project work was done during his regime and that the BJP only cut ribbons of the projects initiated by them. While Akhilesh in his tweets called the BJP government “kainchijivi” (those cutting ribbons)”, the PM said someone might have cut its ribbon in their “childhood” without taking any names. “Three-fourth of the Saryu Nahar National Project work was done during the SP government and this BJP government took five years to complete the remaining work,” the SP chief claimed in his tweet.Akhilesh’s tweet was seemingly in response to the PM Modi’s tweets the night before in which he had said: “You would be shocked to know that work on the Saryu Nahar National Project began in 1978 but for decades the project was never completed. Costs increased and so did people’s woes. A project that remained incomplete for four decades has been finished in four years.”In what appeared to be a jibe at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, the PM said after inaugurating the project, “When I started from Delhi, I was waiting for someone to say that he had cut the ribbon of this project and started this scheme. This is the habit of some people, maybe in their childhood they had cut its ribbon. Some people’s priority is ‘imagination’, ours is execution.”After the inauguration of the project, Akhilesh at a press conference in Lucknow said and also tweeted in an apparent reference to BJP’s “Fraq Saaf Hai” campaign: “There are basically two types of people in the world, some who really work and some who appropriate others’ work. This is the difference between the government of SP and today’s ‘Kainchijivi’ (ribbon cutting) government. That’s why in 2022 elections the BJP is going to be completely wiped out.” “The BJP is about to complete five years in power but they have not even had the time to look at their own ‘sankalp patra’ (manifesto). They are spending money meant for schemes in ads, banners and hoardings. Samajwadi Party gave students laptops while the BJP has rained lathis on the youth. Yeh ‘Farq Saaf Hai’ (the difference between the previous SP government and the present BJP government is clear). If anyone wants to change any name, give a request to the chief minister and the name will be changed— Farq Saaf Hai,” Akhilesh tweeted.“Our government arranged the land for AIIMS in Gorakhpur while the BJP people filed PILs to put hurdles in the project—Farq Saaf Hai. This BJP government announced a university in the name of their leader and the late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee but did not build the university itself. From where has the university been functioning from? At a floor from the Ram Manohar Lohia Institute built by the SP government-Farq Saaf Hai,” he said.When asked about speculations of alliance with union minister and BJP ally Anupriya Patel and her party Apna Dal (Solelal), Akhilesh said at the press conference, “We will see but first she should quit her ministership”. The Samajwadi Party has already allied with the other faction of Apna Dal—Apna Dal (Krishna Patel)—led by Anupriya’s mother Krishna Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/75-work-of-up-s-saryu-canal-project-was-done-under-sp-rule-akhilesh-101639242102931.html

Chauhan was cremated with full state honours at Tajganj crematorium here in the afternoon. His daughter Aradhya, 12, and son Aviraj,7, lit the pyre.

Then the mortal remains of the IAF officer left for his house in a military truck. All along the 8-km stretch from the airport to Saran Nagar, locals showered flower petals on the vehicle as a mark of tribute to the departed soul. A large number of people had gathered outside Chauhan’s house to pay their last respects to him.

This and many more important decisions were taken at a progress review meeting of the works of Magh Mela-2022 held under divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal on Friday.In the meeting, held at ICCC auditorium located in the Prayagraj Mela Authority office, it was decided that in an effort to maintain cleanliness of the rivers, necessary guidelines be given to the authorities concerned to prevent 100% discharge of untreated sewage into rivers. “Besides, samples of the drain water would be collected and the same would be tested at labs of pollution control board and Ganga pollution control unit as the lab located at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) has limited resources,” the commissioner said.“In order to stop erosion due to the strong currents of the Ganga in various places of the Mela area, the irrigation department has been asked to take necessary steps to check it,” he added. While reviewing the works of public works department (PWD), the commissioner directed that as the pace of construction of pontoon bridges being built in the Mela area was slow, officers should ensure that bridge number 1 and 2, being built on Mahavir and Triveni Margs, were completed by December 15 and the other three bridges by December 25.In view of pandemic and the necessary precautions to be taken thereof, the health department has been instructed to arrange sampling centres and ambulances in sufficient quantity. The department is also making arrangements for 15 sampling centres, 30 ambulances and about 11 vaccination centres for the annual mela this time. For proper hyenine and cleanliness, it has been agreed to build 15,000 toilets in the mela area. Of these, there would be 1500 pre-fabricated steel toilets, 3,000 tent toilets, 300 urinals, 9,000 institutional toilets and 900 at government institutions.For the devotees, authorities would be constructing at least 10 ghats stretching from Nagvasuki to Sangam. Because of these ghats, the numbers of devotees wishing to take a dip at Sangam would be diverted accordingly to avoid overcrowding. It has been made clear to all that consumption of non-vegetarian food, liquor or use of any other type of intoxicant would remain strictly prohibited in the mela area. Likewise, obscene or vulgar dances or songs will also be prohibited. Authorities have decided that like previous melas, there would be two central control rooms for lost and found camp. The entire mela area would be illuminated by several high-mast and proper lighting. Installing blower or heaters in the camps would be prohibited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-magh-mela-2022-untreated-waste-falling-into-ganga-yamuna-to-be-stopped-101639241022924.html

By scanning these QR codes with their mobile phones, users will be able to access relevant information regarding proper use of these exercise machines, officials say.The decision in this regard was taken at the review meeting held under divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal to assess the progress of the works being done under Smart City Project and Prayagraj Development Authority. “The open-air gyms were started by us with the aim of helping denizens remain fit and to provide all the exercising equipment to them free of cost which were otherwise only available in commercially run gymnasiums. Now as the user scans the QR code from their mobile phones, all the information about how the machine can be used and for which exercise would become available immediately”, said divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal. Display of these QR codes would go a long way in making these equipment more user friendly, he added. For the past around two years, a set of 12 equipment with the numbers differing slightly as per the area available have been installed at different parks, roadsides and open spaces in various localities of the city. As the sets of exercise equipment are very sturdy and free of cost, it became an instant hit among the locals and within no time they became immensely popular. Among the locations where these exercising equipment are installed include Durga Puja Park of Preetam Nagar, Children’s Park Church Lane, Shivaji Park and Saraswati Park of Mumforganj, D Park of Katra, Kalyani Devi Park of Attarsuai, Ramleela Park of Allahapur, Swarooprani Park of Zero Road, Dilip Jaiswal Park of Kdyganj, Hashimpur Park of Tagore town etc.Along with these, open spaces besides several important roads also have the equipment installed. Some of the equipment include chin-up dipping, standing waist trainer, solder wheel, space walker, bicycle, leg press, rowing machine, pull chair, chest press, scaling ladder, sit up bench etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-qr-codes-on-all-exercising-machines-in-prayagraj-s-open-air-gyms-101639240362982.html

According to officials, PU’s vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary asked the colleges to initiate decentralised admission by treating vacant seats as ‘casual vacancies’ and fill them by December end.PU commenced the centralised admission process on August 1 and concluded in November.As per the varsity officials, colleges would prioritise students who had already applied in the centralised admission process and give preference to the applicants based on merit. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said, “The details of honours-wise vacancies have been made available to the concerned institutions. Admission process under casual vacancies is likely to expedite from Monday.”Colleges with vacant seats are Magadh Mahila College (175), Patna College (244), BN College (231), Patna Science College (117) and Vanijya Mahavidyalaya (84).

The inquiry ordered by him also could not start as three of the five members of the inquiry committee refused to be part of it. The V-C had alleged irregularities in the outsourcing of staff also in his letter.Qudus, on the other hand, said he would reply to the notice. “In a democracy, everyone has a right to defend himself and speak up. I felt wrong, and so I raised the issues. I have not made full payment to the firm. Against the supply of 1.60-lakh answer books, the university had to pay ₹28 lakh. I have stopped the ₹6-lakh payment, as the GSM (grams per square meter) had not been decided. As far as the syndicate decision is concerned, I have the power under the Bihar State Universities Act to accept the recommendation or not. The syndicate has indeed approved payment to the staff as before. I will refer the matter to the Chancellor office or the education department for their guidance,” he added.Singh said that there was a laid down procedure for everything, and the V-C could not take any decision by his whims and fancies. “I welcome the government’s move to go in for performance audit of all the state universities. I had raised the issue of performance and financial auditing in universities at the very beginning, as there is a lot that needs to be set right. Even the employees’ basic details and origin are not properly available, and no automated updating is done. I have had an unblemished track record spanning over four decades. The college where I was the principal, National PG College (Lucknow), is among the top colleges at the national level. What I have done at Bihar universities is for all to see, though a lot more is needed,” he said, adding “Pataliputra University during his temporary charge was the only university in the state that could conduct pre-Ph.D registration test in the last five years and LNMU successfully conducted the combined B.Ed entrance test, but those who work often end up facing obstacles.”The LNMU V-C said that he had been given temporary charge of three universities and made the head of the search committee by the Raj Bhawan. “Not only Qudus, but all the V-Cs appointed by the search committee headed by me are also from Bihar, contrary to the perception being developed that all the V-Cs are from UP. I work with no baggage. I have no axe to grind. Qudus wrote against me while he cleared the payment for the company that supplied answer books. Negotiations were also done with the company. If the order was wrong, he should have cancelled the tender and invited a fresh one. He also took overcharge in my absence as I was in Lucknow those days. There was no formal handing over of charge, while he said his joining was delayed with an ulterior motive,” he added.Maintaining that the V-C is not involved with the tendering process, Singh said that he had, however, issued a resolution that the quantity of the answer books to be purchased should not be more than 10% of the requirement and if there was any delay in issuing the fresh tender, old, established process should be adopted. “Exams cannot wait and therefore 10% extra copies should be normally there to be ready for any eventuality, viz. exam cancellation, destruction or any other reason. I don’t even know the company that has supplied answer books. If Md Qudus had reasons to believe that there was anything wrong with the process adopted or quality, he should not have allowed payment and simply ordered fresh tender,” he added.Despite all the heat generated over him, Singh remains the V-C of LNMU and continues to hold the additional charge of Aryabhat Knowledge University and Pataliputra University. In Pataliputra University, a new V-C, RK Singh from Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Institute of Technology (Uttarakhand), was appointed on November 24 but is yet to take charge even after a fortnight. “What is the hurry? I will take charge after completing some formalities, and once I do, it will be known,” he said.

11-12-2021||Pune||Pune ophthalmologists urge state health minister to allow day care facilities at eye clinics||PUNE Members of the Poona Ophthalmological Society (POS) have urged state health minister Rajesh Tope to allow eye clinics and OPD (Out Patient Department) centres to run as day care centres.A day care procedure allows one to be hospitalised at the centre for less than 24 hours which allows in return for the patients to claim benefits under health insurance schemes.Tope, who was at the 14th annual two-day conference of the Poona Ophthalmological Society ‘POS Spectrum 2021’ on Saturday, promised to expedite the process and allow day care centres at eye clinics.Dr Prakash Marathe, the chief trustee of POS, said, “Under the Bombay Nursing Home Act, a medical facility can be registered as a nursing home/ hospital or a clinic. While hospitals and nursing homes can treat IPD and OPD patients, clinics are allowed to treat only OPD patients since they do not need any admission. However, if the government allows eye clinics to be registered as day care facilities, the ophthalmologists can conduct most eye procedures which require less than 24 hours of admission.”“The patient can also claim benefits under various health insurance schemes that require hospitalisation. Even after a complicated eye surgery the patient is required to be admitted only for a few hours and eye clinics would be able to do that under day care centre facilities,” he said.At the event, Tope also emphasised the importance of eye donations and that the ophthalmological society must work to create awareness of eye donations.He said, “We were able to bring down blindness in the state from 3.5% to almost 0.35% which we aim to further bring down to 0.25% in the next two to five years under the central government scheme of the national programme for control of blindness”“We know that cataract is the major cause of blindness in over 80% of the cases. Also, some of the causes could be birth defects and also diabetes. The state of Maharashtra also provides free spectacles to children as today the exposure to radiation through multiple screens like TV, laptop, mobile and others is unavoidable. The ophthalmological society needs to work even more to create awareness towards eye donation,” he said.“The number of eye banks, eye donations and eye transplants need to increase. In the last two years because of the pandemic the work regarding non-communicable diseases was completely hampered but now we need to fill in the gaps,” he said.India’s leading ophthalmologist Dr Tatyarao Lahane also emphasised on the need to increase eye donation awareness.He said, “Despite being a smaller country in terms of population than us, we have to import eyeballs and corneas from our neighbour Sri Lanka. With about one lakh deaths annually Sri Lanka gets over 2 lakh corneas and with approximately ten lakh deaths, we get around 70 thousand eyeballs only.Dr Lahane also said that to reduce the conflict between patients and the doctors, the doctor must explain the procedure in detail not just to the patient but also to the relatives.He said, “I have seen that more bilateral and mature cataract surgeries are coming up now. Counselling is important, not just to the relatives but to the patients as well. With proper counselling, patients and doctors’ conflicts will reduce.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-ophthalmologists-urge-state-health-minister-to-allow-day-care-facilities-at-eye-clinics-101639237062261.html
11-12-2021||Mumbai||Nizam’s city just four hours away from Mumbai||Mumbai: Imagine travelling to The city of Nizams in just four hours from Mumbai. It isn’t a far-fetched dream but a reality in the making. A detailed project report (DPR) is being prepared for the proposed Mumbai-Hyderabad high speed rail corridor by National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), a subsidiary of Railway Ministry formed to build highspeed train routes (called bullet trains) in India.If this plan works out, passengers will be able to travel between Mumbai and Hyderabad by a high-speed train in about four hours. It will be at least ten hours less than the time required to travel by train as of now and a little more than double the time required by a flight which is an average 90 minutes. Mumbai-Hyderabad high speed rail corridor is likely to be a joint project of the central and the Maharashtra government.In response to Railway’s plans, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has already written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi offering to work jointly on the project which will also connect some cities in Maharashtra. It is proposed that a 10-coach train with a capacity of approximately 750 passengers should be operated between Mumbai and Hyderabad. A senior NHSRCL official informed that the proposed alignment of the corridor will be different considering mountainous terrain on the route. It will be overground unlike the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train which will be partially underground. The DPR will be submitted to the government by mid-2022 and after discussions the final alignment of Mumbai- Hyderabad will be decided.Under the DPR, an aerial survey for land acquisition is already conducted in September 2021. Study of land requirements, number of railway stations, construction of terminals and station premises, identification of overhead facilities, underhead and underground utilities is being done. The cost of the project too is yet to be worked out. It will depend on the land acquisition process, said officials.According to the NHSRCL officials nearly 1,200 hectares of land would be required for the project. A meeting with state government officials in Maharashtra and in Telangana was held in November end and September. “The project will then go to the Railway ministry for sanction following which bids will be invited from companies to build the same,”the official added. Passenger associations say any plan to provide faster transportation for the people is a good step.“It is a welcoming move. to build a high speed corridor to connect Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad. People wanting to travel to Pune will also be able to reach their destination quicker. Though it will be a bit expensive, travelling between Mumbai and Pune would become smoother. Presently it takes upto three hours by trains.” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. Further, apart from Mumbai - Hyderabad and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project of high speed railway corridor between Mumbai - Ahmedabad, the NHSRCL will also construct Delhi - Varanasi, Mumbai Nagpur, Delhi - Ahmedabad, Chennai- Bangalore- Mysore, Delhi - Amritsar and Varanasi - Patna -Howrah high speed train corridors. The DPR of the high speed railway corridor between Mumbai -Nagpur will be submitted by NHSRCL to the state government in the starting of 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nizams-city-just-four-hours-away-from-mumbai-101639237001605.html

11-12-2021||Mumbai||Not a single first-year PG medical student joins course in 2021||Frustration, uncertainty and anguish describe the current state of the medical fraternity. With constant delays in admission due to rising Covid-19 cases and a series of petitions pending in different courts, the fraternity is left without one full batch of postgraduate (PG) medical students across the country.What’s worse- the resident doctors currently pursuing second and third-year PG medical courses are shouldering the workload of three batches of resident doctors with the current strength of two batches- which has resulted in exhaustion and worsening mental health conditions.The admissions which were meant to commence in February this year will now start sometime in January next year, which means, not a single first-year PG medical student joins the course in 2021.Frustrated with the current state of affairs, resident doctors across several government and corporation run hospitals in the country have started protests and are demanding for admissions to begin at the earliest.While both the central government as well as respective state governments are requesting the Supreme Court of India to speed up the hearing of the ongoing petitions, very little seems to be happening on the ground.23-year-old Dr Ojas Tapse has been waiting for admissions to begin since January this year. “In the peak of the second wave, my batch was still preparing for final year MBBS exams and at the same time, we were also working extra hours in the Covid wards of the respective hospitals we were attached with. To continue our work, we had to seek admissions into a postgraduate course and while at first NEET-PG was delayed by nearly seven months and now delay in admissions is leaving us all frustrated,” said Tapse, one of the thousands of PG medical aspirants in Maharashtra affected by this delay.Dr Shruti Pawar (24) cleared her MBBS in 2020 and used the last one year to complete her rural internship before applying for NEET-PG. “At a time when the country is witnessing the rise of a new Covid variant, the least that needs to be done is strengthening of the health care system and we need all hands-on deck. Yet here we are, waiting for admissions to begin so we can help,” said Pawar. What’s worse is that like several aspiring doctors, Pawar has an education loan to worry about. “Constant delay has left us lagging a year behind in our education and this means I will have to start repaying my loan even before I complete my post-graduation. No one is talking about this,” she added.The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) 2021 exam which should take place in January was postponed to February first, then April this year. It was eventually delayed indefinitely due to increasing cases of Covid-19 registered across the country.The entrance test was finally conducted in September this year, but admissions post the exam has been stayed by the Supreme Court which is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of implementation of EWS and OBC quota in all India quota (AIQ) seats.“Nowhere else in the world has education been affected to this extent where an entire batch of PG medical students was not admitted due to Covid. Instead of focussing on hiring more doctors on board, our system has ensured that no medical student is admitted to the system in 2021,” said another first-year PG medical aspirant, on condition of anonymity.“Currently, a plea has been issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as well as the union health minister has assured that the Prime Minister’s office is looking into this issue, we are hoping for a positive outcome within a week. There are at present nearly 50,000 PG medical aspirants waiting for counselling and considering the rising number of Omicron cases, the authorities should fast-track the Admissions process to avoid burnout among the current batches of PG medical students,” said Dr Pranav Jadhav.Vice-president central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD).Associations of resident doctors across the country have once again threatened to suspend OPD services within a week if the stay on admissions is not vacated soon. “No amount of protests or threats will work until the government and judiciary don’t wake up. Meanwhile, we (first year PG medical aspirants) are hoping to be back in the hospital wards, fighting the fight and hoping for a better future,” said Dr Pawar.

The association fights for the rights of all the women auto drivers across all the cities,” said Santosh Bhagat, president of the association.He added, “There is a dedicated lane for women auto drivers in Panvel. Similarly, there should be one in every city including Kalyan and Dombivli. We have been demanding this for almost a year.”Bhagyashree Dhondiwale, 38, one of the women auto drivers, said, “There is a need to have a dedicated lane for women auto drivers so that we feel safe even working during the late hours. We can use the lane as per our convenience as not all of us are full-time auto drivers.”Outside the Kalyan railway station, there are dedicated lanes for auto drivers where both women and men auto drivers park their auto rickshaw.The Kalyan Regional Transport Authority has introduced a dedicated helpline number –9423448824 – for those who want to raise a complaint against errant auto drivers.
11-12-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar accuses BJP of rewriting textbooks||Mumbai Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for rewriting textbooks to influence students, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar said that the ruling dispensation wanted to replicate the Ram temple agitation at other religious sites.He was speaking at an event where a compilation of his speeches was released. Pawar said that based on the prevailing situation, it seemed that “a systematic, well-planned policy had been drawn up and was being implemented” to change academic texts and influence the thinking of young minds. Calling this a worrying trend, the NCP chief added that this rewriting of textbooks was meant to impress certain ideas on students. He appealed to experts to work on countering this.The NCP chief pointed to how a BJP MP had said in the Rajya Sabha that their work on the Ram temple and Babri Masjid had been completed, and two more things (a possible reference to the disputed sites at Mathura and Kashi) were yet to be achieved.“He said that for these two things, we all have to collectively utilize our strength,” said Pawar, adding that the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992 had led to massive rioting and loss of lives across the country, including in Mumbai. Pawar warned that there were attempts to recreate this situation, and called on people to stay united.“At least a leader of Sharad Pawar’s stature should know that the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) frames textbooks and decides what should go into these books, and what should not. To make such wild allegations against the BJP is childish. It is the people of Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir who will decide if the issue of Kashi and Mathura should be taken up,” said BJP MLA Atul BhatkhalkarMeanwhile, the NCP has planned a virtual meeting on the occasion of Pawar’s 81st birthday on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-accuses-bjp-of-rewriting-textbooks-101639233581971.html

Even as the positive cases reported per month after the second wave was declining, on an average, more than 1,000 cases were being reported each month in Navi Mumbai. The highest was reported in April this year with 26,930 cases.In March 2020, when the pandemic started, the first month had 12 cases and increased to 218 in April and crossed 1,000 in May with 1,973 cases. The highest in 2020 was in August with 10,764 cases. In 2020, the total number of cases reported was 51,002.In 2021, in January, the cases started with 2,007 positive cases and had the highest in April with 26,930 cases that started declining from May, with a total of 5,618 cases.“The higher number of vaccination and also herd immunity played a role in the decline of the cases. Moreover, we have been doing targetted testing to find the maximum number of cases that has helped us in controlling the spread,” a medical officer from Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation said.Till now, 1.09 lakh people in Navi Mumbai have tested positive since March 2020, of which 10,853 were below 18 years and 98,472 above 18. In Navi Mumbai, till now 12.02 lakh people have got their first jab, of which 8.59 lakh have received their second jab as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/for-first-time-since-may-2020-navi-mumbai-covid-cases-drop-below-1000-101639233223991.html
11-12-2021||Pune||Cloudy skies, fog keep mercury down in Pune city||PUNE Pune city has been witnessing cold weather due to drop in day temperature during the first ten days of December. The highest maximum temperature recorded during the day has been 29 degrees Celsius. Weather experts note that cloudy skies and fog have kept the day temperature low bringing chill to the city. As per the climatology of Pune city for December between 1951-1980, the daily maximum mean temperature should be around 29.6 degrees Celsius. However, till Saturday, the daily maximum mean temperature had been just 26.3 degrees Celsius, which was 3.3 degrees cooler. Speaking about the weather, Dr DS Pai, who heads the climate research and services at India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune said that there was cloudy weather during the day as December started. “Due to this, the day temperature has not seen a rise. But the day temperature is around normal. The night temperature is also a few degrees more than normal. But in the next few days, the night temperature is likely to decrease owing to cooler winds from the northwest side of the country,” said Pai. As per the data furnished by IMD, the daily minimum mean temperature for December in Pune is around 12 degrees Celsius. But this year, till December 11, the daily minimum mean temperature has been 16.1 degrees Celsius which was four degrees warmer. Temperature may not decrease further, according to the weather department. Speaking about further drop in temperature, Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department of IMD Pune said that a western disturbance (WD) is likely to affect Himalayas by December 13. “At the same time, strong winds from the Bay of Bengal may penetrate the state from December 12. It is likely to change into southerly winds and the cooler northern winds are likely to interact. From December 14, Konkan and Goa and central Maharashtra may receive isolated very light to light rainfall. From December 14 to December 17, chances of rainfall is likely in Marathwada,” said Kashyapi. He said that between December 12 and December 17, the weather across Pune may remain cloudy and there are chances of light rainfall. But during early morning hours, city may experience haze and visibility issues. “However, due to cloudy conditions, the night temperature is not likely to reduce any further,” said Kashyapi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cloudy-skies-fog-keep-mercury-down-in-pune-city-101639232922145.html

11-12-2021||Mumbai||Omicron scare: 118 international passengers not traceable by Thane civic body||From among the 2004 international passengers who have arrived in Thane, 118 have not been traced till now. Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has shared the list of non-traceable passengers with the State government as it has received the passenger database from airport authorities.While the State’s focus is only on those traveling from countries of concern, TMC has mandatorily tested all international travellers on the seventh day after their arrival to India. According to TMC officials, the list of untraceable passengers exists because the travellers have provided international contact numbers or incomplete addresses. This makes it difficult to know their health conditions.“Many of the contact numbers are either switched off or out of coverage. In some cases, the address only includes Pin Code or name of the ward. None of these are helpful to trace the passengers. Moreover, we receive the list from the airport authority on the third day after these passengers have arrived in the city. This makes it difficult to keep a tab as many would have gone to other states or cities as they have come down only for a particular reason,” said a senior official from TMC.TMC has around 600 passengers who are due to be tested on the seventh day; 245 have tested negative.“We have prepared a list of 2,004 passengers. Among these, around 1,730 are from the countries of concern. Those arriving from at-risk countries are tested at the airport. We get a list of passengers whom we trace and test on the seventh day of their arrival. We also have a team that closely monitors their health up until the 14th day. Till now, all the RT-PCR reports have been negative for Covid,” said Dr Prasad Patil, medical officer, TMC.TMC is conducting an RT-PCR test on all passengers arriving within Thane city. However, as those coming from countries that are not at risk are not tested at the airport, they continue to show reluctance when TMC officials request for a test on the seventh day as they are not even under home quarantine.“We submit a separate list of untraceable passengers and also a regular update on the status of all passengers to the district and State officials,” added Patil.Meanwhile, two international travellers and three close contacts of another international traveller tested positive in Navi Mumbai for Covid out of the total 195 international travellers from high-risk countries tested.According to the protocols, the housing societies where they stay have been completely sealed by the corporation. Meanwhile, three close contacts of a high-risk traveller has also been found positive while the traveller himself was found to be negative.“When any case of high-risk traveller is found positive, we send it to genome sequencing for confirming if it is an Omicron variant. Unless a negative report comes, one should consider it to be a case of Omicron and take necessary precautions. There is no need to spread panic if an international traveller is found positive. Only following all Covid protocols is important. We have increased the vigilance of people gathering without masks and are also keeping a watch over marriage halls. Till now, we have fined a mall as well as a banquet hall of ₹50,000 fine for not following the Covid protocols,” Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.(Inputs by Raina Shine)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-scare-118-international-passengers-not-traceable-by-thane-civic-body-101639231601827.html
11-12-2021||Mumbai||New study gives peak into Vengurla Archipelago’s ecosystem||Mumbai An ongoing study by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) -- funded by the state forest department’s Mangrove Foundation -- has given researchers key insights into the biodiversity of the Vengurla Archipelago in Sindhudurg district, known to harbour the largest congregation of Indian Swiftlets, a protected bird species endemic to India’s Western Ghats and Sri Lanka. Notably, researchers observed that these swiftlets and other birds are key to the survival of various cave-dwelling invertebrates in the area, as their droppings provide energy in the absence of light and vegetation.The Vengurla Archipelago comprises about 20 islets, roughly 10km from the coast, of which three islets are comparatively large, namely New Lighthouse Island, Old Lighthouse Island, and Burnt Island. The birds are found in the four caves between the New Lighthouse and Burnt Island. One of these caves, called Pakoli Ghal on Burnt Island, is where the Indian swiftlet nests and roosts in the thousands. Other species including rock pigeons, tawny pipits, dusky crag-martins and western reef egrets have also been seen here. In 2012, the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) had designated these rocks as an Important Bird Area (IBA), making it one of 467 such sites across the country.The swiftlet is particularly vulnerable as its nests (which are made up of hardened saliva) are used to cook a Chinese delicacy called bird’s nest soup. Vengurla has previously witnessed rampant poaching of swiftlet nests (prior to the species being brought under the purview of the Wildlife Protection Act) and between 2001-02, seven smugglers operating in the area were arrested. “Fortunately, during our study period, we have not found any indication of this activity continuing,” said Dr Shirish Manchi of SACON, who is leading the study and has spent two decades working on the conservation of the Edible Nest-Swiftlet (a related species) in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.In an interim report submitted to the Mangrove Foundation in March this year, and which was shared with Hindustan Times this week, researchers noted that “a detailed study on flora and fauna on these islands has not been done... Most visits by researchers or naturalists to the Vengurla Rocks were for exploring the Avifauna on the islands and in caves.” SACON has attempted to document, for the first time, the various orders of cave-dwelling fauna and their relationship to these birds.“We conducted three repetitive, systematic surveys in the pre-monsoon season (December to February) in Pakoli Ghal on Burnt Island. We documented the presence of invertebrates from eleven different orders; (1) Diptera (flies, mosquitoes), (2) Orthoptera (crickets), (3) Lepidoptera (Moths and butterflies), (4) Araneae (spider), (5) Crustacea (Crabs), (6) Blattodea (Cockroach), (7) Coleoptera (Beetle), (8) Hymenoptera (ants), (9) Microlepidoptera (Micro-moths), (10) Squamata (Gecko) and (11) Scolopendromorpha (Centipedes),” they wrote, adding that work is ongoing to identify these taxa at a species level.“Since March 2021, in the post-monsoon season, we may have encountered even more orders of invertebrates, which will be detailed in a final report early next year. Since the caves are very remote and do not have a lot of light in them, the survival of these invertebrates depends on the birds, who defecate in the caves and provide an important source of energy,” Manchi explained. Guano contains high amounts of nutrients like nitrate and ammonium, and over time accumulates to form a substrate on the rocky surfaces of the cave.For example, during the study, researchers observed that plaster bagworms and beetle larvae feeding on and living in swiftlet droppings. “Indian Swiftlets inside the cave play an essential role in providing shelter and unlimited food supply for various organisms in caves. Hence, the presence of a diversity of species orders is apparent,” the researchers have noted.Rock pigeons, they found, were also bringing in vegetative nest-building material, which falls on the cave floor and is then used as an energy source by the invertebrates. “Further studies will be required to understand the contribution of each bird to the cave ecosystem,” the interim report says.These findings are significant because biospeleology (i.e. a branch of biology dealing with the study of ‘troglofauna’, or cave-dwelling organisms) is in a very nascent stage in India. “With the exception of a few caves of states of Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and the Andaman Islands, we do not have systematic cave faunal studies in the country despite there being a lot of potential for them,” Manchi added.This study will also form the basis for a broader project by SACON – funded by the union environment ministry – on studying the biology, ecology and conversation value of Indian Swiftlets in Maharashtra. Commissioned in January 2020, that study has been delayed on account of the pandemic. “We are also hoping to put together a comprehensive document on cave fauna in the Konkan, from Palghar in the north to Sindhudurg in the south, which has never been done before. But that will have to be done as a separate exercise,” Manchi added.Dr Manas Manjrekar, deputy director (research) at the Mangrove Foundation, explained that the forest department may also consider initiating ecotourism activities in the area. “But before we can take any decision on that, we need to have some basic understanding of how the ecosystem works. The tourism part is secondary as of now,” he said.Bhau Katdare, the founder of NGO Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra, which first detected the poaching of swiftlet nests in Vengurla some 20 years ago, said, “We knew these islands were used as a breeding and nesting area for a number of coastal birds, including swiftlets. There is even a mention in the Maharashtra State Gazzeteer of the official sale of these nests. When we first visited the island in 2000 we saw that there were long ladders and bamboo scaffolds which had been set up specifically for the purpose of obtaining the nests from high areas in the caves, but thanks to ours and the forest department’s efforts this is no longer a practice there and we have seen the swiftlet population double. But as for the caves themselves very little is known about them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-study-gives-peak-into-vengurla-archipelago-s-ecosystem-101639231483215.html
11-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: 26 detained for protesting against WTE plant in Bandhwari landfill||Police detained 26 people from Gurugram Sector 14 on Friday afternoon for protesting against the foundation stone laying ceremony of the waste to energy (WTE) plant in Bandhwari landfill.They were detained nearly one hour before Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was scheduled to lay the foundation stone for the Bandhwari WTE and the new Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) office opposite to Vyapar Sadan at 3pm on Friday.People mostly affiliated with the Aravalli Bachao citizens group, and other Gurugram residents gathered at Sector 14 near Vyapar Sadan around 1.30pm and observed a silent protest by holding posters and banners against the WTE project.Deepak Kumar, 22, who is a resident of Sector 44, allegedly suffered minor injuries after he was “manhandled by police” during the incident. “Around 2pm, a few police officers in a PCR vehicle approached the protesters and asked us to vacate the area. We agreed to this after a brief discussion and were about to leave the site, but... all of a sudden, a team of police officers, including female constables, started detaining the protesters. They dragged us inside a police bus. During a scuffle following this, a few police officers punched me on my face and kicked me on my stomach,” said Deepak.Jyoti Raghavan, a protester, said, “The placement of a WTE plant in the forest land amid a critical water recharging zone for the National Capital Region (NCR) defies all logic. WTE plants have failed across the country, and most of these projects have already closed down. WTE plants only add to the ongoing pollution crisis instead of providing a solution... We were silently protesting against the project but were detained without any reason.”According to the protesters, they were kept at the women’s police station in Palam Vihar under preventive custody for almost three hours, and were released around 5.30pm — only after CM Khattar’s programme was over.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram police, said that 26 protesters were taken to the local police station. “They (the protesters) were taken into preventive custody to maintain law and order situation in the city,” Boken said.Earlier in the day, another group of nearly 30 residents and environmentalists from Gurugram and Faridabad also organised a protest against the WTE project outside the Bandhwari landfill between 11am and 12.30pm. “Our protest was carried out peacefully, in the presence of police personnel. There were no disruptions... It was not affiliated to any political party... We simply raised slogans against the WTE project, demanding the Haryana government to reconsider its move considering the environmental implications arising from it,” said Vaishali Rana, a Gurugram-based environmentalist and a protester.CM Khattar calls it ‘waste to wealth’ approachMeanwhile, Khattar said during his Friday address that “it was an important day for Gurugram and Faridabad”.“The WTE plant is being set up for proper disposal of waste from both the cities — Gurugram and Faridabad. Cleanliness is the ornament of life, and is also necessary for the ease of living. We are moving towards a ‘waste to wealth’ approach with this new technology. Haryana’s first plant WTE project, to generate electricity from waste, has already started in Sonipat, and this new WTE plant in Gurugram will generate around 600,000 units of electricity per day and ensure that the waste in the area is being disposed of properly,” said Khattar. He also talked about further increasing the capacity of the WTE plant.Pataudi Chowk: 3 AAP office bearers detainedOn Friday, three Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) office bearers were also allegedly detained at the Pataudi Chowk police post for more than four hours, according to a release issued by the party.Dr Sarika Verma, one of three detained office bearers, said that “AAP had not planned any protest against the WTE project or came up with any message on disrupting the CM’s programmes on Friday”, but the trio was detained anyway.However, assistant sub-inspector Dhuli Chand, in-charge of Pataudi Chowk police post, said, “We received a tip that the AAP office bearers concerned would swirl black flags at the Bandhwari landfill, and try to disrupt the Haryana CM’s programmes on Friday. So, we called the three AAP office bearers to the police post for holding a discussion on the matter. There was no detainment as such.”
11-12-2021||Kolkata||Ahead of Kolkata civic polls, TMC releases manifesto; BJP takes a swipe at it||With Kolkata, frequently bearing the brunt of cyclones and erratic and extremely heavy spells of rain triggered by climate change and global warming, the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal in its manifesto for the upcoming Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections has promised to revamp the city’s drainage pattern in the next five years to keep the city free from water logging during such situations.The manifesto released on Saturday, just a week ahead of the city’ civic polls scheduled on December 19, promises to come up with a water logging action plan for the city, keep the city’s drains free from any blockage and revamp the city’s network of canals, including the Adi Ganga, for better drainage of storm water. “To combat increased water logging due to change in pattern of rainfall, experts from reputed institutes will be consulted to find sustainable and scientific solutions. Existing pumping stations and sewer lines will be upgraded along with procurement of 200 pumps,” the manifesto said. At least 6,811 people have been killed in India between 2018 and 2021 (till March) due to hydro-meteorological disasters such as heavy rain, lightning, flood and cyclones among others till March this year, and West Bengal with at least 964 such deaths topped the list, revealing the state’s vulnerability to climate change. Fourteen people were killed in West Bengal and Odisha when Cyclone Yaas had hit this year in May, in 2020 Cyclone Amphan had killed 98 people in West Bengal alone. Kolkata was badly hit with large parts of the city inundated and power cuts for several days. “The Adi Ganga Canal will be revamped with regular dredging and prevention of solid waste dumping. Water outlets from the city pockets to the canal for better drainage of storm water would be facilitated,” the manifesto said. With cases of vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue taking its toll on Kolkata and its outskirts, the manifesto promises to set up at least 30 dengue detection centres. The World Health Organization in a bulletin last year had warned that by 2100 it is estimated that average global temperatures will have risen by 1 – 3.5 degrees Celsius, increasing the likelihood of many vector-borne diseases in new areas. Kolkata recorded the highest rise in surface air temperature within the studied cities and regions across the world in 1950-2018, according to latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “Our analysis of IMD data of a century says that the number of depressions intensifying into cyclones has dropped in the Bay of Bengal. But when a cyclone develops its intensity is very high. Similarly, the overall rainfall in the monsoon season has increased but the number of rainy days has dropped resulting in intense spells. The latest IPCC report has already pointed out that Kolkata recorded the highest rise in surface air temperature within the studied cities and regions across the world in 1950-2018. Except for a desert West Bengal has everything from mountains to sea and river floodplains and so it is also vulnerable to the effects of climate change. What aggravates the situation is that while on the one hand alteration of nature is going on in an unbridled way, we also lack mitigation and preparedness,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University in Kolkata. This apart the manifesto named ‘10 Diganta’ (10 horizons) also promises an underground garbage bin container system, annual cultural festivals, beautification of river ghats, toilet for women in every ward and ward-level planning committee among others. The BJP, which released its manifesto earlier this week, took a jibe at the TMC saying that except for making promises the TMC has done little for the city and the state. “The party is in power for 10 years but the civic body has failed. People have seen this and will take an informed decision. The TMC believes in politics of force and the KMC poll is the latest example. The elections were announced when the court was hearing the matter,” said Samik Bhattacharya. Earlier in the day, BJP’s national vice president Dilip Ghosh had attacked the TMC saying that the party was trying to follow in the footsteps of the BJP. “I don’t know what Ghosh and other BJP leaders are saying. It is good that they have come up with a manifesto. But they won’t be able to win a single seat,” said Aroop Biswas, state minister and senior TMC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ahead-of-kolkata-civic-polls-tmc-releases-manifesto-bjp-takes-a-swipe-at-it-101639230941792.html
11-12-2021||Mumbai||EOW books developer for delay in handing over flats||Mumbai The Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police registered a first information report (FIR) against three directors of Nirmal Lyfestyle Ltd. for allegedly delaying possession of ready flats to 54 buyers. The complainants have claimed that the developer took money from them in 2010-11 for purchasing flats in a Mulund (west) project, but the flats have not been delivered yet. The housing-2 unit of EOW has on Tuesday registered the FIR Nirmal Lyfestyle directors Dharmesh Jain, Rajeev Jain, Puja Jain and others. The FIR is based on March 2021 complaint lodged by Umesh Kakule, president of Zircon Flat Owners Welfare Association, on behalf of the buyers, who have booked flats in the 39-storied “Zircon” on LBS Road at Mulund (West). Kakule has booked a 911-square-feet flat in the proposed high-rise in January 2010 and has paid ₹88.89 lakh to the developer between August 2009 and February 2016. When the developer failed to deliver the flat on the promised deadline of June 2013, when they enquired with the developer they were told that the project got delayed for want of commencement certificate and permission from the BMC for revised plans. According to the complainants, the construction work resumed later and till 2019, 45 floors were constructed and though all 301 flats in the high-rise are sold, the developer hasn’t yet secured the occupancy certificate. They said some interior work, electric work and water supply work was still incomplete. The complainant had also moved to MahaRERA against the developer in April 2019. The RERA authority has given the extension for completion of the project, and also directed it to pay a monthly rent to the flat buyers, which the developer eventually paid.

The fine amount of ₹2,000 will be increased to ₹10,000 as per the new order.In 2019, the central government had made several amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, according to which the fines for almost all violations were increased by a significant degree. Governments of various states were to implement these amendments as per their discretion. However, the then Maharashtra government had put the implementation of these amendments on hold.In January this year, the current State Transport Minister, Anil Parab, had said that the amendments would be implemented in Maharashtra soon, and on December 1, the State government had issued an order increasing the fine for drunk driving.After the order was issued, the Thane Traffic Police started the process of integrating the new fine amount in their anti drink-and-drive campaigns.“As we use e-challan machines instead of paper receipt books to issue challans, we need to recalibrate our machines to reflect the new fines. This process is currently under way and is expected to be complete within a few days. By next week, the increased fine of ₹10,000 will be imposed on those who are found driving under the influence of alcohol,” DCP Balasaheb Patil, Thane Traffic Police, said.The Thane Traffic Police will soon be finalising details of this year’s anti drink-and-drive measures, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fine-for-driving-under-influence-of-alcohol-to-go-up-from-rs2-000-to-rs10000-101639227582944.html

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress infighting: Sidhu backs Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Cheema in battle with Rana Gurjit||Amritsar: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday announced support for Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema in his ongoing feud with neighbouring MLA and state technical education and employment generation minister Rana Gurjit Singh. The tussle between the minister and the MLA began when Rana Gurjit’s son Rana Inder Partap Singh began canvassing in Sultanpur Lodhi constituency to stake claim for the Congress ticket. He claims that Cheema is unpopular and there has been corruption in the constituency. Before concluding his speech at the rally organised by Youth Congress leader Satinder Singh Chhajjalwaddi, the son of former three-time Congress MLA Ranjit Singh Chhajjalwaddi, at Rayya in Baba Bakala constituency, Sidhu asked Cheema to come on stage. Then he said, “Many have tried to root out Navtej. I will not let that happen.” Cheema was among the six Congress MLAs who wrote to Sidhu against the induction of Rana Gurjit in the state cabinet in September. Baba Bakala MLA Santokh Singh Bhalaipur stayed away from the rally organised by his rival Chajjalwaddi. Bhalaipur had recently supported then chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in the bitter tussle with Sidhu. Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Dimpa, whose village also falls in this constituency, also extended support to Chajjalwaddi. Punjab Congress working president Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala and Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa were also present.

The special NIA court of additional district and session judge-XV Gurwinder Singh Malhotra has fixed December 17 to pronounce the quantum of sentence. Those who were pronounced guilty were identified as—Arif Hussain, Dilwar Hossain, Adbul Karim, Mustafizur Rahman alias Shaheen (WB), Jahidul Islam alias Kaisar (Bangladesh national), Mohammad Paigambar Sheikh, Ahmad Ali alias Kalu, Nur Alam Nomani and Mohammad Adil Sheikh under Sections 121, 121A, 123 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Explosive Substances Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. According to the special public prosecutor (NIA) Lallan Prasad Sinha, eight of the nine accused had filed a joint petition before the special court on October 22 confessing their crime for hatching conspiracy and executing blast, which was accepted by the court. Mohammad Jahidul Islam has not filed any petition confessing his crime. Sinha told HT that all the accused earlier lodged in West Bengal were produced before the court on October 22 when the special court had issued a production warrant against the accused on September 22, 2021, and asked the competent authority to execute the order. All the accused persons have been chargesheeted for their involvement in the terrorist act of planting three IEDs in and around the Bodh Gaya temple complex on January 19, 2018. The case was initially registered by the Gaya police following information that some suspicious objects were lying near the Kalchakra Maidan, Bodh Gaya under a generator set. The police secured the site and during the search of the whole premises, two more live IEDs were recovered. Later on, the case was taken over by the NIA. Investigation revealed accused Jahidul Islam, with the help of other co-accused, made three IEDs and two hand grenades. The IEDs were planted by Adil Sheikh, Dilwar Hossain and Arif Hussain in the premises of Bodh Gaya temple complex to cause loss to public life and property during the presence of the Dalai Lama and also during the visit of Bihar Governor at Bodh Gaya. All the nine accused were convicted in Burdwan and Banglore blast cases. 
11-12-2021||Mumbai||Can’t compel spouse to continue accord for divorce by mutual consent: HC||Mumbai Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday upheld a 2017 order of the family court at Aurangabad, allowing a Mumbai-based medical practitioner to withdraw his consent for converting his divorce petition into a joint plea for divorce by mutual consent. The estranged husband had agreed to consent terms not just before the counsellor, but also before the family court, but a single-judge bench of Justice Mangesh Patil said that he cannot be compelled to continue his consent and go ahead for divorce by mutual consent if he does not wish to do so even after agreeing with the consent terms. The parties tied the knot in April 2012, but due to matrimonial discord, they started residing separately from March 2013. Three years later, the doctor instituted a divorce petition on the ground of desertion. But, he agreed to convert his petition into a joint plea for divorce by mutual consent, when the spouses were referred to the family court counsellor in June 2017, as part of the procedure followed in divorce proceedings. The couple then finalised terms of settlement and filed and signed consent terms before the counsellor and also admitted signing of consent terms even before the family court. However, later the 44-year-old doctor filed an application before the family court stating that under the consent terms, he had agreed to pay ₹1.11 crore to his estranged wife as permanent alimony and he had paid her an amount of Rs. 25 lakh, but it was difficult for him to pay the balance amount and on that ground sought to withdraw his consent. The family court allowed him to withdraw the consent for mutual divorce, prompting his 36-year-old wife to approach the high court, where she contended that the terms and conditions were settled before the marriage counsellor and duly presented before the Family Court and for all practical purposes the petition thereafter ought to have been proceeded under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act for grant of mutual consent. She also contended that the terms of settlement agreed before the marriage counsellor have sanctity and finality in view of Rule 31 of the Family Courts (Maharashtra) Rules, 1987, which lays down the procedure for grant of divorce by mutual consent when parties settle the matter before a marriage counsellor and requires the family court to grant a decree of divorce in terms of the agreed terms. Justice Mangesh Patil, however, rejected the argument. The single-judge bench noted that the Supreme Court has held that mutual consent is required not only at the time of filing the joint plea, but also on the date on which the family court passes the divorce order. “In view of such emphatic view of the Supreme Court, the respondent (husband) cannot be compelled to go ahead and seek divorce by mutual consent, it does not wish to do so,” said HC and dismissed the woman’s petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cant-compel-spouse-to-continue-accord-for-divorce-by-mutual-consent-hc-101639223801780.html

11-12-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Aiding hotel industry tide over the pandemic||The most affected industry due to the Covid-19 pandemic is undoubtedly the restaurant and hotel industry. As different cities and geographies across the world reopened gradually over the last two years, there are many restaurants and hotels grappling to survive, reduce operational expenses and attract customers. A 27-year-old from Pimpri-Chinchwad, Rahil Shaikh, is helping this industry unlock with technological support through a restaurant management platform, TMBill. This platform is a cloud-based, end-to-end technology solution for restaurants, bars, cafes, Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), ice-cream shops, bakeries and cake shops. In the beginning… A native of Shrirampur in Ahmednagar district, Shaikh completed his Computer Science engineering course from the DY Patil College in 2014. After his degree, Shaikh had offers from multinationals, however, he chose entrepreneurship. Says Shaikh, “I am a farmer’s son and my parents wanted me and my brothers to complete our higher education. My elder brother is a Class 1 officer while another is also a software professional and runs his own institute. My elder brother supported me during my engineering studies. I was passionate about entrepreneurship and fascinated with the start-up world. Hence, I did not take up any job offer and instead chose to start my own website and mobile application development company ‘TechMainstay Software’.” “Without any prior experience, I miserably failed at my attempt and as they say, ‘burned’ through the startup journey of the initial six months. I struggled a lot, but could not get a single client. After going through some good and bad experiences, I managed to get my first client at the end of 2014 and got a cheque of ₹8,000. It was an amazing feeling,” recalls Shaikh. Introspecting another failure In 2015, Shaikh was introduced to the concept of cloud kitchen. Inspired by this model, Shaikh and his team then started their own cloud kitchen operations. “We got a good response and soon expanded to three locations. After this expansion, we realised that we needed software to manage operations efficiently. We were told that a software was available for restaurants and hotels, but it was priced at around Rs90,000. We could not manage the cash flow, inventory, stock, billing and other expenses. Despite being an IT guy, we chose the manual way of operations and as a result we again failed miserably in the cloud kitchen business,” Shaikh said. After running the cloud kitchen for about six months, Shaikh and his team introspected. They found out that they failed due to lack of cost-effective software. “Since we had our software company team in place, we decided to solve this problem. We learnt our lessons the hard way and by that time we had sound knowledge about how the restaurant industry operates and the problems faced by them at every stage. So, we created the architecture and built a foundation for TMBill,” said Shaikh. TMBill – the must have on a restaurant menu? Says Shaikh, “We started working on the idea of a complete ‘Restaurant Operating System’ which would be the ‘mainstay’ for the industry. I had a team of 12 developers in March 2015 and this team further helped me build the TMBill product. TMBill helps all types of food businesses, from a standalone food outlet to a large food chain, manage functions like billing, QR code ordering platform, CRM, customer loyalty, aggregator integration, analytics, inventory, recipe and wastage management, centralised menu management, vendor management and more. It’s a complete solution for a restaurant’s technology, operations and marketing needs, all within an integrated framework.” First customer Sharing his experiences about customer acquisition, Shaikh said, “We got our first customer, The Moctail Den near Bharati Vidyapeeth in 2015. We, made our framework and structure solid, did our test cases and use cases and based on that a prototype was created. Then we entered the market full-fledged. They were experienced in the hotel management domain and we had experience in software. They were our first paying customer and we offered them lifetime use of our software.” “From one customer in June 2015, TMBill went on to onboard 20 paying customers that year. The next year, 2016, TMBill was being used by 120 customers from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad area. Since TMBill gained traction, we continued to focus more on this business segment. Growth was 30 per cent from user perspective. We used to offer our software for as low as Rs2,000 to Rs3,000 then,” recalled Shaikh. Turning a corner Shaikh and his team’s persistence for the next two years – 2017 and 2018 – paid off. In 2019, the start-up got a good user base. “I used to visit each and every restaurant from Nigdi Pradhikaran to Shivajinagar area on my bike. Besides, we posted videos about the software on YouTube and did a lot of social media marketing. We started getting enquiries from customers within and outside India. It was a breakthrough point for us. Since we were bootstrapped, we managed to get only 1,800 customers till 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.” “We turned the corner after the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. With lockdowns in India and other countries, several restaurants, hotels and businesses started looking for technological solutions to sustain during the pandemic. This gave us the much-required boost and we acquired a total of 5,000 customers globally. Of these, 1,300 are from India,” Shaikh explained. Saudi Arabia’s ‘GST’ moment Says Shaikh: “Saudi Arabia had earlier announced that every business will be required to publish a Value Added Tax (VAT) number on every invoice or bill issued by them. Those rules are being implemented from December 4 this year. Publishing VAT number on every bill essentially meant that no business would run without a billing software. This was like the GST-moment there. Sensing this opportunity, our chartered accountant Ganesh Joshi’s brother who stays in Saudi Arabia, offered us a plan. He became our distributor there.” “We have successfully registered a global presence in over 300 cities and 14 countries. We are the first company to provide a complete online cloud POS solution for restaurants on desktop and mobile devices. We now have 1,100 customers in the Gulf countries - Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE; and about 100 customers in European countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Germany. All these customers are premium restaurants in these geographies using our cloud-based software for the last two years,” states Shaikh. “We have an inhouse team of four sales executives. We are planning to expand this team and have 100 sales executives on ground for quicker expansion. This would also improve our profit margins,” stated Shaikh. Future Plans Shaikh claims there was an attempt to acquire his start-up by a Noida-based software company and an early-stage VC firm approached him with funding. “We want to reach a customer base of 10,000 so that our revenues and valuation also increases. We are hopeful that we achieve this target by 2022. We are also launching a feature soon in which a message will be delivered to the customer about how many calories, proteins (ingredients) they have consumed,” he stated. Shaikh is very optimistic about the future. He says, “There are millions of small and big restaurants in India. Only 10 to 20 per cent are ‘organised’ while rest are ‘unorganised’ in terms of government registration. Most of the organised outlets are in metro cities where we have already reached. There are two avenues for future growth. First is the unorganised segment where we can onboard 100,000 to one million restaurants easily and the second segment is the tier 2 and tier 3 cities which are yet to be covered. If we consider this, we have not even captured 1 per cent of the market and this means there is huge potential in the near future.” Proof of the pudding “We have been using TMBill for the last two years, and we are happy with the support and product they offered us. We are better at handling the cash flow, sales and inventory (P&L), reduced workforce by 30 per cent and now we have our own ordering platform instead of relying on some third-party provider,” says Bhushan Mane, owner, Kasturi Mastani House (Kothrud).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-aiding-hotel-industry-tide-over-the-pandemic-101639219963412.html

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress rally: Mansa MLA wants action against cops for lathicharge on protesters||Mansa MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia on Saturday urged chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to initiate action against policemen responsible for beating up unemployed protesters on Friday. Manshahia took to Facebook to express his anguish after videos were shared on social media, showing police personnel in plainclothes leading cops in beating trained teachers at the Congress rally in Mansa. The police personnel in question is stated to be a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) in the CM’s security wing. During the rally, a group of unemployed teachers raised slogans, demanding government jobs. Manshahia, who was also present at the rally, said that the videos were disturbing. “It is an inhuman way adopted by the police officer, who deserves punitive action as he was ruthless. It was painful to watch videos where he was seen attacking protesters in a bus when they were being taken out of the venue by the district police,” he said. During the rally, a group of teachers and a section of Youth Congress activists had jeered in the presence of the CM. While the police personnel did not act against those who hooted continuously against Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who joined the Congress recently, but the protesting teachers faced the heat. After the protests, Channi said his government has no sympathy for those create ruckus. The CM suspended his address for 20 minutes. Several political leaders, including state transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, AICC secretary Harshwardhan Sapkal and Moosewala, were present on the dais but no one responded to the police action on the unemployed teachers. Manshahia justified the CM’s statement on not tolerating protests at public programmes. “Channi is in the CM office for less than three months and he has undertaken several people-oriented steps. He has assured sympathetic redressal of long-pending issues of government employees and unemployed teachers. But it is unfair to create ruckus and the CM should be given time to resolve matters,” said the MLA, who had switched to the Congress after quitting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in April 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-rally-mansa-mla-wants-action-against-cops-for-lathicharge-on-protesters-101639214800719.html

11-12-2021||Patna||Incidents of digital fraud in Bihar panchayat polls raise questions on biometric system||Bihar’s ongoing 11-phase panchayat polls, having introduced a biometric system for voters’ verification at the polling booths, may have curbed bogus voting, but instances of cyber fraud have raised a question mark on the system being foolproof. The State Election Commission (SEC), holding the panchayat polls, has now taken a slew of measures to strengthen the system by putting strict checks on personnel handling the machines and capturing fingerprints of voters in the machines for verification and restricting the use of mobiles at the booths. This comes after reports of fraudsters taking out money from accounts of voters by taking their fingerprints wrongly in other devices emerged. How it happened In Munger district, during the ninth phase of polling on November 29, over a dozen voters were at wit’s end when they found to their dismay that money had been debited from their accounts to the tune of ₹5000-10000 just one hour after they had cast their votes at booth number 145 in village Charaun under Munger Sadar block falling under Muffasil police station. The victims, including some women, immediately rushed to the booths and created a hue and cry. SDM, Sadar, Munger, Khushboo Gupta, after reaching the booth, questioned one Ravi Kumar handling the biometric machines and subsequently, unravelled how he was the one who had secretly taken the fingerprints of the voters on his phone before they had put their fingerprints in the biometric machine to cast their votes. Police investigations found Kumar, now lodged in jail after the arrest, was working in one nearby common service centres (CSC) kiosk that provides various government-related services to villagers including cash transactions of a rural bank, which had its sole branch in the village. People familiar with the matter said Kumar had his login ID through which he had access to the bank accounts of the voters having accounts in the branch. The bank accounts of villagers could be assessed by the agents working at the CSC (also known as cash, sale point) by getting a thumb impression and Aadhaar Card details easily. Fraudulent withdrawal of money is possible as the personnel have access to login IDs and also get OTP (one–time password) on behalf of the account holders, as told by those in the know of the functioning of the CSCs. For the biometric system used in panchayat polls, thousands of agents working at the CSCs across Bihar at the village level had been roped in. “Ravi Kumar had an application loaded on his phone through which he managed to access accounts of the victims through fingerprints taken on his phone and Aadhaar card details. He made a login of the bank from one Guddu in Banka,” said SDM, Munger. “He was taking fingerprints of the voters twice, once for the phone and second for the biometric machine to cast votes,” the SDM added. DSP (headquarter) Munger, Alok Ranjan, who is now the acting SP, Munger, said investigations were still going on. Another case Incidentally, similar complaints of fraudulent withdrawal of money from bank accounts of around 30 persons came to light on the same day (November 29) at booth number 81 and 133 in Baisi block soon after the persons cheated had cast their votes during the ninth phase of polling. All the victims hailed from Surgaon, Kumharwa, Baisi, Mobehaa, Chairaiya and Rehuya panchayat in Baisi block in Purnea district, one of the poverty-stricken districts in the state bordering West Bengal. An inquiry conducted by SP Purnea, Daya Shankar, submitted to DM, Purnea, Rahul Kumar mentions that of the 30 persons who lodged complaints of losing money through fraudulent withdrawals, six did not cast their votes. The report also said that on 29 November, money from the bank accounts of 27 people was fraudulently withdrawn while on November 28 three others were cheated. “It has come to light that around four months back some unidentified persons took fingerprints of villagers in the name of providing loans. A few days ahead of the election, some microfinancing company officials got money transacted on behalf of small account holders by taking fingerprints from the CSP agents,” the report said. According to the police report, one Mohammed Amir alias Khushro had been arrested a few months back on charges of fraudulently withdrawing cash from the accounts of some persons through the biometric system on the complaint in Amour police station dated 8.9.2021. However, police have not made any arrests connected to fraudulent withdrawals of money from bank accounts of 30 persons in Baisi so far. “No arrests have been made so far. Investigations are going on,” said DM, Purnea. Vulnerability of biometric systemThe instances of fraudulent withdrawal of money from bank accounts of voters just after they cast their votes in the panchayat election has raised a few questions about the ‘foolproof’ biometric system to verify voters’ identity. Questions are being raised whether voters’ thumb impression could be misused. Deputy director-general, department of telecom, Government of India, Atul Sinha, feels the biometric system is surely a good method for voters verification as it is linked with Aadhaar but sometimes thumb impression could be misused. “There are certain vulnerabilities as a thumb impression given wrongly or taken wrongly in any other device for ulterior motives could be misused by fraudsters. But, I want to say the biometric system for voters verification, once having recording thumb impression of any person, cannot be manipulated or misused”. State Election Commissioner Dr Deepak Prasad too made a strong argument that the biometric system of voters’ identification used in panchayat polls was foolproof asserting that the case of fraudulent withdrawal of money in Munger did not happen from the voters’ biometric machine. “It’s just an isolated instance in Munger where a person with ulterior motives manipulated the system by using his own device that was detected later. In Purnea, there is still no evidence that the fraudulent cash withdrawals were carried out through any manipulation of our biometric system because some of the fraudulent withdrawals were as big as ₹30000 to ₹40000. The upper limit of withdrawal from CSC points at the villages is only ₹10000,” he said. Digital fraud through the thumb impression of voters in Munger and Purnea has brought the CSC personnel, deployed to handle biometric machines at the booths during panchayat election voting, under the scanner. One, it has exposed how a CSC personnel used a device of his own to secretly take fingerprint impressions of voters having bank accounts and withdraw money. Secondly, it has raised a question as to whether it was right on part of the SEC to hire the CSCs agents (working on commission) to handle biometric machines at the booths. SEC, Dr Prasad, maintained the poll panel decided to hire CSCs personnel for using biometric machines as the work required certain technical know-how. Also, CSCs personnel were working under government bodies as all the CSCs schemes are IT-enabled, e-governance services under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. “In every phase, 12,000 personnel of CSCs were roped in through randomization. But there has been an unfortunate case of cheating by one personnel. So, the percentage of personnel indulging in fraud is negligible and more or less, the system of biometric was not manipulated either. We decided to hire CSCs because they were working in government services. We did not hire any private persons for the work,” he said. Prasad also said the Baisi case of fraud seemingly looks like a handiwork of some local gangs as well some elements who are against the biometric system because it has checked the bogus voting. “I cannot deny the possibility of a conspiracy in the works to defame the biometric system of voters verification because it has brought in transparency in the voting system and also checked bogus voting. On average, 12000 to 15000 persons have been caught trying to put bogus vote during the 10-phase election so far,” he said. The 11 phase panchayat polls will conclude on December 12.Nonetheless, the SEC said the state poll panel had further strengthened the checks in place for personnel handling biometric machines at booths by issuing instructions to DMs that no CSCs personnel would be allowed to take phones and the login ID’s would be kept inactive on the voting day. “We feel such instances would not take place anymore,” Prasad said.

11-12-2021||Delhi||At 8.3 degrees, last night was the coldest yet of this winter in Delhi||At 8.3 degrees Celsius, Delhi on Friday recorded the coldest night yet this winter season, ANI news agency reported citing the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Last night was the coldest in Delhi with the temperature plummeting to 8.3 degrees Celsius. It was the coldest night of this season till now,” an IMD official was quoted as saying by the agency.The maximum temperature on Friday, however, rose to 23.7 degrees Celsius earlier in the day, but it dipped below 10 degrees during the night.With temperatures dipping to 8.3 degrees, the mercury level on Friday was just slightly lower than the night before on Thursday, when the national capital recorded 8.4 degrees Celsius, marking back-to-back cold nights and plummeting temperatures in an entirely chilly week.The situation due to the weather is especially compounded in the national capital by the air pollution crisis. On Saturday morning, the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi slipped to 301 in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR).The PM 10 was recorded at 217 in the ‘moderate’ category and PM 2.5 was recorded at 121 in the ‘very poor’ category at 9:17am, marking the third consecutive day in the national capital when the air quality has remained in the ‘poor’ category.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in October unveiled his 10-point master plan to combat severe air pollution in the winter months, which included announcing alternatives to stubble burning, measures to control road dust and vehicular emissions, and urging governments of neighbouring national capital region (NCR) states to adopt similar steps.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government led by Kejriwal has also formed a 16-member team to evaluate the performance of the Connaught Place smog tower and marked air pollution hot spots through the Green Delhi app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-8-3-degrees-last-night-was-the-coldest-yet-of-this-winter-in-delhi-101639199353864.html
11-12-2021||Noida||This Noida-based mountaineer is training to climb Everest sans oxygen support||“Endless miles of white patches of snow is the most thrilling aspect of climbing mountains,” says mountaineer Arjun Vajpai. On International Mountain Day (December 11), the 28-year-old from Noida tells us about his plans to climb Mt Everest without oxygen, and why it’s integral that he must achieve this. “Climbing without oxygen is a ridiculous task to take up. A lot of people don’t understand what it entails. Climbing an 8,000 meters mountain is risky in itself and climbing without oxygen increases your chance of not coming back home safely. Very few people have been able to make it without oxygen. The cold get colder and there are high chances of frost bites. Blood gets thicker and it gets harder for your heart to push blood. If you get too exposed or push yourself too hard, there is a high chance that you might get frost bitten, might lose toes, fingers… But that’s the tip of the iceberg,” says Vajpai, who attempted to climb Mt Everest without oxygen earlier this year as well. However, he’s better prepared now, and shares: “I see it as an opportunity to discover a newer version of myself. Climbing Everest without oxygen is the holy grail of mountaineering. In its own way, it’s the real test for a mountaineer, to see how far the human body can take. The margin of error is next to nothing. But, I feel I’m ready for it. The challenge is to come back down! You have motivation to reach the top. Without oxygen, I have heard that the real challenge is when you start to come down. So, I am looking forward to it.”An intensive prep is underway for Vajpai as climbing 8,000 meters can be tricky at times. “It’s tough to simulate the same kind of environment and stress which your body will go through when you are climbing any 8,000 meters mountain. It takes all my free time. Sometimes I’m training myself physically through CrossFit physical training. I have a small gym in the house. Lot of high intensive workout happens at home. My training regime has three days of cycling when I am on my bike. My ankles are completely finished as they have had so many tendon tears. I cannot run a lot but I compensate with cycling. I cycle for about 59-60 kilometres from Noida to Greater Noida and back, when I’m in the city. Or I compensate with hikes when I’m in the mountains. I take a backpack which weighs about 15-20 kg and we go on uphill hikes. That’s the prep that happens. Then there is physical prep and mental prep. I have a meditation approach for getting into the zone for climbing,” he adds. Though he might be ready, his parents — Colonel Sanjeev Vajpai, and Priya Vajpai — are still coming to terms with his task ahead. “My family is still very apprehensive. It’s not easy for a parent to let go of their child knowing that there is a high possibility he might not come back home this time. But they have gone a long way. My mom is a tigress with wings of steel and I keep testing her patience,” he says. But to Vajpai, climbing mountains comes naturally now since he scaled Mt Everest in 2010, Mt Lhotse in 2011, Mt Manaslu in 2011, Mt Makalu in 2016, Mt Cho You in 2016, and Mt Kangchenjunga in 2018. “I’ve taken to climbing mountains like fish takes to water. It feels like going home. At times, I feel more anxious in the cities than when I’m up there in the mountains,” he says, adding what’s necessary before he packs bags for any summit is yummy food and a friends’ gettogether! “I’ve a party with friends before I leave, a couple of beers with them and bingeing on a lot of homemade food. I do all that I’m going to miss when I’m up there in the cold, seeking motivation and inspiration,” he concludes.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/this-noida-based-mountaineer-is-trainning-to-climb-everest-sans-oxygen-support-101639201010432.html

11-12-2021||Other||With only 9 days of sitting, Odisha Assembly adjourned amid ruckus||Amid continuing ruckus by the opposition demanding the resignation of minister of state for home and energy Dibya Shankar Mishra, alleging his proximity to the main accused in the case of murder of a woman schoolteacher in Kalahandi district, the winter session of the Odisha Assembly came to an end on Friday, twenty days ahead of its scheduled conclusion.Government chief whip Pramila Mallick moved an adjournment motion in the House seeking an end to the winter session, following which Opposition BJP and Congress members staged a walkout. The House was adjourned sine die by Speaker Surya Patro after passing of the supplementary budget of ₹19,833 crore.Earlier in the day, the Speaker had to adjourn the proceedings of the House twice with opposition BJP and Congress creating ruckus holding placards and beating gongs to demand the resignation of Mishra in Mamita Meher murder case. Meher, 26, was allegedly killed by Gobind Sahu, president of the managing committee of Sunshine English medium school in Mahaling grampanchayat of Kalahandi district on October 8 after she allegedly threatened to expose her extramarital affairs. Though Sahu was arrested, the opposition has been stridently demanding Mishra’s sacking from the Naveen Patnaik ministry alleging his complicity with Sahu.BJD MLAs too resorted to sloganeering in the House over alleged negligence by the Centre over allocation of houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, fuel price hike and inflation.Since December 1 when the winter session began, no significant business has been undertaken in the Assembly amid protests, sloganeering, blocking of the Assembly gate, beating gongs and bells and the sprinkling of gangajal and cow dung-laced water for ‘purification’ of the premises. The House ran for less than two hours during the last 9 days of the session and all-party meetings convened by the Speaker to end the deadlock did not succeed as opposition leaders boycotted it.Deputy Leader of Opposition, Mohan Majhi said the opposition wanted the chief minister to come to the House and not make a statement through video conference.“But his indifference to our demands compelled us to protest in the House to make our voices reach to the CM. He can travel all over Odisha to distribute Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana cards, but cannot attend the Assembly session and take our questions,” Majhi said. “He should have suspended Dibya Shankar Mishra over his involvement in the Mamita Meher murder case. But he did not respond to any of our demands.”Though the Assembly is supposed to sit for 60 days in a calendar year, during the 21-year rule of the BJD, the Assembly has completed the 60-day sitting only three times - during 2006, 2010 and 2012. In the remaining years, it has convened for anything between 41 days and 58 days. This year, the Assembly sat only for 30 days. In 2020, the Odisha Assembly’s winter session was adjourned after sitting for only 10 days.After the first pre-independent assembly was formed on February 3, 1937, the Odisha assembly fulfilled the 60-day-a-year norm only a dozen times - 1952, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1972, 2006, 2010 and 2012. When the first pre-independent assembly was dissolved on September 14, 1945, it had held a total of 188 sitting days.The highest-ever sittings in a calendar year was achieved in 1955 when the Assembly sat for 103 days over two sessions....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-only-9-days-of-sitting-odisha-assembly-adjourned-amid-ruckus-101639199318230.html

"We will contest all seats, why not... We had a detailed discussion over candidates' selection, preparations underway...," the Lok Sabha MP told reporters in Aurangabad.The AIMIM was denied permission to hold a rally at Mumbai's BKC on November 27 in wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent incidents of violence reported in some districts of Maharashtra.In the run-up to the municipal elections, the AIMIM has attacked the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for joining the "communal" Shiv Sena to grab power in Maharashtra.

11-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A living landmark for 40 years||She’s a living landmark of Connaught Place. The colonial-era commercial district has seen rapid transformation in recent decades, and very few institutions have managed to survive.But fruit seller Ms Phoolwati, 60, can seen everyday in the same spot on the KG Marg pavement - and it’s been 40 years. She sits still, with such composure that the mere act of buying an apple or a guava from her might turn out to be soothing or meditative experience.This afternoon, as always, Ms Phoolwati is sitting motionless with her fruit baskets. The cobbler behind her is lying sprawled on his pavement stall, asleep. A pedestrian has paused by her stall while reading a newspaper, as if he has suddenly come across some news of great importance. It is a rare moment on the road in the background - there is almost no traffic. The scene is like a photograph. Moments later, a man appears, trying to leap over the tall metal fence on the divider.Ms Phoolwati is facing a new high-rise whose construction finished during the pandemic. The immediate landscape includes an old tree that fell by the wayside some months ago. So much has changed, she observes. Before the coronavirus reshaped our world, her stall teemed with office-goers. “Since the pandemic [arrived], I only sell half of what I used to sell,” she mutters, agreeing that perhaps many of her previous customers are nowadays working remotely from home.Ms Phoolwati commutes daily from her home in Khichdipur, renting an auto to carry all the fruits. Her day begins at four in the morning, and two hours later, she is at the wholesale Azadpur subzi mandi to buy fresh fruits. She sets up her stall by ten. She returns home 12 hours later.Ms Phoolwati lives with her retired husband. Her two sons reside nearby with their families. “In the morning, my chhoti bahu (younger daughter-in-law) prepares lunch for me. In the evening, my badi bahu (elder daughter-in-law) prepares dinner for me and my husband.”Despite her advanced years, the fruit seller hasn’t considered retiring from work “because it’s important to earn money as long as one can”.In the following ten minutes, no customer arrives. Ms Phoolwati remains still as a statue. And what goes on in her mind during such spare moments? “Kya kahe (what to say),” she says, smiling faintly.She shows her hands. They justify her name. The palms are tattooed with tiny phool, or flowers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-living-landmark-for-40-years-101639182865825.html

A total of 22 cases of snatching and 27 theft cases have been solved with the recovery of the stolen phones and the arrest of the trio by our district’s special staff team,” said deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap.The arrested men were identified as Sidharth Singh,21, from Mumbai, and two residents of Bijnor (UP) Luckman,29, and Salman,25.DCP Kashyap said in the wake of the several snatching, robbery, the special staff team was asked to nab the criminals. The team put the stolen phones on electronic surveillance and found that many of them were active in southern states, and Maharashtra. It was learnt that a gang active in Mumbai and Delhi was disposing off stolen phones in far flung areas of these states. The gang is led by Sidhesh and his close aide, Sidharth Singh, who was living in Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar.“Our team caught Singh on December 7 from Shakarpur while he was leaving for Mumbai with 58 stolen phones. He disclosed that the phones were procured from Salman and Lukman, who lived in Chand Bagh area in northeast Delhi.

11-12-2021||Delhi||MCD staff warn of strike as talks with north corp over salaries end in deadlock||The final round of talks between an umbrella body of civic employees and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation over the non-payment of salaries for three months ended in gridlock on Friday evening. The union said thousands of municipal employees will begin an indefinite strike at the Civic Centre from Monday, demanding their salaries.The North corporation, meanwhile, has called for a meeting to be convened under mayor Raja Iqbal Singh.AP Khan, the convener of the Confederation of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Employees’ Union (CMCDEU), said North MCD officials could not provide a blueprint to regularise due payments.“The mayor and others kept making false promises throughout the meeting. They didn’t pay any attention to our pleas that the other two corporations [the south and east bodies], have already issued a circular enhancing the dearness allowances for their employees and pensioners as per orders issued by the Centre. The talks failed as they were not ready to make any promises in writing regarding pending bonuses, house rent allowance and children education allowances,” he said.North Delhi mayor Singh, however, said that all attempts are being made to make regular salary payment to its employees.“The staff members are justified in asking for their dues, and efforts were being made to pay their salaries soon. Since we are fund-starved, we have no option other than to give assurances to our employees,” he said.Chhail Bihari Goswami, leader of the North MCD house also said that the body is trying to get funds from all disbursing agencies.Meanwhile, the finance ministry called on senior north MCD officials to discuss the feasibility of transferring some of the civic body’s properties to the income tax department in a bid to ease its financial distress.“The proposal has been okayed verbally and we are expecting its written approval soon,” a North MCD official present in the meeting with the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcd-staff-warn-of-strike-as-talks-with-north-corp-over-salaries-end-in-deadlock-101639175151879.html
11-12-2021||Delhi||AQI in Delhi back to very poor as winds get slower||Pollution levels in Delhi got worse on Friday as winds got slower, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD), even as the weather office predicted improved air quality over the weekend.Temperatures increased marginally on the day and officials said they expect the mercury to remain stable till Monday.Recordings from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) at 4pm on Friday was 314 (very poor), worse than 289 (poor) a day earlier.“The winds were relatively slower on Thursday, because of which there was some accumulation of pollutants in Delhi. But the winds picked up from Friday afternoon, the impact of which will be visible from Friday evening. There will be a marginal improvement in air quality on Saturday, and the AQI will remain in the poor range till November 13,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research centre.He said that winds will be strong enough to clear up pollutants till November 13, but added that the weather office expected the AQI to worsen into the ‘very poor’ zone again on November 14 and November 15, on the back of a fall in the temperature and wind speeds.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.“Low temperatures impact the mixing height of the atmosphere and force pollution particles to stay close to the surface,” explained Soni.The air quality forecast issued by the Union ministry of earth sciences’ early warning system said the winds on Saturday are likely to get faster and reach 8-10kmph.Meanwhile, the minimum temperature at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, was 9°C, up from 8.4°C on Wednesday. The maximum temperature was 23.7°C, a notch below normal.“Temperatures are likely to remain in the 7-8°C range for the next two days. Cold winds from the freshly snowed states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand will blow into Delhi and keep the temperatures lower compared to what it was in the first week of December,” said a senior Met official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aqi-in-delhi-back-to-very-poor-as-winds-get-slower-101639174536032.html
11-12-2021||Delhi||Schools stay shut, but pollution panel may rethink building ban||Schools and educational institutions in Delhi-NCR continue to remain shut as the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) is still to review its closure order issued earlier this month. The ban on construction activity, however, is set to be revisited with the Supreme Court on Friday permitting CAQM to consider requests for relaxing the construction ban in the wake of improvement in air quality.Taking up a public interest litigation (PIL) on air quality measures in the Capital, a bench, headed by chief justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, eased its November 24 order that revived the ban on construction activities. It asked the commission to examine the pleas made by various builders and their representative bodies for resuming their work.“We are all in Delhi. We know the condition. It has just started improving. They (CAQM) can relax the conditions slowly,” observed the bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant.The court was dealing with a bunch of applications pleading for a relaxation on the construction ban, but it declined to entertain the individual applications.“All the governments -- Centre or states, should have taken strict steps before our shouting. We never had to pass these orders. Now, if we are going to be involved in each and everything, this will never end,” remarked the bench, holding that all applications will be examined by CAQM.“We expect that the commission will look into these issues within a week,” added the court, as a clutch of senior lawyers appearing for builders and their representative bodies such as Developers and Builders Forum pressed for an expeditious review by the Commission. The court further said that CAQM may hear some of them before passing final orders, if required.The court, which had on December 3 lamented that it was sought to be portrayed as a “villain” for trying to get schools shut although it did not pass any such order, did not seek any update on reopening of schools in Delhi-NCR during the Friday hearing, nor did CAQM made any submission on this aspect.Schools in Delhi have been shut four separate times since March last year – twice owing to concerns over Covid-19, and twice in less than three weeks because of the pollution. Experts have, however, repeatedly pointed that the pollution levels are as bad indoors as they are outside, if not worse. Further, they have also flagged concerns over the mental health impact and learning gaps that the repeated interruptions have caused.The affidavit filed in the top court by CAQM cited orders issued on December 8 and 9 related to running of industrial units but it remained silent on reopening of schools even as some experts underscore concerns over learning loss due to prolonged school closure while not preventing the air crisis that young people face.“There is no fresh order by the Commission after its December 2 order which directed that all schools, colleges and educational institutions in NCR shall remain closed, allowing only online mode of education, except for the purposes of conducting examinations or practical. This technically means that there is no change in the closure order and the December 2 direction is very much in force till it is reviewed in future,” said an official, associated with the CAQM, who did not wish to be named.Air pollution levels in the national capital have improved marginally over the past week, owing primarily to stronger winds, after spiking severely earlier this month. The air quality index (AQI) improved to the ‘poor’ zone, and falling to its lowest since October 27 this year.Pollution levels did, however, worsen to the ‘very poor’ zone on December 10.After the Delhi government on December 2 closed all schools in the city due to high pollution levels, CAQM, by its order passed the same day, expanded the closure order to all of NCR. These orders came within hours of the top court pulling up the Delhi government for reopening schools on November 29, asking if it was prudent to expose young children to bad air and toxic smog while adults were still working from home.“Children have to go to schools at 6-7 in the morning in this bad weather...You have implemented work for home for the employees. So, parents work from home and children have to go to schools. What’s this?” it asked.But on December 3, the bench stressed that it did not give any direction to the effect, nor did it suggest that the Delhi government must shut schools; all it did on December 2 was to ask the Delhi government for reasons behind reopening them even as pollution levels were high.Meanwhile, CAQM’s affidavit further informed the court that the expert group set up by the Commission is in the process of finalising an air quality forecast model in terms of the air quality index, using WRF-Chem Forecasting model. WRF-Chem is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry.“The model is envisaged to provide a 7-day forecast and outlook for subsequent 3 days (i.e., total 10-days) based on predominant surface wind direction, wind speed, mixing layer height, ventilation index etc. The system would also be able to predict 7-day air mass inflow and outflow of Delhi which would in turn help in planning suitable actions that can be taken in advance to curtail any adverse air quality scenario,” stated the affidavit.It added that a new statistical model trained on past air quality and meteorological data is also under development by the expert committee for forecasting the air quality for next few days, besides reviewing the various measures that have been proposed under the graded response action plan (Grap).On November 24, the apex court said that controlling pollution in the national capital should not be left to “an act of God”, directing the Union government to instead devise a scientific model, based on seasons and wind conditions, for taking all remedial and urgent steps in anticipation of the air quality.“There has to be a statistical model for Delhi. This is the national capital. Imagine the kind of signals we are sending to the world. You have to have a system in anticipation of how the weather is going to be. Ad hoc measures will not be good enough,” said the bench, prompting CAQM to constitute the expert committee to comply with the court orders.CAQM’s latest affidavit has also given details of coercive measures taken by its enforcement task force and the flying squads. Between December 4 and 7, a total of 1,534 sites were inspected by the flying squads and a total of 228 sites were issued notices of closure, the affidavit said.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, said the continued closure of schools due to the pollution was hampering the welfare of children.“School plays a key role in the growth and development of children, particularly younger children. Interaction of children with other children is also significant for the overall development of a child. When air pollution is an annual feature, we should direct efforts towards combating it instead of closing down schools. Closure of schools is not a solution to the pollution problem,” he said.

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: GLADA’s demolition drive faces opposition from property dealers||A group of property dealers and residents on Friday strongly opposed a demolition drive set to be carried out by the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA).The team, led by Khushpreet Singh, GLADA officer, had visited Durga Enclave, Phase 1, near Chuharpur Road, Haibowal, to carry out a demolition drive of unapproved and unauthorised colonies, which were built after 2018.“We are in process of lodging a formal police complaint in this regard. They have no documents to show. They admit that the colonies are illegal and established after 2018 without approval. Now when the authorities were about to carry out the demolition work, they blocked the way and protested against the team due to which we had to return,” Singh said.The property dealers and residents blocked the road leading to the unauthorised colonies, not allowing authorities to carry out the demolition. The realtors and residents refused to move despite police intervention. Mandeep Singh Mani, president of the Property Dealer Association, reasoned by saying that the government was in the process of formulating a policy to approve the unauthorised colonies. Mani revealed that he, along with other property dealers, had been trying to regularise the colonies, which he admitted to have been developed after 2018, but had been facing problems with the pandemic-induced slowdown in government departments.He rued the losses suffered during the pandemic, before adding that the GLADA team decided to demolish the colonies just as the market had begun to pick up pace. Pointing out the government assurance on a one-time settlement that would regularise the buildings, he said, “We were assured that a decision in this regard will be taken during the cabinet meeting.”“Earlier too the authorities have demolished two of our colonies and today they wanted to demolish the colonies at Durga enclave. We had no option but to oppose,” Mani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianagladas-demolition-drive-faces-opposition-from-property-dealers-101639170469831.html

Led by Lakhwinder Singh Dhillon, union leader, protesters raised slogans against Channi and removed his stickers from their auto-rickshaws. They complained that no notification has been issued by the government regarding the promised waiver. Dhillon revealed that the CM had personally visited the union office at Gill Road, along with Punjab Pradesh Congress chief Navjot Singh Sindhu, on November 22, and had announced that the challan fee of all auto-rickshaws will be waived. Channi, according to the union chief, had also promised the release of impounded vehicles. “A photo-op exercise was staged and nine challans of auto rickshaw drivers were waived. But when we reached the regional transport office in the mini-secretariat, we were told that no notification to waive the challan fee has been issued by the government and officials refused to remit the challan fees. This is fleecing. Now whose word should we trust. While CM assures that our challan fee has been remitted but on the ground level things have not changed,” he said.Dhillon further revealed that officials of the transport department had sought a day’s time to resolve the matter. “We are issuing an ultimatum. If our grievances will not be redressed by tomorrow, we will stage protests and choke the roads and highways of Ludhiana district,” he later said.Meanwhile, Gurdeep Singh Gosha, president of the Youth Akali Dal (YAD), also joinedthe protesting auto rickshaw drivers. “For petty politics CM Channi has played with the sentiments of the needy. For mere few votes, he has lied to the poor auto drivers. It is unbecoming for a man who holds the chair of the CM. Either he is lying or the officials at the transport department are lying,” he said. The police, led by ACP Dharmapal, were deployed to tackle the hour-long protest. The protesters eventually returned home, but not without issuing an ultimatum of intensifying the demonstrations if the matter is not resolved by December 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/irked-by-cm-s-false-promises-auto-unions-step-out-to-protest-101639170459665.html

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Cong finetunes Malwa strategy with Moosewala’s induction||Chandigarh : When controversial Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala joined the ruling Congress last week, the party laid out the red carpet for him. The 28-year-old singer, whose real name is Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, was inducted in the presence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary and several other party leaders in Chandigarh in the full glare of publicity. Both Channi and Sidhu sang paeans to the “Youth Icon” with the former calling it a “revolutionary day in state politics.” He accompanied three of them to Delhi and met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi the same evening. Big hit among youth Being touted as a “prized catch” by the Congress ahead of the state polls, Moosewala is a big hit among the youth and his fan following of nearly 10 million subscribers on YouTube and 7 million followers on Instagram is matched by very few singers. The party plans to make full use of his popularity and ability to pull in the crowds to connect with the youth in the Malwa region, according to party leaders familiar with the development. Accused of promoting violence through his songs However, his grand entry has surprised and shocked many, including some in the ruling party. The reason: he comes with baggage – a history of violent songs that allegedly promote gun culture and radicals. Last year, the rapper was booked for promoting violence and guns through his song “Sanju”. He was earlier booked under various provisions of the Arms Act and the Disaster Management Act in Barnala after his photographs of firing an AK-47 rifle at a firing range during the Covid lockdown surfaced on social media. In one of the songs last year, the singer also hailed militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale triggering a controversy. The opposition parties and experts have been quick to lash out at the Congress for the induction with BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh dubbing the Congress support to “such criminal elements” as a warning bell for the state. Guru Nanak Dev University’s former head of political science department Professor Jagrup Singh Sekhon says this exposes their (Congress’) lack of commitment to ideology and their internal contradictions. “They (Congress) just want to win the elections. Moosewala may pull in crowds and help them get some votes, but what about the ideology of the party and its leaders. They talk about a cultural commission to curb the glorification of arms in Punjabi songs, but then take someone indulging in the same. This is the crisis in politics,” he says, questioning BJP MP and actor Sunny Deol’s contribution in the same vein. Resentment in section of Cong Also, the joining of Moosewala has led to resentment among a section of the leaders in Mansa district which was visible at the Congress rally in the area on Friday – the first party event attended by the singer, when a group of party workers protested against him in the chief minister’s presence. But the Congress sees Moosewala as worth the risk, and critical to its electoral plans in Mansa, to which the singer belongs, and the adjoining districts of Barnala, Sangrur and Bathinda, to counter the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) whose state chief, comedian-turned-political Bhagwant Mann, is also a huge draw. Though the Congress had won a two-thirds majority in the 2017 state polls, its performance in Mansa and Barnala, where it drew a blank, was nothing to write home about. The party also faced stiff competition from the AAP in Bathinda and Sangrur districts. “Moosewala is hugely popular among the youth who admire him. In his songs, he talks about correcting the system. It is gain for the party,” says Surinder Dalla, media adviser to Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, fobbing off the criticism. May be fielded from Mansa The singer’s accessibility to his fans and the support he gave to farmers during their protest at Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws are also being cited as pluses for him. There is already talk in Congress circles that he may be fielded from Mansa – a seat that the party has won only once in the past five elections. “We have nothing to lose. Sitting MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia has already joined the Congress from the AAP and Moosewala’s entry will also give a boost to our prospects, irrespective of who gets the ticket,” argues another Congress leader. While the rapper surely has the pull to draw crowds at rallies, no one seems sure if it will translate into anything substantive on the ground. Before him, several other Punjabi singers, stage performers and celebrities – Bhagwant Mann, Hans Raj Hans, Mohammad Sadique, Jassi Jasraj and Gurpreet Ghuggi, to name a few – have taken the political plunge but only a few have got success. Celebrities who took political plunge Mann is a two-time MP from Sangrur and the most popular state leader of the AAP in Punjab, whereas Sadique became a legislator from Bhadaur in his electoral outing in 2012 and then got elected to Lok Sabha from the Faridkot reserved constituency in 2019. Hans, who comes from the Valmiki community, joined the SAD and contested the Lok Sabha election from Jalandhar in 2009, but lost. When he was denied the ticket in 2014, the singer-politician joined the Congress. Hans got his first taste of electoral success with the BJP – the party he joined five years ago, which fielded him from the North West Delhi Lok Sabha seat in 2019. Ghuggi and Jasraj, on the other hand, had short and unsuccessful stints. Only time would tell what course Moosewala’s political career charts in Punjab politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cong-finetunes-malwa-strategy-with-moosewala-s-induction-101639168827639.html

One of his employees left with his lunch bag from the car’s back seat, while he was carrying a bag containing ₹9.5 lakh and two mobile phones.As he proceeded to step inside the factory gate, someone hit him in the neck with a blunt weapon, causing him to fall on the floor. Meanwhile, another man snatched his bag containing the cash and mobile phones, and fled.He immediately informed the police about the incident. Driver’s role under scannerOn reaching the spot and examining the CCTV footage, the role of the victim’s driver came under scanner, as he did not react to the crime at all.As his employer was attacked and injured, he never alighted from the car or try to chase the robbers. He is being questioned.Money was meant for employees’ salariesThapar said he had withdrawn the cash from his bank on Thursday to pay his employees’ salaries, which were handed out on 10th and 25th of every month. Therefore, he brought the large sum of money to the factory on Friday morning.Investigators said it appeared that the robbers had been following the factory owner, aware of the money’s presence in the car, and attacked him as soon he stepped out of the vehicle to enter the factory. The robbers arrived on two motorcycles – a Honda Splendor and Bajaj Pulsar. One of them kept his bike running, while two others attacked Thapar. Meanwhile, their three accomplices also turned up on another bike, and all of them sped away within 15 seconds after executing the crime.

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||HT Readers’ take: Make fitness your new mantra||Yoga and meditation sessions Lifestyle diseases have become a major contributor in rise of lifestyle diseases. All of us should help in reducing the frequency of such diseases in City Beautiful. Authorities must organise yoga and meditation sessions in the lungs of the city- the neighbourhood parks and gardens. Moreover, each of us should turn towards healthy food and shun all junk food. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhHealthy lifestyle necessary in times of pandemicPeople must adopt an active lifestyle to stay fit. It’s not necessary to go strenuous exercise regimes, just 45 minutes of light exercise a day and healthy food can help keep the doctor away. Just one person resolving to get fit and healthy, can change the lifestyle of the whole family. We need to turn the lens on fitness, especially in these trying times of the pandemic. Shubham Dhiman, via emailJunk food a major concernResidents of the tricity are more health conscious than those in other cities. Luckily for them, they also have a range of facilities, including parks, green belts, gyms etc at walking distance from their homes. The only problem here is the consumption of junk food and inactive lifestyle, especially among children who spend long hours in front of mobile and computer screens. Schools could go a long way in enforcing healthy lifestyle values among children.DS Banati, Mohali Regular check-ups mustSadly, despite living in city with a luxurious lifestyle, people here are losing out on the health quotient. People need to adopt healthier habits, such as going for exercise and morning walks. They must also avoid fast food and carbonated drinks. Regular check-ups can help detect any underlying issues at an early stage. People should start by preparing a time-table for sleep, exercise and meals. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliMake simple changes Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and hypertension can be prevented or at least controlled by following some simple measures, such as regular workout, brisk walking, cycling, and shunning fast food. People can make simple switches in the lifestyle, such as using cycles instead of cars for commute. Using the stairs instead of the lift and playing in the park instead of on computers.Som Gupta, PinjoreAwareness campaigns can helpHectic lifestyles have increased the prevalence of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity among residents, which is especially worrying in times of the pandemic. The need of the hour is to start public awareness campaigns and encourage people of all age groups to take up physical activities, such as morning & evening walks, exercise, yoga, & meditation. Rather, it should be made compulsory for all age groups. Further, there is need to control consumption of fast food.Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliCatch them youngCity beautiful is blessed with green belts and large areas under forest cover, but ironically, many among us are unmoved by this ‘privilege’ and ‘pleasure’. Schools and colleges should have health and fitness programmes so that students can be taught the importance of a healthy lifestyle at a young age. Parents must also discourage children from excessive use of mobile phones for gaming and entertainment. Instead, they should be encouraged to take up cycling, swimming and other such activities. Shammi Bhatia, via emailCommunity health initiativesEducational institutes, local authorities and residents’ welfare associations must work together and get people to adopt an active lifestyle by organising sports events every weekend. This will not only encourage people to take up physical activities but also habour community bonding. Apart from this, dietitians should visit localities to guide residents about healthy eating.Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliPlanned city, sedentary lifestyleWell-planned cities like Chandigarh which have markets, schools etc in each sector contributes to lesser physical activity. Poor public transport also leads to people sticking to personal vehicles, such as cars and two-wheelers. This means the chances of them walking or cycling to their destination, is much lower. Most adults in the city rarely use bicycles, and don’t encourage their children to do so either. Home-delivery services also make it possible for residents to get on with life without stepping out of their homes. Administration needs to organise events such as marathons etc to get residents to stay active.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliPersonal choice, but community initiatives A healthy lifestyle is a personal choice. But authorities can encourage that among the masses by organising awareness programmes, community health events etc. Steps such as increasing the tax on junk food items can also help discourage its consumption to some extent. Ensuring there are parks and gyms at all walking distance from residential areas can also help people stay motivated to stick to their fitness regimes. Programmes and advertisements on lifestyle diseases and how to prevent them can also make people adopt healthier habits. Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurJunk food, alcohol and smoking poison for the bodyHealth experts say that sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet are responsible for many diseases. With availability of gadgets, physical activity has substantially decreased. Ready-to-cook junk food seems to satisfy the palate but is harmful for our health. Late-night dinners, alcohol, smoking are the worst enemies of the heart and lungs. As far as possible, one must stick to home-cooked, healthy food and also take up as much physical activity as possible. Usha Verma, ChandigarhYoga, the time-tested solutionA large number of lifestyle diseases can be prevented by making yoga the way of life. Spend just a few minutes of your morning practicing this age-old technique and you can be assured of a healthy life. Consuming neem and tulsi will also help keep the diseases at bay. Strong immunity is a must in these times of Covid-19. Harnam Singh, MohaliZero physical activityTechnology has no doubt enhanced our productivity, ability and efficiency but at the same time, it has also led to a sedentary lifestyle. With the pandemic lockdowns, taking much of our work, education and even entertainment online, the chances of physical activity has reduced even more. Residents of Chandigarh don’t even take part in simple household chores such as cooking or cleaning, and have domestic helps to care of it. A major chunk doesn’t even go for walks or mild exercise. Yasmin D Khosla, PanchkulaParents, set a good example for kidsUnhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise and little physical activity poses a public health hazard. Administration must step in by developing parks, gardens and gyms for the public. Institutions like schools, colleges and universities must motivate children on healthy habits and compulsory physical activity must be a part of the curriculum. Parents must also follow healthy habits to set an example for new generations. Healthy youth will lead to a healthy future of the nation.Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaGovts need to be the driving forceWhile results of the national family health survey are mixed, there have been radical improvements in maternal and child health, sex ratio and population control. Other areas, such as childhood nutrition where marginal gains are deemed insufficient, and require renewed corrective efforts. Rising figures of anaemic women and children since 2015-16 points to the need for improving the food security and nutrition supplementation schemes. The broader message is that resources that the state and society need for healthier lives will only come if governments deliver consistent and high economic growth. Sanjay Chopra, MohaliPrevention is better than cureThe rate of incidence of cancer in the city is alarming. Sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits and alcoholism are behind most diseases. Besides, with temperatures dipping, people will bring down physical activity. It is paramount that people take preventive measures and improve their lifestyle before it is too late. SK Khosla, ChandigarhMake use of your neighbourhood parkChandigarh is famous for its parks and green spaces. But sadly, over the last decade, its use has come down drastically. Now, instead of parks, people go to gyms for strenuous physical fitness regimes. People also use to take pride in bringing home-cooked food. Now, they are opting for junk food packed in plastic. We need to bring back the habits of the years gone by, so as to preserve our health as much as we can. The administration can also do its bit by encouraging cycling etc, by way of introducing more cycle tracks.Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhLimit screen timeFirst and foremost, limit your screen time and time spent on social media. Instead, make time for a walk in the nature, bird watching, dance, light exercise and other such activities that will bring down your stress levels and also improve your physical health. Secondly, families must resolve to restrict the consumption of junk food. Improve your sleep and meal schedule, and during work, take at least 10 minutes off to walk around. A hectic lifestyle that leaves no time for your health and family is of no use. Nishu Aggarwal, PanchkulaWalk, practice yogaLifestyle diseases such as obesity are more pronounced in affluent families because they lead a sedentary life, which makes them quite lethargic. Regular walks and yoga can help bring down diseases such as hypertension. Shed lethargy and keep away from junk food, and good health will knock on your doors. SC Luthra, ChandigarhA generation at riskHealth is not gained in a day. People in general should improve their lifestyle by following healthy eating habits. Incorrect and wrong eating timings, job stress, little physical exercise, lack of awareness about healthy habits is making our generations unhealthy. Administration can facilitate by providing parks, gyms and other facilities but it is our prime responsibility to follow and improve our lifestyles by following healthy habits. Anju Mohan, PanchkulaAct before the situation gets out of handDiseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, joint paints, vision problems and teeth decay, are rising among today’s population due to poor lifestyle habits. The UT as well as the states of Punjab and Haryana need to improve their public health policies, and work to bring down the incidence of lifestyle diseases. Preventive measures and awareness are the only way to control the problem before it gets out of hand. P Mehta, via emailHealth is wealthChandigarh suffers from high incidence of lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes, heart-attack and hypertension. The government must take serious note of this. Lack of awareness, unhealthy eating habits, zero or little exercise are the main reason behind this. Awareness about achieving fitness through cycling, brisk walking, avoiding junk food, consuming healthy food should be spread among the masses. Subhash Chugh, via emailMake use of mass media to promote fitnessPeople should start educating their kids about staying away from junk food to prevent obesity and diabetes in the long run. To encourage physical activities among residents, the authorities must organise workshops and events such as marathons from time to time. We are lucky to have open-air gyms in our neighborhood parks, but sadly these have not been put to use due to the pandemic. Each sector must hire trainers to give fitness tips to the residents. Mass media such as FM Radio etc can also play a huge role in encouraging fitness. Vikas, via emailForced to stay indoorsMany non communicable diseases are on account of lifestyle and occupational habits. The pandemic has also contributed to a large extent in the rise of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension etc. People were forced to stay indoors and there was no scope of any outdoor activities. Children were the most affected due to the closure of the schools. The screen time has also led to sleep and mental disorders. It is high time that we realise the importance of our health. We have to stop eating junk food and move towards more nutritious and healthy food. Daily walk, exercise, meditation and yoga can lead to better health. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhEmployers, it’s your responsibility tooLong working hours are also one of the contributors to lifestyle diseases. Employers must encourage their staff to have 30 minutes of yoga/ exercise break in between the shift. And parents, must make sure that their children limit the screen time and junk food consumption.Chander Vij, via emailPolitical will for public health initiativesLow political will, institution corruption and resource mismanagement also contribute to poor implementation of public health programmes. Public health promotion can be seen as the whole process of enabling or empowering people to increase control over and improve their overall health. It focuses on creating awareness of health issues, engendering behavior modification. To promote good health (physical, mental and social well-being), authorities must do whatever it takes to help people work towards better health. Social media platforms like WhatsApp and blogs can be very potent in this regardVineet Gandhi, ChandigarhReader of the week Success stories of others can help stay motivatedWe can’t force someone to leave their comfort zone, but success stories of those who have been able to turnaround their lifestyle for good can motivate others to adopt healthier habits. As a community, marathons, health camps etc can help us stay motivated towards our fitness goals. But it is upon the individual to work towards a healthy lifestyle. Kiran Bala, MohaliWhat experts sayLifestyle changesOne should avoid trans fats and eat dinner on time. Also, non-diabetic people can fast frequently. Besides this, it is important to do physical activities to lifestyle diseases.Dr Sanjay Bhadada, HOD, endocrinology, PGIMERHealthy eatingPeople should avoid junk and processed food and have more of green veggies, fresh fruits, calcium and fiber-rich food. Eat small portions at regular intervals and exercise at least five time a week for 45 mins. Dr KP Singh, director, endocrinology dept, Fortis Hospital, Mohali Reduce stressTo control lifestyle diseases, people will have to increase physical activities and start using facilities, such as cycling tracks and parks, available in the city. People must also try to reduce stress by doing relaxing activities like yoga. Also, say no to fast food and trans fats.Dr Harinder Bali, cardiologistYoga and exerciseAdopting exercise and yoga early in life can potentially alleviate the prevalence of preventable diseases such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression and anxiety.Prof Akshay Anand, in-charge CCRYN centre for mind, body interventions by yoga, PGIMER Get activeI think people have become very lazy nowadays. They think by just consulting dieticians they can attain fitness.

The school remembered Rawat as it’s one of the most brilliant students. The school organised special prayers meeting which was attended by students, teachers and old students of the school. School principal Anil Wilson Sequeira reminisced Gen Rawat’s promise to be the chief guest at the school annual function. He studied in Edward’s from 1971 to 1973 when his father was posted in Shimla. Gen Rawat had visited his alma mater in 2019 along with his wife Madhulika Rawat. He motivated students to join the Army. Principal of St Edward’s Anil Wilson Sequeira while addressing the prayer meeting said the school had planned interaction with General Rawat on March 9, 2022, which is the founder’s day of the school. “This void will never be filled and the school will miss the motivation of General Rawat. We will miss him forever,” he said. “During his visit in 2019, he visited here and without any care for protocol, he went to the canteen and met the support staff that shows how down-to-earth he was. I will remember this incident of humility forever,” Sequeira said General Rawat had planned a get-together with his old batch mates, but he could not turn up for the event due to some professional reasons. “All students of the 1973 batch had planned a get together to relive their old days that they spent together in British-era schools,” said Brij Mohan Chauhan, Rawat’s school friend and a childhood friend. He recalls him as a simple and brilliant student. Raja Bhasin, a historian who accompanied Gen Rawat for a ‘heritage walk’ in Shimla, remembers him as somebody who had an interest in knowing the history of Shimla and its heritage building. “General Rawat, his wife Madhulika and I walked across the town for two hours in 2019. He was a down-to-earth person. He was curious to know everything about Shimla,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-gen-bipin-rawat-s-alma-mater-st-edward-s-school-pays-glowing-tributes-to-him-101639168110482.html

In total, 20 constituencies where polling for byelection was held lost in 12 assembly segments.“The public has rejected this government. Even it was routed in the Mandi parliamentary constituency, the home-turf of the chief minister,” he said.“It would have been better if the CM along with his cabinet colleagues had resigned and paved the way for elections in Himachal Pradesh,” he added.Agnihotri said today government employees, police personnel and jobless youth were up in arms against the BJP government as the current regime has failed to “safeguard” their interests.Even as Agnihotri was speaking, a heated exchange started between the treasury and opposition benches.Amid the pandemonium, Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar ruled that there should be on third strength in the house for the motion to be admitted for discussion.The number of members required for the motion to be approved was 23, however, the opposition had only 18 members.“Hence this motion could not be approved for discussion and thus stands rejected,” he said.At this the opposition members started raising slogans.Agnihotri claimed that the opposition had the required strength but the government was running away from the discussion.He said Congress also had the support of Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPIM) legislators. He said the notice they had given also had the signature of 23 members.However, the speaker announced the lunch. Later, speaking to the media outside the House, Agnihotri termed the move to reject the motion undemocratic as the opposition has submitted the notice for the no-confidence motion to the Vidhan Sabha speaker with the signature of 23 members.He reiterated that the BJP government had lost credibility and public trust. He said it was after the defeat in the byelections that the prices of petrol and diesel were slashed and contentious farm Bills were repealed.In the state too, the government called a meeting of the JCC and accepted their demands. He said this government had no moral right to remain in power.Agnihotri said at first the speaker allowed to move the no-confidence motion but then rejected it even though Congress had the required strength which shows that the government is running away from the discussion.

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Question Hour: No possibility of restoring old pension scheme in Himachal||There is no possibility of restoring the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) for state government employees, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur stated in a written reply laid on the table of the House. The question was jointly raised by Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri and Congress MLAs Ram Lal Thakur, Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu and Jagat Singh Negi. “The New Pension Scheme (NPS) is applicable to the Central government employees and employees of almost all the states. Therefore, it is not possible to restore the old pension at the present time,” the CM said. The estimated one-time expenditure on the implementation of the old pension scheme would be about ₹2,000 crore and the recurring expenditure per year would be about ₹ 500 crore, he added. It was also informed that a total 23,931 recruitments were made in various departments of the state government in the last three years (2018-2021). The highest 8,066 appointments were made in the education department-- 7,336 in elementary education and 730 in higher education. A total of 6,253 people were appointed in health department and 2,150 in the police. In reply to a question raised asked by Rohru legislator Mohan Lal Brakta, Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh informed in a written reply that administrative approval of the plan for channelisation of the Pabbar river was accorded on June 26, 2015, for an expenditure of ₹190.82 crore. At present, investment clearance has been approved by the Government of India (Central Water Commission) in the 13th meeting on August 7, 2020. The project has been sent for funding under the Flood Management and Border Area Programme (FM&BAP). The commencement of this work depends on its selection in the Flood Management and Border Area Programme (FM&BAP) and the availability of adequate funds.In a reply to a question by Jubbal-Kotkhai MLA Rohit Thakur, the Jal Shakti minister informed that three MoUs were signed between the Agriculture Produce Export Development Authority (APEDA) and Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Produce Marketing and Processing Corporation (HPMC) on September 20, 2016, for the setting up three CA Stores at Kharapathar (Shimla), Patlikuhal (Kullu), and Churah (Chamba). However, due to the non-availability of grant-aid, APEDA cancelled the MoUs on November 10, 2016. The cumulative proposed cost of these CA stores was ₹20.38 crore. APEDA had given in-principle approval to provide Rs. 16.81 crore as financial assistance for the same. He said the HPMC proposes to set up CA Store in Churah at a total cost of ₹4.66 crore for which financial assistance of ₹4.18 crore has been approved by NABARD.Apart from this, under the World Bank-funded Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Development Project, a 500 metric tonnes capacity CA store and 5,600-MT grading packing house are proposed to be set up at an estimated cost of ₹16.46 crore. The cold store at Patlikuhal under the Ware House Infrastructure Fund (WIF) with the help of NABARD has been upgraded as CA Store in 2015-16. At present, there is no proposal to set up a CA store AT Khadapathar as the financial position of HPMC is not satisfactory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/question-hour-no-possibility-of-restoring-old-pension-scheme-in-himachal-101639167929080.html
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Akali Dal demands probe into allegations of graft for police postings against minister Randhawa||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday accused Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of accepting “huge sums in bribes” in lieu of posting district police chiefs, particularly in the border belt of the state.In a press conference in Chandigarh, party MLA Bikram Singh Majithia referred to a meeting of the state cabinet, when minister Rana Gurjeet Singh purportedly levelled allegations against Randhawa for having taken money to post senior superintendents of police (SSPs) and officials of lower ranks. He asked chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to come clean on the issue, alleging that he was trying to hush up the matter. “According to the allegations levelled by Rana Gurjeet Singh, the home minister took ₹2-5 crore for the postings. But he (Channi) tried to put the matter under the carpet as he asked the officers present in the meeting to leave and shut the door,” Majithia said. The matter should be probed by a central agency, he said. He alleged that Randhawa is known for patronising gangsters such as Jaggu Bhagwanpuria and Lawrence Bishnoi and even gave VIP status to UP don Mukhtiar Ansari during his tenure as jails minister. ‘My life under threat’Citing “intelligence inputs”, Majithia said his life was under threat, but the state home minister refused to take action. “Some persons who conducted a recce of my Amritsar house a few days back were nabbed with a tiffin bomb and a hand grenade. They are linked to terror outfit Khalistan Task Force (KTF),” he said. He also claimed that the police officers, who were transferred after more than 120 persons were killed in the 2018 hooch tragedy, were back to their old postings. Randhawa was not available for comments despite several attempts to reach him.When contacted, minister Rana Gurjeet refused to comment on what happened in the cabinet meeting on Thursday. Sukhbir slams CM Channi SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday slammed CM Channi for not ordering a probe into bribe being taken by home minister Randhawa for postings of senior police officers.“It is condemnable that despite minister Rana Gurjeet made the accusation on record in a cabinet meeting, no probe was ordered,” he said talking to media after rallies of party candidates Daljeet Singh Cheema and Sunita Rani in Ropar and Balachaur.Channi cannot suppress the people of the state by resorting to “sacrilegious actions” like giving orders to play DJs loudly to drown out their voices, he said, adding that it was shocking that a CM, who boasts of listening to each and everyone, was not only running away from people, but was using the civil and police administration to stifle their voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-demands-probe-into-allegations-of-graft-for-police-postings-against-minister-randhawa-101639167926845.html

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal felling of trees: Lalru MC president, former EO indicted||Mohali additional deputy commissioner Pooja Sayal has indicted municipal council president Bindu Rana and then executive officer (EO) Ashok Kumar for the illegal cutting of trees spread over 10 acres of a shamlat land in Lalru, under the Dera Bassi subdivision, last month. In her report submitted to the principal secretary, local bodies department, Punjab , Sayal stated that Rana and Kumar failed to get any approval from the MC House or permission from the forest department to cut the trees. Even the agenda was not tabled in the House, and there were no representatives from the district administration during the cutting of trees, the report mentioned. “The final report recommending action against the two will be submitted within seven days,” said Sayal.Meanwhile, present EO Jagjit Singh Sahi has written to the Lalru station house officer to register a case against the contractor for cutting the trees. The contract was given for ₹2.25 lakh, but the axed trees were worth several lakhs, it was stated.Officials were supposed to apprise me: RanaDefending herself, MC president Bindu Rana said that it was the duty of the officials to bring to her notice the absence of permissions. Accusing Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma of playing “dirty politics”, Rana said the land in question was meant to carve out plots for homeless people. MLA NK Sharma, who belongs to the Shiromani Akali Dal, had brought the irregularities to light after visiting the spot on November 24. “The whole business was going on without the approval of the forest department. As per rules, a written assessment was to be done by the forest department before giving permission for cutting the trees from the shamlat land, after which advertisement for auctioning of trees was to be issued,” the MLA said.EO Ashok Kumar was shunted out the same day and sent to the head office in Sector 35, Chandigarh. The next day, an inquiry was marked. Even the block officer of the forest department had confirmed that the matter regarding clearance for axing the trees was not in his notice.
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC election: 12 independents form Azad Front||An “Azad Front” has taken shape with 12 independent candidates, mainly rebels from the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), coming together on a common platform ahead of the Chandigarh municipal corporation election.Their target is not just upstaging the two parties in the municipal polls, but also put up a joint candidate for the Lok Sabha polls that are a couple of years away.Narinder Pal Chaudhary, a BJP rebel candidate contesting as an independent from Ward No. 26, said: “We will be helping each other in the MC elections, as we are taking on three major parties with big pockets. The support can be in terms of mobilising crowd support and sharing volunteers for each other’s campaign. So, if a contestant has Purvanchal voters in his constituency, he will bring them to the aid of the other independent candidate who needs their support in his ward.”The Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are locked in a tight three-cornered fight. All three are facing a challenge from a number of rebel candidates.The Congress has to face the challenge from its former members who joined the AAP and SAD and got the ticket after their claims were rejected by the parent party. In the BJP, while three rebel candidates withdrew their candidature, but some candidates with a strong support base are still threatening the party’s official nominees’ winning chances.Now, with the independent candidates getting better organised, the parties are in for a stiffer challenge.Former Congress general secretary Shashi Shankar Tiwari, who resigned from the party after being denied the party ticket, said: “So far we have 12 candidates who have agreed (to join the group). But we are trying to bring more candidates on our platform. The aim is to offer city’s residents an option beyond these corrupt established parties, which have failed to deliver on their promises for so long. Both parties have been gripped by dynastic politics.”Tewari, who is also the Purvanchal Vikas Mahasangh president, said: “In the immediate future, we will work to ensure victory of independent candidates. For this, we are developing a common strategy, and a common manifesto is also under discussion. But our ultimate aim is to get an Azad Front candidate to fight the Lok Sabha election in 2024.”Notably, Tiwari himself is not contesting the election, but is coordinating the activities of the Azad Front.Tiwari named Krishan Lal (Ward No. 3), Manpreet Kaur (9), Veeru (35), Prempal Chahuan (15), Harvansh Singh (29), Sushila Pathak (10), Kripanand Thakur (20), Asha Rani (7), Mukesh Goyal (32), Sohan Singh Mauli (8), Narendra Chaudhary (26) and Parmajit Kaur (4) as the independent candidates who have come together so far.Meanwhile, Kripanand Thakur (Ward No. 20), a rebel BJP candidate, said: “We are in constant talks over different issues and helping each other. But the priority is to win the MC polls in our wards. The future course of action will only be decided after these elections. Common strategies for the grouping are still to be developed.”
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sippy Sidhu murder: CBI announces ₹10 lakh reward for info||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has announced a reward of ₹10 lakh to any person who provides credible information about the murder of national shooter and advocate Sukhmanpreet Singh, aka Sippy Sidhu, who was gunned down at a park in Sector 27, Chandigarh,on September 20, 2015. The case remains unsolved to date.A CBI sleuth privy to the investigations said that it is part of the investigations, as cash rewards can at times motivate people to provide more information and leads. This is, however, not the first time when the CBI has announced a reward in the case. A similar reward of ₹5 lakh was announced on September 6, 2016, as well. “While some calls had come in, the information hadn’t helped in advancing the case by much,” said the CBI official, on the condition of anonymity.Family confused by announcementMeanwhile, the announcement did not go down well with Sippy Sidhu’s family, who have been waiting for justice for the past six years. The victim’s younger brother Jippy Sidhu said over a phone call: “The announcement is unexpected. When the accused has been mentioned by name during the investigations, then what was the need for announcing another reward for the same information?” Jippy, who is out of town, will be returning and meeting CBI officials on Saturday to discuss the matter.After Sippy Sidhu, 36, was shot dead, his family had alleged the involvement of a judge’s daughter. The woman, reportedly a friend of Sidhu, was summoned and questioned twice by the Chandigarh Police during the initial probe. After Sidhu’s family held protests alleging that she was being shielded by police, the UT administration on January 22, 2016, recommended a CBI probe into the case.In December 2020, the CBI had informed court that it had no evidence about the woman’s involvement. The federal agency, however, added it would like to keep the investigation open as it had “strong suspicions about the role of (woman’s name hidden) to eliminate Sippy Sidhu.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sippy-sidhu-murder-cbi-announces-10-lakh-reward-for-info-101639167161523.html
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab election: Singer Anmol Gagan Mann gets AAP ticket from Kharar||Blurb:  The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has declared Punjabi singer Anmol Gagan Mann, 31, as its candidate from Kharar constituency in Mohali district for the Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections scheduled early next year. She has replaced suspended AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu, who won the elections in 2017 by a margin of nearly 2,000 votes defeating former Congress cabinet minister Jagmohan Singh Kang.However, the decision has not gone down well with local AAP leaders, who have shown their resentment over the ticket distribution of the ticket, calling Mann a “parachute candidate”.One such leader is Narinder Singh Shergill, who contested the Lok Sabha elections from Sri Anandpur Sahib constituency and was a contender for the Kharar ticket. “I have been working in Kharar ever since the AAP was formed, but they ignored me,” he said, while adding that he would decide his future course of action after a discussion with his supporters.Jagdev Singh Maloya, district president of the AAP’s farmer wing in Mohali, said: “It is not right to field a candidate from outside Kharar. There were so many local leaders, who were strong contenders for the ticket, but the party completely ignored them.”‘I’ve been living in Kharar for 16 years’Mann is a Punjabi singer and belongs to Mansa district in Punjab. She has done her graduation from MCM DAV College in Sector 36, Chandigarh. In July last year, she joined the AAP and was made the Kharar in-charge. She had actively participated in the farmers’ protest in Mohali. Mann said that people are fed up with both the Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress and have made up their minds to bring the AAP into power. “I am hopeful of winning the elections with a thumping majority. Some leaders are unhappy; it happens; we will pacify them,” she said.Mann said though she is from Mansa, for the past 16 years, she has been staying in Kharar and will keep serving the people of this town.In November 2018, the AAP had suspended journalist-turned-politician and Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu along with Sukhpal Singh Khaira for “indulging in anti-party activities” and “continuously attacking the central and state leadership”. Though Khaira later resigned from the party, Sandhu is still in the AAP but has not been active in his constituency.Last week, in a message on social media, Sandhu made it clear that he would not be contesting the elections, but will remain active in public life and will continue serving people in other ways. On the AAP, he said: “The party should introspect on its conduct.” He also made it clear that he will not be joining any other party. During the Kharar municipal elections in February this year, AAP won only one seat of the 27. The Congress got 10, followed by eight each to SAD and Independents.

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC election: Meet candidates with meagre means but high hopes||Among a number of high-profile and rich candidates fielded by different parties, there are many from humble background who will try their luck as Independents in the upcoming Chandigarh municipal elections.They might possess meagre means, but have high hopes. Among them is Lata Diyat, a visually challenged candidate who has filed her nomination papers from Ward No. 6. Wife of a gardener, the 46-year-old lives in Bangla Basti, Manimajra. A social worker at the school for blind, she holds an MA (music) degree from Panjab University.

Aged 33, this Bapu Dham Colony resident has studied till Class 10. Naeem claims he never took interest in municipal elections, but the issues faced by him during lockdown prompted him to file the nominations this time. “At first, no one came to help when we were in quarantine during the pandemic. It was a difficult situation and people needed help. I want to show people a new way so that changes can be made,” he says.Surinder Kaur, 40, whose husband is a mechanic, is contesting from Ward No. 1. A resident of Khuda Ali Sher village, she says the lack of support shown by the elected representatives during the lockdown prompted her to vie for a seat in the civic body. “This is the first time that I will take part in an election. People want to be heard, and I want their problems resolved,” says Kaur.Akhil Bansal, 28, a telecom retailer who lives in the rehabilitation colony at Dhanas, has entered into the fray from Ward No. 15. “The area lacks basic amenities, and I want to address this issue as a representative of the people,” he says.Aged 22, Akansha, who is contesting from Ward No. 16 on the Bahujan Samaj Party ticket, is among the two youngest candidates in the fray this election.

I want to do more for them. Even basic amenities are missing in the city’s slums; people are forced to drink water contaminated by sewage,” says Akansha, who has declared assets worth ₹30,000. “If other candidates have money, I have ideas and sincerity.”

Demanding the revival of truck unions, the protestors have been sitting on a dharna at the spot since December 6. The one-hour blockade during peak traffic from 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm led to a massive snarl-up with vehicles lining up for around 4 kilometre. Though police diverted the traffic through villages, most vehicles remained struck, delaying many people who were supposed to board their flights. Union district vice-president Amandeep Singh said: “After the 2017 assembly elections, all truck unions in the state were dissolved by Amarinder Singh-led Congress government. As now chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is at the helm, we demand that he should revive the truck unions. We also demand that transportion rates be increased, as truck operators are suffering from an economic downturn.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohaliprotest-by-truckers-brings-traffic-to-a-halt-on-airport-road-101639167148794.html

Speaking in Parliament, the Bathinda MP said even after the ministry of environment, forest and climate change had said that stubble burning was not the major cause for air pollution in Delhi, the AAP government continued to defame the farmers of Punjab and Haryana. “Studies have rather pointed out that stubble burning impact on the air quality in Delhi is negligible and that construction activities, industrial emissions and vehicular pollution is the major cause of air pollution in the national capital,” she said.She asked the Union environment ministry to issue a white paper on the issue so as to set the record straight and end the unfair targeting of farmers and demanded the centre to give an alternative to farmers to phase out the practice of stubble burning.She said that the Supreme Court had directed that farmers should be given ₹100 per quintal to manage their stubble but nothing has been done in this regard for the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stop-blaming-farmers-for-air-pollution-in-delhi-harsimrat-101639166906388.html

The protest began to support Nirmohi Akhara Mahamandaleshwar Gyan Das, who has been fasting since November 16 for the cleanliness of the holy river. The seers under the banner of Shaddarshan Sadhu Samaj started the protest on the bank of the river after the condition of Mahamandaleshwar deteriorated. “The sewer drains are polluting the river for the past four decades. During Simhastha, the river was cleaned for the time being by filling water of Narmada river but again the river has turned into a drain only. This is not a matter of purification of Shipra river but it is a matter of faith. Saints take a holy dip in the river on several occasions but the condition of the river is worsening by the day,” said Mahamandaleshwar Gyan Das.“The protest will not end with just assurance. We will leave this place only when the work order will be placed to clean the river, said Rameshwar Das of Sri Kshetra Panda committee. District collector Ashish Singh said the administration is trying to persuade the seers to end their protest. “We are trying to convince the seers to end the protest. We will soon send a proposal to the state government for cleaning the river”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/clean-up-shipra-river-or-protest-continues-say-seers-in-madhya-pradesh-s-ujjain-101639166726062.html

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: After repeal of farm laws, BJP hopes to regain lost ground||With Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) elections inching closer, the opposition parties, including the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are banking on the remnants of an anti-BJP sentiment that stemmed from the farmer agitation, to sway votes of the population residing in city villages in their favour.With the agitation now withdrawn, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is also keen on regaining lost ground with the city’s rural demographic, which accounts for around 1.25 lakh votes.There are a total of 22 villages under the civic body’s jurisdiction, of which 13 were added recently, making for first-time voters, heading into the December 24-election. The 1.25-lakh-strong demographic is expected to be the deciding factor in around 12 out of the total 35 wards.‘Farmers still angry at BJP’Claiming that the farmers are still angry with the BJP’s handling of the agitation, Pardeep Chhabra, co-in-charge of the AAP’s UT unit, said, “It took the BJP government more than a year to heed to the justified demands of the farmer community.” “For that long the farmers had to suffer hard and many of them even died. Now, when the BJP has withdrawn these laws, it is only because of an eye on elections due in several farmer dominated states,” he added.Notably, the city saw several protests and regular sit-ins, including those in villages, for a vast majority of the agitation’s entire duration. The BJP workers faced strong opposition from protestors in various villages on multiple occasions, at times even being denied entry. Instances of physical altercations involving protesting villagers and party functionaries were also reported. In one such incident reported from Sector 26, the car carrying mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and senior BJP leader Sanjay Tandon was attacked with iron-rod-wielding protestors. Kisan leaders sceptic of BJP’s prospectsSurinder Kaur, a member of the AAP from Khuda Lahora, who has a long-standing association with the farmer agitation, said that while the protests against the BJP leaders have mellowed since the withdrawal of the contentious farm laws, it will still be difficult for the party to win over rural voters.A former BJP national Kisan Morcha member and two-time Daria sarpanch, Gurpreet Singh Happy, said, “If BJP thinks that withdrawing the farm laws would pacify the farmers then it is making a grave mistake.” Having turned dissident after not getting a party ticket, Happy, highlighted the sizeable population with a farming background that reside in city villages. He said, “Most of the villages like Khuda Lahora, Khuda Jassu, Kajheri, Palsora, there is a strong base of families associated with farming. These are the original inhabitants and many still have agricultural land within the city and neighbouring areas.”BJP puts money on withdrawal moveThe BJP local leadership, meanwhile, continue to back their earlier stance suggesting that Narendra Modi government’s decision to withdraw the farm laws has helped close the chapter on the entire issue.“The government has not only withdrawn the laws but has also accepted other demands of the farmers. The farm laws were brought for the farmers’ welfare and withdrawn for the nation’s good. We will now see greater support for the party in the village among the farmer community,” Arun Sood, president of the party’s UT unit, said.Accusing the opposition parties of “instigating” farmers for political gains, Sood said, “It is the Congress and AAP who can’t take on the BJP directly who are even now trying to instigate farmers against the party. They are even camouflaging themselves as farmers to perpetuate such non-existing anger.” 
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege: SIT grills dera vice-chairperson for four hours, no trace of Vipassana||Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) on Friday visited the Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Haryana’s Sirsa district for the second time this week in connection with the 2015 sacrilege cases and questioned vice-chairperson Prithvi Raj Nain, who earlier failed to appear before it despite having summoned repeatedly. The SIT could not trace the sect’s administration wing chairperson Vipassana Insan. After the two were summoned last month, Vipassana failed to respond, while Nain expressed helplessness in appearing before the SIT citing his ill-health. SIT head inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar along with other members — Batala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mukhwinder Singh, DSP Lakhbir Singh and inspector Dalbir Singh — asked 73 questions from Nain during his grilling for more than four hours at sect headquarters on Friday. Besides, the SIT also gave a questionnaire, having 125 queries. He has been directed to submit his answers within 48 hours, people familiar with the development said. IGP Parmar said “We have recorded Nain’s statement. He was uneasy during questioning and evasive in answers. After some time, he requested to discontinue the questioning. As he is only a witness, we agreed and gave him a questionnaire. The dera management told us that Vipassana left the dera headquarters more than a year ago and no one knows about her whereabouts. We have started the process to trace her.” An official privy with the development said the SIT asked Nain about the whereabouts of Vipassana and three absconding members of sect’s national committee — Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri. The questions were more focused on dera management’s operations and events connected with sacrilege incidents, which took place in Faridkot district in 2015, people familiar with the development said. Bareta, Kler and Dhuri are the missing link in three sacrilege incidents that sparked off state-wide protests in 2015, says the SIT. The team claims that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari (Faridkot), Malke (Moga) and Gurusar (Bathinda) were given by Bareta, Kler and Dhuri to the district dera committee members after getting directions from the sect headquarters. Vipassana and Nain were summoned to appear at the IGP’s Ludhiana office on November 16, 26 and December 3 in connection with an FIR lodged at the Bajakhana police station in Faridkot district on June 2, 2015. The case was registered after a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of the district. On December 6, SIT visited dera headquarter to question them but failed to trace them. Nain had also approached Punjab and Haryana high court fearing arrest. However, the state on Thursday told the court that he is only required to make a statement and as of now, there is no such contemplation to arrest him. The two are also facing allegations of orchestrating violence in Panchkula in August 2017. On November 8, the SIT had questioned dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for seven hours at the Sunaria jail in Rohtak district and submitted a 65-page status report in the Punjab and Haryana high court four days later.

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Protests mar Channi’s public rally in Mansa||A public rally addressed by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday witnessed protests by the unemployed teachers and activists of the Youth Congress.The twin events caused embarrassment to the organisers as it was seen as an important political event ahead of the forthcoming state elections. Famous Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who came on the political stage for the first time on Friday after joining the Congress recently, faced strong opposition from a section of youth present in the gallery.All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Harshwardhan Sapkal was among those present at the function.As Channi started his address, a group of men among the Congress workers started raising slogans against the Punjab government for not providing jobs to the qualified teachers. They were overpowered by the security personnel and pushed out of the venue.Police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse another large group of protesters out of the venue. Some protesters also sustained injuries and several were taken into custody. The police action forced the CM to suspend his address for nearly 20 minutes.Channi issued a stern warning to the protesting unions. “Such people are working with ulterior political motives and the government will not tolerate such unruly behaviour,” he said. “I will not listen to such people who disrupt Congress meetings or climb atop water tanks to press for their demands. We are ready to redress problems of all sections, but unions cannot hold the government to ransom,” said the infuriated Channi.Protesters try to disrupt Moosewala’s speechEarlier, a group of Youth Congress activists hooted throughout the time when Sidhu Moosewala addressed the gathering.Carrying placards of former Mansa district Youth Congress president Chuspinder Singh Chahal, the protesters tried to disrupt Moosewala’s speech.He, however, urged the Congress workers to get united for the development of Mansa. “Mansa became a district in 1992 but this mutual rivalry led to a stage that the district continues to be underdeveloped. It is high time that we all get united. The Congress has several senior leaders in the district and I will take whatever role the party assigns me,” said the singer.Transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, who had overseen Mansa rally’s planning, was left red-faced with protest by a section of the party workers.Police had a tough time handling Chahal’s supporters and they were caught unawares about the unemployed teacher’s presence among the political activists.No dearth of funds for development: CM Addressing the gathering, Channi said the state has enough funds for various developmental and welfare activities.“It is an annual feature that money is generated from taxes and it gets exhausted by the end of the year on public activities. There is no shortage of funds,” he added.Channi said the state government would welcome farmers who would start returning to their homes from Saturday after the repeal of the contentious farm laws.Meanwhile, ex-AAP legislator from Jaitu Master Baldev Singh was inducted into the party. Singh, who was disqualified by the speaker in October this year for anti-defection provisions, had quit AAP on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protests-mar-channi-s-public-rally-in-mansa-101639165826145.html
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: AAP releases second list, bets on new faces||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday released a list of 30 candidates for the Punjab assembly elections early next year, fielding former IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh from the Amritsar North seat. Kunwar Vijay was part of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident. He took premature retirement from service in April this year after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the probe report filed by the SIT. The former inspector general of police joined the AAP in June. This is the second list of party nominees and all, except seven, are fresh faces. The others have contested the assembly or Lok Sabha elections in the past. The first list of 10 candidates – all of them sitting AAP MLAs repeated from the seats presently held by them – was released by the party last month. In 2017, the AAP had won 20 seats to emerge as the principal opposition. The party was then rocked by internal squabbling and desertions, which reduced its effective strength to 11. Raman Bahl, who switched sides from the Congress to the AAP exactly a month ago, has been given ticket from Gurdaspur, according to the list signed by AAP state in-charge Jarnail Singh and state president Bhagwant Mann. Bahl, a former chairman of the Punjab State Subordinate Services Selection Board, is the son of former minister and four-time Gurdaspur MLA Khushal Bahl. He remained president of the Gurdaspur municipal council twice. Punjabi singer Anmol Gagan Mann is the AAP nominee from Kharar. The seat was won by AAP’s Kanwar Sandhu in 2017, but he was suspended for anti-party activities two years ago. Former improvement trust chairman Vibhuti Sharma has been given the ticket from Pathankot, while Jagrup Singh Sekhwan, the son of former minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan, has been named the party candidate from Qadian. Sekhwan Senior died in October, days after joining the AAP. Punjabi singer-action Balkar Sidhu is the party candidate from Rampura Phul. Former MLA Naresh Kataria has been fielded from Zira. Gurmeet Singh Khudian, who was the covering candidate of former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh during the 2017 assembly elections, has been given the ticket from Lambi. His father Jagtar Singh Khudian was MP from Faridkot. The list also includes DCP Balkar Singh (Kartarpur), Ravjot Singh (Sham Chaurasi) Balbir Singh Pannu (Fatehgarh Churian), Dr Inderbir Singh Nijjar (Amritsar South), Gurdit Singh Sekhon (Faridkot) Sherry Kalsi (Batala), Lalit Mohan ‘Ballu’ Pathak (Nawanshahr), Lalijit Singh Bhullar (Patti), Daljit Singh (Ludhiana East), Kulwant Singh Sidhu (Atam Nagar), Manwinder Singh Gyaspura (Payal, SC), Jagdeep Singh Kaka Brar (Muktsar), Neena Mittal (Rajpura), Harmeet Singh (Sanour), Chetan Singh (Samana) and Madan Lal Bagga (Ludhiana North). Jiwan Singh has been fielded from Gill (SC), Gurlal from Ghanaur, Labh Singh Ugoke from Bhadaur (SC), Lal Chand from Bhoa (SC) and Harbhajan Singh from Jandiala (SC) seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-aap-releases-second-list-bets-on-new-faces-101639165465958.html
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Fake birth, death certificates: Centre asks Haryana to hold inquiry, seeks action-taken report||PASSING THE BUCK The Registrar General of India writes to Haryana CS, says chief registrar of state is responsible for effective functioning of birth, death registration system India’s Registrar General and Census Commissioner has requested the Haryana government to “conduct a proper inquiry” into the red flags the state health department has raised over unauthorised people generating fake birth and death certificates by breaking into the Civil Registration System (CRS) portal.In a series of letters shot-off to the Registrar General of India (RGI) between June and October this year, Haryana has been listing the details of how “thousands of fake birth and death certificates were generated fraudulently” by unauthorised persons after breaching the security of the CRS portal that RGI maintains.And it is after HT report (Haryana sounds alarm over fake birth, death certificates, December 2) that Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, Vivek Joshi, on December 9 sent a letter to Haryana chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal, seeking action-taken report in this matter from the state health department.“It is requested that necessary directions may be given to the authority concerned to conduct a proper inquiry on the issue of fake birth certificates and take appropriate action required under the law. Office of RGI will provide assistance in the said inquiry, if required,” said Joshi, the RGI, who is a senior IAS officer, in his two-page letter (HT has the copy).“An action-taken report (ATR) in the matter by the chief registrar, department of health will be appreciated.”The registration of births and deaths in country is done under the provisions of the Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Act, 1969 and corresponding state rules.According to Joshi’s letter, the RGI, at the central level, coordinates and unifies the activities of registration throughout the country.Contrary to Haryana’s contention that no action is being taken by the RGI office despite showing information about illegal use of CRS portal, the RGI has said the CRS is state governed and implementation of the statute is vested with the state governments, which has appointed the chief registrar as the chief executive authority in the respective states for implementing the Act.As the head of registration system, the letter says, the chief registrar is responsible for organisation and operational aspects of the Act for effective functioning of the registration system in the state.OTHER STATES ALSO FLAGGED FAKE BIRTH CERTIFICATE ISSUEAccording to the RGI’s letter, there were “reports from few state governments” regarding issuance of fake birth and death certificates. These reports included “misuse of user/login ID and passwords in the existing portal/software” developed for online registration of birth and deaths by unauthorised persons.The RGI has said that in view of such reports, chief registrars of states/UTs were requested on July 28 and September 29 to issue instructions to all registration functionaries not to share their login details and periodically change the password. The letter further says that chief registrars were instructed to take legal action in case of misuse of user/login ID and password of any user or fake registration.“In spite of the aforesaid instructions, it has come to the notice of the office of RGI that some unauthorised persons by misusing login ID/password or otherwise have issued fake birth certificates in few cases on the CRS portal for online registration of births and deaths in the state of Haryana,” says RGI’s letter to Haryana chief secretary.The reported compromised IDs and fake records, states the letter, were blocked and deleted by office of RGI. In addition, director, directorate of census operations, Haryana has recently taken up the matter with authorities concerned in state.The letter further seeks direction to Haryana’s chief registrar to instruct all registration authorities in the state to “exercise due diligence while accessing CRS portal/software”.THE BLAME GAMEWhile RGI’s latest missive clearly deflects Haryana’s contentions, on the other hand, the state health department in its October 13 letter to the RGI said: “Despite repeated requests and showing information about illegal use of the CRS portal, no action has been taken at your end and the misuse of the portal is yet to be controlled. The fake registration cases are still being informed to this office.”In another letter to the RGI, which comes under the Union ministry of home affairs, Haryana health department said they were unable to keep check on creation of fake registrar and sub registrar in the portal as they don’t have control/access over database.The state health authorities stated that despite earlier communications “regarding misuse of CRS portal by hacking it” at least 243 births were registered illegally in Panipat’s ESI hospital and primary health centre using bogus user identification in October.“It seems that some outsiders have good control over the CRS website...” Haryana had told the RGI.

11-12-2021||Chandigarh||UGC pay scales: Teachers of Panjab University and affiliated colleges intensify protest||University and college teachers in Chandigarh have intensified their protest over the Punjab government’s failure to revise UGC pay scales as per the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations.Besides a dharna held by the Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) for the second day in a row, teachers at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26, and DAV College, Sector 10, participated in a chain hunger strike to press their demands. The protests are being held by teachers as part of a statewide “education bandh” under the banner of Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Federation (PFUCTO).PUTA started a rally from the varsity’s Gandhi Bhawan. The teachers expressed their disappointment over their pending demands. PUTA members reportedly also locked a few teaching departments as a mark of protest.PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar said: “We hope that the assurance given by the Punjab government is fulfilled without any further delay. It is difficult to understand the inordinate delay on the part of the state government, when revised UGC pay scales have long been implemented all over the country except in Punjab, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh.”The teachers appealed to the Punjab chief minister to take notice of the long struggle and help them get their dues through his personal intervention. Dr Inderpal Singh Sidhu, an assistant professor at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26, who participated in the chain hunger strike said: “It’s strange that the Punjab government has revised the pay scales of all employees but denied the revision of scales to university and college teachers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-teachers-of-panjab-university-and-affiliated-colleges-intensify-protest-101639164626835.html
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Fresh stand contradicts 2016 decision: HC on show-cause notice to HCS officers||The Punjab and Haryana high court said fresh stand taken by the Haryana government flies in the face of the 2016 decision in the case of show-cause notices given to 19 Haryana Civil Services (HCS) officers in November.The high court bench of justice Arun Monga, while seeking response from the state by January 27, said till next date of hearing it is expected that the government will maintain status quo. The court was hearing a plea from some officers, Inder Jeet and others, who had approached court challenging the show-cause notice.The issue is about show-cause notice on termination of services to 19 officers given on November 27. They were recruited pursuant to a 2004 advertisement during Om Prakash Chautala-led Indian National Lok Dal government. As many as 102 were selected but after allegations of adopting unfair means to select candidates, only these were declared non tainted and appointed in 2016.However, recently, the state government told the high court that the entire selection process was vitiated. Hence, these 19 officers too were given show-cause notices of dismissal. The state had submitted its response to a plea from those who were not given appointments.The court said in 2016, chief secretary had passed an order on appointment of non-tainted ones following which an appeal on the issue was disposed of. Against that high court order, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court, which was dismissed and now the high court judgment has since attained finality.The government also accepted recommendations of a committee comprising of senior officers of the state vigilance bureau, vide which the officers, who were completely exonerated of the allegations of adopting any unfair means in their selection process and they were appointed in May 2016, the court added.The court said notices now come as bolt from the blue. The entire selection process that had withstood the judicial review from the high court and followed by the Supreme Court, has now been exhumed all over again.It further observed that show-cause notices given reflect that even though they have been given 30 days to respond to the same, but it appears that a decision has already been taken to dispense with their services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fresh-stand-contradicts-2016-decision-hc-on-show-cause-notice-to-hcs-officers-101639164566716.html

The women in Rohtak’s Khidwali village on Friday distributed laddoos and other sweets after the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) announced to suspend the agitation after the Union government accepted their demands.Sushila Devi, of Khidwali village, said they will make all arrangements of food and accommodation for the farmers returning from Delhi borders. “We will shower petals on the agitators. This agitation has reduced the barriers between Haryana and Punjab farmers. We are grief-struck that many farmers who visited the borders in this fight did not return home and we are standing by their families,” she added.SKM leader Inderjeet Singh said the farmers will leave the protest sites after cleaning it. “Our volunteers have started collecting garbage and other waste. It’s our duty to clean the protest areas. The villagers from Jhajjar to Sirsa have made langar and accommodation facilities for farmers who will travel through these areas,” he said.“The villagers have prepared halwa, kheer, tea and other items for the returnees. The villagers are excited to see a glimpse of the returnees. We have packed our trolleys and will leave the protest sites after holding a ‘fateh yatra’,” he added.BKU Jind district president Azad Palwa said farmers and villagers will shower petals on farmers’ vehicle passing through the district. “We have also deputed teams of doctors at various points, for in case any farmers complain of health complications,” he added.The farmers from Haryana and Punjab said the year-long agitation has brought them closer and has reduced the barrier which was forged over the SYL issue.Gurjan Singh, of Punjab’s Sangrur, said they have established family-like relations with Haryana farmers and will never forget the support provided.“We will miss the protest sites and the time spent with our Haryana brothers. Haryana farmers have big hearts and we will stop our vehicles at every stoppage point from Tikri border to Khanauri to receive their welcome,” he added.Navdeep Singh, of Bathinda, said they have packed their belongings and will leave the protest site on Saturday.“We have won the battle due to the immense support provided by the Haryana farmers. They arranged food and other items required at Delhi borders. Even when the Haryana Police registered cases against them, they continued to fight against BJP-JJP leaders,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-villagers-set-to-give-rousing-welcome-to-local-punjab-farmers-101639164206189.html
11-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Poll code further delays setting up of RT-PCR test lab at GMSH-16||Amid the possibility of another surge of Covid-19 pandemic and concerns over the new Omicron variant, the Chandigarh health department has inadequate facilities to conduct testing for the virus. In fact, over 20 months after the first Covid-19 case surfaced in Chandigarh, Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, is yet to begin the RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing. The health department had in July planned to set up an advanced lab at GMSH-16 for conducting RT-PCR testing, with the aim to complete the project by September this year. Though the department has received the required equipment, the already delayed project will take another one month for completion due to Chandigarh municipal elections.“The engineering-related work of the building got delayed initially. Now, we have got the equipment, but due to the election code of conduct, approvals and filing procedures are taking extra time. It will take around a month to start the facility,” said Dr Suman Singh, director health services, Chandigarh.The RT-PCR test detects the presence of viral RNA and is quite accurate. It is the most recommended test for tracing the infection in individuals suffering from influenza-like symptoms and Covid-19. Once operational, the hospital will start conducting 400 tests per day while the capacity will increase with time. Meanwhile, the GMSH-16 has a TrueNat machine that gives results in three to four hours, but is only meant for testing of emergency cases and not for mass-scale testing. Besides, rapid antigen tests are being conducted at various government facilities, which give results in 30-45 minutes but are less reliable than RT-PCR tests.In the absence of the RT-PCR test facility, the UT health department is sending more than 1,000 samples daily to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).

We need to expand our economic and security posture around the world."Truss held talks on the sidelines of the summit on Friday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as Germany's new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.Blinken flies on to Southeast Asia next week on a visit designed to highlight the region's importance in Washington's push for "peace, security and prosperity" in the Indo-Pacific region against an increasingly assertive China.Ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will join the G7 summit for the first time ever on Sunday, in a session earmarked for wide-ranging talks on issues including Covid-19 vaccines, finance and gender equality.South Korea, Australia, South Africa and India will also participate as Britain's chosen G7 "guests", with many attendees taking part virtually due to the pandemic and emergence of the Omicron variant.Truss said before the meeting that she wanted deeper ties between G7 nations in trade, investment, technology and security "so we can defend and advance freedom and democracy across the world".Ukraine talksTruss, who replaced Dominic Raab in the role in September, set out her foreign policy vision in a major address on Wednesday.She warned Moscow it would be "a strategic mistake" to invade Ukraine, following growing concerns over a big Russian troop build-up on the border which the Kremlin says is defensive against any move by Kiev towards NATO.That echoed comments delivered by US President Joe Biden to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a virtual summit the previous day when he warned of unprecedented sanctions if Ukraine was attacked.Washington's top diplomat for Europe and Eurasian affairs, Karen Donfried, will hold follow-up talks with senior government officials in Kiev and Moscow next week to try to end the conflict.She will then head to Brussels for further discussions with NATO and EU allies "to pursue a diplomatic solution" to the stand-off.Britain's G7 presidency has been dominated by responding to Beijing's increasing international assertiveness and alleged widespread domestic rights abuses, including of its Muslim minority Uyghur population.This week, a panel of human rights lawyers and experts in London concluded Beijing had committed genocide by imposing population restrictions, including birth control and forced sterilisations, on the Uyghurs.China rejected the tribunal's findings.At a G7 leaders' summit in June, Biden pushed for a stronger collective stance towards both China and Russia, and this week saw Washington, London and Canberra announce diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Truss has said the West needs to work towards ending the "strategic dependence" of a growing number of low- and middle-income countries on its adversaries, in various areas from energy to technology.At the summit she will push attendees to provide those countries with more finance for infrastructure and technology projects, according to the foreign office.G7 countries and their allies must offer "an alternative to unsustainable debt from non-market economies" like China, it said.Truss will unveil a UK-led initiative -- the Africa Resilience Investment Accelerator -- to boost collaboration investing in Africa's "most fragile markets" and help develop "a pipeline of investable opportunities".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-top-agenda-as-g7-ministers-call-for-unity-against-authoritarianism-101639244974552.html

Imran said that it was necessary to help Afghanistan avoid an economic collapse.“Pakistan valued its long-standing relationship with the United States and was committed to expanding it in all spheres, particularly in the economic dimension,” Khan told the four-member US delegation consisting of senators Angus King, Richard Burr, John Cornyn and Benjamin Sasse. Khan’s latest statement comes amid frayed relations between the US and Pakistan as the Pakistan prime minister boycotted the Democracy Summit hosted by US President Joe Biden.The four senators are members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Senator King is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.The senators also thanked the Pakistan government for helping in the evacuation of the American nationals and others from Afghanistan earlier in August and September following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The senators also affirmed that the US feels that due to Pakistan’s geo-strategic location and population both nations should make determined efforts to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation.Pakistan on several occasions has reiterated to the international community that it should not isolate Afghanistan, which is governed by the Taliban, citing that it will lead to a humanitarian crisis and economic despair. The international community however remains committed to helping the Taliban-led government only if it keeps its pledges regarding women, education and protection towards minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-boycotting-biden-s-summit-imran-khan-shifts-stance-101639244477374.html

Ticket prices have not been disclosed.Alan Shepard performed a 15-minute suborbital space flight on May 5, 1961, just under a month after the Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, orbiting the planet.Shepard, who died in 1998, went on to be the fifth of twelve men to have set foot on the Moon.Previous Blue Origin flights have flown the company's billionaire founder Bezos as well as Star Trek actor William Shatner to space.Bezos, who made his fortune with Amazon, envisages a future in which humanity disperses throughout the solar system, living and working in giant space colonies with artificial gravity.This, he says, would leave Earth as a pristine tourism destination much like national parks today.The year 2021 has been significant for the space tourism sector, with Virgin Galactic also flying its founder Richard Branson to the final frontier, and Elon Musk's SpaceX sending four private citizens on a three-day orbital mission for charity.ia/dw/AMAZON.COM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-completes-third-space-flight-with-6-member-crew-101639237297791.html

The recent actions of Russia, signalling an intention to invade Ukraine, prompted US President Joe to hold discussions with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, over a secured telephone call last Tuesday.The concern over possible invasion of Ukraine has further grown as Russia continues to deploy more troops in the border areas. In an interview with Greek TV channel ANT1, Peskow said Russia can move its forces wherever it wants. Referring to US warplanes landing in Ukraine, the Kremlin spokesperson said that the troops have been moved closer to the areas that could pose a threat to national security.When asked whether Putin was planning to launch a military offensive against Ukraine, Peksov said, "No, the problem is very simple.”“Russia is moving its forces within its territory and we can move our forces in any direction we want and closer to the areas that could pose a threat [and currently] we see US warplanes landing in Ukraine and US military equipment approaching our borders," he added, as quoted by ANI.Peskov was also asked whether Russia and the United States could ever become allies, to which the Kremlin spokesperson said "it would be hard to imagine such a thing" considering the current situation.Last week, Biden said he was coordinating with European allies to make it “very, very difficult” for the Russian president to attack Ukraine.“What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,” Biden told reporters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-not-planning-to-attack-ukraine-adds-problem-is-very-simple-101639227747042.html

So I decided to come down here to see what was going on, and I had no idea the building looked that bad. And I'm just; I'm worried sick," she said.Illinois Governor JB Pritzker tweeted: "My prayers are with the people of Edwardsville tonight, and I've reached out to the mayor to provide any needed state resources."The US National Weather Service had issued tornado warnings on Friday night for areas in several states including Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Illinois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-trapped-after-amazon-warehouse-roof-collapse-near-us-city-of-st-louis-101639224682325.html

11-12-2021||World||Illegal but essential: Afghan migrants, minorities recycle Istanbul's waste||Shrouded by acrid smoke, a young Afghan crouches sorting waste he has pulled from the trash bins of Istanbul, anxious that Turkey will soon strip him of even this subsistence."I start at eight in the morning and finish at eight at night," said Issam Raffur, who has spent four of his 20 years in Turkey."It is very hard and poorly paid, but I have no choice," he shrugged, smoke billowing from a fire barely warming his makeshift sorting centre on a soggy winter day.Considered the poorest of Turkey's poor, Afghans have joined Kurds, the Laz, Roma and other ethnic minorities and undocumented migrants in doing work others snub.For less than $10 a day, they roam the streets of Istanbul, a megalopolis of nearly 16 million people straining under the weight of a currency crisis and a flood of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other conflict-riven states.Diving headfirst into dumpsters, they dig up plastic bottles, glass and other waste they then sort and sell in bulk -- a self-organised, unregulated business that keeps the city clean, and men such as Issam fed.But as public sentiment turns against migrants and other foreigners in Turkey, the state-appointed prefecture of Istanbul has declared this work bad for "the environment and public health".Issam and his friends suspect that what Turkish officials really want is to put this potentially profitable business under the control of a few, well-connected recycling firms."If the big companies take over, they will saw off our last branch of support," said Mahmut Aytar, a Turk who manages one of the small recycling centres on the Asian side of Istanbul. "They will throw us in the ravine."Speaking to AFP, Deputy Environment Minister Mehmet Emin Birpinar did little to ease Aytar's concerns."Waste can be bought and sold, so we have started to view it as a raw material with other uses," he said. "After the price of raw materials increased, the value of recycled goods has risen."- Women and children - Born in multi-ethnic southeastern Turkey, Aytar, 28, launched his recycling business out of desperation after failing to find work befitting his biology degree."This job does not require experience or training. Anyone can do it, but it is mostly the people excluded by the system who get involved," he said while watching his press machines crush plastic bags and empty bottles.After being shrunk into tidy bales, the plastic waste is loaded onto trucks of small, independently run recycling operators who convert them into granules.Aytar said he runs one of 2,500 or so impromptu recycling depots in Istanbul, receiving dozens of trash collectors -- called "cekcekci" (pronounced "chekchekchi" and roughly translating as those who pull carts) -- every day.Tugging white, muddied carts filled with paper, cardboard, plastic and bottles, they dart between honking cars and pedestrian streams, earning 80-120 liras ($6-$9) a day.Women and minors specialise in cardboard boxes, which they find after the shops close at night, their babies sometimes riding along in the carts' lower folds.Each kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of waste is worth about a lira (seven US cents), and the bravest collect about 150 kilogrammes of waste a day."They probably don't realise it, but by being impoverished, they contribute to protecting the environment," said Aytar. "They are helping society."'Harassment' They do so while living in destitution and depend on the whims of the police.In early October, security forces rounded up more than 250 cekcekci in one day, releasing them after a few hours but keeping their precious cargoes of waste."It's harassment," said Elrem Yasar, who started managing his own depot after collecting trash for 12 years."Each confiscation costs me about 560 liras, which I earn in three days."Istanbul prefecture officials defended their crackdown."These cekcekci work illegally," one official told AFP on condition of anonymity. "It is up to the city to take care of recycling and to collect revenues from it."Conceding that his work has no legal status, collector Ekrem Yasar said he would be happy to pay taxes if ever given the chance."We are not asking for state handouts, but if they take away our jobs, tens of thousands of people will be left with nothing," he said, pinning his hopes on the first cekcekci union, which is still in the process of being set up.Most of the trash collectors and warehouse workers live on-site in crudely arranged containers, huddling around open fires in Istanbul's industrial zones."Imagine, life in the city," Yasar said with a bitter laugh. "You think we are making money? Look, we only have one teaspoon between us," he said while serving tea.ach/zak/imm/lth/cdw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-but-essential-afghan-migrants-minorities-recycle-istanbul-s-waste-101639216423116.html

"I was hoping to complete it by Christmas but I guess that’s not happening anymore, but it’s an adventure."Rutherford, who is to remain at in hotel before her planned departure for Taiwan on Monday, said she expects to complete her journey by mid-January.With enhanced Covid-related travel restrictions, Rutherford said she has sometimes not been allowed to see local places in some countries."I’m seeing these places from the air and that is the most incredible thing," she said. "Although I’m not always allowed to go and visit, walk around and check out museums and restaurants, I can always see them from the air and it’s pretty incredible.”Aside from entering the record book, the teenager has expressed hope that her voyage will encourage girls and women to study and work in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), and spark girls' interest in aviation.Rutherford is seeking the title held by from Shaesta Wais, who became the youngest woman to fly solo round the world at age 30 in 2017. The youngest male record holder, Mason Andrews, was 18 years old when he made the journey in 2018.Born to two pilots, Rutherford will start university next year, with the dream of becoming an astronaut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teen-zara-rutherford-lands-in-seoul-in-record-soloflight-101639211242259.html

The filters worn by people infected with Covid-19 glowed around the nose and mouth areas.The team hopes to further develop the masks so that they will glow automatically, without special lighting, if the virus is detected.Tsukamoto, a veterinary professor and the president of the university, has studied ostriches for years, looking for ways to adapt their immunity power to fight bird flu, allergies, and other diseases.Tsukamoto told the Kyodo news agency he discovered his own positivity for Covid-19 after he wore one of the special masks and found that it glowed when checked. The diagnosis was confirmed after a standard test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/using-ostrich-cells-scientists-make-masks-that-glow-in-contact-with-coronavirus-101639208986531.html

Between December 3 and 9, the daily average was at 3,450, growing 22% over the previous week.With transmission at these levels, modelling showed cases could double and another Delta-driven wave could result in four-fold rise, while an Omicron wave could make matters worse.In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said “if spread of the Omicron variant were to accelerate and replace the Delta variant as the predominant variant in Canada” then it was “possible” there could be an “even more rapidly accelerating resurgence in cases”. There have, so far, been 87 cases of confirmed infection related to the Omicron variant.However, the situation will be very different to the winter wave a year earlier. “Despite the challenges ahead with the continuing Delta-driven wave in Canada and emergence of the Omicron variant, we have more and better protections going into this holiday and winter season than previously,” she said. A wide vaccine rollout and extensive coverage, “continue to give us an advantage over this virus, and while some reduction in protection is possible with the Omicron variant, Covid-19 vaccines are still expected to provide a level of protection, particularly against severe outcomes”, she said.Of the entire population, 81% have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 76% are fully jabbed. With paediatric vaccinations having started, 17% of children aged between 5 and 11 have been administered one dose of an mRNA vaccine. In addition, booster doses have also commenced, and a wider population will be covered in January.”Despite the challenges ahead, “we have more and better protections going into this holiday and winter season than previously”, the modelling presented on Friday noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-better-prepared-to-tackle-fresh-cases-in-holiday-season-101639205679938.html

11-12-2021||World||Joe Biden ends summit with call to ‘safeguard’ guardrails of democracy||US President Joe Biden closed the Summit for Democracy on Friday reminding world leaders, who participated, of their responsibility to “strengthen the guardrails of democracy” to make it more resilient against the “buffeting forces of autocracies” and he vowed to do his own part in America by enacting laws advancing voting rights.The two-day virtual summit was attended by leaders of 89 countries - of the 100 who were invited - and the European Union. Biden announced in his closing remarks that he plans to host a second edition of it next year and indicated it would be an in-person gathering.Joe Biden closed the summit saying, “As the leaders of governments, we - we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and to drive reforms that are going to make transparent, accountable governments - governance more resilient against the buffering and - the buffeting forces of autocracy and those who want - and the naked pursuit of power ahead of the public good.”This first summit of its kind was attended among others by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, France’s Emmanuel Macron, UK’s Boris Johnson, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Australia’s Scott Morrison. Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan were not invited and Pakistan’s Imran Khan turned down the invitation.“Over the last two days, we’ve heard government leaders, as well as democratic reformers from every region of the world, talk about the challenges that democracy is facing and the opportunities for its renewal,” Biden said, summarising the remarks and comments at the conference.“We’ve shone a spotlight on the importance of protecting media freedom and how advancing the status of women and girls is an investment in the success for our democracies,” the US president added. “And we’ve focused on the need to empower human rights defenders and make sure … technology … is used to advance democracies to lift people up, not to hold them down.”The last point was an unmistakable reference to Beijing’s use of technology - the persecution of China’s minority Uighur Muslims - is what has been described by the United States and other countries as genocide. The country’s communist party rulers have also used technology to suppress dissent.President Joe Biden went on to say that though challenges to democracy may vary from country to country “the threat we face and the solutions we seek have a common antecedent”. Autocracies, essentially.In the US, the most serious threat to democracy in recent history came from a horde of insurrectionists incited by former President Donald Trump who invaded the US Capitol, home to the country’s parliament, to prevent a joint sitting of its two chambers from certifying Biden’s election as president.Biden addressed the domestic threats to democracy in the US as a voting rights issue and promised to “make real the full promise of America, including by enacting both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act”. The two legislations seek, above all, to make voting easy and non-discriminatory.“Here at home, that means working to make real the full promise of America, including by enacting both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-ends-summit-with-call-to-safeguard-guardrails-of-democracy-101639201906658.html

He was 78.Uemura, the lead architect behind Nintendo Co.'s trailblazing home game consoles, died Monday, Ritsumeikan University said in a statement. The cause of his death was not released.Born in Tokyo in 1943, Uemura studied electronic engineering at the Chiba Institute of Technology and joined Nintendo in 1971.Uemura was tasked by then-president Hiroshi Yamauchi in 1981 with developing a home console for games like Donkey Kong, which was a huge hit in the United States at the time but only available for arcade use.The so-called Famicom game system hit the Japanese market in 1983 as Nintendo's first cartridge-based console, allowing users to play popular games that came in cassette formats. The upgraded Super Famicom was released in Japan in 1990.The Nintendo Entertainment System, as it was known, hit the United States in 1985 and eventually became a global sensation with more than 60 million consoles sold worldwide, bringing international recognition to a company that previously made traditional Japanese card games, other playing cards, and toys.After retiring from Nintendo, Uemura taught game studies starting in 2004 at Ritsumeikan University in the ancient Japanese capital, which is also home to Nintendo."We offer our heartfelt appreciation for Mr. Uemura's huge contributions to the development of the game industry by introducing a variety of video game consoles including family computers," Ritsumeikan University said in a statement. “May he rest in peace."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masayuki-uemura-creator-of-nintendo-s-iconic-nes-console-passes-away-101639198901914.html

I hope that your obsession with her is over,” Judge Daly told Bhavnani.Last month, the court heard that Bhavnani made threats in a 100-page letter delivered to the female nursing student, who cannot be named for legal reasons.He claimed that he had copied the threats from poetry found online.In her statement, the victim said that she was terrified that Bhavnani would sexually assault her.Bhavnani pleaded guilty to stalking, but not guilty to a more serious form of the offence. He has already spent a month on remand after breaching his bail earlier."I started getting six-minute-long voice messages saying he was going to make me be his wife, make me have his children, make me live with him,” the victim had told the BBC.The victim had repeatedly made it clear that she was not interested in any kind of relationship, and warned Bhavnani she would contact the police if he continued to harass her.She is now calling for a change in the university’s policies, and urged more support for stalking victims.In a statement, Oxford Brookes University said it wanted to reassure students that it took "reports of harassment, violence or abuse very seriously" and added that lessons would be learned."In this individual case, following a university conduct hearing, the most severe penalty available was applied by the university and the student was expelled from Oxford Brookes," the university said in a statement."We accept, however, that there are lessons we can learn for the future, especially in cases where student behaviour may also constitute a criminal offence," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-student-expelled-from-uk-university-for-stalking-101639196682467.html
11-12-2021||World||After Biden-led summit, China calls US democracy ‘weapon of mass destruction’||China branded US democracy a "weapon of mass destruction" on Saturday, following the US-organised Summit for Democracy which aimed to shore up like-minded allies in the face of autocratic regimes.China was left out of the two-day virtual summit -- along with countries including Russia and Hungary -- and responded by angrily accusing US President Joe Biden of stoking Cold War-era ideological divides.“‘Democracy’ has long become a ‘weapon of mass destruction’ used by the US to interfere in other countries,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in an online statement, which also accused the US of having "instigated 'colour revolutions'" overseas.The ministry also claimed the summit was organised by the US to "draw lines of ideological prejudice, instrumentalise and weaponise democracy... (and) incite division and confrontation."Instead, Beijing vowed to "resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of pseudo-democracies".Ahead of the summit, China ramped up a propaganda blitz criticising US democracy as corrupt and a failure.Instead, it touted its own version of "whole-process people's democracy" in a white paper released last week that aimed to shore up legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party, which has become increasingly authoritarian under President Xi Jinping.While the US has repeatedly denied there will be another Cold War with China, tensions between the world's two largest economies have spiralled in recent years over issues including trade and technological competition, human rights, Xinjiang and Taiwan.The US Treasury on Friday sanctioned two high-level Chinese officials for human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region and placed Chinese AI surveillance firm SenseTime on a blacklist for its facial recognition technology targeting the Uyghur minority.Taiwan, a democratic self-ruling island that is claimed by China, was invited to the US summit in a clear snub to its larger neighbour.But Beijing got a boost in the middle of Biden's summit when Nicaragua dropped its previous diplomatic alliance with Taiwan, saying it only recognised China.The announcement leaves Taiwan with only 14 diplomatic allies. In response, the US State Department called on "all countries that value democratic institutions" to "expand engagement" with the island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-biden-led-summit-china-calls-us-democracy-weapon-of-mass-destruction-101639197174480.html

The watch face of the limited edition Hublot watch bears the signature and jersey number of Maradona, and the back shows the silhouette of the man, both hands held aloft in celebration.“A costly Hublot watch... Maradona... Dubai... Assam Police Looks like random words, don’t they? But today all these words came together nicely, stating a story of successful International Cooperation between #DubaiPolice and @assampolice,” Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, Assam’s director general of police, tweeted on Saturday.The limited edition watch has been recovered from Hussain, Mahanta tweeted. “The watch belonged to the legendary football player himself, which was being stored in Dubai along with other belongings in a safe,” the police chief said in the tweet.The prompt action by state police drew prise from chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “In an act of international cooperation, Assam Police has coordinated with Dubai Police through Indian federal LEA to recover a heritage Hublot watch belonging to legendary footballer late Diego Maradona and arrested one Wazid Hussein,” Sarma tweeted. “Follow up lawful action is being taken.”Hussein was arrested from the home of his in-laws in Charaideo district early Saturday morning, Sivasagar police superintendent Rakesh Raushan told HT.Police conducted a search on Friday night, but Wazid was not at his home in Sivasagar, Raushan said. “We arrested him from Charaideo district, and based on the information he shared, we managed to recover the stolen watch from his residence,” Raushan said.Hussain worked as a guard at a private company in Dubai, which was in charge of security of a location where Maradona’s belongings have been stored, police said. In August, Hussain returned to India, citing the ill-health of his father.“As per the information we received, Wazid Hussian was working as a security guard at a company in Dubai in UAE (United Arab Emirates) since 2016,” a police officer said, requesting anonymity. “The company stores the belongings of the late Argentinian footballer. Before returning back home in August, he stole the watch.”Hussain had thus far not revealed how he managed to steal the watch and bring it into India. He did not sell the watch, afraid of getting caught given how distinctive the watch was, police said.There is a possibility that Hussain might be sent to Dubai to face consequences of his act. “But the decision will be taken by higher agencies,” Raushan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-who-stole-maradona-s-watch-held-in-assam-101639247264851.html
11-12-2021||India||Farmers dismantle their shelters at Delhi borders||Tens of thousands of farmers began wrapping up tents and other makeshift structures at three protest sites on the national capital’s borders on Saturday as they headed home after yearlong protests against three contentious farm laws that have now been scrapped by the Centre.Farmers took out a victory march, sang, danced and organised feasts as they started dismantling tents used for the protests, with some of them saying that the entire process to vacate the three areas – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur – could take up to three days.After morning prayers and a victory march led by horse-mounted Nihangs, the farmers camped at the Singhu border started retreating from the protest site on tractor-trolleys decorated with flowers amid blaring music. While Nihangs displayed martial art skills and a decorated bus carried the Guru Granth Sahib in front of the procession, several onlookers threw flower petals in their path.A compromise between the Centre and protesting farm unions came after two days of back-channel negotiations that saw proposals being sent back and forth, and 11 rounds of tenuous negotiations that hit a deadlock on January 22. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that his government was repealing the contentious laws and Parliament scrapped them on November 29.At the Ghazipur border, another protest site of the farmers, the first group of farmers left on Saturday afternoon for different areas in Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh. Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that the process to vacate the area will take up to three days. “I will leave the site by December 15,” he said.To be sure, the three border roads where the farmers held sit-in protests are yet to open for vehicular movement. Even after most farmers vacate the streets by Sunday night or Monday, police teams from Delhi, UP, Haryana and other agencies will take some time to clear the roads. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will then inspect the roads before giving a nod to open them for vehicular movement after over a year, an official aware of the developments said.Special commissioner of police (law and order) Dependra Pathak said: “We have started the process of removing the barricades and blockades that were placed on the Delhi side. The concerned stakeholders have been intimated about the developments and asked to take necessary steps to open the three borders. We are trying to open the borders and resume traffic on the roads as early as possible.”Barring the deserted section of the main Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) protest stage, over 70% area along the Delhi-Jaipur highway was cleared by late afternoon at the Singhu border. With larger metallic iron frames yet to be dismantled, repairs needed on the carriageways and the concrete embankments made by the authorities in Delhi still in place, it will take a few more days for normal traffic to resume in the area, people aware of the matter said.The farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan have been camping at the three key border points at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 26 last year to protest the now-scrapped farm laws. SKM member and farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said the farmers won the fight and the central government forced to bow down. He also paid tributes to more than 700 farmers who died during the stir.Besides distributing sweets and taking selfies at the three sites, many farmers were seen donating some of their belongings to people in the area. Before departing in triumphant convoys, the farmers said that they were going with bittersweet memories. Iqbal Singh (63) and Labh SIngh (70) from Fatehpur Sahib in Punjab were seen clearing their tent. “We are helping clean the place before leaving. Singhu has been like a home to us and this place has given us many good experiences… Morcha fateh (victory) has been declared and we will head back to our fields. Farmers don’t rest,” Iqbal Singh said.While many farmers began returning to their homes when the final agreement was reached between the Centre and SKM two days back, the dismantling of makeshift tents and shelters along the Delhi-Chandigarh highway gathered pace on Saturday. Youngsters from villages in the area and locally hired labourers used jackhammers and cutting tools to wrap up the structures. In case of larger langar halls with metallic frames, cranes and excavators were being used to remove the structures.“There are ration stocks, cots, firewood and other relief material. It was a community effort to sustain the protest and community members are helping take everything back. We will clear the site by tomorrow (Sunday),” Dalip Singh from Huzoor Sahib gurdwara in Nanded said. He added that three trucks and two cranes have been brought to pack up the material gathered over the last year.Around 30km away, the Tikri border protest site witnessed a similar flurry of activity. Emotions ran high, as farmers hugged and congratulated each other on the success of their struggle, and promised to stay in touch with each other as they headed back to their villages. Gopal Krishna, 60, sat atop a truck with two others as he oversaw the dismantling of their makeshift home. Residents of Hamidi village in Punjab’s Barnala district, the lot was waiting to return by Saturday evening. “Back home, people are waiting for us. As soon as we all reach home, we will mark our victory and thank the people back home who supported us during the movement,” said Parminder Singh Pradhan, a farmer from Punjab’s Sri Muktsar Sahib.At Ghazipur, BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said: “This was our ‘training ground’ where we learnt how to face different situations and how to carry on long protests while tackling all weather conditions. The people who are part of this agitation will now go to different parts of the country and teach others how to deal with such situations.” Tikait shot into the limelight after his emotional appeal from the dais of the protest site on January 28 earlier this year. Farmer leaders said that the dais at the site will be dismantled and Saturday evening was the last time when speeches, including that by Tikait, were made from the dais erected on National Highway 9.Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (rural), said: “Some farmers went home on Saturday while others in large number of groups will start moving to their homes on Sunday morning. The gathering swelled on Saturday as people came to meet farmers before they go home and families of many farmers also arrived to take them home.”Emotions ran high as the farmers performed prayers to thank the almighty and started their “victory march” from Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur protest sites to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in convoys of tractors, bedecked with colourful flowers and lights and blaring songs of jubilation.By Saturday evening, most farmers cleared the Singhu border protest site spread over 5-6km, leaving behind some tents.People gathered at many places on the Delhi-Karnal-Ambala and Delhi-Hisar national highways as well as other routes welcomed and honouring the farmers with garlands and sweets.An aircraft also showered flower petals on farmers at Shambhu border (Punjab-Haryana border).Because of the large convoy of tractor trolleys and other vehicles, traffic jams could be seen at many places on Delhi-Haryana national highway and other roads.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter to praise the farmers for their effort. “There is no substitute for patience, courage and unity. Only by mutual brotherhood and unity, the country move forward. This unity of farmer brothers was their biggest strength. My salute to the strong will and vitality of the farmer brothers who are returning home from today with a historic victory,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-dismantle-their-shelters-at-delhi-borders-101639247262314.html
11-12-2021||India||Wing Commander Prithvi Singh cremated with state honours in Agra||With moist eyes, family, friends and others bade adieu to Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan in Agra on Saturday. Chauhan was cremated with full state honours at Tajganj crematorium in the afternoon. His daughter Aradhya, 12, and son Aviraj, 7, lit the pyre. A resident of Saran Nagar locality in Agra, Chauhan, 42, died in Wednesday’s chopper crash in Tamil Nadu in which Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 10 others also lost their lives. Earlier in the day, the mortal remains of the Indian Air Force (IAF) officer reached Agra airport where Union minister of state for law and justice Prof SP Singh Baghel, IAF officials, Agra DM Prabhu N Singh and SSP Sudhir K Singh paid their tribute to the departed soul. Emotions ran high when Chauhan’s wife Kamini Singh Chauhan wife reached the coffin wrapped in the Tricolour. She stood composed as she guided her son and daughter who offered floral tribute to the mortal remains of their father. Then the mortal remains of the IAF officer were taken to his house in a military truck. All along the 8-km stretch from the airport to Saran Nagar, locals showered flower petals on the vehicle as a mark of tribute to the departed soul. A large number of people had gathered outside Chauhan’s house to pay their last respects to him. Family, friends and relatives were in tears as Chauhan’s aged father Surendra Singh, 74, and mother Susheela Singh, 70, broke down once the IAF personnel entered their house carrying Chauhan’s mortal remains on their shoulders. Later, the funeral procession was taken out in which people in large numbers took part.

Though the committee understands the necessity to undertake a media campaign to spread the message of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' among the people, they feel that it is equally important to balance the objectives of the scheme,” the panel highlighted.The panel said that since the scheme has managed to capture national attention and influence the national consciousness regarding the necessity of valuing the girl child it should now focus on making financial provisions in order to achieve measurable outcomes related to education and health, the aim with which the scheme was rolled out.“This is one of the most important schemes of the government to improve child sex ratio in backward regions and ensure education of the girl children, the committee recommends that the government should, hereafter, reconsider spending on advertisements under the 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' scheme and should focus on planned expenditure allocation for sectoral interventions in education and health,” the panel observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-takes-a-dig-at-bjp-over-panel-report-on-beti-bachao-beti-padhao-scheme-101639244627374.html
11-12-2021||India||In self-reliance boost, India tests new anti-tank missile, longer range rockets||India on Saturday successfully tested a new locally-developed anti-tank missile and concluded a series of tests of extended range rockets also developed indigenously, weapons that will be inducted into the armed forces shortly, officials familiar with the developments said. The weapons successfully tested were the helicopter launched stand-off anti-tank (SANT) missile and Pinaka extended range (ER) rocket systems. “The successful tests are an important step towards achieving the goal of self-reliance in the defence sector, and have paved the way for the induction of the weapons into the armed forces,” Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chief G Satheesh Reddy said. The DRDO and Indian Air Force flight-tested the indigenously designed and developed SANT at Pokhran firing range on Saturday. “The test met all mission objectives. The release mechanism, advanced guidance and tracking algorithms, and all avionics with integrated software performed satisfactorily. Tracking systems monitored all mission events,” the defence ministry said in a statement. The weapon has a range of 10 km. The IAF’s Russian-origin Mi-35 attack helicopters are expected to be equipped with the missile to arm them with the capability to destroy enemy tanks from an improved stand-off range.The existing Russian-origin Shturm missile on the Mi-35 can target tanks at a range of five km. The other weapons on the gunship include rockets of different calibre, 500 kg bombs, 12.7mm guns, and a 23mm cannon. The existing anti-tank missiles developed by DRDO --- the Nag and Helina --- have an effective range of under five km. While the Nag missile is launched from a modified infantry combat vehicle (called the Nag missile carrier or Namica) and has a range of four km, the Helina or helicopter-based Nag is for mounting on the Dhruv advanced light helicopter and can strike targets up to five km away. A series of successful tests of Pinaka ER rocket systems were also carried out over the last week at the Pokhran range. The new rocket system has a longer range with reduced length compared to the earlier variant. “DRDO, after establishing the performance efficacy of the enhanced range Pinaka, transferred the technology of the system to the industry. The industry partner has manufactured enhanced Pinaka Mk-1 rockets with DRDO’s handholding. Rockets developed by the industry have undergone performance evaluation and quality certification,” the ministry said in another statement. While Pinaka Mk-1 rockets have a range of 36 km, the ER variant can hit targets more than 48 away and has been developed as per requirements of the Indian Army. The tests were conducted over the last three days. “In these trials, as many as 24 rockets were fired for different ranges and warhead capabilities to meet the objectives of accuracy and consistency. With this, the initial phase of technology absorption of Pinaka-ER by the industry partner has been successfully completed, making the partner ready for series production of the rocket system,” the statement added.

The killings were described by both the Union government and Army as a case of ‘mistaken identity,’ as they apologised and expressed regret for it.This, however, has failed to cut ice with protestors, with protests taking place across the region seeking an immediate scrapping of AFSPA. At least two chief ministers, Neiphiu Rio of Nagaland and Conrad Sangma of Meghalaya, have publicly demanded its withdrawal.Also Read | Nagaland resolution seeks repeal of AFSPAThe Nagaland government, last Tuesday, decided to write to the central government to repeal AFSPA.

11-12-2021||India||Tiger spotted in north Bengal’s Buxa Tiger Reserve after two decades||A tiger was spotted at the Buxa Tiger Reserve in north Bengal after almost two decades, forest officials in West Bengal said. “We found a few pugmarks on the sand along the river inside the tiger reserve over the last two to three weeks. From the pugmarks it appeared that the animal was staying in the reserve. Thereafter, we set up camera traps. In the early hours of Saturday, one of the camera traps captured the photo of the tiger. It is a full-grown male,” said Debal Roy, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal. Officials said that though they could find scats and pugmarks of tigers in the tiger reserve in the early 2000, the last photographic evidence dates back to the late Nineties. “We are very happy. We were certain that there were tigers but there was no photographic evidence and hence many people claimed that tigers have vanished from the tiger reserve. Already two of our teams are camping in the area. On Monday a team from Kolkata will visit the spot,” said Jyotipriyo Mullick, state forest minister. Officials said that sometimes tigers come to the Buxa Tiger Reserve located in the foothills of the Himalayas from Bhutan and Assam. But this one seems to be residing in the area and not in transit. “We could spot tigers in the day light even in the early 90s. But as human interference increased, particularly in those areas where prey was found, the tiger population declined. Sometimes tigers used to crossover from Bhutan but they avoided the plains because of human interference. Buxa has a low-density habitat. We need to bring down human interference to bring them back,” said Pradeep Vyas, former chief wildlife warden of the state. Officials said that there are at least 11 villages in the tiger reserve. The state government is planning to rehabilitate them with the help from the Centre. “Plans are also afoot to bring in at least 20 tigers, including 14 females, from Assam and release them in Buxa,” said Mullick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-spotted-in-north-bengal-s-buxa-tiger-reserve-after-two-decades-101639241802724.html

The minister is in touch with the officer's family, reports said. A day after the crash, the defence minister informed Parliament that Varun Singh was on life support and all efforts were being made to give him the best possible treatment.According to the Indian Air Force, the condition of Group Captain Varun Singh continues to be critical but stable, while his father said it is difficult to define the condition as there are too many fluctuations."There is so much fluctuation that how (my son is) cannot be defined. In the hourly monitoring, there are rises and falls. You cannot say. Everyone is discussing. We are in the best hands. He is in the best hands, rather," his father told PTI.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai visited the Command hospital in Bengaluru on Friday and said his body has been majorly affected by burn injuries and doctors are treating him.On Saturday, the mortal remains of six more soldiers were identified and sent to their hometowns for last rites.

The party would soon start distributing cards for the scheme, she said, adding that these cards carrying unique identification numbers would become operational once the TMC forms a government in Goa. The Mamata Banerjee-led party has announced that it would be contesting all 40 seats in state. "The women from 3.5 lakh households in the state would be covered under the Griha Laxmi scheme as it will also do away with the maximum income ceiling, which is mandated in the current Griha Aadhar scheme of the BJP government in the state," Moitra, who is TMC's Goa in-charge, said. She said that the current scheme of the BJP government in Goa provides only ₹1,500 per month to women and it covers only 1.5 lakh households due to the income ceiling. "The actual implementation of Griha Aadhar scheme requires ₹270 crore annually, but the Goa government has earmarked only ₹140 crore annually because of which many people are not able to get the benefit," the TMC parliamentarian said. The projected expenditure for the TMC's scheme would be six to eight per cent of the total budget of Goa, she said. "Latest studies have revealed that COVID-19 has shrunk the country's economy, which needs to be revived," Moitra added. Earlier, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which will also contest the Goa polls, has also promised that it would increase the remuneration provided to women in the coastal state under the state-sponsored scheme and also promised financial assistance to women not covered under it, if it is voted to power. During his recent visit to the state, AAP's national convener Arvind Kejriwal had said if his party comes to power in Goa, then the existing remuneration of ₹1,500 provided to women under the Griha Aadhar scheme would be increased to ₹2,500, while other women aged 18 and above, who are not covered under the scheme, would be paid ₹1,000 per month. On Friday, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was on a day long visit to Goa, had promised 30 per cent quota in jobs for women in Goa if her party came to power in the state.

The personnel whose bodies have been identified are Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, the pilot of the Mi-17V5 that crashed, Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, the co-pilot, Junior Warrant Officer Rana Pratap Das, Junior Warrant Officer Arakkal Pradeep, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja --- their mortal remains were flown to Agra, Pilani, Bhubaneswar, Sulur, Gaggal and Bengaluru, respectively. Four families are still waiting for the mortal remains of their loved ones to be identified. These soldiers are Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh and Naik Jitendra Kumar. The 13 people killed in the crash included India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat and the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder. Lieutenant Colonel Singh, one of the four soldiers whose body is yet to be identified, was Rawat’s staff officer. Rawat, his wife and Lidder were on Friday cremated with military honours at Brar Square in Delhi Cantt in two separate solemn ceremonies steeped in military tradition, with top government officials attending the heart-wrenching final send-off and thousands of men, women and children lining the road leading to the crematorium to pay their last respects. While Kritika and Tarini lit the funeral pyre of their parents, Bipin and Madhulika, 16-year-old Aashna performed the last rites of her father Lakhbinder Singh Lidder in ceremonies filled with emotion, honour and pride. The schedule for the last rites of the remaining four soldiers will be finalised after the “process for positive identification of their mortal remains,” is completed, the officials said. The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, is still on life support at the IAF Command Hospital in Bengaluru. A top three-star officer is heading the inquiry into the crash. Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers there. The Mi-17V5 helicopter took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48 am on Wednesday, and it was scheduled to land at the helipad at the Wellington golf club at 12.15 pm. The air traffic control at Sulur, however, lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08 pm, 20 minutes after it took off. The chopper was seven minutes away from its destination. The Coonoor crash was of one of the worst air accidents involving India’s top military brass and a setback to the ongoing military reforms in the country, the biggest since Independence. Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. The CDS’s shocking demise will have implications for the military reforms, including theaterisation, and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane is the senior-most military officer in the country after the CDS’s demise. Rawat survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur on February 3, 2015. He was a lieutenant general at that time.

Sadhu had criticised Tejashwi Yadav for marrying Rachel Godinho, a Christian. Accusing Tejashwi of doublespeak, Sadhu said that the RJD leader should seek votes from the Christian community in Kerala and Chandigarh."Tejashwi wants the vote of Yadavs in the election but has married a Christian. He should now go to Chandigarh and Kerala and seek votes from the Christian community. There is nothing left for him in Bihar," said Sadhu Yadav.The disapproving remarks and apparent objection over marrying a Christian girl didn’t go well with Tejashwi’s siblings who targeted Sadhu on social media, calling him a murderer and “Kansa mama”, a villainous figure in Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. Tej Pratap shared the images of Sadhu’s effigy being burnt by Chhatra Janshakti Parishad, RJD’s student wing, and dared his uncle to stand straight in front of him.हत्यारे साधु यादव का पुतला दहन छात्र जनशक्ति परिषद द्वारा किया गया।हमारी माँ-बहनों की इज़्ज़त को सरेआम बेइज़्ज़त करने वाले उस “कंस” को मेरा खुला निमंत्रण है कि अगर अपनी माँ का दुध पिया है तो मैदान में आके करले दो-दो हाथ।या अगर औकात है तो सामने में सीधा खड़ा होकर हीं दिखा दें! pic.twitter.com/5tzlbxd9uWIn another tweet apparently aimed at Sadhu Yadav, Tej Pratap said in Bhojpuri that the “elderly" should stay within his limits.रुकऽअ हम आऽवतानी बिहार तऽ गर्दा उड़ाऽव तानी तोहार..!बुढ़-बुजुर्ग बाड़ऽअ, तनिक औक़ात में रहल सिखऽ। पाजामा से बाहर आऽवल के कौनो ज़रूरत नईखे..!Tejashwi’s sister Rohini Acharya, who lives in Singapore, said Sadhu has proved that ‘Kansa’ still exists in this society.कंस आज भी समाज में मौजूद हैइन्होंने साबित कर दिया.रिश्ता निभाना है तो कृष्ण बनो दुष्ट कंस के जैसा अन्यायी ना बनो.. https://t.co/v2qjP7csYmFollowing the tweets, Sadhu said Tejashwi is free to marry whoever he wants but there’ll be serious repercussions if Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, both former Bihar chief ministers, “don’t control their children.”“These people have been mentally torturing me for 10-12 years. You (Tejashwi) are free to marry whoever you want, I've no objection... There'll be serious repercussions if Lalu Ji or Behan Ji don't control their children," the Bihar politician told news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tej-pratap-calls-uncle-sadhu-yadav-murderer-after-his-remarks-on-tejashwi-s-marriage-101639235107747.html

The Tangail airdrop is the biggest airborne operation ever mounted by Indian paratroopers. The army and the air force dedicated the parachute jump at Agra to India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the 12 other braves killed in the horrific Mi-17V5 crash near Coonoor on December 8. Central Army commander Lieutenant General Yogendra Dimri led the mass jump involving 120 elite paratroopers and four veterans who took part in the 1971 India-Pakistan war. “General Rawat envisioned jointmanship amongst the services to touch the highest standards of integration and execution. The parachute jump was marked by precise coordination between the army and air force in the best spirit of jointmanship,” the Indian Army said in a statement. Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat and the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder were on Friday cremated with military honours at Brar Square in Delhi Cantt in two separate solemn ceremonies steeped in military tradition, with top government officials attending the heart-wrenching final send-off and thousands of men, women and children lining the road leading to the crematorium to pay their last respects and raising slogans of glory for the departed The aim of the Tangail operation was to capture the Poongli Bridge on Jamalpur-Tangail-Dhaka road and the ferry site on Louhajang River to intercept Pakistan army’s 93 Brigade that was retreating from the north to defend Dhaka, the officials said. Around 750 men of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were involved in the successful mission. The paratroopers defeated a force that was three times numerically superior and shattered the will of the Pakistani army to defend Dhaka. Several veterans who took part in the Tangail airdrop and the subsequent operations in Bangladesh witnessed the commemoration of the landmark event at Agra. Lieutenant General Nirbhay Sharma, who was the adjutant of 2 Para during the 1971 war, was among those present. The veterans who took part in the mass jump were Lieutenant General RR Goswami, Major General Shiv Jaswal, Colonel Thomas Kochappan and Colonel Pramod Tembe. The Shatrujeet airborne brigade, consisting of the army’s finest paratroopers and based at Agra, was the centrepiece of high-altitude combat manoeuvres carried out by the army and the air force in the Ladakh sector in early November. The airborne drills in eastern Ladakh aimed to validate and showcase the Indian military’s rapid response capabilities, including inter-theatre movement of troops and equipment, precision stand-off drops, rapid grouping and ability to capture designated targets with speed and surprise at a time when India and China are locked in a standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector. Other elements of the exercise include integrated battle drills by airborne forces, mechanised columns and attack helicopters.

11-12-2021||India||Punctuality of trains reaches 93% from 75% reported in pre covid period||Indian Railways has improved its punctuality as a result of which passengers have been able to reach their destination on time. According to statistics from the ministry, 93.29% of the trains have been punctual from April 2021 to November 16, 2021. This is in contrast to the period between April to November 2019 when only 75.67% of trains used to run on time. This, according to officials, could be due to rigorous maintenance work during the complete lockdown last year. Officials also say that to maintain these coaches, they have increased their maintenance time for better performances. As per the official data, 68.19% of trains were punctual from April-November 2018, which improved to 75.67% during the same period in 2019 (pre covid). Explaining the reason for improved punctuality, a senior ministry official said, “Realising that not being able to dedicate required time for maintenance was one of the crucial reasons for poor punctuality rate, we decided to utilise the lockdown days to the fullest. Moreover, we also worked on the train table in a way that the trains are now able to get more time for their maintenance.” According to data sourced from the ministry, some of the trains that have improved their running status include, 20801- Magadh Express (Islampur- New Delhi) that has improved its running status by 11%, 12393/94- Sampoorn Kranti Sup Express from Rajendra Nagar (Patna) to New Delhi and return, improved by 5%, punctuality of Lichchavi Express (train number:14005/06)- Sitamarhi to Anand Vihar (Delhi) improved by about by 7-8%, Kolkata Rajdhani that runs from Howrah to New Delhi and return (train number: 12301/02), has improved by around 7% and Bihar S Kranti that runs from Darbhanga to New Delhi and return (train 12565/66) has improved its running status by around 8%. The ministry spokesperson said, “99% of trains have resumed operations. Around 1750 Mail/Express trains are running as of November 16. The average pre covid was 1768 Mail/ Express trains.” “Average maintenance time of a train has been improved. If we had one hour dedicated for a train’s maintenance, then today we have allocated three hours. This has been done to give more time (than before) towards maintenance,” a ministry official explained.However, a former member of transport said, “Improvement in train running status is a result of the number of trains on busy routes being lesser (than earlier) due to the pandemic, that led to restricted train movements. Due to this, the cascading effect of any failure would have been the minimum leading to increased punctuality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punctuality-of-trains-reaches-93-from-75-reported-in-pre-covid-period-101639225424463.html

The Rajya Sabha member, known for his sharp remark against opposition and critics, said the NCP chief had also warned that the "regressive" policies of the BJP would take the country in a backward direction but the Shiv Sena took a “long time to realise” it.“Some 25 years ago, Sharad Pawar had said that BJP did not want unity in the country. Its methods are divisive. We realised this two years back. He had also said that BJP's policies were regressive which would take the country back. However, we took a long time to realise it,” news agency PTI quoted Raut as saying.The Sena MP was speaking at a book launch where a collection of Sharad Pawar's speeches in Marathi at various political rallies was released. Referring to the book’s title ‘Nemkechi Bolane’, Raut said the book should be gifted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he “needs to know certain things”. ‘Nemkechi Bolane’ roughly translates to speaking with brevity.“The name of the book is so good that we all should gift it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He needs to know certain things,” he said, as quoted by PTI.Why is the Sena expressing solidarity with the Congress?The Rajya Sabha member said the Central Hall of the Parliament used to be known for meetings and discussions among leaders across political parties and journalists but this has changed in the last few years.“We have seen that those who try to raise questions are being opposed and muzzled,” he alleged,” Raut noted.Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray’s son and political heir Uddhav Thackeray severed ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party after the Maharashtra Assembly elections in 2019 over power-sharing formula. He formed the government with NCP and Congress after weeks of high-voltage drama and became Maharashtra’s chief minister.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-flagged-bjp-s-divisive-methods-25-years-ago-shiv-sena-realised-truth-in-2019-sanjay-raut-101639222745150.html

Dhankar was referring to Banerjee's recent order where she asked the West Bengal police to not allow BSF soldiers outside the BSF’s jurisdiction of 15km.Mamata Banerjee is among those chief ministers who opposed the Centre’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) to 50 km from the prior limit of 15 km in the states which share borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Centre has also given the paramilitary force power to conduct searches, arrest suspects and make seizures.“BSF is working for the country's safety. Regarding the jurisdiction, it was decided that they will operate in a range of 50 km. Then why does the CM talk about a 15 km range and create problems between the local police and BSF?” Dhankhar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Mamata earlier on December 9 issued this directive to the state police asking them to not allow BSF personnel to enter the villages which are outside its jurisdiction without permission.“In a state having international borders with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, the BSF and Central Armed Police Forces play a significantly well-defined and crucial role from the perspective of national security and containing criminal illegal activities. There is an obvious need to generate bonhomie and not confrontation: cooperation and not combat amongst these agencies and State apparatus,” the Bengal governor further said.He also said that the law and order agencies of the state government and the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) should play their roles and do their duties in a synergic manner to ensure cooperation as well as maintain overall safety and security.The BSF, which earlier was empowered to take action up to 15 kilometre in Punjab, West Bengal, and Assam, is now authorised to extend its jurisdiction up to 50 km without any hurdle or permission from either central or state governments.The jurisdiction of the BSF, however, was cut short by 20 km in Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, and Meghalaya, where its jurisdiction was earlier 80 km. In Gujarat, the BSF's jurisdiction was curtailed from 80 to 50 km. In Rajasthan, the BSF's area of jurisdiction remains the same at 50 km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhankhar-accuses-mamata-of-creating-problems-between-bsf-west-bengal-police-101639219502605.html

The scheme, she said, would be universal and given to all the estimated 3.5 lakh households in Goa amounting to ₹60,000 per year. “The monthly benefit of ₹5,000 will be made available through direct benefit cash transfer. 3.51 lakh households will be covered under the scheme. This is going to be universal coverage -- you don’t have to belong to any backward caste or community, you don’t have to belong to any economically deprived section. It is going to be for everyone,” she announced. “The ‘Griha Laxmi’ initiative is a pioneering and transformative scheme for the people of Goa. The scheme has already been implemented in West Bengal,” she added. Explaining the rationale behind the announcement, Moitra said that the need of the hour was to ensure that there was money in people’s hands especially after the twin disasters of demonetization and the Covid-19 lockdown which ensured that people had no money to spend. “Economists like Abhijit Banerjee have said that the best thing to kickstart the economy and the local economy is to give them more cash in their hands. If a woman gets Rs. 5000 in her hand, she can buy clothes for the children, medicine. That money goes into the economy faster. The multiplier effect is faster. This is not the time when governments should look at inflationary pressure. This is the time they should look at liquidity and pump in money,” Moitra said. “The budgetary allocation for this is going to be between ₹1500 to 2,000 crore which is 6-8% of Goa’s budget,” she added. Goa already has a scheme that was begun by former Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in 2012 called the Griha Aadhar scheme which gives a family ₹1500 per month but is offered only to the economically weaker section of Goan society that is -- the gross income of the husband and wife, taken together should not exceed ₹3-lakh per annum to be eligible for the scheme. Earlier, the Aam Aadmi Party in Goa had promised to hike the existing monthly amount by ₹1,000 from ₹1500 to ₹2,500. The BJP has termed the announcement by the TMC as an election gimmick aimed only at garnering votes. “The original idea belongs to Manohar Parrikar who had brought about the Griha Aadhar Scheme which was basically to empower women and make them independent and that scheme has come a long way. These are nothing but ways to buy votes and not really empower women. This is an election gimmick,” BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar said. “Both AAP and TMC [are] in a competition of who will give more free money as a promise to women. Both know they won’t win a single seat so they can promise whatever they want,” Congress Social Media coordinator Hasiba Amin, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-promises-rs-5-000-per-family-per-month-if-voted-to-power-in-goa-101639221641212.html

According to experts, the spread of the new variant is less concerning than that of Delta as the symptoms are mild. While this is partly because of the nature of this new variant, another reason might be the high rate of seropositivity of Indians, experts have said."India has the advantage of a very high rate of 'seropositivity' of 70, 80 per cent, and in big cities more than 90 per cent people already have antibodies," Rakesh Mishra, former Director of CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) here, told PTI. Even if people get infected by Omicron, it will be very mild and mostly asymptomatic, Mishra said.India's Omicron tally rises to 33: Tracing Covid-19's new variant in various statesA fresh wave of the pandemic may come even without Omicron, Mishra said referring to the fresh waves in Europe. Ruling out the possibility of a surge in hospitalisation, he said wearing the mask, maintaining social distancing and getting vaccinated remain the three major weapons against future waves.New variants are bound to emerge and the general tendency is that newer variants should be milder and more infectious. However, it is possible that an unexpected bad variant may emerge, Mishra said.All Omicron cases in India are mild and there has been no report of Omicron death in India and in any country of the world. The common symptoms are weakness, sore throat etc. Many Omicron patients of India have already recovered and tested negative for Covid.Capital Delhi reported a new Omicron case on Saturday as a Zimbabwe-returnee tested positive. Reports said the patient only complained of weakness.Which states have how many Omicron cases?Maharashtra has 17 Omicron cases, which is the highest in the country, while the second is Rajasthan with nine cases. Gujarat has reported three confirmed Omicron cases. Karnataka and Delhi have two Omicron cases each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-cases-in-india-will-be-mostly-asymptomatic-says-expert-here-s-why-101639220664128.html

Uttar Pradesh is set to witness the next Assembly election early next year.He also shared a tweet soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Saryu Nahar Canal Project and said that while the BJP government believes in completing projects, others prioritise cutting ribbons. In an apparent reference to the ‘saaf dikhta hai’ (clear difference) remark of Modi, Yadav wrote on Twitter in Hindi, “There are basically two types of people in the world -- some who really work and some who take credit for others’ work. And, there is a clear difference between the (previous) SP’s working government and the current ribbon-cutting government. Hence, the BJP is going to be completely removed in the 2022 election.”दुनिया में मूलतः दो तरह के लोग होते हैं कुछ वो जो सच में काम करते हैं और कुछ वो जो दूसरों का काम अपने नाम करते हैं…सपा की काम करनेवाली सरकार में और आज की ‘कैंचीजीवी’ सरकार में ये फ़र्क़ साफ़ है… इसीलिए बाइस के चुनाव में भाजपा पूरी तरह होने वाली साफ़ है।#सपा_का_काम_जनता_के_नाम pic.twitter.com/LZWJdBqULVYadav said that while Samajwadi Party gave laptops to the youth, the BJP baton charged them. “The SP gave Lohia Awaas to the poor and the BJP drove over farmers and killed them in Lakhimpur Kheri. The Samajwadi Party believes in development, whereas they believe in changing names,” he added.He further said the BJP spends more on advertisements than on projects. “The BJP showed dreams that farmers' income will be doubled by 2022, where are the farmers with increased incomes? Huge hoardings are put up that youngsters are getting jobs, where have they givenjobs in UP?” he said.Earlier in the day, ahead of Modi inaugurating Saryu Nahar National Project, Yada said three-fourth of its work was completed by his government."The BJP government in UP took five years to complete the remaining work of Saryu Nahar National Project which was three-fourth completed during the SP government," he wrote on Twitter.He said 2022 will usher in a new era of the SP and the state will sway with "canals of development".(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saaf-dikhta-hai-akhilesh-hits-back-at-pm-modi-over-yogi-govt-s-projects-101639219860715.html

Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of “renting” the development works of other states for its own promotion, the Opposition parties of Tripura targeted the state government for using Kolkata's Sealdah flyover in a poster of a slogan writing competition on Motor Vehicle Driving Regulations."It is a very shameful act by the BJP-led government in Tripura to showcase West Bengal's flyover for highlighting Biplab Kumar Deb government's success. It looks like a rented campaign by the BJP government," news agency PTI quoted Subal Bhowmik, Trinamool’s state steering committee convener, as saying.The CPI(M) claimed the Tripura government had no other option than to use the photograph of a Kolkata flyover to show off its development works.The MyGov Tripura Twitter account deleted the poster amid criticism from the Opposition.The ruling BJP, however, defended the poster, saying it was related to a national-level competition and the party thinks the nation comprises all the states, reported PTI. Blaming the Opposition for showing the “negativity”, Tripura BJP’s chief spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said the poster was aimed at making people aware of “congested roads”."The tweet was in regards to a national-level competition, to show a congested road irrespective of states. It was aimed at making people aware about congested roads. The BJP thinks the nation comprises all the states," Chakraborty said, as quoted by PTI.This is not the first time the BJP-ruled governments have faced criticism for showcasing other states’ work as their own. In September, a UP government advertisement used Kolkata’s Maa Flyover to showcase the development works of the Yogi Adityanath administration. The Union ministry of civil aviation last month tweeted West Bengal’s Durgapur airport as an airport located in Uttarakhand.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-govt-handle-tweets-poster-with-kolkata-flyover-deletes-after-criticism-101639218434553.html
11-12-2021||India||Kerala guv says CM Vijayan should appoint himself as chancellor of universities||Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Saturday wrote to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday expressing his disappointment over alleged political appointments in universities and urging the latter to amend the law and appoint himself as the chancellor.Stating that it was becoming difficult for him as a chancellor to the state’s universities from political interference and erosion of their autonomy, Khan said asked Vijayan to amend the Acts of the Universities that made the governor the chancellor of these institutes of higher education. The governor asked Vijayan to amend the Act and appoint himself in his place."My advice to you is to amend the Acts of the universities and you personally assume the position of the chancellor, so that you can carry out your political objectives without any dependence on the governor. Once the universities come under the direct control of the government, there will be no scope for anybody to make allegations of political interference," Khan wrote in his four-page letter."You can ask the advocate general to prepare a legal document through which the governor can transfer the powers of the chancellor to the chief minister. I am confident it should not be difficult for the advocate general to find a legal method to do so," he added.The Governor is reportedly unhappy about a number of latest developments in some of the state’s universities, including the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor professor Gopinath Ravindran."I wish to make it clear that in the matter of Kannur University, I did something against my better judgment but I do not wish to do such things any more And at the same time, I do not wish to pursue a course of conflict with my own government," the Governor said."I fully realised that what I was being asked to do was not consistent with rules and was contrary to law but I had no intention to start any dispute with the state government. In order to avoid the controversy, I signed the order but I have been feeling extremely uncomfortable after that," he added."The existing scene today is that the authorities of the universities are packed with political nominees and non-academics are taking academic decisions," the governor further said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-guv-says-cm-vijayan-should-appoint-himself-as-chancellor-of-varsities-101639216359092.html

Yours. Isn't it? Your money should have been better utilised. Those who misused it, would you not punish them?” he asked a gathering after opening the canal that is expected to provide assured water for irrigation to over 14 lakh hectares of land and benefit about 29 lakh farmers, mainly in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The project that involves interlinking of five rivers -- Ghaghara, Saryu, Rapti, Banganga and Rohini -- has been completed at a cost of over ₹9,800 crore, of which more than ₹4,600 crore was provisioned in the last four years, the government said.The PM said that while some people prioritise laying the foundations of projects, for his government, it is about completing them. “When I left Delhi, I was waiting for someone to says ‘we had started this project'. There are some who are used to saying this. Maybe, they had cut the ribbon for the project in their childhood. For some priority is to lay the foundation, for us, it is completing them,” he added.“Work that was not done in 50 years was completed in five years.

In a video released on social media, the filmmakers said, "I am not a Muslim from today onwards. I am an Indian.""Today, I am throwing away an attire I received by birth," the filmmaker-turned-politician said.Reports said Ali Akbar will now become Ramasimhan, the new Hindu identity that he has chosen for himself. He also said that he would not force his two daughters to convert as it will be their personal choice. That no religious leader called out the social media "jubilations" over Bipin Rawat's death has hurt him, he said. Watch | General Bipin Rawat’s chopper caught on camera minutes before the crash.

The Saryu Nahar National Project began in 1978, but the work was delayed due to what officials said was a lack of continuity of budgetary support, interdepartmental coordination, and adequate monitoring.Two years after Prime Minister Modi came to power at the Centre, the project was brought under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana in 2016 with the target to complete it in a time-bound manner. According to the Prime Minister, the project which remained incomplete for four decades was then finished in only four years.The Prime Minister arrived in Balrampur at around 1pm on Saturday and took the stage along with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and other senior officials and politicians.In photos shared by the ANI news agency, Modi could be seen reviewing the project's model ahead of the inauguration.PM Narendra Modi reviews the Saryu Nahar National Project that he will inaugurate in Balrampur shortly. pic.twitter.com/gbAtWpM0xUWelcoming the Prime Minister, Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat highlighted that the 6,623-kilometre-long canal system will provide assured water for irrigation of over 14 lakh hectares of land to the benefit of about 29 lakh farmers of nine districts in the region – Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, and Maharajganj.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath commended PM Modi for clearing the project that was stuck for nearly four decades.“This project was sanctioned the same year I was born,” the chief minister said. “Yet, this scheme got wings when Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived. He has cleared more than 100 such schemes across the country that were stuck in the pipeline.”Salient features of the Saryu Nahar National Project:• Five rivers—Ghaghara, Saryu, Rapti, Banganga, and Rohini—has been interlinked under the project to ensure optimum usage of water resources of the region.• The sub canals with a length of 6,600km have been linked to the 318km main canal.• The project will help irrigate over 14 lakh hectares of land and benefit about 29 lakh farmers of more than 6,200 villages.• The canal system is also expected to protect the districts of eastern UP from recurrent floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-boost-to-up-farmers-modi-launches-saryu-nahar-canal-in-balrampur-101639207715323.html

11-12-2021||India||Experts advise taking safe course in wake of Omicron variant||India must increase the speed of vaccinating its population, roll out booster doses, especially for the immune-compromised, start vaccines for children and ensure that hospitals have enough capacity in wake of the anticipated infections with the Omicron variant, virologist Dr Sahid Jameel said on Friday. He advised people to get vaccinated, mask properly and avoid being in crowded spaces to prevent the risk of infection. “The government should also bring down the gap between the two doses of Covishield vaccine to 12 weeks. This will not compromise the efficacy of the vaccine,” said Dr Jameel at a webinar organised by Ashoka University, Delhi, to discuss the new Omicron variant. “We no longer have any paucity of vaccine doses, so let’s reduce this gap,” he said. Dr Jameel is a director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. He is also the former head of the advisory group to the Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).India currently mandates a time gap of 12 to 16 weeks between two doses of Covishield developed by Astra-Zeneca and Oxford University. When the nationwide vaccination drive began in January, the government had mandated a four-to-six-week gap for the vaccine. In March, it was extended to six to eight weeks as evidence suggested better protection within this time interval. The Centre further extended the time gap to 12 to 16 weeks in May. “It’s 12 to 16 weeks but most people are getting appointments only after 16 weeks. It should be made 12 weeks,” said Dr Jameel emphasising the need to prep health systems to face the anticipated surge in cases. He said that some early results have shown that vaccinated people drop their ability to neutralise the omicron variant by about 40 times.“Unpublished reports from South Africa on Astra Zeneca vaccine, similar to India’s Covishield, also show a 40% drop in neutralising titers. I expect the same to happen in India, which essentially means that a lot more Indians are going to get re-infections. But then, they will not get a severe disease,” he said adding, “Looking at that scenario, we must create hospital capacity in advance. If a very large number of people get re-infections, then some of them will show up in hospitals. This should be a caution to various state health departments to be ready.” According to Dr Jameel, India must start drafting the details on the booster policy, who will get the boosters first, which boosters should be given, the time limit among other things. “There is no need to shut down schools or implement lockdowns,” he said. Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University who also spoke at the webinar said that the Omicron variant is worrisome going by the hypothesis over its origin and the early data on its transmissibility and infectious nature. “We will see some impact in the months to come, but it’s hard to say what that impact will be. We should be careful, we should do surveillance, we should do genome sequencing and we should be watchful for cases in the coming days,” he said. Overall, the Omicron variant has been detected in 32 cases in the country, In India, seven cases have been detected in Maharashtra and two in Gujarat on Friday. The tally across states stands at 17 in Maharashtra, nine in Rajasthan, three in Gujarat, two in Karnataka, and one in Delhi. The Omicron variant, first reported in southern African countries last month, is thought to be at least four times as transmissible as the Delta variant, according to preliminary studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-advise-taking-safe-course-in-wake-of-omicron-variant-101639205621409.html

Here's what central expert panel said||Amid growing concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in India, an expert panel of the country's central drug authority told the Serum Institute of India (SII) on Friday that before a potential booster dose of the Covishield vaccine can be authorised, the Pune-based firm will need to submit local clinical trial data before the authority, along with a proposal and justification for the approval.According to officials familiar with the development, cited by the PTI news agency, the subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) reviewed SII's application for Covishield as booster dose and after “detailed deliberation”, recommended the company must submit local clinical trial data and the justification for additional jabs.Also Read | After favouring booster dose for 40+, INSACOG says ‘more experiments required’The Pune-based SII on December 1 requested the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to authorise Covishield as a booster dose, citing the emergence of new coronavirus variants in the country and an adequate stock of vaccines to tackle that growing concern.Prakash Kumar Singh, the director of government and regulatory affairs at SII, also referred to the UK's medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency giving a go-ahead to the booster doses of the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.Developed in the United Kingdom by the University of Oxford and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is sold here by the Serum Institute under the brand name Covishield.The SII official, while submitting his plea to the central authority, is said to have cited the fact that many countries have already started administering booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines, indicating that maybe it is time India, too, did the same."You are aware that now there is no shortage of Covishield in our country and the demand for a booster dose is increasing day by day from the people who have already taken two doses in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and emergence of new strains," Singh was quoted as saying.Notably, it is not just the SII that is pushing for the approval of a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.

The UP Gate protest site, on the other hand, will be completely cleared by December 15, according to farmers.To avoid chaos, the farmers have decided to not leave all at once on Saturday morning and some of them will stay back and wait for more vehicles to arrive. “The larger tents will take a day or two to dismantle and we will need at least two trucks to take our belongings back,” a farmer from Punjab's Amritsar told Hindustan Times, adding that a few others from his village have already left for Delhi with tractors and trolleys.“The extra day was for us to pack our belongings, dismantle tents and prepare. The end goal is to reach Golden Temple on December 13,” a farmer leader said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh, were protesting at various Delhi borders from late November 2020, seeking repeal of the three farm laws.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that his government would repeal the contentious laws, and subsequently, Parliament passed a bill on November 29 to repeal them.The SKM, a conglomeration of over 40 farmers' unions and the face of the protest, called off the movement across the country on Thursday, following a final letter from the central government accepting all the remaining demands of the peasants.The letter, signed by Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal, promised to take back all pending cases against agitating farmers, include SKM leaders in the panel to deal with minimum support prices (MSP) for produce, and consult the union before introducing an energy regulation bill in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-to-mark-vijay-diwas-today-at-protest-sites-before-leaving-for-home-101639184061164.html
11-12-2021||India||Modi to launch Saryu canal project today, lakhs of farmers in east UP to benefit||In a move to woo farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Saturday visit the poll-bound state's Balrampur district and inaugurate the Saryu Nahar National Project.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) release, the 6,623-kilometer-long canal system will provide assured water for irrigation of over 14 lakh hectares of land to the benefit of about 29 lakh farmers of nine districts in the region – Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, and Maharajganj.Also Read | Yogi reviews preparations for Saryu canal project inauguration by PM ModiProject incomplete for 4 decades, finished in 4 yearsThe PMO said although work on the project began in 1978, it was delayed due to lack of continuity of budgetary support, interdepartmental coordination, and adequate monitoring and was not completed even after more than four decades.The project was only settled after PM Modi’s government took active measures to complete it, said the release, highlighting that of the total ₹9,800-crore cost of the project, more than ₹4,600 crore was provisioned in the last four years.“A project that was incomplete for four decades has been finished in four years,” PM Modi tweeted.What are the salient features of the Saryu Nahar National Project?• The project involves the interlinking of five rivers—Ghaghara, Saryu, Rapti, Banganga, and Rohini—to ensure optimum usage of water resources of the region. The sub canals with a length of 6,600km have been linked to the 318km main canal.• The project will provide assured water for irrigation of over 14 lakh hectares of land and benefit about 29 lakh farmers of more than 6,200 villages, according to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).• The farmers of eastern UP, who were arguably the worst sufferers of the inordinate delay in the canal project, are now expected to benefit from the upgraded irrigation potential and grow crops on a larger scale, maximising the agri-potential of the region.• According to the Uttar Pradesh government, the canal project, in addition to providing a boost to the agriculture sector in eastern Uttar Pradesh, will also be an important milestone in the BJP government’s pledge to double the income of the farmers by 2022.• The canal system is also expected to protect the districts of eastern UP from recurrent floods.When the Prime Minister inaugurates the Saryu Nahar National Project on Saturday at Balrampur in Uttar Pradesh, protesting farmers will be returning to their villages from the Delhi border as a result of the peasants' unions calling off their year-long agitation against the now-repealed farm laws.It shows the farmers’ trust in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, a BJP leader told Hindustan Times, adding that functionaries have been mobilised to make the inauguration programme successful.The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government has also launched a massive campaign on social media, as well as in the rural areas of eastern UP, terming the project a major achievement of the party’s double engine government at the Centre and in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-launch-saryu-canal-project-today-lakhs-of-farmers-in-east-up-to-benefit-101639179875435.html

11-12-2021||India||Border protest sites get busy as farmers prepare to leave city||With farmers set to depart Delhi’s border points after nearly 13 months, activity has picked up at the Singhu and Ghazipur borders, where more trucks and tractor trolleys arrived on Friday.Most farmers will set off for their homes at 9am on Saturday.Farmers said the UP Gate protest site, meanwhile, will be completely cleared by December 15.The trucks that entered the borders were mostly empty, and were later loaded with tents, clothing and food, which sustained langar (community food) services.Farmers said they will not all leave at once on Saturday morning, in order to avoid chaos, and that some will stay back to clear the area. Others, meanwhile, said they have to wait for more tractor trolleys to arrive.“The larger tents will take a day or two to dismantle and we will need at least two trucks to take our belongings back,” says Harpal Singh, from Amritsar, adding that people from his village have already left for Delhi.Bhajan Singh, a member of Prabandak committee at Singhu Border, said farmers were instructed to try and send a majority of their belongings in trucks on Friday itself, with a joint march on tractors and trucks to be carried out on Saturday morning.“The extra day was for us to pack our belongings, dismantle tents and prepare for Saturday. While a majority of us will be able to leave, it may take another day or two to completely clean up the area,” he said.“Not all of us will leave together either as this may create chaos, but trucks will leave at regular intervals. The end-goal is to reach Golden Temple on December 13,” he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that his government would abandon the contentious laws and Parliament repealed them on November 29.The SKM signed off on a final letter from the Centre on Thursday that contained key steps forward.“Most of our belongings have been packed and only a handful of the larger tents have been kept intact so that people can sleep the night there. The food, which was in several hundred kilos has also now been loaded in trucks,” said Kultar Singh from Sirhind in Punjab.“We have started packing up our stuff and are happy that we will soon be reunited with our families. The agitation was a success only because it was a collective effort — several of our brothers lost their lives during the course of the agitation,” said Puran Singh, a farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh at the UP Gate protest site.

This is the second conviction in the riots case.Pathan allegedly aimed a pistol at Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya with an intention to kill him on February 24, 2020, according to the police.After the photographs of this incident went viral, Pathan absconded and was nabbed from Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh on March 3, 2020.Police claimed that Pathan took shelter at convict Kaleem Ahmed’s house in Shamli which, they said, is corroborated by their mobile phone locations.On December 7, additional session judge Amitabh Rawat convicted Kaleem Ahmed, the same day when it framed charges against Pathan.On that day, the court charged Pathan and three others under sections pertaining to attempt to murder, rioting, assault, rioting, unlawful assembly, obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act.Additionally, the court also framed charges against Ahmed for harbouring an offender who has escaped from custody or whose apprehension has been ordered (section 216 IPC).The maximum punishment under this Section entails a jail term of up to seven years and a fine.The judge will hear the arguments on the point of sentencing him on December 16.Communal clashes had broken out in north-east Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-convicted-of-harbouring-pathan-who-aimed-gun-at-a-cop-during-riots-101639173339686.html
11-12-2021||India||Jagannath temple servitor arrested on charges of sodomising 16-year-old||Bhubaneswar: A senior servitor of the 12th century Jagannath temple in Puri town was arrested on Friday on charges of sodomising a teenager within the temple premises, a senior police officer said.Police officers in Puri said servitor Laxmi Narayan Khuntia was arrested under sections 294, 377 and 506 of Indian Penal Code and section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act after the boy’s father alleged that the minor was sodomised at Bhuvaneswari temple in the Jagannath temple premises 2 months ago. “The servitor has been arrested and the probe is on to collect more relevant information in connection with the case,” said Puri superintendent of police Kanwar Vishal Singh. The accused works as a servitor in Laxmi temple.The boy’s father said Khuntia took my son to Bhubaneswari temple two months ago where he first sodomised him. “He then used to take him to isolated corners behind the Laxmi temple and sexually assaulted him for several days. My son finally could not take it any longer and told me about his ordeal on Thursday evening,” the teenager’s father said in his complaint.He said the boy did not complain earlier because he had been threatened by the accused, and he has lodged formal complaints with the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) and the association of servitors as well.On October 9, police arrested Sangram Dash, priest of a subsidiary shrine in the Jagannath temple, for allegedly molesting a minor girl inside the shrine.There are over 6,000 sevitors at the Jagannath temple who perform at least 119 daily rituals, starting from 5am. The last of these rituals is at midnight which involves preparing the bed and bedsheets for the deities.Last month, Odisha kicked off the ambitious Shree Mandira Parikrama Project to develop areas around the Jagannath temple with an expected expenditure of ₹800 crore.The temple surroundings are being developed for the first time after Ganga dynasty kings built the temple to house the deities of Lord Jagannath and his siblings. The project is expected to be completed in 18 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagannath-temple-servitor-arrested-on-charges-of-sodomising-16yearold-101639168767620.html

So we are taking forward the identification process keeping in mind the sensitivities involved," said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coonoor-chopper-crash-bodies-of-remaining-10-armed-forces-being-identified-101639161761560.html
11-12-2021||India||Kandhamal village’s dying hope of justice in police’s ‘mistaken identity’ killing||KANDHAMAL: More than five years after a bullet hit her 13-month-old son in his tiny stomach, Sunita Digal says she can’t forget the sound of gunfire as she cradled her baby on the night of July 8. She was also hit as she picked her baby and ran for safety. As she placed his lifeless body on the cot, she knew it was too late but hoped he could be revived. It took her a bit to get a hold of the situation. Then, the 27-year-old mother says, “my world came crashing down”.“As I looked at my dead child, I could not breathe,” she said, sitting outside the hut where she last held her son in July 2016. Sunita Digal said the memories come hurtling back when she hears of the tragedies like the Army firing in Nagaland’s Mon district that led to the death of 13 civilians and a soldier.On December 4 evening, when villagers of Mon district were returning home from work at a coal mine in a pick-up truck, they were fired at and killed by Indian Army soldiers who believed they were terrorists. The army and the government have regretted the firing calling it a case of “mistaken identity”.In Kandhamal’s Gumudumaha village, a habitation of 60 tribal and Dalit families deep inside the forest, another similar story played out on the night of July 8 five years ago when 16 tribals and Dalits carrying rice and other items squeezed themselves into an autorickshaw from nearby town of Baliguda to get back home. But their auto got stuck in the slush on the road next to their village. The passengers got out so that they could push the vehicle. The gunfire started moments later.Commandos of Action Team No 58 of Special Operations Group, Odisha’s elite anti-Maoist force, apparently thought they were Maoists and opened fire. Though the police later said the villagers were not Maoists, they claimed that the villagers were caught in the crossfire with a group of Maoists hiding nearby.Five died. Sunita Digal’s son, Jehad, was the youngest. Kukala Digal (50), a former sarpanch of Parampanga gram panchayat, Binguli Mallick (45), Kimari Mallick (40) and Midiali Mallick (45) lost their lives while seven others sustained serious injuries.The next of kin of the deceased received ₹9 lakh and jobs as peons in local government schools while the injured received compensation of ₹50,000 each.The government also promised to build them a real road; the one that doesn’t get washed away in the seasonal rains. Work to build the 12km stretch from the highway to the village was started under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana but it still hasn’t been completed. The village got an electricity connection and an overhead water tank with 10,000-litre capacity. “But the power supply is erratic and the overhead water tank too does not get filled up due to low voltage issues,” said Bibi Mallick, whose wife Kimuri died in the firing.Families of the people who were killed in the incident said it is the lack of any effort to bring the guilty to justice that still rankles them the most.The Naveen Patnaik government did set up a judicial inquiry headed by the then Kandhamal district judge Mohammed Ajmal to probe the circumstances of the police firing. A special investigation team (SIT) was also formed with a superintendent of police (SP) ranked officer of the police’s Human Rights Protection Cell taking up the investigation on the basis of the FIR lodged by sergeant Nilakantha Kanhar, the officer leading the group of commandos that fired at the tribals. The government also announced a magisterial inquiry and an inquiry by the Revenue Divisional Commissioner, the reports of both have not been made public.The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, which did a quick probe into the incident, said “prima facie, it appears that firing by the police was resorted to without sufficient cause or provocation” and asked for the judicial and the police probe to be completed within three months to ensure credibility of the inquiry and faith of people in justice.The National Commission for Scheduled Castes recommended cases against police personnel involved in the firing under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The Odisha Human Rights Commission which asked the state government to increase the compensation for the deaths from ₹5 to ₹9 lakh, however, refused to term the killing as “cold-blooded murder” because, it said, a judicial probe was pending.The judicial commission submitted a 104-page report to the home department in March 2018 but it is still a secret document because the government hasn’t placed it in the state assembly. The police probe by the human rights cell hasn’t gotten any further either. It is yet to file its first charge sheet.Sunil Narwane, additional director general of police who oversees the human rights cell, said the probe team is waiting for a copy of the judicial inquiry report from the government.“We have asked for a copy from the home department as we want to see what are the findings in it before we file charge sheet in the trial court,” said Narwane.Mohammed Ajmal, the Kandhamal district judge who retired soon after handing over his report in 2018, could not be contacted. He was appointed judicial member of the National Company Law Tribunal in 2019.Odisha home secretary Sanjeev Chopra did not respond to calls and text messages on the status of the judicial inquiry report.Sunita’s husband, Luta, wonders if they will ever get justice.“If anyone commits a crime, they are promptly arrested and punished. But in our village, 5 were killed and 7 were injured, but no one has been punished. The government made a fool of us in the last 5 years,” the 32-year-old said wondering “what kind of justice is this”.Luta and his wife Sunita also joined the protest last year outside the district collector’s office to demand that the judicial inquiry commission’s report be made public. “If the government does not want to tell us why the police fired on us why are they announcing inquiries,” Sunita asked.Human rights activist Biswapriya Kanungo said it appears increasingly unlikely that the victims of the Kandhamal firing will get justice.“In both the cases, innocents were gunned down. But in the Nagaland firing, the state government lodged cases against the army officials. In the Kandhamal firing, the FIR was registered by the SOG sergeant, who was at fault. The entire premise of the investigation thus would be based on what the SOG jawans said or believed. Besides, the judicial commission report is yet to be made public though such reports should be tabled in the assembly within six months of submission according to the Commission of Inquiry Act. I don’t see people of Gumudumaha ever getting justice,” said Kanungo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kandhamal-village-s-dying-hope-of-justice-in-police-s-mistaken-identity-killing-101639165525768.html
11-12-2021||India||Karnataka high court gives BBMP 3 months to take action against unauthorised buildings||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Friday gave the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) three months’ time to take action against unauthorised buildings in the city. “Despite the work you have done on paper, action should be seen on the ground. You have demolished only three buildings. Our only effort is to sensitise you and make you aware of what is going on in the city. We will give you more time, but action should be seen on the field, not only on paper,” a division bench of chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Sachin Shankar Magadum said on Friday. Earlier, BBMP submitted before the bench that there are 131,745 unauthorised buildings in Bengaluru.The court was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) it had initiated in 2019 after noticing several instances of illegal constructions across Bengaluru.Observing that the BBMP has not taken any concrete step, except conducting a partial survey, in the past two years against illegal constructions, the high court on October 27 had directed the BBMP Commissioner to take concrete actions, including demolition of identified structures by December first week.Noticing from the chart submitted by Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta, indicating that 4,279 buildings have been identified for construction in deviation from sanctioned plan or against the bylaw, the court said that the commissioner’s statement did not indicate survey of buildings constructed sans sanctioned plan.Responding to this order, the BBMP on Thursday informed the court that they have surveyed 131,745 unauthorised buildings in the city. The BBMP commissioner told the court they had issued notices under Section 313 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act to 16,286 building owners, for submitting documents to show that the buildings were not unauthorised constructions and have received replies from 1,712 of them.BBMP’s response stated that the teams surveyed 75,008 buildings in Bommanahalli Zone and served notices to 4,779 of them. In Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the civic body surveyed 38,147 buildings and served notices to 1,687. In the West Zone, 10,619 buildings were surveyed and 2,701 were served notices, the civic body said.The BBMP sought three months’ time from the court to complete the process and take action. Taking the submission into consideration, the court set a time frame of three months. “Considering the submission made by the counsel for the BBMP, we grant three months’ time to the BBMP to execute the action taken to plan as prepared by them and file the compliance report on the basis of annexure number 4 and 5 (details of survey and notice). The officer (Chief Commissioner) present will appear again on the next date,” the court said.Meanwhile, the counsel for the BBMP informed that a personal affidavit has been filed, explaining the steps taken to identify unauthorised constructions and the action taken on the issue. The hearing was adjourned to March 15, 2022, while asking Gupta to appear again.Apart from the unauthorised buildings, BBMP has identified 185 old buildings that are at the risk of collapse, but only 10 have been demolished. Even though instructions to demolish these buildings were given in 2019 itself, but no action has been taken. Fresh instructions were issued to demolish these buildings within seven days in October this year after at least three old buildings collapsed. However, the deadline was not met by the BBMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-gives-bbmp-3-months-to-take-action-against-unauthorised-buildings-101639163425183.html

The panel on Empowerment of Women, chaired by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Dr. Heena V Gavit, also noted that out of a total of ₹446.72 crore released during the period 2016- 2019, “a whopping 78.91% was spent only on media advocacy”. The panel recommended that “it is time to focus on other verticals by making ample financial provisions to help achieve measurable outcomes related to education and health envisaged under the scheme”. Addressing reporters here, Gavit acknowledged that the low spending by states did not “an up to the mark performance of the scheme.” “We have recommended that the ministry of women and child development immediately takes up the issue with the states to ensure proper utilisation of funds. The Committee has also said that the nodal ministry must release funds strictly on the basis of actual utilisation of earlier release and after proper scrutiny of expenditure/ utilisation of the previous funds,” Gavit said.The panel will now take up the issue of a number of girl students dropping out of schools amid the pandemic. Sangeeta Kumari Singh Deo, a member of the panel, said, “Our initial estimates suggest that more girl students dropped out of private schools during Ccovid.” “The possible reasons might be that lack of internet facilities hampered education or that parents might be uninterested in paying fees when the schools remained closed. Government schools faced little problem as education is free there. We will study this carefully,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beti-bachao-beti-padhao-states-used-only-25-of-funds-allocated-shows-report-101639163245829.html
11-12-2021||India||Karnataka government issues fresh guidelines for discharge of Omicron patients||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Friday issued new guidelines for the discharge of patients who tested positive for the new variant of coronavirus, Omicron days after two cases of the highly mutated variant were confirmed in the state. According to the new guidelines, patients with mild and moderate symptoms will be discharged after 10 days from the onset of the symptom. However, in both cases the patient must be asymptomatic for the last three consecutive days, should maintain an oxygen saturation level of 95% (without oxygen support) for four consecutive days, two negative RT-PCR test reports 24 hours apart should be presented before getting discharge.These conditions for the discharge of patients have been laid out by the department of health and family welfare in the guidelines issued on Friday.The guidelines added that after discharge, home quarantine is advised for seven more days, with self-monitoring for symptoms and follow-ups from the district surveillance officer. “Home quarantine will end if an RT-PCR test conducted on the sixth day is negative,” the guidelines said.For cases with severe symptoms, including immunocompromised patients, the discharge protocol includes two negative RT-PCR tests (24 hours apart) three days after complete clinical recovery. A series of medical requirements has also been listed out by the health department for the discharge of such patients.The guidelines come after the Bengaluru police registered a case against a South African national on December 3, who tested positive for the Omicron variant of the coronavirus but left the country three days later based on a negative Covid-19 test report, which has now come under suspicion.Meanwhile, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has announced that separate guidelines would be issued for student hostels and Covid clusters as part of the state’s Covid-19 management.“Considering the present positivity rate, there is no need to panic. But still, caution would continue as the committee has advised. Separate Guidelines would be issued for hostels which would include sanitisation, serving of food in staggered batches, maintaining distance, compulsory double dose vaccination for cooking personnel and setting up isolation rooms. Special standard operating procedures would also be released for managing Covid clusters in Bengaluru and other places,” Bommai said on Thursday.He also said that the Covid-19 vaccination drive will also be intensified again. “The precautions and guidelines at border areas of the state would continue. Action has been taken to ensure double dose vaccination and RTPCR test for students from Kerala,” Bommai said, while talking to reporters after attending a cabinet meeting.On imposing night curfew, restrictions on Christmas and New Year celebrations, Bommai said that an appropriate decision would be taken next week after taking stock of the situation.Meanwhile, another Covid-19 cluster has been detected at a nursing college at Bhadravathi town in Shivamogga district, health department officials said on Thursday. A total of 24 nursing students tested positive for Covid-19 in the Nirmala Nursing College and Shivamogga deputy commissioner KB Shivakumar told the media that the college has been sealed.Recently, students from the nursing college had travelled to Shivamogga city to take an examination. They developed symptoms after returning to the college. After getting tested, they were found positive for Covid-19. Since the college is attached to the nursing home, it has also been sealed and OPD services have been shut down, officials said.The state government has stepped up monitoring of all nursing and medical colleges across the state, especially in Davanagere, Tumakuru, and Dharwad districts, where clusters have been reported, health officials said. However, the state government is not considering a ban on offline classes at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-government-issues-fresh-guidelines-for-discharge-of-omicron-patients-101639163185142.html
11-12-2021||India||Six students of Andhra school drown in Krishna river||Six students of a Vedic school in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district, who went for a swim in Krishna river, drowned on Friday, home minister Mekathoti Sucharita said. Five of the deceased were identified as Harshit Shukla, Subham Trivedi, Anshuman Shukla, Shiv Sharma and Nitesh Kumar Dikshit and the body of the sixth student was yet to be identified. They are said to be from Uttar Pradesh. A statement from the home minister said the students, belonging to Swetha Srungachalam Veda Pathasala at Madipadu village, went for a swim in the river closer to their institution on Friday evening. “However, the students could not gauge the depth of the river at the spot and drowned in the waters. Police, who rushed to the spot on receiving the information, recovered the bodies with help of expert swimmers,” the statement said. Expressing deep shock over the incident, Sucharita said she had spoken to the higher police officials about the mishap and instructed them to take up a comprehensive inquiry to ascertain the reasons.

11-12-2021||India||Over 99% turnout in Karnataka Legislative Council polls||Bengaluru: Over 99% voter turnout was recorded during the biennial election to the Karnataka Legislative Council’s 25 seats on Friday, with the border district of Belagavi recording the highest 99.98% turnout, the office of Chief Electoral Office (CEO), Karnataka said in a statement. The polling began at 8 am on Friday and ended at 4 pm. The results of the polls will be declared on December 14 and it will have a bearing on the power equation in the Upper House of the state legislature.“The polling concluded peacefully,” the office of the CEO said.While Belagavi recorded the highest turnout, Vijayapura district saw the lowest turnout at 99.55%.Elected members of the legislative assembly, members of parliament and other local bodies are eligible to vote in the election for the legislative council. The election was necessitated as the term of 25 incumbent MLCs, including 14 from the Congress, seven from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and four from the Janata Dal (Secular), ends on January 5.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said, “There is an indication that we will taste victory in all the constituencies we are contesting. All efforts are also being made to ensure this.”Bommai cast his vote in his home constituency of Shiggaon in Haveri district on Friday.The poll outcome will have a bearing on the power equation in the 75-member Upper House, with the BJP, JD(S) and the Congress hoping to secure victories to gain control of the Upper House of the legislature. A total of 90 candidates are in the fray for 20 Local Authority’s Constituencies.The elections come at a time when the ruling BJP in the state is facing severe criticism and its government has been accused of various charges, including of corruption and involvement in the alleged Bitcoin scam, in which several prominent political leaders and officials are alleged to have laundered money using cryptocurrencies.Politically too, the polls are crucial for Bommai after losing one of the two seats in the October 30 bypolls for Hanagal and Sindgi assembly constituencies.The defeat in Hanagal, a neighbouring district from Bommai’s home district, had fueled speculation of a growing divide within the saffron outfit and discontentment against the chief minister.The Congress is hoping to capitalise on the discord and dissent within the BJP and prepare the ground for other upcoming polls like zilla and taluka panchayats, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the 2023 state assembly elections.“My vote is for progress, unity and stability. That’s why people are choosing to vote for the Congress Party. Cast my vote for the MLC elections in Kanakapura,” DK Shivakumar, president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said on Friday after casting his vote.He added that the Congress will win seats beyond its expectations and there are indications that the party will win even those constituencies it lost out on in the previous elections.The elections are crucial for all three political parties in the state to gauge the sentiments of their respective grassroots level support, which appeared to be waning over contentious decisions made by their top leaderships.The BJP has openly sought the support of the JD(S) in seats where the regional outfit is not contesting, prompting the Congress to call the two “allies”.The JD(S) has been tactful in denying support, but asking its local leaders to take a decision to support whichever party they choose in their respective districts that would benefit the regional outfit.Bukahalli C Manju, BJP’s candidate in Mandya, on Friday broke down in front of TV reporters, stating that there were people who spread rumours about him and hinted that some members of his own party refused to support him. Mandya is a bastion of the JD(S) and Manju’s allegations indicate that the BJP may have backed the regional outfit in the district to gain its support in other places it is not contesting.“(BS) Yediyurappa has become distraught and has asked for support from JD(S), which means the BJP has lost its strength,” Shivakumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-99-turnout-in-karnataka-legislative-council-polls-101639163009884.html
11-12-2021||India||Parliament: Oppn slams government over announcements at Glasgow climate summit||India’s decision to announce a net zero emissions target by 2070 in the context of the climate crisis facing the planet was debated at length in the Lok Sabha on Friday during a discussion on the outcomes of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26.The debate ranged from why India announced the 2070 goal in Glasgow to whether the country managed to push the case for equity at the climate negotiations. MPs flagged issues such as palm oil cultivation, farm stubble fires, role of tribal people in conserving forests, etc.The debate that started on Wednesday and was deferred on Thursday continued through Friday, going overtime from noon to 4pm, after which it was deferred again. Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav’s response to concerns related to the outcomes at Glasgow was deferred.The minister was asked by Saugata Roy of the All India Trinamool Congress as to what prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce net zero emissions by 2070. Though India seemed against the idea of a net zero emissions target before the Glasgow conference, what pressure led to a volte face by Modi, Roy asked.“We agreed to phasing down of coal but why didn’t we push developed countries to phase out all fossil fuels,” Roy asked. He added that coal-dependent states such as West Bengal will be adversely impacted by the Glasgow decision. Intracountry climate equity will be a challenge for India, he said.Roy said a discussion on loss and damage should be initiated in the Sunderbans, one of the worst affected landscapes by climate change. Referring to books by author Amitav Ghosh, Roy said the Sunderbans area was battered by four cyclones in two years and is facing severe erosion.NK Premachandran of the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Kerala said India deserves appreciation for raising the issue of climate justice in Glasgow but it has not reflected in the operational paragraphs of the Glasgow Pact.“It’s a case of the rich hiding behind the poor. The concept of equity is being diluted globally. Instead of developed and developing countries, a new concept of emerging economies is being introduced which will dilute the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities under the Paris Agreement.”Tapir Gao, BJP MP from Arunachal Pradesh, said that tribal people were an important resource in solving the climate crisis. “Where there are tribals, there are forests,” he said.Agatha Sangma of the National People’s Party, an MP from Meghalaya, said 76% of her state is forests and it acts as a significant carbon sink for India. “The Indo Himalayan region is known for its distinctive biodiversity. It’s significantly different from the rest of the country. We cannot have nature-negative growth,” she said, adding that the government should go ahead with palm oil cultivation in the northeast and Andaman and Nicobar only after detailed consultations with the state governments. Meghalaya has come out with a concept of environment states, which will be environment-first economies, she said.Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal said Punjab because of its agriculture-dominated economy is among the worst impacted by climate change. But every year Punjab’s farmers are blamed for causing air pollution due to stubble burning. “They have been burning stubble for centuries. Our farmers have played a major role in the country’s food security. The green revolution depleted our groundwater, and polluted water. Cancer cases are rising in Punjab,” she said.Yadav said stubble burning is decriminalised under the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Act.Jagdambika Pal of the BJP said the fact that the Lok Sabha was debating climate change and the Glasgow conference was a message to the world on India’s seriousness about the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-opposition-slams-government-over-announcements-at-glasgow-climate-summit-101639162948500.html
11-12-2021||India||Kerala Governor threatens to quit chancellor post over political appointments in varsities||Peeved over alleged interference of the Kerala government in many varsities, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has sent a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, saying he was upset and willing to quit the chancellor’s post. People, who are aware of the development, said Khan has reportedly sent a letter to the CM and state higher educational council on Dec 8 in which he suggested the government “to bring an ordinance to remove him and he will be happy to sign it”. The governor is the chancellor of all universities and Khan recently requested all to make these varsities centres of excellence and avoid too many political appointments and interference. When contacted, people close to the government neither admitted nor denied receiving the letter. The Governor is in Delhi now. What really triggered his protest is the re-appointment of Kannur University vice chancellor Prof Gopinath Raveendran. He was re-appointed for a period of four years again and it was also challenged in the high court. The Save University Campaign Committee, a whistle blower in the higher education sector, had petitioned the governor several times pointing out too many political appointments bypassing other eligible candidates. The recent appointment of the wife of the CM’s political secretary KK Ragesh in Kannur university had kicked up a row.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-governor-threatens-to-quit-chancellor-post-over-political-appointments-in-varsities-101639162946179.html

Of the seven cases, three were detected in Mumbai including one in Dharavi. The remaining four cases are from Pimpri-Chinchwad in Pune district. Of the 17 found so far, six Omicron infected patients in the state have tested negative for Covid-19, and have been discharged, health department officials said.With the new cases in Mumbai, the total number of cases of the Omicron variant rose to five in the city. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the newly infected patients are men of 25, 37 and 48 years of age. The 25-year-old returned to Mumbai from London on December 1, while the 37 and 48-year-old patients returned to Mumbai from South Africa and Tanzania, respectively, on December 4. All three patients are admitted at Seven Hills Hospital in Marol area of Andheri.Dr Mangla Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, said that besides the 25-year-old, the remaining two patients are not residents of Mumbai. “The 25-year-old is a resident of South Mumbai, the 48-year-old is a Chennai resident who had come to Mumbai’s Dharavi for professional work, while the 37-year-old is a resident of Gujarat,” Gomare said.After the reports of the patients came out positive in the RT-PCR tests taken by them on arrival at the airport, the samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), the report of which came on Friday.The BMC also added that the 25 and 37-year-old patients were fully vaccinated, and the 37-year-old has mild symptoms, while the remaining patients are asymptomatic. The 37-year-old was admitted to the hospital by the airport authorities as a precautionary measure while the remaining two patients were hospitalised after their reports turned out to be positive.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner said that the Tanzania returnee who went to Dharavi had to take a compulsory test at the airport as he was not vaccinated. “The patient was asked to wait at the airport till reports came, however, he left for Dharavi in the evening and the RT-PCR report came out to be positive. Following which, the local ward office (G/North) tracked the patient and the sample was sent for genome sequencing,” Dighavkar said. Dharavi, a densely populated slum of at least 850,000 people with a population density of 354,167 per square km, was a hotspot of Covid-19 infections in the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020.BMC officials said that the high-risk contacts of all three patients have been tracked and tested, and none of them have tested positive.According to the health department, the four new cases in Pimpri-Chinchwad are contacts of a Nigerian national (of Indian origin), who was detected with the Omicron strain of the virus on December 5. The 44-year-old-woman, along with her two daughters had come to Pimpri-Chinchwad on November 24 to meet her brother. “Out of seven patients found today, four have been vaccinated. One patient has received a single dose of the vaccine, while one patient has not been vaccinated. One of the patients is a three-and-a-half-year-old so not eligible for vaccination. Four patients are asymptomatic while three patients have mild symptoms,” a statement from the health department said.Since December 1, 61,439 passengers, including 9,678 passengers from at-risk countries, have arrived at airports in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. The state has found 20 Covid-19 positive cases of people from at-risk countries and five from other countries.

11-12-2021||India||Chabahar port more economical, stable route to reach India: Jaishankar||Iran’s Chabahar port has emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region and is a “more economical and stable route” for landlocked countries to reach India and the global market, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday.Jaishankar’s remarks in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha indicated India’s continuing commitment to the port on the Gulf of Oman despite speculation about its viability following the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in mid-August.“The Chabahar port has provided much needed sea-access to landlocked Afghanistan. The port has also emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region. It is a more economical and stable route for landlocked countries of the region to reach India and the global market,” he said in response to a question from Bahujan Samaj Party MP Ritesh Pandey.Pandey posed a supplementary query on the impact of US sanctions and the contention by the Iranian side that the project has been delayed, and Jaishankar replied: “I would like to inform the honourable member that his assertion is completely inaccurate. This agreement was signed in 2016. We took possession of the terminal in 2018. We have already supplied six cranes. The terminal is fully functional.”Jaishankar added that US sanctions on Iran “are not relevant to this project at all”.He further said in his written reply that Chabahar port facilitated the delivery of humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, and India used it to ship 75,000 tonnes of wheat as food assistance to Afghanistan in 2020. A total of 110,000 tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been trans-shipped from India to Afghanistan so far.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Iran in May 2016, a trilateral agreement to establish the International Transport and Transit Corridor (Chabahar Agreement) was signed by India, Iran and Afghanistan. India is participating in developing the first phase of Shahid Beheshti terminal at the port in cooperation with the Iranian government.Jaishankar said India has committed a total grant assistance of $85 million and a credit facility of $150 million for developing Shahid Beheshti terminal.“As part of our commitment towards infrastructure development of Shahid Beheshti terminal, Chabahar port, India has supplied [six] mobile harbour cranes (two 140 tonnes and four 100 tonnes capacity) and other equipment worth $25 million,” Jaishankar said.The Indian company, India Ports Global Limited, through its wholly owned subsidiary, India Ports Global Chabahar Free Zone, took over operations at Chabahar port on December 24, 2018. Since then, it has handled 160 vessels, 14,420 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of cargo and 3.2 million tonnes of bulk and general cargo.The Shahid Beheshti terminal has handled shipments and trans-shipments from countries such as Russia, Brazil, Thailand, Germany, Ukraine, Oman, Romania, Bangladesh, Australia, Kuwait, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates.
11-12-2021||India||Mirzapur web series: HC quashes FIR against Farhan Akhtar, others||The Allahabad high court on Friday quashed an FIR registered against ‘Mirzapur’ web series producers Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani, along with others, for allegedly hurting religious, social and regional sentiments through their portrayal of Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh.On January 17, the UP police registered an FIR against the makers of the “Mirzapur” series under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67-A of the Information Technology Act.Others accused in the case are Karan Anshuman, the director of season one, Gurmeet Singh, the director of season two, Vineet Krishna, the writer of season one, and Puneet Krishna, the writer of season two.On XXXX, Akhtar and Sidhwani approached the high court seeking quashing of the FIR.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Manish Tiwari argued that even if all allegations in the FIR were accepted to be correct, no case was made out against the petitioners. There was no allegation that the web series was produced with any deliberate or malicious intention of outraging the religious and social feelings of the citizens of India or to insult the religious and social feelings of the people of any particular class, the counsel argued.The state counsel, however, submitted that there was a specific allegation that the web series hurt the social and religious feelings of the first informant.After hearing both the parties concerned, a two-judge bench comprising justices M C Tripathi and Subhash Vidyarthi observed: “There is no allegation in the entire F.I.R. that any content shown in the Series portrays any particular religion in a bad light and which can possibly hurt the religious feelings of a class of citizens.”Earlier, on January 29, 2021, the court had stayed their arrest in the case.“Even as per the averments made in the First Information Report, it is the informant alone whose religious, social and regional sentiments have been hurt by the web series and not those of any class of citizens. There is nothing on record to indicate that besides the informant, the religious beliefs of any class of citizens were hurt by the web series Mirzapur and what to say about the same having been done with deliberate and malicious intention,” added the bench.The court further observed, “Upon a specific query being made from the learned counsel for the informant as well as the learned A.G.A appearing for the State, they could not point out any other complaint, First Information Report, resentment or agitation of any form having been made by any class of citizens showing that the web series has outraged their religious feelings.”The bench, while allowing the petition, observed, “The F.I.R. alleges that illicit relations amongst family members has been shown in the Web Series, but there is no allegation in the F.I.R. that “sexually explicit act or conduct” has been shown in the series. It is settled law of interpretation of Statutes that while interpreting any provision of a Statute, neither any word can be added nor can it be ignored. This principle is applicable in a more stringent manner while examining the provisions of a penal law.”“Therefore, no word can be ignored from the phrase “sexually explicit act or conduct” occurring in Section 67 A of the IT Act and if the act or conduct shown in the Series does not contain sexually explicit act and it shows the same only in an implied manner, the same would not attract the provisions of Section 67 A of the IT Act,” observed the bench while quashing the impugned FIR.NEEDS A RESPONSE FROM THE COMPLAINANT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mirzapur-web-series-hc-quashes-fir-against-farhan-akhtar-others-101639162645662.html
11-12-2021||India||Winter session: Legislative agenda may get pruned amid Opposition protests||Parliament will take up the central government’s additional budget or the supplementary demand for grants on Tuesday and a host of other legislation amid speculations that the Centre didn’t have much business left in the winter session.A raft of bills, including the one to repeal the three farm laws, have been passed in Parliament. But with the government holding back a few key bills for the next session, the legislative agenda might get pruned.A top Lok Sabha functionary added that apart from the supplementary demand for grants—the only bill that’s a constitutional requirement in this session-- the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill will be taken up to replace an ordinance.The government has told the farmers that the contentious electricity bill—that proposes to allow private firms to compete with discoms in same territory—has been shelved as per the agreement with the farmer bodies to end their protests. “An amendment to the banking laws is also uncertain in this session and some of the bills mentioned in the initial list of 26 bills for passage in this session are unlikely to come,” said a senior Lok Sabha functionary.The other bills expected in this session are the mediation bill that aims pre-litigation mediation and at the same time safeguards in the interest of the litigants to approach competent adjudicatory forums in case an urgent relief is sought, the National Anti-Doping Bill to give a legislative framework to the National Anti-Doping Agency for meeting the obligations of India and The Chartered Accountants, the Cost and Works Accountants and the Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to reform and speed up the disciplinary mechanism of the institutes.The top Lok Sabha functionary added that a debate on price rise will take place in the Lower House next week. The same topic was slotted for a debate in the Upper House too, but failed to take place due to disruptions.
11-12-2021||India||Construction of resort in Rushikonda draws flak from environmentalists||The ongoing construction of a high-rise resort in Rushikonda Hills, abutting the popular Rushikonda beach on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam city, has kicked up a row with several environmentalists alleging ‘destruction of the area for commercial purposes’. On Friday, former Andhra Pradesh chief secretary L V Subrahmanyam wrote to Raj Bhavan secretary R P Sisodia, seeking the intervention of Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan in the destruction of the hills by the state government in the name of tourism development.Subrahmanyam, who served as chief secretary of the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government between June and November 2019, approached Raj Bhavan after taking note of a series of social media posts on the indiscriminate digging of hills for the construction of the multi-storeyed tourism resort.“How can this (destruction) be allowed to go on? Are we having any concern for conservation? Wish the Governor questions this action. We cannot be silent spectators. An innocent tribal is not allowed this liberty in his habitat where options are few. But here with all options for alternative this marauding of ecology is simply unpardonable. We must halt this at once (sic),” Subrahmanyam said in the letter.Till recently, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) had been running a tourism resort comprising a group of cottages on the Rushikonda hills to allow tourists to enjoy the view of the picturesque beach abutting the hill.However, in February this year, the state government decided to demolish the existing resort and construct a brand new multi-storeyed five-star hotel-cum-resort at the spot at a cost of ₹190 crore. “The new hotel will certainly put the port city of Visakhapatnam on the international tourism map,” state tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao had said earlier. The construction work for the new resort began in August even as several environmentalists, local NGOs and opposition parties condemned the plan. “The entire area is barricaded so that nobody would go near the area to know what is happening inside,” Subrahmanyam said.Retired IAS officer and former Union energy secretary E A S Sarma said the state government had obtained environmental clearance from the Centre for the construction on Rushikonda hill by stating that it was only remodelling the existing resort and as such, there will be no damage to the hill or vegetation. But what is going on there is exactly the contrary, he added. “The construction activity has extensively damaged the otherwise scenic Rushikonda hill terrain, leaving ugly scars and causing extensive denudation of the vegetation there,” Sarma, who has been fighting environmental issues such as industrial pollution in Vizag and illegal mining in forest areas, told HT.Sarma claimed that the ongoing construction at Rushikonda also violated the Master Plan of Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA).“It is also in violation of the Coastal Region Zone (CRZ) regulation, as no high-rise structures should be allowed adjacent to the sea,” the retired bureaucrat said.Senior Telugu Desam Party leader Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said the Jagan government decided to demolish the existing resort and construct a five-star hotel to favour contractors and make money. “Right from the beginning, the government has been bent on demolitions. By projecting Visakhapatnam as the executive capital and taking up such projects, the government is hoping for an increase in the land value,” he said.When contacted, APTDC chairman A Varaprasada Reddy said the multi-storied tourism resort was coming up in two levels on the hills, in place of the earlier small cottages, and no major destruction was taking place. “We have not violated any environmental laws. We shall be restoring the pristine glory of Rushikonda. Once it is completed, it is going to be a major tourism landmark in Visakhapatnam,” Reddy said. 
11-12-2021||India||Political discourse must improve in social media age, says Supreme Court||State force should never be used to browbeat a political opinion, the Supreme Court held while it called for an improvement in the public discourse, especially in the age of social media.Urging the political class to be more tolerant of each other’s opinion while maintaining a temperate language in their critiques, a bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said that the debasement in dialogue has become a chief problem of democracy.“It is undoubtedly the debasement in the dialogue which is taking place which needs introspection from the political class across the country. In a country which prides itself on its diversity, there are bound to be different perceptions and opinions, which would include political opinions. That is the very essence of a democracy,” said the bench, which also included justice MM Sundresh.“No doubt, by the very nature of the job required to be performed by the political class, at times their exchanges may get heated. But it should not explode. We are sure difference in perception can be expressed in better language,” noted the bench in its order, as it lamented the decline in the quality of dialogue in the public arena.The order was passed on Thursday, but released the following day.In it, the bench also urged state governments not to use the State’s powers to intimidate journalists for reporting on something which is already in public domain or is in exercise of their right to free speech and expression.“State force should never be used to either browbeat a political opinion or the journalists suffer the consequences of what is already in the public domain,” held the court.At the same time, the bench added that “this does not take away the responsibility of the journalists in how they report the matter, more so in a Twitter age”.The court’s discontent came through as it quashed four criminal cases registered by the West Bengal Police against editors and journalists of web portal OpIndia. The FIRs were lodged against OpIndia editor Nupur J Sharma, her husband Vaibhav Sharma, portal founder and CEO Rahul Roushan, and the former editor of its Hindi division Ajeet Bharti. The cases invoked charges relating to promoting enmity between religious groups, outraging religious feelings, attempt to provoke breach of peace and defamation.After the state government informed the top court on Thursday that it has decided not to pursue the criminal prosecution in the four cases, the bench proceeded to quash the FIRs.“We are, however, not inclined to let go of the opportunity of saying something which is troubling the society and the court. It is undoubtedly the debasement in the dialogue which is taking place which needs introspection from the political class across the country,” rued the bench.It underlined that the very fact that FIRs were lodged against the journalists for reproducing what the political class has said against each other, and which was already in the public domain, is an indication of degradation in public discourse.“We must appreciate the stand taken by the state government and allay any apprehension of the that it may be perceived in a negative sense in public domain. If at all, the stand is to be appreciated of better late than never and should be a model for others to follow,” stated the court order.During the hearing on Thursday, the bench cited the example of former prime ministers PV Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee to point out that despite belonging to different political parties and opposing each other at several public platforms, both the leaders maintained a mutual respect for each other and always used appropriate language.
11-12-2021||India||NGT stays ring road plan in Auroville amid protests||There is a disorder at tranquil experimental township of Auroville, which lies in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram district, with residents protesting against the Auroville Foundation clearing their building and trees to implement a ring road project called Crown Road. On December 9, Auroville residents stood around a JCB in Darkali forest and began chanting “Om” which they described as a way of bringing calm amid the chaos. The entire community has been shaken up with events in the past week saying they were attacked when they tried to stop JCBs and visuals show that there has been violence. On Friday, they got a temporary relief with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) granting an interim stay on the road project till December 17.The Crown Road project is 4.4 km long for which trees under the definition of “Deemed Forest” and Auroville’s Youth Centre which is near the iconic Matrimandir have to go. The Auroville residents say they aren’t against the project but rather want a consensus to find a way to develop the project without disrupting its environments such as the water paths. Meetings to discuss the Crown Road project have been going on for a few months between the Residents Assembly, which includes all Aurovillians about 3,500 of them, and Auroville Foundation, an autonomous body established in 1988 under the administrative control of the ministry of human resource development.But, the trouble began, Auroville residents say, when they were caught by surprise on the morning of December 4, when a JCB arrived without prior warning and began to clear sections of the forest two days earlier than scheduled. They protested and the JCB went back. “This itself was a shock. In Auroville, we normally resolve contentious issues through dialogue,” said a resident of 18 years who didn’t wish to be identified. But it got worse. In the intervening night of 4-5 December around 1 am there was an unexpected and dramatic midnight bulldozing of the forest next to the Youth Centre, said a statement from the Residents Assembly. “The youth living here were not notified and were shocked at the late night presence of JCB’s next to their house, flanked by 200 police, cordoning off the area and acting with aggression,” the statement said. A foreign resident, who has been in Auroville since its inception, said they were intimidated by police. “They asked if we had valid visas. Threatened to take our passports and some even said go back to your country,” the resident said wishing not to be identified. “Everything that is happening is against the very ideals of Auroville.” The residents say they were beaten, their phones were taken away and children were also rounded up. The following day, on December 6, the government appointed secretariat of the Auroville Foundation gave an ultimatum stating that if residents did not agree before 7am the next morning to dismantle the buildings in the Youth Centre themselves, then it would be done by force, the Residents Assembly statement said. “Feeling pressurised and with violence fresh in people’s hearts, the residents did not have time to call for a community-wide consultation. A small group of Aurovilians had a meeting with the Secretariat and a compromise was drafted.” The residents said they arrived at a painful decision of dismantling the buildings of the Youth Centre by themselves.But on December 9, there was another kerfuffle when the residents tried to stop a JCB near the Youth Centre and locals who are non-Aurovillians can be seen pushing the residents in visuals. “We could tell they weren’t from our surroundings because we have a good relationship with people in villages adjacent to Auroville,” said one of the residents quoted above. They painfully expressed that some of the first Aurovilians watched a 50-year-old tree and their Youth Centre being brought down. A resident, Divya, wrote a scathing letter addressed to the Foundation’s members. “Today I climbed on top of the JCB which was working at the YC, and asked the driver to stop the machine. The driver was scared, he would have stopped. But 20 goondas surrounding the JCB, lifted me off and carried me away. Of course, in the process, I got hurt physically, but that is not the point,” she said. “Human Unity will not be built by bringing police or goondas from villages. Neither will the city be built this way.”The Foundation responded that under The Mother’s direct guidance a plan for the Auroville Township plan was prepared known as the Galaxy Plan. It was presented along with the Charter of Auroville during the inauguration of Auroville on February 28, 1968. Residents of Auroville formulated a Master Plan in 1999 based on the Galaxy Plan, which was unanimously approved by the Residents Assembly and sent to the Governing Board for approval.
