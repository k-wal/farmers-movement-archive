Unit-level data of India’s official employment survey – the Periodic Labour Force Survey – analysed by HT shows that the unemployment rate increased in both urban and rural areas in the months of the lockdown. This is despite the fact that agriculture compensated for job losses elsewhere. But how has the labour market fared in 2021?

The heritage Victoria Memorial Clock Tower had been established by the British in 1906 near Chaura Bazar. The clock tower is being built as part of a ₹3.6-crore project to beautify parks and build roads in the area, of which ₹1 crore will be spent on the replica and for beautification of the Gol Market. Selfie point to be set up Congress Ward 48 councillor Parvinder Lapran said that the 25-feet tall structure will come up at a park in the market, and a selfie point will also be set up near the tower. “Ornamental plants worth ₹10 lakh will be planted in the park and on entry points of the market. Eight other parks situated in the Model Town area will also be beautified under the project, which will be undertaken by the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT). A two-month deadline has been set for its completion.” Appreciating the move market association president Amarjit Singh said, “There is a dire need to give the market a facelift as nothing concrete has been done after 1995. The park is well maintained and the fountain does not function properly. The project will certainly increase the footfall in the market.” Parking space to be demarcatedWith the market facing a shortage of parking space, authorities are planning to demarcate the parking area around the park, and a proposal has also been made to reduce the radius of park by a few feet. Lapran said that a separate area has been designated for street vendors and parking space will be demarcated to facilitate the visitors and shopkeepers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-gol-market-to-get-replica-of-the-iconic-clock-tower-101639765683088.html

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Air ticket scam jeopardises nearly 300 travellers’ Canada dream||Around 300 people hoping to travel to Canada have been left in a lurch after their travel agents bought air tickets from a fraudster, police said on Friday. The travellers had spent up to ₹2.3 lakh on a one-way ticket, and the travel agents who fell victim to the fraudulent deal had collectively spent around ₹3 crore on the tickets.It is learnt that the accused had already bought 400 group tickets from airlines in August for ₹70,000, and had started selling the tickets to travel agents in September. With the term in Canadian colleges due to start in January, and limited flights available in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the tickets had sold for as high as ₹2.3 lakh.The dealer had taken the travellers’ details from the travel agents and promised to send a physical ticket by December 12. However, no ticket was sent, and he later stopped answering the travel agents’ calls. Later, the agents found out that the Passenger Name Record (PNR) number given to them by the dealer was fake.After local travel agents lodged a complaint against the dealer, commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar marked a probe to the additional deputy commissioner of police.One of the travel agents who fell victim to the scam said, “Many of us have returned the money to travellers from our own pocket so that our business does not suffer. We are not sure if we will get our money back.” Students say they are likely to miss classes this semester as only a limited seats are available. Arvind Arora, who had taken admission in a business administration course in Canada, said, “I paid ₹2.3 lakh for a one-way ticket, but two days before I was scheduled to travel, my agent said there was some problem with the tickets. There are no more tickets available and I have already paid my college fee.”

17-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah says cooperative sector a hub of corruption in previous regimes, but Yogi govt cleaned everything||Union minister for home and cooperation Amit Shah on Friday said the cooperative sector in Uttar Pradesh was a hub of corruption under previous regimes before 2017 but the Yogi government cleaned everything in the last over 4.5 years. “Under previous SP (Samajwadi Party) and BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) governments, cooperative societies had turned into family and caste citadels,” said Amit Shah, who was in Lucknow to inaugurate cooperative projects of over ₹155 crore.“Under Behenji and Babua, there was rampant corruption in cooperative societies. But the Yogi government cleaned everything,” said Amit Shah. On the occasion, Amit Shah inaugurated 28 grain godowns of the Uttar Pradesh State Warehousing Corporation having a capacity of 1.40 lakh metric tons. These warehouses are located in 19 districts across Uttar Pradesh. Amit Shah also inaugurated cyber security operation centre of a cooperative bank and inaugurated 13 new branches of the bank. He also spoke about Kashi Vishwanath Corridor inaugurated recently by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“No one talked about Hindu religious places because everyone was into vote bank politics,” said Shah.But the Modi government is re-estabilishing the pride of Hindu religious places, Shah said.“We don’t know how many people had sacrificed their lives for these Hindu religious places,” said Shah.Soon, a magnificent Ram temple will come up in Ayodhya, he added. “With UP’s support, BJP came to power at the Centre twice,” he said.Amit Shah also said the Centre will soon come up with a new cooperative policy. The Union minister for home and cooperation said this while inaugurating three-day seventh national convention of Sahakar Bharati in Lucknow on Friday.“The government is preparing to introduce new cooperative policy. It will be introduced soon,” Amit Shah said while addressing the gathering.He also stressed on audit and free and fair elections to make the cooperative societies robust. Becoming the first minister for cooperation was part of a big journey and ensuring that the journey culminated at its intended destination was a big responsibility, Amit Shah said. Stressing on making cooperative societies effective, Amit Shah stated that soon these societies would be computerised. He also said government was planning to promote organic farming. “To start with, the government will introduce a new system in two states for the promotion of organic farming. In these two states, government will provide all facilities to farmers who are into organic farming through cooperative societies,” Amit Shah said. He mentioned the success of the Amul Cooperative Society of Gujarat through which 36 lakh women were earning their livelihood respectfully. He also shared the success stories of other cooperative societies like Lijjat Papad and IFFCO. Sahakar Bharati was working in 27 states, he said. “The demand to set up a cooperative ministry was there for a long time and it was PM Modi, who floated the idea of this ministry when he became the PM for the second time and I had the good fortune of becoming the first minister,” Shah said. The minister requested delegates to visit Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi.Soon, people will be able to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at Ram temple in Ayodhya, the construction work of which was going on, he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath also expressed his views on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-says-cooperative-sector-a-hub-of-corruption-in-previous-regimes-but-yogi-govt-cleaned-everything-101639765440403.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Banking services hit for 2nd consecutive day amid strike over privatisation of PSBs||Banking services in Ludhiana were hit for the second consecutive day as members of the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) continued their strike on Friday as part of a nationwide protest against the decision of the Union government to privatise two public sector banks (PSB).A protest was held by hundreds of bank employees outside the State Bank of India near Fountain Chowk, where they slammed the Union government’s move and alleged that its purpose is to benefit corporate houses. Employees of State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India and Canara Bank among others participated in the strike.The rally was addressed by president of the Punjab Bank Employees’ Federation PR Mehta, general secretary of Joint Trade Union Council DP Maur, UFBU convenor Naresh Gaur and president of Punjab Bank Employees’ Federation Pawan Thakur among others.They stated that the protest is being held against the Union government’s plan of tabling the Banking Laws Amendment Bill 2021 in the Parliament.Mehta said that the only issue being raised against the PSBs is of huge non-performing assets (NPAs), in which the major share is of big corporates. “Successive governments have taken initiatives such as debt recovery tribunals and SARFAESI Act, but these steps have not yielded the desired result. Therefore, the banks were forced to write off those loans, resulting in huge losses. The PSBs have suffered a loss of ₹284,980 crores because of this,” he said. It is the wilful defaulting of the corporate and big business houses, which have dragged the banks into this crisis, added Mehta. Gaur said that time and again, PSBs have also been used to bail out ailing private sector banks such as Global Trust Bank, United Western Bank and Bank of Karad, etc. “In the recent past, it was Yes Bank, which was bailed out by SBI. In the recent past, RBL Bank, Bandhan Bank and four small finance banks have also posted losses. RBI has cancelled the license of Subhadra Local Area Bank. The public also fears putting their money in private banks,” he said.“This will only benefit the corporate defaulters and remove all the bad loans from public glare and silently write them off. Banks and insurance companies deal with people’s money. Privatising them means handing over people’s money to private vested interests,” said Gaur, while adding that the two day-strike was announced to awaken the government from deep slumber and further action will be taken as per the directions received from the banks’ union at national level. The banks will open on Saturday as per the schedule. Gill MLA Kuldeep Vaid also participated in the protest and assured that the Congress will take up the matter at the state and national levels. Banking transactions of ₹1,600 crore hitAs per the union members, banking transactions of over 1600 crores were hit in the industrial hub during the two-day strike, due to which the public and industry faced a harrowing time. Gaur stated that banking transactions of over ₹800 crore are witnessed in the city on a daily basis. Industrialists rued that the payments have been delayed and they will have to pay interest on the delayed payments of installments to banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-banking-services-hit-for-2nd-consecutive-day-amid-strike-over-privatisation-of-psbs-101639765268051.html

All thanks to a first of its kind drone service, initiated by the health department of the Palghar District administration, that transported 300 doses of Covid-19 vaccines.The drone flew from Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, Jawhar to Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Zap village, 25 km by road in just 10 minutes.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has congratulated the Palghar District Collector, health department and staff for successfully making vaccines available to remote areas of Palghar district through drones. The CM noted that the transportation of vaccination through drones was a pioneering example in Palghar district to provide medical assistance. In future, the same can be done for supplying blood and organs.District collector Dr Manik Gursal shared, “The pilot proposal to use drones to transport vaccines was submitted to the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which they approved a few days ago resulting in successful completion of our mission.”The drone experiment was made possible with the efforts of Blue Infinity Innovation Lab and IIFL Foundation in collaboration with the state Public Health Department.While additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas informed that the drone can carry medical cargo of 5 kg.“The experiment was a success and we will transport essential emergency medicines, blood, vital organs for transplant and other materials through drones as it will help the government to transport them to rough and inaccessible terrain,” said Dr Vyas who also plan to use the same technique to transport vaccination using drone technology in Nandurbar district.Dr Vyas, Zilla Parishad (ZP) CEO Siddaram Salimath, ZP president Vaidehi Vadhan, district medical officer Dr Dayanand Suryavanshi, and other officials were present to witness this happen today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-uses-drones-to-deliver-covid-vaccines-for-jawhar-tribals-in-remote-village-101639765140113.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||RT-PCR test kits stolen from Ludhiana railway station||A carton of RT-PCR tests and assorted medical equipment was stolen from the Ludhiana Railway Station on Thursday evening. However, none of the 100 CCTV cameras at the station captured the theft. The stolen wares belonged to a team of the health department that has been stationed opposite the entrance gate of the station, near Platform 1, for over a month to offer free Covid tests to passengers. The camera installed over the health team’s desk was facing away and therefore failed to capture the incident. “The camera is either focused towards passengers coming down the escalators or from the opposite side. It is not a 360 degree camera,” said a security official, requesting anonymity. “The health team should not have left their possessions unmanned. It is possible that a passenger could have mistakenly taken the box with their luggage,” the security official said. Surprised over the lack of leads, a member of the health team, said, “It is surprising that none of the CCTV cameras recorded the theft as we are stationed right at the front gate, which one would think would be well monitored.” GRP, RPF out of sync Both the Government Railway Police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force (RPF) have installed a few cameras at the same locations at the railway station, which has led to overlapping of footage and wastage of resources.“Director general of police (DGP) Sanjeev Kalra has directed the GRP to change the locations of the overlapping cameras,” a security official said.An official privy to the matter said, “The RPF installed the cameras without consulting the GRP. The SP has now directed us to replace the defunct cameras with the extra cameras. The GRP does not have enough funds to purchase new devices.” GRP superintendent of police Amandeep Kaur said, ‘The railways have already installed enough cameras at the railway station, but to secure more locations, the position of a few cameras will be changed and defunct cameras will be replaced soon.”The cameras at the railway station have been installed by the GRP, RPF, local police and parking authorities.Special railway magistrate conducts surprise checking A surprise inspection was conducted by the special railway magistrate of Punjab, Munish Garg, at the Ludhiana railway station on Friday.According to the officials ₹14,100 in fine was recovered from 40 offenders by the checking team which included officials from Government Railway Police, Patiala, Railway Protection Force, Ludhiana, Jalandhar police personnel and three members of the magistrate staff.The team held the illegal vendors along with those who were found crossing the railway tracks, offenders of chain pulling and those who were found drunk at the railway station or trains.While the checking team held 14 new offenders on Friday at the Ludhiana railway station and recovered a total of ₹1,800 fine from them; 26 old cases were also disposed of and a fine of ₹12,300 was imposed.A senior official stated that the SRM usually conducts the checking inside the trains, but due to the pandemic, it was done at the station.Another official stated that the checking team would conduct surprise checking at some other railway station post Ludhiana on Friday itself.Meanwhile SRM said that instructions have been given to the railway security to keep an eye on the violators. “Many people travel without ticket, which ultimately is a loss to railways and also a serious offence. Our teams pay surprise visits and catch such violators with the help of local officials,” stated Garg.

The 25-strong fleet of buses has already landed in the city and is expected to start operating by January-February next year.These fully air-conditioned buses have several features including announcement of next stoppage before reaching it (like in a metro train), indicator for low battery (before 20 km of total discharge), music system, a mike with driver to interact with passengers as and when required, GPS system in every bus and a CCTV near driver’s seat to have a full view of passengers. To start with, these buses have been registered with the district regional transport office (RTO) and will be operating on two major routes of the city. The city will receive another set of 25 buses in a few months, after which, three additional routes will be added, officials said. For operating these e-buses, authorities of Prayagraj City Transport Service limited (PCTSL) have chalked out a detailed route map. Besides, a mega charging station has been developed near the old Yamuna bridge on Naini side wherein 25 electronic-buses can be charged at a time. This charging station is being built on an area of around 6,000 square metres. TKS Bisen, managing director, PCTSL, said, “We have already received 24 buses and one more will come on Saturday. These buses are being registered with the local RTO and will be operating on roads in a few months”. The official clarified that in the first phase, the e-buses will operate on two routes: Shantipuram (Phaphamau) to Raymond Crossing (Naini) and Trivenipuram (Jhunsi) to Puramufti (Manauri). “Later, when we get the additional 25 buses, they will be operated on three other routes which would be Railway Station to Lalgopalganj, Baihrana to Shankargarh and from Civil Lines to Pratappur,” said the MD, PCTSL. The bus facility will be available from 6am to 8pm and each vehicle would have 28 seats. Among these, two seats would remain reserved for differently abled persons while 22 passengers can stand by holding the hangar. For the safety of passengers, the bus will only proceed for its journey after both gates are fully closed.PHOTO CAPTION: The smart buses that have arrived at Prayagraj (HT)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/25-e-buses-set-to-ply-in-sangam-city-soon-101639764900177.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls 2022: BJP, Amarinder announce alliance||The Bharatiya Janata Party and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress on Friday formally announced to join hands to fight the state assembly polls scheduled early next year. The announcement came after Amarinder on Friday called on BJP Punjab in-charge and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat at his residence in the national capital. After more than an hour-long meeting, both Amarinder and Shekhawat addressed the media and announced the alliance between the two parties. “After seven rounds of talks, today I confirm (and) make it clear that the BJP and Amarinder will contest assembly elections in Punjab together. Topics like seat-sharing will be discussed later,” said Shekhawat, adding that the seat distribution will be announced at an “appropriate time”. “We are ready and we are going to win this election. The decision on seat-sharing will be taken on the seat-to-seat basis, with winnability being the priority. We are 101% sure of winning this election,” said Amarinder. The former two-time Punjab CM also announced the alliance on Twitter, posting a photo in which he can be seen hugging Shekhawat. “We have formally announced a seat adjustment with the BJP for the 2022 Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections,” he wrote.This was the second meeting between Amarinder and Shekhawat. Earlier, the BJP leader had visited Amarinder’s farm house near Chandigarh to discuss the alliance. The saffron party is also holding talks with Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s Akali Dal (Sanyukt), and a meeting between the two is expected in the next two days. BJP likely to be senior partnerAccording to senior BJP leaders privy to the talks, the national party will be the bigger partner in the alliance and may contest on at least 60 seats in the 117-seat Punjab assembly.“The party is adamant on contesting on seats dominated by Hindu and scheduled caste population. It also wants to keep more focus on Majha and Doaba regions,” a senior party functionary said. Sources said both Amarinder and the BJP are likely to give the final shape to the alliance by the end of this month. Amarinder had led the Congress to a decisive win in 2017, defeating the Akali-BJP alliance by wresting 77 seats in the Punjab assembly. In September this year, he resigned as the CM following months of infighting with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Later, he left the Congress and floated his own party. The BJP in 2017 contested on 23 seats, but managed to win only three in one of its worst performances in Punjab. The SAD-BJP alliance, in fact, came third with 18 seats, behind the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (20 seats). Last year, the SAD parted ways with the saffron party over the contentious farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-2022-bjp-amarinder-announce-alliance-101639764661102.html
17-12-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: A Coming of Age||It was the year 2000; the 1000th and last year of the 2nd millennium; the 100th and last year of the 20th century; and the 1st year of the 2000s decade.Lara Dutta had won the Miss Universe crown; the planet was just emerging from the Y2K jitters (I kid thee not, look it up!); a centennial earthquake of 6.5 on the Richter scale had hit Iceland; Sony had released its PlayStation 2 and AD Singh had called to invite us to the opening of his latest venture: the Olive Bar and Kitchen in a little known nook in Khar/Bandra. (The joke was that the exact location changed, depending on how much Sula Chardonnay you had imbibed).Now in 2000, AD was not exactly an unknown entity. Like so many others in Mumbai, I too had experienced the affable restaurateur and consummate SoBo boy’s many offerings: I had schmoozed over post-dinner jazz and cheesecake at Just Desserts; had clambered shakily onto his ambitious Suzie Wong schooner, with its fairy lights twinkling enticingly off the Queen’s necklace; had out-bowled three of the country’s leading billionaires on a memorable evening at his Bowling Company at BKC and yes, had even shaken a leg at Copa Cabana his hot and sweaty Latino dive in Marine Drive, a place that redefined the term ‘hole in the wall’…There was no doubt about it: in 2000, AD along with his fellow peers in the stand-alone F&B restaurant universe like Sanjay Narang, Rahul Akerkar and Moshe Shek -was a man to watch –a mover and shaker who would change the way Mumbaikers dined out and partied. *** But what had greeted me on that first visit to Olive twenty-one years ago convinced me that Singh had stolen a march over his contemporaries. In comparison to his previous offerings, Olive appeared decidedly next level.To begin with, there was its look: Mykonos -inspired white stucco walls, juxtaposed with azure blue crockery; quirky bric-à-brac handpicked by his designer wife Sabina; a snaking al fresco dining area and bunches of bougainvillea that melded seamlessly with the Portuguese -influenced ambience of what was until then still a sleepy, suburb featuring fairy tale cottages named Ave Maria and Peace Haven. It was easily Singh’s most well-conceived ‘concept’ restaurant down to its last detail.Then, of course, there was the matter of its location. Barely coming to terms with the idea of stand-alone restaurants for its fine dining needs, Mumbai’s smart set with its aspirations set firmly in SoBo had not yet got its head around to venturing outside the Laxman Rekha of its comfort zone that ended more or less at Haji Ali.Olive quickly put paid to that. Before the sea link was even a glimmer in Ajit Gulabchand’s eye, Singh had managed to make Khar-Bandra a glamorous F&B destination. With the arrival of Olive, the action began to shift decisively northwards and soon word got around that the city’s movers and shakers- when they weren’t moving and shaking - at Indigo or Fire and Ice or the Bay View Bar, or whichever avatar of the Taj’s disco was the flavour of that month -could be encountered at Olive.And it’s this that sealed the venture’s success. The very first evening (or was it an all-day brunch that had segued into happy hour and then into sundowners-who can tell?) had seen a converging of what would become the ‘Olive Crowd’: impossibly long-legged girls in LBDs who were on their way to their first record/modelling gig/Bollywood film, smart young media executives making deals over Martinis and Bollywood’s brat pack making its after hour moves in the restaurant’s PDR.There was no doubt about it, Singh’s dream of a restaurant that would tick all the boxes of the Italian idea of la dolce vita, a place where good food was not the only offering on the menu, but just another ingredient in the mix, along with music, laughter community and dancing- was a foregone conclusion. And thus, Mumbai got its first taste of the lifestyle restaurant. *** Before its arrival on the scene, the idea that a restaurant needed to have more on its menu than just good food was an unfamiliar one, experienced mainly in places outside the restaurant universe. Certainly, the verandah of the Bombay Gymkhana where Singh as a young schoolboy must have spent many a happy hour could have been an early inspiration. Here, you could arrive for your customary plate of chicken -mayo sandwich and chips, but the highlight undoubtedly would be the familiar faces you ran into, over the course of your afternoon.Similarly at cafe Samovar, along with your coveted order of dahi wada and boti roti roll there was the added frisson that you might just be compelled to share your table with an artsy legend in his lunchtime. And at Juhu’s Sun N Sand, or the Taj’s Sea Lounge, the food was only incidental to the pleasure afforded by spending quiet time reading or contemplating the view.Olive’s instant success was that it combined all these experiences. Here, during a course of an evening you could eat pasta as a Roman would; then schmooze at the bar with old friends and new; then attend a cultural or wine event at the same location; and then, of course, dance away the rest of the night on its table tops.It is easy to see why Olive’s arrival had such an impact on the city’s F&B landscape and why it was the great disruptor in so many ways. *** Singh says that what pleases him most about Olive reaching its milestone anniversary is the fact that the children of those who partied there in its early days –are now doing the same.In many ways, this is a validation of his pioneering of the lifestyle restaurant concept.Even today, twenty-one years after it opened its doors, the concept holds good. OPA, Soho House, the coming of Quorum, Jolie’s and the soon to be opened Bay Club in BKC centre, where customers can eat network, read, work, take calls, party and smash cheap crockery to their heart’s content, attests to this.Whether these establishments go on to capture the public imagination and become long-lasting landmarks on the city’s F&B landscape in the same way, is too early to say.But as someone who has always believed that there’s more to eating out than the food on one’s plate and who has dined at Olive on the first day of its opening- I can be excused for taking a certain proprietary satisfaction on its twenty-first anniversary.After all, it just goes to prove that the more things change the more they stay the same: Twenty-one years since it opened its doors, the party appears to be still on for the next generation of ‘Olivians.’Just as twenty-one years after Lara Dutta brought home the Miss Universe crown, Harnaaz Sandhu has done so too!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-a-coming-of-age-101639763820694.html

17-12-2021||Lucknow||Panchayat election duty death: HC seeks govt reply on petition challenging compensation criteria||The Allahabad high court on Friday asked the state government to file its reply in a petition challenging government order which provided compensation to the family members of only those employees who died within 30 days from the date of Panchayat election duty due to Covid-19. The bench comprising justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and justice VD Chauhan passed the order in a petition filed by Subhash Chandra of Hapur. The petitioner’s claim for compensation was rejected by government saying that his wife died after the period of 30 days from election duty, and the period was beyond the cap put by the government order (GO). Therefore, he was not eligible for any compensation. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Mahesh Sharma submitted that government order dated June 01, 2021, provides for payment of ex-gratia of ₹30 lakh to the family members of the deceased employees, who were infected by COVID-19, during the 2021 panchayat election in UP. However, clause 12 of the said GO was arbitrary and discriminatory, as it puts a cap of 30 days. “A Covid-19 infected person can die within 30 days or even after 30 days of getting infected. The cap of 30 days put by the state government is arbitrary,” the petitioner said. The petitioner’s claim was rejected by the concerned authorities saying that the date of election duty of the petitioner’s wife was April 29, 2021, and she died on June 02, 2021, i.e. after the period of 30 days as provided in the GO. The next hearing in the case will be in the month of February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/panchayat-election-duty-death-hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-petition-challenging-compensation-criteria-101639763676975.html
17-12-2021||Lucknow||Kashi new sustainable model of urban development: Yogi||VARANASI: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Friday that Kashi was a scintillating example of amalgamation of India’s rich tradition with modernity, which every city of the country should aspire for. The city had been equipped with modern facilities while preserving its ancient culture and this was due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision and efforts, he said. Yogi was speaking at the all India mayors’ conference organised by the Uttar Pradesh urban development department here. Mayors from various states across the country are participating in the conference. An exhibition has also been organised on the sidelines of the event from December 17 to 19 to showcase the key achievements of the Government of India as well as the Government of Uttar Pradesh in urban development. CM Yogi said: “Seven years ago, Kashi was very different from what it appears today. The lanes were narrow and dirty while live electric wires hanging lose from the poles posed risk to people’s lives in almost every locality. At that time, open defecation along railway tracks was a common sight. But now, with the building of lakhs of houses with toilets as well as community toilets, the picture of Kashi has changed. It’s a transformed city due to of the honourable PM’s efforts.” Yogi said that sustainable urban development played a key role in the economic development of a state and would contribute a lot to making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025. The chief minister said that Kashi had set new standards of development. He emphasised the importance of having an integrated control & command centre and integrated traffic management for developing a city into a smart city. In this context, he mentioned the role played by the ICCC in security management during the Kumbh fair.

17-12-2021||Lucknow||Efforts to reclaim lost bastion:Rahul’s foot march in Amethi today||Lucknow: When senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reaches Amethi to lead a ‘padyatra’ (foot march) there on Saturday, his visit will mark the beginning of the Congress’ efforts to reclaim the Lok Sabha seat that, till 2019, was considered to be one of the Gandhi family’s two bastions in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul, who represented Amethi parliamentary constituency in the Lok Sabha since 2004, lost to union minister Smriti Irani in the 2019 elections. He is now MP from Wayanad Lok Sabha seat of Kerala. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who was MP from Amethi till 2004, had shifted to neighbouring Rae Bareli, considered to be another bastion of the Gandhi family, and represents the constituency in the Lok Sabha. As this will be Rahul’s first visit to Amethi after a long gap, the party leaders and workers of the constituency are enthused and have stepped up preparations for the ‘padyatra’ that will mark the launching of the Congress campaign for the 2022 assembly elections in the state. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who recently met party’s office-bearers from Amethi and briefly visited certain areas there, will also take part in the ‘padyatra’ in the constituency. “Rahul Gandhi will lead a nearly 6-km long ‘padyatra’ from Ramlila ground ( Jagdishpur) to Harimau in Amethi on Saturday. The ‘padyatra’ will focus on voting out the BJP in 2022 polls to bring down rising inflation. We are ready for the ‘padyatra’ in Amethi after nearly two years. We are happy and enthusiastic about his visit with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to this family of Amethi,” said Amethi district Congress committee president Pradeep Singhal. “People of Amethi are certainly more enthused about Rahul Gandhi’s visit this time. Rahul continues to maintain his relations with Amethi as a family, though he is MP from Wayanad, Kerala. The people are coming forward voluntarily for the ‘padyatra’ now. The BJP has not been able to keep its promise of bringing about any development in Amethi,” said Amethi Congress leader and MLC Deepak Singh. “Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Amethi is certainly politically significant for the Congress. He had lost some ground in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but still has strong connection with the people of Amethi and Rae Bareli. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has brought the Congress back into focus and people of the region have realized that the BJP did not keep its promises. So, the visit should help the Congress in further strengthening its base in the area,” said Professor UB Singh, principal, Baiswara PG College, Lalganj, Rae Bareli. The Congress would obviously like to use the occasion to strengthen its base in the constituency and show some results in 2022 UP assembly elections. The party failed to win any of five assembly seats in Amethi in the 2017 assembly elections. However, it won two of five assembly seats of Rae Bareli, with Aditi Singh (who recently joined the BJP) winning from Rae Bareli assembly seat. Congress MLA Rakesh Singh, who won from Harchandpur assembly seat of Rae Bareli, is also with the BJP. After wresting Amethi from the Congress, the BJP is now working hard to strengthen its base in Rae Bareli. “Rahul Gandhi’s ‘padyatra’ is only a visit to Amethi. This is not serious politically. He is now Wayanad MP. If he loved Amethi, he would not have left the constituency. Rahul has lost people’s faith by leaving the constituency. Union minister Smriti Irani is doing well and working for the development of Amethi. So Rahul Gandhi’s visit will not have any impact,” said Uma Shankar Pandey, senior BJP leader from Amethi.

17-12-2021||Lucknow||No seat-sharing issue, ready to make ‘sacrifices’ in alliance with SP: Shivpal||The Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) chief Shivpal Singh Yadav on Friday said there would not be any problem over seat sharing with the Samajwadi Party in the 2022 UP assembly polls as he was ready for any “sacrifice”.His nephew Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav and he had announced an alliance for 2022 UP assembly polls on Thursday. “Seat-sharing will not be an issue. We are ready to make any sacrifice,” Shivpal said while addressing his party workers at his party’s headquarters in Mall Avenue a day after the announcement was made for the alliance.Before him, Akhilesh during his “Vijay Rath Yatra” in Rae Bareli said: “All the alliances that the SP entered with small, regional parties were announced only after deciding on seat sharing.” Shivpal is Akhilesh’s uncle and the elder Yadav held a meeting of his party workers, recalling that he had already told them that in case of an alliance their party may get fewer seats from which to contest.“We will fight the elections together and if needed we will also make sacrifices for it. The BJP government has to be removed and we will form the government together,” he told them. Earlier, Akhilesh had hinted in Etawah on November 3 that he would ally with his uncle’s party.Before the “chacha-bhatija” reunion, Shivpal Yadav had said his breakaway party was preparing to field candidates on 100 seats in the elections to the 403-member assembly. The coming together of the family appears to have enthused workers in both the parties.Hundreds of supporters from the two parties had on Thursday gathered outside Shivpal Yadav’s house, chanting “Chacha-Bhatija Zindabad”. The relations between the uncle and the nephew began souring in August 2015 and reached a flashpoint in 2016 with the sacking of Shivpal Yadav as a minister when Akhilesh Yadav was the chief minister. Akhilesh Yadav became the SP president in January 2017 and his uncle first formed a Samajwadi Secular Morcha in mid-2018 and then PSP-L shortly before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. PSP-L had contested 56 out of the 80 seats in UP in the Lok Sabha elections unsuccessfully. During the panchayat polls held a few months back, the SP and the PSP-L had come together in Etawah where they won 18 out of 24 wards and BJP got just one seat there.The reunion could also help in checking any erosion in their support among the Yadavs who are said to be around 9 per cent of the state’s population. Aggressively positioning himself against the BJP in the 2022 UP polls, the SP has already entered into an alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal, Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Apna Dal (Krishna Patel), Janwati Party (Socialist) and the Mahan Dal.
17-12-2021||Lucknow||SP walks out of Vidhan Parishad over ‘corruption’ in paddy purchase in UP||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Friday staged a walkout in the Vidhan Parishad demanding a high-level inquiry into the alleged state-wide corruption in paddy purchase from farmers at minimum support price (MSP) during the current procurement season.Raising the issue through the adjournment motion, SP members Naresh Chandra Uttam, Balram Yadav, Rajesh Yadav, Shashank Yadav and others alleged that middlemen were showing paddy as being purchased from farmers who actually had no land and never grew paddy. The middlemen, according to them, had opened bank accounts in the name of farmers depriving genuine farmers of the benefits of the MSP. Joining the issue, SP MLC Sanjay Lathar demanded the government to withdraw the amendments to the Mandi Act in the wake of the repeal of the package of three farm laws by the Centre. The amendments, he said, had declared private silos, godowns and cold storages as sub-mandis where traders could purchase goods from farmers without adopting any auction process. Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Sahi, in his reply, said SP’s allegations were baseless and demanded the chair to reject its demand for a debate on the issue. Not satisfied with the minister’s response, SP members walked out of the House shouting slogans against the government. Earlier, SP members staged a walkout demanding a probe into the reservation in the assistant teachers’ recruitment examination, 2019. Deepak Singh of the Congress raised the issue of spiralling price rise in the state and demanded the chair through the adjournment motion to allow a debate on the issue of public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-walks-out-of-vidhan-parishad-over-corruption-in-paddy-purchase-in-up-101639761419030.html

Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni, is the key accused in the violence that claimed eight lives, including four farmers, on October 3 under the Tikunia police station limits of Lakhimpur Kheri. He was arrested on October 9 and is in jail since then.Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said, “On Friday, second bail application of Ashish Mishra alias Monu was moved in the court of incharge CJM Mona Singh by counsel Awadhesh Singh in modified IPC sections in FIR number 219.” “The court in its order on Friday said there were not enough grounds for bail and rejected the second bail application on gravity of the crime,” he further said.Mishra’s second bail application was moved after the CJM court on December 14 allowed the special investigators to add sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous harm with dangerous weapons) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 3/25/30 read with section 35 of the Arms Act, which were not part of the original FIR number 219 in which Ashish Mishra is the main accused. There are 12 other accused in the FIR. The court had also allowed the SIT probing the Tikunia violence case to drop sections 279, 338 and 304A of the IPC from the FIR number 219 which was related with the death of four farmers and a local journalist. The modifications in the sections were allowed after chief investigating office Vidyaram Diwakar in his report to the court described the act as premeditated with the intention to kill. Ashish Mishra had filed his first bail application in the CJM’s court on October 13 after his arrest on Oct 9 under sections 147, 148, 149, 279, 338, 304A, 302 and 120B of IPC invoked in FIR number 219/2021.

17-12-2021||Lucknow||With Ganga E-way, BJP set to take UP polls fight to western UP||After wooing voters by launching several projects in eastern Uttar Pradesh recently, the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) now plans to take the fight for the 2022 assembly election to western region of the state as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of 594-km Ganga Expressway connecting Meerut with Prayagraj in Shahjahanpur on Saturday (December 18). PM Modi has already launched a string of projects in eastern UP including Kushinagar international airport, Purvanchal Expressway, Saryu Nahar National Project, fertiliser factory and AIIMS at Gorakhpur, inauguration of nine medical colleges at Siddharthnagar and inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor at Varanasi.Riding on the Ganga Expressway project, the BJP hopes to counter the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) alliance as well as Rakesh Tikait-led Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) that was leading the farmers’ agitation in the western UP.The BJP also plans to consolidate its hold made in the 2017 assembly election in western UP making inroads into the support base of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Samajwadi Party (SP). The Ganga expressway will start from Bijoli village in Meerut and passing through Hapur, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Sambhal, Budaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli and Pratapgarh, it will terminate at Judapur Dandu village in Prayagraj district. Terming the Ganga expressway the longest expressway in UP, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said along with connecting the western UP with the central UP region, it will give thrust to the economic activities and remove economic imbalance.“It will be a step towards converting UP into an expressway state. The Purvanchal expressway has been dedicated to the people by the PM, traffic on the Bundelkhand expressway will be opened soon and the work on the Gorakhpur link expressway and Ballia link expressway is continuing on a war footing,” Yogi said.Built at the cost of ₹36,200 crore, the six-lane Ganga expressway will provide direct high-speed connectivity from National Capital Region (NCR) through western UP to Prayagraj. It will facilitate construction of all-weather high-speed access-controlled expressway in the western UP region, said a state government spokesperson.The expressway will decrease the travel time from Meerut to Prayagraj to 6.5 hours. The 3.5 km long airstrip that will be constructed at Shahjahanpur on the expressway will assist emergency take-off and landing of fighter aircraft. An industrial corridor will be constructed along with the expressway to give boost to economic activities, the spokesperson added. The expressway will also give a fillip to multiple sectors, including industrial development, trade, agriculture, dairy, tourism, training and educational institutions and medical institutes as well as other economic activities. It will also provide a big boost to the socio-economic development of the region, the spokesperson said.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet under chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave its nod to Ganga expressway in the first week of September. The state government purchased 94% of land for the expressway from 8,2750 farmers despite the Covid pandemic, he added.

Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, who is also in-charge of the public health department said that many crew members present at the locations have travel history as they come from different parts of the country to Mumbai. “The BMC may arrange camps in shooting locations at studios or in the film city at the earliest to inoculate the crew members present. The drive will be conducted by the local ward office and will be conducted in the lines of BMC’s campaign to ensure all the employees in the workplace are fully vaccinated,” said Kakani. “In a film set, there are many crew members who have travel history and might not have completed their vaccination course. These members work on different locations and if they contract the virus, they can become super spreaders, which is why we are working towards starting this drive as a precautionary measure,” he said. Kakani also said that besides setting up a vaccination centre, the BMC is also planning to arrange awareness campaigns to sensitise those who are working at sets to ensure that they take vaccines at the earliest. He also maintained that the ward officials have been instructed to expedite the number of daily tests conducted each day. “Before allowing shooting to start post the second wave, the BMC had clearly stated that testing camps should be there at the site of the shooting and all the members should be tested regularly for everyone’s safety,” he said. Rajul Patel, chairperson of the BMC health committee said that vaccinating the crew members working at a film set is the need of the hour because a large number of people work together at the film sets. “Many famous celebrities have started to take the rules imposed by BMC lightly which is why many of them have become positive in last one week,” said Patel. “We are planning to start mobile vaccination vans as well in the shooting areas to make sure more people get their dose at the earliest,” Patel said. Another senior BMC official of the public health department said that the BMC will prepare a list of the shooting activities that are happening at their ward and then will contact to administrative heads in-charge of the shooting, to check if a camp could be set up||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-arrange-vaccination-drive-testing-camps-at-film-sets-101639759683737.html

Apart from pressure to act on some political sensitive cases, sources said the leakage of sensitive documents from the police headquarters related to a sensitive drug case was the reason behind Sahota being removed from the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chattopadhyaya-assumes-additional-charge-as-punjab-dgp-101639759260353.html

We stay at Dhayari on Sinhagad road and my son’s school is in Navi peth. We cannot afford to send him by a private bus as the fees are not affordable,” said Machindra Sonawane, a parent. The PMPML school bus service used to run across the city on demand from the schools. Some buses are specially given to schools and run on specific routes with only school students allowed and fixed timings, morning and evening. Student Rahul Khillare from Hadapsar said, “My school is at Swargate area and we used to daily go by our special PMPML school bus. Currently we are going by regular public transport bus, but we have to pay regular ticket fares. If the students special bus starts then it would be beneficial for many students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-to-restart-special-bus-service-for-school-students-from-next-week-101639758959013.html

If the BJP tries to instigate trouble, we will have to resist such bids,” the Diamond Harbour MP was quoted as saying by PTI.Abhishek also warned his party’s activists and leaders of strict action if they are found using “unfair means” for personal gains.“If anyone shows ‘dadagiri’ (high-handedness), he will be expelled from the party after 24 hours,” the nephew of TMC supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, said while addressing a meeting after a roadshow in south Kolkata.Calling senior leaders of the BJP, who made multiple visits to West Bengal before the assembly elections earlier this year, as “bahiragato” (outsiders), Abhishek said they only “peddled lies” about the state and contributed to the rising cases of Covid-19 in the region.“People rejected leaders like Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who had spread canards about the state. See for yourself the situation in UP, where a Union minister's son mows down agitating farmers with his car. Do you want such a situation in Bengal?” he asked the crowd during the roadshow.Also Read | UNESCO recognition for Kolkata’s Durga Puja triggers slugfest between TMC, BJPThe TMC MP was referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh in which Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son, Ashish Mishra, has been named as one of the accused.Challenging the BJP to an open debate with him on the matter of West Bengal's development, Abhishek said the party has “no suggestion” to offer and only “uses religion” to gain votes.“In two years, Kolkata will become the ‘number one city’ in the country on development parameters,” the TMC MP said, urging people not to vote for them in the Lok Sabha polls, if the ruling party fails to live up to their expectations.The BJP, which is also contesting all the 144 seats in the KMC elections, filed a petition to stay the voting to be held on December 19. However, the division bench of the Calcutta high court dismissed the party’s petition.The BJP’s state unit also moved the high court, seeking deployment of the central armed police force (CAPF), but that was too turned down on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-may-cause-trouble-abhishek-banerjee-to-tmc-workers-ahead-of-kmc-polls-101639753567721.html
17-12-2021||Pune||MSRTC strike hits day 50: Process for dismissal of those not working begins||PUNE Despite several attempts to get staff to resume work. the Maharashtra State Transport Corporation (MSRTC) workers’ strike hit day 50 on Friday. Now the MSRTC’s Pune division has started the process of dismissing staff on strike and as of Friday, 69 staffers who had participated in the protests have been sent showcause notices with an enquiry process to dismiss now begun. So far, a total of 1,250 workers of the 4,200 workers in the Pune division have resumed work. State transport minister Anil Parab had warned protesting workers across the state to join to work by December 13, but very few responded. Now the process to dismiss has begun and a departmental enquiry will conducted in three rounds. “We have sent showcause notices to 69 protesting workers since Monday and an enquiry will be done in three rounds. If they do not appear for the enquiry then a final ultimatum to resume duty will be given and then they will be dismissed,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Ramakant Gaikwad. “Around 1,250 workers have joined work in Pune division and most of them are from workshop and administrative departments. And we have suspended 488 workers, 66 of whome then rejoined work. Still the number is less to start bus operations in Pune division,” he added. MSRTC workers and several unions are protesting various demands. Apparently, the main demand of merging the MSRTC into state government was compromised according to the workers, after which workers (apart from the union members) spontaneously started the strike and all the 13 depots in Pune division have been affected. To support the state government the private tourist bus association gave 2000 buses to be operated across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-strike-hits-day-50-process-for-dismissal-of-those-not-working-begins-101639758719044.html

A fund crunch and unavailability of space for miniatures that are part of the park have been gathering dust, residents of the area have complained. The homeless have been using the park to sleep in at night.“We were aghast to see such a bad condition of this place. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had spent ₹90 lakh on this heritage park with lovely miniatures of Shaniwarwada, Lal Deval, Aga Khan Palace, Pataleshwar caves, Parnakuti, Osho Ashram, and Council Hall, but now they are riddled with cobwebs, rats and termites,” said Qaneez Sukhrani.This park was set up to avoid the underpass of the bridge being used illegally. It was never opened for citizens and now it is a dump. “The floor has become hollow because termites and rats. This will cause damage to the Sadhu Vaswani bridge above. Did PMC do a survey that this location would attract tourists and be included in Pune Darshan tour ? How is PMC answerable now for public funds?” Sukhrani asked.Harshada Shinde, head of PMC’s heritage department, said, “The Sadhu Vaswami bridge is an heritage bridge and is old. The department is aware that the miniature replicas are in a bad state but we are facing shortage of funds to maintain them and besides there is an order to dismantle the old bridge, hence, we are looking for a new place to shift the miniatures.” A similar situation can be seen at the underpass of the Swargate bridge where the murals are layered with dust and no maintenance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/heritage-park-under-sadhu-vaswani-bridge-in-state-of-disrepair-101639758420756.html

17-12-2021||Patna||Madan Mohan Jha offers to quit as BPCC chief, AICC looks for replacement||PATNA: The All India Congress Committee (AICC) has expedited the process to appoint a new chief of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) after Madan Mohan Jha offered to quit the post yet again, people aware of the development said.An AICC general secretary, wishing not to be named, said that consultation was going on at the highest level and the new president for the Bihar unit could be announced very soon. “Party seniors have been brainstorming the strategies to strengthen the state units across the state. AICC in-charge for Bihar Bhakta Charan Das, who has gone out for a few days, will return to Delhi by Monday to carry forward the selection process,” he said.Another senior leader said that reconstitution of the BPCC disciplinary committee headed by former minister Kripanath Pathak, a couple of days ago, is an indicator that the AICC is seriously mulling over the revamp of the BPCC. “Disciplinary committee is considered an apex body, which can act against even the BPCC chief and recommend action against AICC delegates,” said a former vice president of the party.The clamour for change of guard in the state party unit has been most pronounced in the state unit after the humiliating defeat of party candidates at the recently concluded by-elections at Kuseshwar Asthan and Tarapur, despite the best efforts put in by AICC in-charge and former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and many other star campaigners.According to party leaders, the AICC has been looking for a suitable replacement after Jha’s name cropped up in a case relating to an alleged promise to give ticket to contest the Lok Sabha election in lieu of money. In September this year, a Congress leader Sanjiv Kumar Singh had lodged a case against opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Rajya Sabha member, and daughter of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, Misa Bharti, and the BPCC chief, alleging that he paid ₹5 crore for a ticket to contest Lok Sabha polls from Bhagalpur parliamentary constituency as an alliance’s candidate, which remained elusive.Confirming the development, Jha said that he had already urged the party high command to relieve him from the post.Many senior Congress leaders attributed depleting strength of the party in the assembly to the weak bargaining skills of the then AICC in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil and Jha, which made the party give up sitting seats and contest from the unfamiliar constituencies under pressure from the RJD. “It was because of Jha and Das that the long-standing coalition between the RJD and Congress broke apart and the party was subjected to the crushing defeat in the by-polls,” said AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha.The Congress’s strength in the state assembly has come down to 19 in 2020 against 27 in 2015. “The party urgently needs a fresh strategy to recover the lost ground after it decided to contest the elections on its own. The BPCC urgently needs a bold, dynamic and popular leader to change the fate of the party in Bihar,” said former vice president Ajay Kumar Singh
17-12-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand assembly: Proceedings disrupted on second day over JPSC row||The second day of the winter session of the Jharkhand Assembly could function for less than an hour on Friday as BJP legislators disrupted proceedings demanding a CBI inquiry into the ongoing civil services exams and dismissal of the JPSC chairman in connection with a series of alleged irregularities in the preliminary examination and declaration of result. The Speaker adjourned the House for the day around 12.40pm as the BJP legislators refused to budge despite one of their colleagues being marshalled out that had led to a brief adjournment earlier. Besides its ally AJSU Party, the BJP also got support from CPI (ML) legislator Binod Singh and independent legislator Amit Yadav who too entered the well with banners demanding action.The legislators disrupted proceedings as the Speaker turned down the adjournment motion brought by BJP, Ajsu Party and CPI (ML) legislators over the issue. Speaking to reporters after the house was adjourned, BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi hit out at the government and also questioned the Speaker’s action. “There has been a series of allegations related to this exam, which is now in the public domain. The JPSC aspirants have themselves been highlighting loopholes in the examination. After denying any wrongdoing, the commission itself declared 49 applicants failed after declaring them pass because their OMR sheet was missing. High-level corruption in this examination is visible and so we are demanding CBI inquiry and dismissal of the chairman,” said Marandi. The BJP leader also hit out at the Speaker for the marshalling of his colleagues for raising slogans in the Well. “What is the option for the opposition than to raise an issue related to the public in House if the government was not listening to their demands. Legislators of other parties and legislators also demanded discussion over the issue. But even the Speaker refused to address the issue of people. It shows the intention of the Speaker,” he added. The JPSC has been facing a series of charges ever since it declared the result of the preliminary test (PT) last month. It started with allegations that applicants at two centres, in Latehar and Sahebganj districts, cleared the examination who took the exam in a series sitting in the same room. The applicants also raised the issue of the JPSC declaring results without announcing the cut off marks under separate categories. The commission announced the cut-off marks earlier. There have been allegations that many students who got less than the cut off marks have made it to the list and vice versa. The JPSC earlier this month itself cancelled the result of 49 students who were shown to have cleared PT in the first announcement. CPI (ML) legislator Binod Singh, said the government ought to reply when so many things are tumbling out. “No authority is explaining the lacunae outside and now when the assembly is in session, it’s the responsibility of the government to clarify things on the floor of the House. The government had announced this year to year of new appointments. In reality, it became a year of taking away the job,” said Singh. While the government has been defending the JPSC in the row, the pressure seems to be mounted on it as members from the treasury benches have also started raising questions over the issue. “I don’t find any problem if a detailed inquiry is conducted if there was no wrongdoing in the examination process. There has been a history of such allegations against the JPSC. So it’s the responsibility of the government to establish the faith of state’s youth over this constitutional body,” said Bandhu Tirkey, legislator and working president of the Congress, the second largest constituent in the government. While the government refused to speak over the issue in the assembly, education minister Jagarnath Mahto defended the JPSC outside the House. “The opposition should raise their concern as per the parliamentary proceedings. As far as irregularity allegations are concerned, the JPSC itself conducted a probe and called the result of some students,” Mahto told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-assembly-proceedings-disrupted-on-second-day-over-jpsc-row-101639758118776.html

The trial against the ninth accused Mohammad Jahidul Islam alias Kausar Mizanul Islam alias Bada Bhai from Bangladesh is still on.According to the special public prosecutor (NIA), Lallan Prasad Sinha, eight of the nine accused had filed a joint petition before the special court on October 22 confessing to their crime for hatching conspiracy and executing the blast, which was accepted by the court. Mohammad Jahidul Islam has not filed any petition confessing his crime.The additional PP Pramod Kumar of NIA told HT that the accused were found guilty under Sections 121, 121A, 122 of IPC, Explosive Substances Act, and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He said that one of the IEDs planted by the suspected terrorists had exploded while two live IEDs were recovered. During the probe, NIA found the involvement of JMB.This was the second IED blast inside Bodh Gaya temple. The first incident occurred on July 7, 2013, in which the convicts, all Indian Mujahideen members, had planted 13 IEDs inside the temple of which nine had exploded. Five persons, including two Buddhist monks, were injured in the incident.Investigation revealed that the accused Jahidul Islam along with the others formed a team and hatched a conspiracy to carry out the blasts by planting IEDs inside the Bodh Gaya temple complex and other symbols of the Buddhist faith.According to investigators, the motive was to attack symbols of Buddhism in retaliation to the alleged atrocities against the Rohingyas in Myanmar and to unnerve the Indian government.This is the second case in which the NIA court pronounced the judgment within seven weeks. Earlier on November 1, the court sentenced four of the nine men to capital punishment for the 2013 serial blasts at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan while five others were convicted to jail terms ranging from life to seven years.NIA findingsThe Bangladesh-based terrorist group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB) was responsible for hatching the conspiracy.Bangladeshi national Jahidul Islam fabricated 3 IEDs and 2 hand grenades. He had entered India and was staying without any legal documents and used different fake IDs to conceal his identity.Dilwar Hossain of West Bengal planted one hand grenade in the cistern of a public toilet near Kalchakra Maidan which was recovered later following his arrest and disclosure.Accused were contacted and assembled at various places. They took shelter at Jehanabad and Masaurhi in Bihar.They used fake names to travel and for renting hideouts and used protected text for communication.The accused escaped after the incident and were hiding in various locations in and around Bengaluru and other places.They also committed a number of dacoities in and around Bengaluru in order to raise funds for their subversive plans.
17-12-2021||Patna||Whistleblower Bihar V-C quits||Patna-based Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University ‘whistleblower’ vice-chancellor (V-C) Prof Md Qudus, who triggered a storm by levelling serious charges of financial irregularities against his predecessor and Lalit Narayan Mithila Darbhanga University V-C SP Singh earlier this month, resigned on Monday, citing “personal and unavoidable” reason. There was no word from the Raj Bhawan if his resignation had been accepted.Qudus had written directly to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar about the irregularities prior to his joining in the award of tender for answer books and security guards and alleged the role of Singh, who was holding the additional charge of MMHAPU. Singh later served him ₹5.10 crore defamation notice and Qudus said that he had already sent its reply and “the outrage against Singh, wherever he has served, was a testimony to his style of functioning”.Qudus also had to face rebuke from the MMHAPU syndicate, the highest statutory body, last week when it approved the payment to all the university staff, including those outsourced, like before and termed their appointment as per rules. The inquiry ordered by him also could not start as three of the five members of the inquiry committee refused to be part of it. The V-C had alleged irregularities in the outsourcing of staff also in his letter. Kudus, who had joined less than four months ago, had earlier said that despite Syndicate’s nod to the earlier appointments, he would refer the matter to the government and the Raj Bhawan for further guidelines. He later wrote about the prevailing conditions in the university to the government and sought clarity on “staff being paid salary through internal resources of the university for nearly six years despite education department’s objections to the way recruitments had been done and roster followed”.“There are employees working since 2015 and getting paid through internal resources, while the government does not recognise the appointments. I also paid them a couple of times but later tried to find out why the fund for their payment was not coming from the state government when the posts had been duly created. I found out that two of my predecessors kept making payments, without clearance from the education department.Some persons appointed were also found overage by the department and it sought evidence of how relaxation was given. As I could not keep paying unauthorised appointments through internal resources, which the university wanted me to continue with, I resigned citing personal reasons. The situation warranted that I should go. I sent my resignation through the mail and later also handed over the letter personally at Raj Bhawan,” he added.Qudus resignation takes the number of vacancies in Bihar’s universities once again to four, as Pataliputra University and Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU) are already vacant for nearly a year, while in TM Bhagalpur University the post is vacant following the former V-C’s resignation. Besides, two universities are under additional charge as one V-C is on medical leave following vigilance raid while another has been sent on compulsory leave. Earlier this month, Pataliputra University Pro V-C had also resigned after a brief stint.

17-12-2021||Pune||Privacy, autonomy, education matter much more than raising age of marriage: activists||PUNE On Thursday, the Union Cabinet cleared a proposal to raise the legal age for marriage of women from 18 to 21 years. In the upcoming winter session, the central government is likely to make legislative amendments regarding the same. However, activists from the city note that making amends on paper may not give relief to girls or decrease the rising cases of child marriages in the state.Kiran Moghe, member of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) said that the organisation strongly disagrees with the recent Union Cabinet decision to raise the age of marriage to 21 from 18 years for girls. “This move, ostensibly for ‘women’s empowerment’, will be totally ineffective in a situation where the government has failed to meet even the most basic nutritional, educational and employment needs of the people. The move will in fact be counterproductive since raising the age of marriage for girls will result in further targeting of choice marriages. It will act as a way to control the sexuality of a young girl, who already faces an uphill task to marry someone of her choice,” said Moghe. She added that studies have shown and we know from our experience that criminalisation of consensual sexual activity between young persons has often led to charges of kidnapping, rape and other crimes including under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, leading to the breaking of these unions and incarceration of the young man involved. “Such a measure will therefore result in affecting the basic constitutional rights of women to privacy and autonomy. The argument that the age of marriage of women should be raised to bring about gender equality is also fallacious,” said Moghe.AIDWA had previously demanded that the age of marriage of boys should in fact be reduced to 18 years, that is, the age of majority, by when all persons have the right to vote and have the capacity to enter into contracts. “The 18th Law Commission had also recommended that the age of marriage should be 18 for boys to bring about parity. This will also stop the boy from being subjected to various criminal penalties. This move to raise the marriageable age is clearly a diversionary tactic from a government which refuses to allocate adequate resources towards nutritional programs like the ICDS, education and healthcare. If, as has been noted, the nutritional status of women remains low from birth onwards, getting married at 21 and having a child after that cannot improve the condition of maternal and child health or mortality,” said Moghe.In an official statement, AIDWA has demanded that the government should scrap this move to raise the age of marriage of girls to 21. City-based education activist Mukund Kirdat said that on paper changes can rarely be reflected in implementation. “There is an increasing number of child marriages across Maharashtra due to the Covid pandemic. And there is no system through which a girl can fight back. In cases of child marriages, the family of the girl is involved and there is no system developed by police or governing bodies to help the girls or related family members to register the matter. There should be sensitivity among government officials. There is some awareness in urban areas, but if this change is brought, cases of child marriages in rural parts will be hidden. Effective implementation is important,” said Kirdat. Varsha Deshapande, women’s right activist and lawyer said that the change is just on paper.“There is no budget allocation or system in place to empower and spread awareness among young girls and boys. In such a case, increasing the age of girls won’t make much a difference on paper,” said Deshpande.IMA supports decisionThe Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra State has, however, supported the decision made by the government.“The new decision will safeguard the education of girls and their future motherhood. This decision will also help for better nutritional levels of future mothers and children. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) will see further drop,” said IMA in an official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/privacy-autonomy-education-matter-much-more-than-raising-age-of-marriage-activists-101639757219049.html

The festival that began on December 14, 2021 was held online.This year, the festival stressed on the theme of Nutritious Food, Flourishing Nature, and Healthy Society, to highlight nutrition and food from across the globe.“Due to blind imitation of modernisation, we have forgotten our traditional food culture. We need to make traditional food culture a part of our lifestyle to restore the health of nature and alternatively human beings,” said Narain. She said, “We are also indirectly harming the next generation, by mocking the traditional food culture. We are hurting our own roots, but interestingly while urban citizens are facing more after effects of the fast food culture, the rural health graph is better for traditional food culture is still prevalent in rural India. There is a need to rethink and re-evaluate the lifestyle and food habits.” In her speech, she stressed upon the natural diversity of India leading to difference in the food culture of the villages, but it is this difference that is conducive to human health. “This diverse food culture needs to be preserved. The geographical climate, soil, water, nature, and other environmental factors have a positive effect on the mental and physical health of human beings.

The CM also announced to accord the status of sub-division to Kartarpur and Adampur cities of Jalandhar district, besides setting up a chair in the name of Baba Sain and Bhagat Namdev.Addressing a gathering at Partapura grain market in Jalandhar, the Punjab CM said the BSP no longer represents the ideology of its founder Kanshi Ram, who aimed to empower the SC community. He said the BSP has sold 15 of the total 20 seats allotted to it to Akali Dal. ‘Kejriwal’s own people don’t have faith in him’Training guns against AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, the CM dared him to explain why Punjabis should believe him when “his own flock doesn’t have faith in him”. He said three out of four AAP MPs elected in 2014 and 11 out of 20 MLAs elected in 2017 have left the party fold. Channi said this is indicative of the fact that AAP is a house of cards that is bound to fall in a day or two. The CM said that Kejriwal has no basic knowledge about state.The CM also announced grants worth ₹200 crore for Jalandhar. He said that Sri Guru Ravi Dass Bani research centre will come up over 100 acres in Ballan village and a research centre on Bhagwad Geeta will be set up in Patiala. In his address, cabinet minister Pargat Singh said Captain’s link with BJP and Akalis has been exposed as he had connived with them to harm interests of state. Addressing the gathering, former MP Sunil Jakhar said that first bugle against the draconian farm laws was blown by Punjab farmers and ultimately the NDA government had to take the decision back. All India Congress general secretary Harish Chaudhary also slammed the Akali, BJP and AAP leadership for working against the interest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsp-leadership-sold-party-to-akali-dal-channi-101639754938603.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||SAD chief raises questions on top cops’ rejig in Punjab||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday alleged that the Congress government was shifting top police officers in order to implicate Akali leaders in drugs and other criminal cases. Talking to media persons on the sidelines of a public meeting at Johlan village in Hoshiarpur, the former Punjab deputy chief minister alleged that the change in director general of police (DGP) was also part of the same “conspiracy”.In a late-night reshuffle on Thursday, the Punjab government had appointed Sidharth Chattopadhyaya as the officiating DGP replacing IPS Sahota.Sukhbir alleged that police officers were being coerced to act against SAD leaders, and said the Bureau of Investigation (BoI) chief’s recent letter had exposed the government’s “mala fide intensions”.In the confidential letter to the Punjab DGP, which was leaked on social media, the BoI chief had expressed reservations in taking action against a senior SAD leader on the basis of a special task force report lying in a sealed cover with the high court.Warning bureaucrats and police officers against becoming a party to the “vendetta drive” of the Congress, Sukhbir said the wrongdoers will be taken to task once the SAD-BSP alliance forms the government in Punjab.The Channi government has lately been under a mounting pressure, notably from state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, to act on the STF report on alleged complicity of certain political leaders and police officials in the drug racket.Meanwhile, the SAD has repeatedly alleged that the Punjab government is trying to frame its top leaders in false drugs cases, a charge denied by the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-chief-raises-questions-on-top-cops-rejig-in-punjab-101639754879693.html

During this time, some unidentified persons, instead of helping him, took his scooter, which was crucial for his livelihood, and fled the scene.According to the Naupada police, the victim, Shyam Salve, stays near the Siddheshwar Lake in Thane, and works as a delivery boy with a private firm based at the Teen Haat Naka, 20 minutes away from his residence. The police said that at around 1.30am on December 13, Salve was on his way home on a Suzuki Access which he had borrowed from his friend as it was useful for his job, when he met with an accident.“Salve was riding on the service road near Nitin Company when he hit a metal plate laid down by the municipal corporation for road repairs. The plate was slightly elevated from the road’s level, and Salve failed to see it as it was dark at that stretch. As a result, he lost control, skidded and hit the road hard, sustaining injuries to his face, hands and legs,” police sub-inspector Sangam Patil, Naupada police station, said.For the next 30 to 40 minutes, Salve lay on the road, injured and unconscious. When he finally regained consciousness, he looked around only to find himself alone on the road and his scooter missing. He tried looking for it nearby but failed to find it, and, due to his injuries, was in no condition to look any further.A panicked Salve then called up some of his friends who rushed to the spot and took him to a hospital for treatment while also informing his family about the incident. After resting for two days and consulting family and friends regarding further course of action, Salve visited the Naupada police station on Wednesday and registered a complaint.“We have lodged an offence of theft against unknown persons under the Indian Penal Code and are investigating the matter. We took the victim to the scene of the accident on Wednesday and found that there are no CCTV cameras covering the exact spot where the incident occurred. We are now looking for any cameras covering the roads leading to the spot while other methods of investigation are also being used,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delivery-boy-meets-with-accident-scooter-stolen-while-he-lay-unconscious-101639753799517.html

17-12-2021||Mumbai||Thane residents live in fear after sighting leopard; forest officials find no signs of wild cat||There was fear among residents in Thane after locals spotted a leopard at Pokhran Road No. 1 near Vartak Nagar on Thursday night.Disaster management officials and forest officers were present at the spot on Friday morning. However, no pug marks or other signs were noted, claimed the forest officers.“We surveyed the area. As it is closer to the forest, the leopard may have wandered unknowingly. We have kept cameras in these areas that will spot the leopard. If repeated sightings take place, only then will we take a call for any action,” said Dinesh Desale, Range Forest Officer. He also assured the locals not to panic and that this could be just a one-off incident.As the Bhimanagar chawls, where the leopard was spotted by locals, have concrete floors, finding any pug marks would have been difficult. Santosh Kharat, a resident of Bhimanagar, said, “I had just returned from work past midnight and was having a chat with my neighbours. This is when one of my friends saw some animal jumping over the rooftop of our houses. He assumed it to be a monkey. I turned and took a few steps ahead when I saw the leopard sprinting across towards a small lane that leads to a housing society adjacent to our chawl.”Soon after, the locals informed the police and animal welfare groups. They switched on all the lights near the chawl to drive away the wild cat. Videos of the leopard roaming inside a housing society and then running back to where it came from are circulating on social media.However, despite repeated attempts, HT could not get in touch with the housing society. Moreover, the forest officials confirmed that there was nothing to panic and necessary precautions were in place.Two years back a leopard was spotted in a mall at night, hardly 2km away from this spot. Moreover, last month a few locals from Manpada also allegedly spotted a leopard but no such signs were found by the police or forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-residents-live-in-fear-after-sighting-leopard-forest-officials-find-no-signs-of-wild-cat-101639750079553.html

It has been approved by ICMR with 100 per cent sensitivity and specificity,” said Jakatdar.According to Dr Phadke one of the most important highlights of this test kit is its ability to reliably differentiate all current Delta lineages and all Omicron lineages including BA.1, BA.2, which are also known as Omicron-like and stealth variants and the very recently proposed BA.3 lineage. “All the Omicron lineages share a number of common defining mutations. The BA.2 sub-lineage, however, does not carry the Spike gene del69-70 mutation, and hence, will not be detected by the so called ‘S-gene target failure’ (SGTF) approach using other commercial kits that are currently being used for that purpose. In fact, a large percentage (as high as 70%) of recently sequenced cases (primarily from South Africa, Australia and Canada) reportedly belong to the BA.2 sub-lineage, and have failed being flagged by the aforementioned SGTF approach,” said Dr Phadke.GenePath’s ICMR approved CoviDelta kit, however, targets the downstream Spike L452R mutation which is present in the Delta lineage, but absent in all the Omicron sub-lineages.“Furthermore, the kit contains additional multiple independent Covid-19 targets providing resilience to current and emerging mutations. Therefore, GenePath’s kit will continue to detect all variants of Covid-19 with high sensitivity and specificity and reliably differentiate between all current Delta and Omicron lineages,” said Dr Phadke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punebased-firm-s-testing-kit-cleared-to-detect-all-variants-of-covid-101639749537490.html

Police have arrested six people, including Pritish Deshmukh, director of GA Software Technologies Pvt Ltd, which was given the contract of conducting recruitment exams for various departments during the earlier raid.During a search operation at the house of Deshmukh, the police had found TET admit cards. Also, the hall tickets of some ineligible students were seized. Therefore, there was a suspicion of malpractice in the TET examination and the investigation was carried out accordingly. Pune police had called Supe for questioning and placed him under arrest, an investigator said.Amitabh Gupta, Pune police commissioner, said, “Supe has been arrested by the cyber cell based on the information collected during the questioning regarding the malpractices during the exams.” Gupta also said that ₹90 lakh cash was seized from Supe’s residence . “During investigation, we seized Rs90 lakh in cash and gold from his residence. Besides him there are other accused in the case and further investigation is underway.”The MHADA Pune Board on December 11 had lodged a complaint with the cyber police station after MHADA and the technical committee of Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) received the information that the contractor company was allegedly trying to leak the paper. The police received a tip-off that an agent would come to meet the director of the company. Police then arrested Deshmukh and two agents from Vishrantwadi at 10 pm on December 11. Two more agents were arrested from Aurangabad later on December 12.The police investigation has further expanded to Mumbai, Pune and Aurangabad after interrogation of the accused during custody.The process of filling 565 vacancies for various posts in MHADA, meanwhile, has been going on for several months now. For the said recruitment test, GA Software Technologies was chosen and accordingly, the examination was scheduled on December 12, 15, 19 and 20 at various centres in all the divisional boards of MHADA.Nearly 53 lakh applications were received for 565 posts by the concerned authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/paper-leak-case-commissioner-of-maharashtra-state-council-of-examination-tukaram-supe-held-101639749237483.html
17-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah urges Ram bhakt Nishads to help BJP win 300-plus seats in Uttar Pradesh||Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday urged the Nishad community to help the BJP win 300-plus seats in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly. He promised the politically influential riverine community members that if re-elected, the BJP would fulfil all the long pending demands of “Ram bhakt” Nishads.Besides, he played up the inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi (on December 13) and foundation laying stone of Ram temple at Ayodhya by Prime Minister Narendra Modi (on August 5, 2020).The home minister was addressing a joint show of strength by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its pre-poll ally Nishad party in Lucknow.The Nishads, currently listed among the Other Backward Castes (OBCs), have been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. “Once we form the government again, the BJP would honour all long pending demands of yours,” Shah said. “Mujhe batayein iss baar Nishad party BJP ki 300 paar ki ladai ladenge kya? … SP, BSP ka soopda saaf ho, Congress ka khata na khule aisa karenge kya? (Tell me, if you would fight BJP’s 300 plus campaign and help oust SP, BSP and stop Congress from opening its account?),” he asked the Nishads at the Rambai Ambedkar grounds, the biggest rally venue in Lucknow.He credited the Nishad community’s support in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls for the BJP’s landslide win despite a SP-BSP alliance in UP. Shah’s address at the joint rally was punctuated with references to Ayodhya and Kashi, the two religious centres that are undergoing a makeover under the BJP rule. A third pilgrim town, Mathura, has been in the news ever since deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted about it being part of the plan where grandeur is yet to be restored.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is set to flag off one of BJP’s six yatras from Mathura on Sunday.Nishads find a mention in Ramcharitmanas, a holy book of the Hindus, as the ones who took Lord Ram, Sita and Lakshman on a boat when they went into exile.Shah promptly referred to the passage which states that Nishadraj (leader of the boatmen) wept on seeing Lord Ram and Sita sleeping on the floor during their period in exile. Shah then used the passage to make a political point. “We have read in Ramcharitmanas how Nishadraj wept on seeing Lord Ram and Sita sleep on the floor but decades later, Lord Ram continued to be in a makeshift temple till PM Modi arrived. You all know who stopped the Ram temple from coming up? Now, Modiji has laid the foundation where grand Ram temple will shortly come up. The grandeur of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor too has just been restored,” Shah said. Eighteen UP districts have a sizeable presence of Nishad community members and they are currently being wooed by all political parties. Shah sharing the stage with the Nishad party was an indication that the BJP could placate the community in ticket distribution, BJP leaders said. Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen Nishad is currently a Lok Sabha MP. He was elected from UP’s Sant Kabir Nagar on the BJP ticket in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, barely a year after being elected as the Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate from Gorakhpur in the 2018 Lok Sabha by-polls. The Nishad party claims a significant presence in 160 of the 403 assembly seats in UP. While the BJP’s surveys to assess the winnability of candidates are on, the Nishad party, too, has been doing surveys to identify the seats it can win in eastern UP.“In the 2019 elections, Modi ji had agreed to a request for a separate department for riverine community and, on being re-elected, the promise was promptly kept,” Shah said referring to how the fishery division was carved out of the department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries vide the cabinet secretariat’s notification.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath spoke of how his government had beautified the Nishadraj Fort in Shringverpur near Prayagraj where a grand statue of Lord Ram and Nishadraj holding each other in embrace was coming up. Shah and Yogi urged the riverine community members to take the message of PM Modi and Yogi to each and every home. In the presence of Shah and Yogi, Nishad party leader Sanjay Nishad told his community that the BJP government at the Centre and in UP had set the process in motion, tasking top leaders and officials with the job of including Nishads in the SC category. The Nishads are currently among the OBCs.“I can tell you that SP Goyal, principal secretary to UP chief minister, UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh and union education minister and UP BJP’s election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan are working on that,” said Sanjay Nishad who was recently nominated to the upper house of UP legislature by the BJP government for a six-year term.
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal’s Hatti community revives 50-yr-old demand for tribal status||With just about a year left for the state assembly elections, the Hatti community of the backward Sirmaur district has renewed its five-decade old demand for according tribal status to 147 panchayats located in the Trans-Giri region. Different organisations of the Hatti community have given a joint call to hold “Khumblis” congregation at the panchayat-level on December 25 to draw the future course of action to persuade the government to grant tribal status to the Trans-Giri region. Khumblis are traditionally held in old Himachal to redress disputes related to a person or a property. Nearly 50% of the population in Sirmaur district comprises the dominant “Hatti” community, living in difficult conditions across the Giri River. Ever since Jaunsar and Babbar areas of Uttarakhand, which share boundaries with the Trans-Giri area, were granted the scheduled tribe status in 1967, the inhabitants of Trans-Giri have also been demanding for the same. But so far, their demands have fallen on deaf ears. “The Hatti community will now fight its own battle. It’s high time now. We will not be fooled by political leaders anymore. We will sit together in the panchayat and decide the future course of action,” said Pradeep Singhta, president, Hatti Vikas Manch. Explaining why tribal status is important for them, he said, “Joblessness is increasing day by day. The remoteness is making life hard for us. Youth of our area are being deprived of the benefits granted to tribals in Kinnaur.” Amin Chanda Kamal, president, Central Hatti Committee, said, “Resolutions passed in Khumblis will be sent to the Prime Minister’s office. Political leaders from both parties have failed to take up our cause effectively.” Matter pending with Centre, say state officialsIn 2016, the state government headed by then chief minister Virbhadra Singh moved a case to the Centre for granting tribal status to Trans-Giri region, Dodra Kwar in Rohru. In 2018, the ministry of tribal affairs wrote back to the state government saying that details provided in the ethnography report about the Hatti community were not “sufficient”. The government had written to the state to re-examine the proposal for inclusion of Hatti community in the list of Scheduled Tribes and had further recommended the government to conduct a full-fledged ethnographic study. “The Centre had sought certain clarifications, and we have replied them. The matter is now lying pending with the union government,” said Onkar Sharma, principal secretary, tribal development. Recently, BJP’s Himachal unit president Suresh Kashyap had met Union minister for rural development Arjun Munda over the demand. He had also met the Registrar General of India (RGI) Vivek Joshi in Delhi over the issue. Kashyap said, “The demand for tribal status for the Hatti community has been pending for long. The Transgiri area of Sirmaur, which is adjoining Jaunsar Babar of Uttarakhand, comprises about 144 panchayats in four blocks of Sirmaur and has a population of about 2.75 lakh. In 1967, the people of Jaunsar Babar area were declared tribal. But the Hatti community of Giripar region of Himachal was not declared as a tribal.”

In a letter to Channi, Bajwa, who is also the chairman of the Congress manifesto committee for the 2022 state polls, said the government should introduce a specialised and focused agricultural budget as the need to diversify from the paddy/wheat cycle was imperative to protect the future of every Punjabi. “It is time for Punjab to take the lead in showcasing a strong alternative model for agricultural development across India,” he wrote, referring to another letter he sent on August 14 to the then chief minister in this regard. He further recommended that the agriculture and farmers’ welfare ministry should be renamed as the ministry for agriculture, farmers’ welfare and crop diversification. “This change will highlight the serious policy shift of the government in tackling the present problems facing the agricultural sector in the state,” he said, calling it the right time to make these changes and start laying the groundwork for the “evergreen revolution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabmp-partap-bajwa-calls-for-separate-agriculture-budget-101639748397308.html

The jatha will return on December 23.Bajaj said, “On December 18 and 19, Mahashiv Pujan, Purnima Utsav and other religious ceremonies will be held. The lighting of earthen lamps will also be held at night at the shrine complex. On December 20, the pilgrims will pay obeisance at Sri Krishna Temple in Lahore, besides visiting the sacred place of Maharaj Luv, son of Lord Rama, and other religious places in the city before returning.”“Unfavourable political developments between India and Pakistan and the Covid-19 outbreak cast shadow over the pilgrimagethe last three times. After Pakistan government assured adequate security arrangements for pilgrims and its Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) extended cooperation, the pilgrimage was planned again and it was granted permission by the governments of both the countries,” said Bajaj.Under the Pakistan-India protocol on visits to religious shrines of 1974, a large number of Sikh and Hindu pilgrims from India visit Pakistan to observe religious festivals every year. A maximum of 200 Hindu pilgrims can be part of the trans-border pilgrimage.The Hindu pilgrims normally visit Katas Raj twice a year, once in February/March during the festival of Maha Shivratri and again in November/December.The Katas Raj Temple, also known as Qila Katas, is a complex of several temples connected to one another by walkways. It is situated in Chakwal district of Punjab province in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/katas-raj-temple-visit-87-hindu-pilgrims-leave-for-pakistan-101639747437136.html
17-12-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation plans to develop 2 new arms of flyover to ease traffic congestion||In view of the increasing traffic congestion, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) is planning to develop two new arms of a flyover that connects Koparkhairane with the MIDC area above the Thane-Belapur Road.With these new arms in place, motorists will be able to board the flyover directly from the Thane-Belapur Road and alight from it.After conducting multiple surveys, the officials from the engineering department prepared a detailed project report (DPR) that will soon be sent for approval to the civic body. They have estimated a budget of ₹44Cr for this work.The flyover was developed by CIDCO around two decades ago.Sanjay Khatal, executive engineer of NMMC said, “CIDCO had developed the flyover so that people from Koparkhairane (and its adjacent Ghansoli) can directly travel to the MIDC area above the Thane-Belapur Road. However, there is no provision for the vehicles on Thane-Belapur Road to go either to Koparkhairane or to MIDC at that junction. So, those vehicles have to travel some more distance to enter these places and that creates traffic congestion in the area. Therefore, we are planning to develop one arm on the right-hand side and the other arm on the left-hand side of the flyover.“By boarding the flyover from the right-hand side, the vehicles will go to Koparkhairane, and by boarding from the left-hand side they will go to the MIDC area. Thus, the new arms will reduce both travel time and traffic congestion in that area,” he further said.Manish Shirke, a 56-year-old activist from Koparkhairane, said, “A large number of people from Thane travel to their workplaces in Mahape and Shilphata (both in the MIDC area) daily. So, apart from the local residents of Navi Mumbai, all those people will be benefited by the proposed new arms.”

Likewise, a number of matches of the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup will be held at the same stadium in October 2022.A senior officer from the civic engineering department said, “The players of those tournaments will need a fine ground with good infrastructure for their routine practices. Therefore, we are now revamping this ground that already had a concrete compound wall with four-foot-tall steel nets above it. Now, at the behest of the authorities, we have increased the height of the steel nets up to eight feet. During the practice sessions, green sheets will be put on the nets so that people cannot watch it from outside.“We have made some seating arrangements (granite steps covered with roofs) and developed four changing rooms, two waiting lounges and two washrooms. The changing rooms will have a total of 24 lockers. We are also developing inter-locking pathways so that players can easily walk from the ground to the restrooms.”NMMC also has plans to develop a cricket pitch and a volleyball court at the other parts of the ground at a later stage.The officer said, “We are finishing the work related to the upcoming tournaments in the first phase. We will take up work on the cricket pitch and volleyball court in the second phase. The civic body has allocated a budget of ₹3.50Cr for the entire work.”Manoj Mahale, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC (sports and cultural department), said, “We have taken the upcoming international tournaments as an opportunity to promote football in Navi Mumbai, specifically among the girls. Football is not a popular game among the students of civic schools here. The FIFA authorities recently trained our twelve coaches who will promote football among the students. The FIFA authorities have verbally assured us to train some of our students too.”

The cyber fraud reported every year is much more than what is lost in house breaks and robbery. And, why is this amount lost in the cybercrime? This is because the victim himself gives away the OTP or clicks something that he should not be clicking. This can be avoided if the person has knowledge on how cybercrime happens. For that, we have started the campaign,” Dudhe said.The campaign was started with Jhirad village under the jurisdiction of Mandwa coastal police and was concluded by Konkan IG, Sanjay Mohite, this week.“Now, Jhirad has become the first cyber-literate and cyber-safe village of Raigad and soon other villages will follow,” Dudhe said.Rajiv Patil, inspector from Mandwa coastal police station, has been conducting awareness campaigns in the area for a few weeks by giving lectures to the village students, holding rallies, street plays and community meetings to create awareness among the citizens.“During the campaign, people are told about various modus operandi of the cyber criminals and how they approach citizens. We tell them about the preventive measures that one should take and what information that they can give to the caller and what they should not,” Dudhe added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raigad-police-begin-campaign-to-educate-citizens-about-cyber-frauds-101639746177721.html

With all of these, we will have 11 plants that will be sufficient for the civic body if there is a major requirement of oxygen during the surge in Covid cases,” said Sudhakar Jagtap, additional commissioner, KDMC.In total, there will be six liquid oxygen plants and five PSA oxygen plants ready with the KDMC. The liquid oxygen plants are being set up at Savlaram Krida Sankul in Dombivli, Art Gallery in Kalyan and Vibha Company in Dombivli MIDC. The PSA oxygen plants are at Rukminibai Hospital in Kalyan (W), Fish market at Vitthalwadi in Kalyan (E), Lal Chowki in Kalyan (W), Savlaram Krida Sankul in Dombivli and Shastri Nagar Hospital in Dombivli.“Once all the 11 plants are ready, we will have at least 180 metric tons of oxygen available with us and don’t have to worry about shortage during the pandemic,” said Jagtap. Along with the oxygen plants, the civic body has also made arrangements for the bed facility, which is on a standby at present. The civic body has increased the bed capacity from 6,000 beds in April month during the second wave to 8,000-plus beds now including both civic and private hospitals.“The beds are kept on standby at present. In case there is a surge, these beds can be used any time. Both civic and private hospitals have been kept ready for this. We have beds available in all the categories including oxygen beds and ventilators, “said Sameer Sarvankar, in-charge officer, KDMC.“The newly-added 540 beds at Vibha Mechano Company in Dombivli itself is a huge facility,” added Sarvankar.

In total, 360MLD of water is taken from these rivers and supplied to the KDMC limits.Meanwhile, 55MLD of water is also provided by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to the 27 villages. In total, 415MLD of water is available for the KDMC limits for an estimated population of around 21 lakh. The civic body says that this is not sufficient for its population.“Considering the estimated increase in the population and also the villages being a part of the civic body, there is a need to increase the water sources for KDMC in the coming years. If the government allows us water from the upcoming Kushiwali dam, it will be very helpful to deal with the water requirements in the future,” said Pramod More, executive engineer, water department, KDMC.The civic body has also urged to divert the quota of 140MLD water by MIDC for NMMC from Ulhas river to KDMC. A decision was taken in a meeting of water resource minister and senior officials in 2009 to divert this quota to KDMC. However, it was not done.“This diversion is not yet implemented for which we have asked the department to help implement it in the coming days,” added More. In the letter, the civic chief has also asked for funds to take up the work at dams like Pesheer and Kondane in Raigad district and have an independent water source in the future from these resources.

Lately, truckloads of persons are approaching namaz sites and raising communally divisive slogans and spewing hatred against the religious community through social media posts, the petition said.“Such hateful campaign, communally divisive incidents and rampant dissemination of propaganda through use of social media, is easily identifiable and is being perpetrated by a limited number of unruly members of the society who are continuously giving effect to their nefarious plans to further hatred and communal disharmony,” the petition said.The petition filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi referred to the July 2018 decision passed by the Supreme Court directing police and state authorities to take both preventive and remedial steps to prevent incidents of hate crimes, mob lynching and communal violence.“The continuous inaction, apathy of the state machinery and failure of the local law enforcement agencies and administration to prevent such incidents or to find a solution to the crises before it spirals into a monstrosity, is precisely what had been indicated by this court in Tehseen S Poonawalla case (of 2018) and is thus clearly a contempt of this court’s direction,” the petition said. The petition has named chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal and DGP PK Agrawal as contemnors.The petition said Muslims of Gurugram have been performing Friday prayers peacefully and without causing any disturbance at 37 open spaces for lack of places of worship. This was being done after approval from the relevant government authorities, including municipal and police functionaries. “In the recent months, there has been a constant rise in incidents revolving around the said Friday prayers at the behest of certain identifiable hooligans, with no local support, who portray themselves falsely in the name of religion and seek to create an atmosphere of hatred and prejudice against one community across the city,” the contempt petition said.“The perpetrators are well-known to the respondents/alleged contemnors herein, who have continuously failed to take any effective measures and have rather been bystanders in the entire controversy,” the former independent member from the Rajya Sabha said.He pointed out that Gurugram is an industrial township where persons of different faiths and religions come to work and such provocative actions are witnessed during working hours when people from the neighbouring areas of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh gather.The Jamait Ulama-e-Hind made complaints to the police, followed by local residents of all faiths, to take note of the growing hate campaign at the behest of a few persons aimed at singling out one community and creating an atmosphere of hatred and lawlessness. “By October 29, the local police, instead of taking any action against such communally divisive incidents, chose to change the pre-approved locations of Friday prayers,” the petition stated, adding that the intensity of hooliganism has increased over the past months every Friday as people are arriving in trucks, in a manner of pre-planned conspiracy to create hateful and communally divisive atmosphere at the places where namaz is offered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-namaz-row-contempt-plea-against-top-officials-101639741195931.html

17-12-2021||Delhi||Pollution: Delhi-NCR schools allowed to reopen in phases||The Commission for Air Quality Management has allowed the reopening of schools in Delhi-NCR in a phased manner. The decision was announced on Friday, a day after the commission submitted its affidavit on its action against pollution to the Supreme Court. After getting the go-ahead from the commission, the Delhi government announced that physical classes for class 6 onwards will resume from December 18. With the pollution level gradually coming under control from what it was when the Supreme Court termed the situation as an emergency, several restrictions have been allowed by the commission over the past week.“The representations put forth by various project proponents and associations in the building and construction/ demolition sector, as also by the association of schools/educational institutions are under active examination and consideration by the commission and a decision on these would also be taken soon on or before December 17, based on the impact of the relaxations given above,” the CAQM’s affidavit stated.Physical classes in Delhi schools were suspended for the most part of November because of pollution. After the Delhi government decided to resume classes from November 29, the Supreme Court took note that while the government allowed work-from-home for office-goers, it reopened schools exposing children to the hazards of pollution.After being rapped by the apex court, the Delhi government again suspended physical classes on December 2. The commission expanded the order and asked all schools in the NCR to suspend physical classes. The Supreme Court, however, clarified that it did not ask for shutting schools; it merely asked for the justification for reopening schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollution-delhi-schools-allowed-to-open-in-phases-101639738618422.html

17-12-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Pune awaits development of megacity airport ecosystem||In 2015, Airbus had published a forecast which projected that there would be 91 megacities in the world by 2034. In 2018, a United Nations report had listed 33 megacities in the world at that time. Six of the 33 are in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad). Given the population’s figures, it is the greater metropolitan area that was considered in each of these cases. While definitions vary, a megacity is generally defined as an urban agglomeration with a minimum population of 10 million people.Pune city by itself clocks in at 3.99 million in 2020 (official 2011 census 3.2 million). The important metric is that it is the second-largest city in Maharashtra, after Mumbai, and the ninth-largest city in India. If we consider the Pune metropolitan area, then Pune metro has a population of over five million and it is the seventh-largest metro in India. If we consider the Pune district, the population estimate rises to about 10.7 million in 2020.Whichever population metric we take, Pune’s planning and design should have already started preparing for megacity capacity in the near future. Why? Because all megacities are not developed or progressive. Some are just a whole lot of population. What differentiates a progressive, developing megacity from one with millions of people? Vision and planning.The current Bangalore International Airport is a good example of an airport that was built for future capacity with an innovative design approach keeping in mind continuously evolving global requirements. The current airport opened in 2008, replacing the earlier smaller airport. In the early 2010s, Bengaluru attained megacity status, and its flights grew 25-fold. Part of this was enabled by its indigenous technology industry that was exporting products and services to the world. In 2019, the airport in Bengaluru handled a peak of 33.6 million passengers. In the same year, Pune handled a little over eight million, which is a good volume for a growing metro area.Pune’s situation is, of course, different, since India’s financial capital (also Maharashtra state capital) Mumbai is right next door with its port and international airport. With the state government having cleared the decks for a second international airport in Navi Mumbai, I wonder how serious state and city planners will be when it comes to developing Pune with international connectivity and as a regional hub. As a business traveller, I have suffered a decade and a half of having to waste time, money and efficiency travelling to Mumbai (or Delhi or Bengaluru) for domestic and international flights.From various reports, one thing that seems to stand out is that Gross domestic product (GDP) will be the key driver for the growth of megacities (beyond aspiration, infrastructure and growth requirements). If we consider Maharashtra as a whole, it has an estimated population of 123 million as of 2020 with a GDP of 310 billion USD. And it has one large-hub international airport in Mumbai, and two small (tiny) international airports (Pune and Nagpur have less than five international destinations between them). Compare this with New Jersey, a state in the USA with a 9.3 million population, GDP of 634 billion USD. New Jersey has three passenger airports, two of which are international, 13 reliever airports and eight general aviation airports (there are several other military and other airports). Or New York state which has a population of more than 20 million (1.7 trillion USD GDP) and is served by 16 primary passenger airports of which 11 are international airports. New York state also has 16 reliever airports and more than 20 general aviation airports.This is not a fair comparison (well-developed versus developing country), but it is meant to provide a perspective on how states and their cities have to consider population growth and financial growth in relation to infrastructure planning. Pune has for long been waiting in the aisles of infrastructure development. National, regional and international business houses have invested in the city and the district and there is a steady flow of talent thanks to the robust education industry.A lot will depend on how many startups and unicorns and business hubs Pune manages to grow in the next decade. This means we have to wait and see if Pune develops holistically enough on financial parameters or just grows in terms of population. More than anything else, Pune needs a set of political guardians, so that there is a public-government will to develop the city to its potential. The political guardians are crucial so that the local interests don’t get overlooked because of the interests of other evolving (and competing) cities or metro regions.Pune also needs an airline or two or three to adopt it as a true home base for a sense of pride to emerge in the running of the airport. Like Southwest adopted Dallas-Love Field and Chicago-Midway in the USA. Like Indigo made Bengaluru one of its hubs. Like Hong Kong is the main hub for Cathay Pacific Airways, just as Delta Airlines has Atlanta airport and so on.Pune is not an aviation hub nor does it have an aviation culture but it is a business and education centre as also an information technology powerhouse. If it has to take its place in the emerging national and global map, it has to be passionate about connecting to the world and firmly asking for its due infrastructure.Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

Also read: Ready to provide additional Rafale jets to India: FranceSidhu said this mission would be started on the lines of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), a centrally sponsored scheme, to give employment to the urban poor, particularly unskilled labour, in towns and cities of the state. “Urban poverty is double the rural poverty in the state. Besides giving right to employment, we will also fix the daily wage and regulate work hours,” he said at a press conference at the Punjab Congress Bhawan, the state headquarters of the party. Calling his “revolutionary” idea as the USP (unique selling proposition) of his “Punjab model” of governance, the state Congress chief said this idea would change the lives of the urban poor. He hit out at the state government for not registering the urban labour, including construction workers, and giving full benefits of MNREGA to the rural poor. “I interacted with daily wagers at Madanpura Chowk in Mohali in the morning.

Reassuring people that the variant doesn’t have severe symptoms, he said he is “absolutely fine”. “There is no reason to fear the Omicron variant. The symptoms are mild, and I have seen this in South Africa as well. There was no reason for any serious hospitalisation. Even for me, there was no need for hospitalisation. If we are careful, wear masks and take the vaccination, we will be fine,” he said in the short video. “I was infected with Delta virus before and now I can share the experience of being afflicted with the Omicron variant,” he said in the video. “I was infected with coronavirus during the second wave. I had two doses of Covid vaccination. Despite this, I tested positive for the Omicron variant. I suffered much more when I was infected with Delta virus than the Omicron variant,” he said. Karnataka reported the third case of the Omicron virus on Sunday.The 34-year-old had arrived from South Africa on December 1. “I went to South Africa in the last week of November. I tested negative in RT-PCR tests at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIAL) in Bengaluru. But, on the third day of my isolation, itching in my throat and cough symptoms developed. I got the RT-PCR test done again at a private lab; the results confirmed the Covid-19 virus. Later, the samples were sent for genome sequencing by the civic agency, in which an Omicron variant was found,” he said in the video. He said that since the information was available to him, he did not panic and as per protocol, he got admitted to the designated hospital. “I isolated myself on arrival from South Africa and my family members didn’t catch the virus. Those who come from abroad should maintain distance and follow quarantine guidelines. If symptoms crop up, without wasting time and negligence, they should get tested and inform health authorities. If this is done, we can prevent the infection from spreading to neighbours and people around,” he said in the video. He was discharged from a designated hospital in Bengaluru on Tuesday, making him the first patient to recover from the Omicron variant in the state. Five primary contacts and 15 secondary contacts of the man were traced, and they all tested negative for Covid-19. Explaining his time in hospital, he said the treatment given to him was similar to his first infection. “The symptoms of throat itching, cough and tiredness were more severe the first time. This time there was no necessity for additional treatment… There is no separate treatment as such for the Omicron variant. Vitamin-C tablets and antibiotics were given. Since there was no tiredness and symptoms were too mild, I worked from the hospital ward for a week,” he said. Meanwhile, the 46-year-old government doctor, the second patient who had tested positive for Omicron without any travel history, has been discharged from hospital along with his family on Wednesday. They have been advised to home quarantine for a week. The doctor, Karnataka’s second Omicron case, along with his wife and two daughters were under treatment for 14 days at the hospital. Doctors said he tested negative twice in a gap of 24 hours. He had developed secondary infections due to low immunity and had continued to test positive till recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-reason-to-fear-says-karnataka-man-who-recovered-from-omicron-101639723132725.html

17-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC to deliver verdict on Air India’s plea against reinstatement of pilots||The Delhi high court on Friday will pronounce its judgment on a bunch of pleas by Air India against a single judge order directing the reinstatement of over 40 permanent and contractual pilots whose services were terminated last year on account of commercial slowdown in the wake of the Covid-induced lockdown.On June 1, the single judge quashed Air India’s decision to terminate the services of several pilots and refusal to accept the withdrawal of their resignations. The court had said that the back wages, including allowances, have to be paid at par with what in-service pilots were receiving and in accordance with the government rules. The terminated pilots had initially moved the court in July last year seeking directions to Air India to accept the withdrawal of the resignations tendered by them. Some pilots had initially tendered their resignations over the delay by Air India in disbursing pay and allowances. On August 13, 2020, Air India issued termination letters to several pilots including those who wanted to withdraw their resignations following which, the pilots moved the high court. Challenging the single judge’s order, Air India argued that once a pilot tenders resignation, the legal relationship of an employer-employee comes to an end with it and the resignation cannot be withdrawn subsequently.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Air India, had contended that under the applicable law, there is no need for a formal acceptance of resignation by the national carrier, and that the six-month notice period post-resignation is only to avoid any hardship to the passengers.Air India, which has been recently sold to the Tatas, earlier cited financial constraints and the impact of Covid-19 on the commercial functioning of the company for the termination before the single judge. A division bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh had reserved its order on October 29 and will pronounce its verdict on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-to-pronounce-verdict-on-air-india-s-plea-against-reinstatement-of-pilot-101639711312827.html

He has parked his veggie cart in an Old Delhi street, opposite a perfume shop. The lane is relatively quiet this afternoon. In fact, things are moving so slowly that Salman seems to be dozing off, with his arms resting lazily on a mound of phool gobhis. There being no customers for the moment, Salman, 22, gamely agrees to become a part of the Proust Questionnaire series in which folks are nudged to make “Parisian parlour confessions”, all to explore the citizens’ distinct experiences. Amused by the questions, the young man responds to some of them almost instantly. With others, he takes his time, thinking for long before making a considered reply. But soon customers start trooping in, and his thought process is frequently interrupted by shoppers coming over to get baingan, aloo, hari mirchi, neembu, pyaz and whatever else is on his cart.

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC employees ‘caught’ burning waste in open||With residents fighting tooth and nail over rising air pollution and urging political parties to announce ‘green manifesto’ ahead of elections, the municipal corporation (MC) staff is being repeatedly accused of adding to the pollution by burning the organic waste in parks and open public places. On Thursday too, the MC staffers were allegedly caught setting the organic waste on fire near the parking area of Rose Garden. Intriguingly the site is around 100 metres away from the official residence of mayor Balkar Sandhu and member of parliament (MP) Ravneet Bittu. Complaint submitted by Council of EngineersCouncil of Engineers have submitted a complaint against the MC staff authorities to the chief secretary, chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board and MC commissioner over the alleged acts of burning organic waste. A similar complaint has also been forwarded against Verka Milk plant officials for burning the organic waste in the premises on Thursday morning.  President, Council of Engineers Kapil Arora said, “Burning of waste adds to pollution and causes respiratory and skin diseases. It is the duty of MC to stop others from indulging in the illegal activity, but its own staff is acting against restriction orders issued by National Green Tribunal (NGT) and Supreme Court in the past. The employees also misbehave with the public when they oppose the burning of waste.” “Earlier too, complaints have been submitted with the senior officials, but to no avail. If MC and senior officials in the local bodies department failed to take action then we will be forced to move NGT,” said Arora. MC health officer Vipal Malhotra said that the department has not received any complaint against MC staffers indulging in illegal activity of burning waste in parks recently. The public should submit a complaint along with the proof and required action will be taken against the employees too. A minimum fine of ₹5000 is imposed on the violators who are caught burning the waste in open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-employees-caught-burning-waste-in-open-101639697870175.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Students shiver on cold floors, invigilators asleep at the wheel||Even though the mercury plummetted and a thick fog cloaked the city, shivering students were spotted haunched over the cold grimy floor as they took their final exam at Government High School, Sunet, near Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar on Tuesday.Citing inadequate infrastructure, students of Classes 6, 7 and 9 were made to take the exam on the floor. Several parents saw red when they spotted their children sitting on the dusty school grounds in the freezing cold through the damaged school wall. “Perhaps, our education minister should visit these schools before boasting of development in government schools. It was difficult to drive my children to school in the thick fog, and it was terrible to see them shivering while writing their exam with frozen hands,” said a parent.A senior teacher, on condition of anonymity, said, “In order to accommodate students taking their board exams, we had no other option, but to make the other students sit outside in the open. Besides, had we made the students sit inside, they would have made a noise and disturbed those sitting for their board exam. Our school building is under construction, and soon we will have more room.” Another teacher blamed the Punjab School Education Board for the date sheet clash. On December 12, students of Government Senior Secondary School, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), and Government High School, Giaspura, had been made to sit on the floor. A senior official in the local education department said that since there are double benches in the classrooms, two students cannot be seated together.A mockery of exams In mockery of the examination process, class 9 students were seen huddling together on mats and discussing the answers before filling their respective OMR ( Optical Mark Recognition) sheets. Though invigilators were present, they failed to check the students. The teachers’ blamed inadequate resources for conducting examinations for failing to keep the students honest. Meanwhile, parents and students have requested school authorities to delay the school timings in the wake of the fog and cold in the morning.District education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra, however, said that timings of the exams cannot be changed. 
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Residents block Haibowal Road for three hours||At a time when chief minister (CM) Charanjit Singh Channi was announcing different development projects in the city on Thursday, shopkeepers and residents of Haibowal main road staged a protest against the state government, congress councillor Harvinder Bhatia (Rocky) and MLA Rakesh Pandey over the pathetic condition of main Haibowal Road and choked sewer lines. The shopkeepers blocked the main road for over three hours. The protest obstructed smooth flow of traffic and public had to switch to diverted routes. The agitation was lifted after councillor Bhatia assured that the issue of choked sewer lines will be resolved by December 20 and the road construction work will be expedited.Protestors’ woesOne of the shopkeepers, Rajinder Matharoo stated that repeated complaints have been submitted with the MC officials, the councillor and MLA, but to no avail. The road has been dug up for over seven months and the work has still not been completed despite it being the main road. Sewer water accumulation and filthy conditions are adding to the woes, but the councillor and authorities are not bothered. “We were forced to stage a protest and will again raise an agitation if the issue of choked lines is not resolved by December 20, as assured by the councillor. The business has been affected badly due to the potholed road,” said the shopkeeper.The shopkeepers said that road cave-in incidents have also taken place in the past and two occupants had a narrow escape when a road portion caved in and their car got stuck in the pit in the month of October. Road accidents are also taking place due to potholed road and business has been impacted badly, but the authorities are not paying heed to the issue.Same state at Jassiyan Road Former district president of BJP and former councillor Rajiv Katna stated that the area has been completely ignored by the MC, councillor Bhatia and MLA Rakesh Pandey. Even the shopkeepers at Jassiyan Road had staged a protest over the pathetic condition of the road last week. The public is bearing the brunt for the apathy of authorities and elected representatives.Despite attempts made to reach councillor Bhatia and MLA Pandey, they were not available for comments. MC SDO, Anshul Garcha stated that the work of laying the sewer lines got delayed due to ongoing pandemic and monsoon season. The issue regarding the sewer lines will be resolved in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-residents-block-haibowal-road-for-three-hours-101639697810103.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Privatisation of PSBs: Banks employees start two-day strike||As part of a nationwide protest against the Union government’s decision to privatise two public sector banks, employees of state-run banks under the banner of United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) kicked off a two-day strike on Thursday.Staging a protest outside Canara Bank near Bharat Nagar Chowk, hundreds of employees said that the move will benefit corporate houses and public money was being handed over to private hands. Employees of the State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India and Canara Bank among others are participating in the strike.The rally was addressed by Punjab Bank Employees’ Federation president PR Mehta, Joint Trade Union Council general secretary DP Maur, UFBU convenor Naresh Gaur among others.Mehta said, “Public sector banks act as catalysts in economic development of the nation in general and particularly for underprivileged sections of the society and backward regions. Nationalised banks have played a major role in the development of agriculture, small trade, small business, SSI, transport and in upliftment of weaker sections of the society. In 2008, when the world economy had plunged into a deep financial crisis and meltdown, it was PSBs, which helped the Indian economy survive.”“There is an argument that PSBs are not doing well and hence to ensure better efficiency, these banks have to be privatised. We all know that many private banks have failed and closed down in the past due to mismanagement. On the other hand, all the PSBs are doing well and earning substantial profit. Gross operating profit of public sector banks in the last 10 years is ₹14,78,289 crores,” he added.Gaur stated that the protest is against the Union government’s plan of tabling the Banking Laws Amendment Bill 2021 in the Parliament session and plans to privatise two public sector banks.“ Bad loans and non-performing assets (NPA) in the banks have been increasing every year due to corporate defaulters. Instead of taking action against them, the government wants to white wash the balance sheets by shifting these bad loans from the books of the banks to the assets reconstruction Company or the Bad Bank. This will only benefit the corporate defaulters and remove all the bad loans from public glare and silently write them off. Banks and Insurance companies deal with people’s money. Privatising them means handing over people’s money to private vested interests,” said Gaur, while adding that the agitation will continue in the coming time and protests/strikes will be planned as per the decision taken by UFBU at national level.A protest rally will be organised on the second day of strike on Friday outside State Bank of India near Fountain Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/privatisation-of-psbs-banks-employees-start-two-day-strike-101639697691961.html

Seeking quick resolution of the issue, industrialists said that closure of banks not only affects business at large, but also the credibility of suppliers and buyers due to delay in payments.All Industries and Trade Forum president Badish Jindal said with banking transactions affected, the industry also has to pay interest due to delayed payment of bank loans. “The government on the other hand benefits from these strikes as interest payable on loans increases. Bank employees should not hold banking services hostage as the entire industry and the general are harassed and face monetary losses at large,” said Jindal.‘Production process delayed’ Janta Nagar Small-Scale Manufacturers’ Association president Jaswinder Thukral said, “We could not pay for raw material, which will delay the production process. It is the industry which bears the brunt of these strikes.”Asserting that the striking bank did not intend to harass the public or the industry, UFBU convener Naresh Gaur said, “Our salaries are also deducted on strike days. If we wanted to harass the public, we would have announced a strike on Saturday and banking services would have been hit for four consecutive days. We only want to stop the government from privatising the bank sectors, which will only benefit corporate houses. We urge representatives of others sectors to support our agitation as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ufbu-strike-public-industry-on-receiving-end-as-transactions-worth-800-cr-hit-in-ludhiana-101639697570112.html

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Dalai Lama holds first in-person meeting since March 2020||The doors of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama’s palace at McLeodganj have been reopened for public for in-person audience for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak in March last year. The Dalai Lama granted first in-person audience to Sikyong (president) of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) Penpa Tsering on Wednesday. It was also Tsering’s first official in-person audience with the Dalai Lama since he assumed the responsibility of Sikyong in May 2021. Speaking to the media after the meeting, Tsering pledged to work towards the resolution of the Sino-Tibetan conflict. “Since March 2020, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has not met any member of the public in-person due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, he has resumed in-person meetings with the public and the first audience was granted to me as Sikyong,” said Tsering. Gradually, the Dalai Lama will start granting audiences to one or two members of the public, although it still would not be possible for the large majority of the people, he said.Tsering’s last in-person audience with the Dalai Lama was in October 2017, though he received four online audiences with the spiritual leader after assuming the office “I also pledge to perform my duties with the blessings and advice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to serve the Tibetan public and our common cause,” Tsering said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalai-lama-holds-first-in-person-meeting-since-march-2020-101639695109901.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal growers seek ban on Iranian apples||A couple of weeks after India suspended the import of kiwi fruit from Iran due to a rise in pest-infested consignments, apple growers in Himachal Pradesh have now demanded a blanket ban on apples and kiwis imported from Iran and Turkey. There is a growing fear among the fruit growers about harmful pests spreading to their orchards from the foreign apples and kiwis. The fruit growers from Himachal Pradesh have sought intervention of the Union agriculture ministry in banning fruits from Iran, Turkey and Uzbekistan. “Kiwis and apples from Iran and Turkey pose a great risk to flora and fauna of our country. We have requested the government on getting a proper quarantine protocol followed and checked on Iranian apples. These apples are also infected and being dumped on a large scale,” said Lokinder Bisht, president of Progressive Apple Growers Association. “If these incessant and uncontrolled imports are left unchecked, they would make this cash crop completely unviable to grow in our region,” he added. The growers’ association had last year written to the government on banning kiwis and apples from Iran. Agriculture ministry’s National Plant Protection Organisation had banned the import of kiwis from Iran from December 7. However, no decision had yet been taken on apples. Imported apples and kiwis have increased the threat of cataclysmic codling moths and pests spreading in apple orchards. Apples alone in Himachal are a ₹6,000-crore economy and sustain 1.75 lakh families. Of the 12 districts, apple is grown in seven with Shimla, Kullu and Kinnaur being major apple-producing areas. Kiwi farming is also gaining ground in Himachal. Codling moth, which is unknown in India, was detected in some of the Iranian apple consignments in a few cases in Bihar and Bengal this year. Horticulture experts observe that the codling moths can cause extensive damage to the crop. Codling moth can go through two or three cycles per year. They appear at the time apple trees are in bloom to lay eggs on the leaves or fruit. The eggs hatch within six to 20 days and tiny young larvae bore into the end of the small fruit and tunnel to the core where they feed on the seed, said horticulture expert SP Bhardwaj, former associate director at Regional Fruit Research Station, Mashobra. Consumers in the National Capital Region are complaining about “white insects” in kiwi fruit this year. Iranian kiwis are selling for ₹7 per piece in retail these days. “Codling moth infestation in apples is visible at Bihar and Bengal. Let common apple consumers get informed about this. It will be a huge step for the whole community,” said a fruit importer from Ahmedabad, who requested anonymity.Iranian apples are coming in non-recyclable plastic crates that pose double risk to the environment. Russia has banned the import of Iranian apples following the high infection rate last year. Iran has witnessed a bumper crop of apples this year and the fruit is being dumped in markets in the country as the Union ministry has not yet banned the import.Farmers say the unregulated import of infected fruits and plant material from Iran does not only pose a grave risk to the apple and kiwi industry of Himachal and Arunachal Pradesh, but also to the consumers across the country.
17-12-2021||Delhi||7 arrested for operating fake call centres in Tilak Nagar||The Delhi Police on Thursday said they have busted a call centre operating from west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar that was being used to dupe job aspirants.The racket’s alleged mastermind was arrested along with six telecallers after the officers of the cyber cell of Shahdara district raided the call centre on Tuesday. Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said the frauds have cheated more than 150 people in the name of getting them jobs at top companies in Delhi-NCR.“The alleged accused were obtaining lists of job seekers from a job search site, contacted them and offered jobs. When the aspirants showed interest in the job offers, the cheats tricked them into paying between ₹30,000 and ₹50,000 online payment for registration and other processing fee,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.The DCP said that the cyber cell registered a cheating case on the complaint of one Pratigya Chaddha, who was duped of ₹30,000 in the name of a teacher’s job in a reputed school.“The accused told her that the school has selected her resume, and told her to pay ₹100 as registration fee through the school’s website. When she clicked the link, ₹30,000 were deducted from her account. When she tried to contact the person, his number was found not in service. She then filed a complaint and a case was registered,” said an investigator.The cons were tracked to a building in west Delhi, and it was raided. “The mastermind of the racket, Hemant Kohli,29, was arrested along with his associate Vinay Kumar,31, and five women telecallers,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/7-arrested-for-operating-fake-call-centres-in-tilak-nagar-101639693278258.html
17-12-2021||Delhi||SC asks for long-term pollution fix||The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed satisfaction over a slew of measures taken by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR, even as it directed the commission to invite suggestions from the public and experts to find a “long-term solution” to the problem.“We are going to list this matter now in the first week of February. We are directing the commission to invite suggestions from experts and public regarding long-term solutions to combat the issue of air pollution and also have a solution by the independent expert body,” said a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana.The bench, which included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, also took note of CAQM’s affidavit filed a day ago that a decision on the resumption of construction activities and reopening of schools will be taken by Friday.During the brief hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government and CAQM, took the bench through the latest affidavit, detailing the steps taken and the latest orders of the commission relaxing various curbs on industrial processes and operation of factories and plants.When the CJI remarked the air quality is “very poor today”, Mehta replied that an expert committee is working to ascertain a long-term solution to the problem of air pollution so that knee-jerk reaction for every year is not needed.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) continued in the “very poor” zone on Thursday, with a reading of 368 at 4pm, up from 363 on Wednesday, according to data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). In the last 16 days, Delhi has recorded one “severe”, 10 ‘very poor’ and five ‘poor’ AQI days. The city recorded at least one “moderate” air day during the same period last year, as well as in 2019.On his part, senior counsel Vikas Singh, who appeared for the petitioner in the PIL on pollution control measures, submitted that the issue requires a scientific and a permanent solution instead of annual measures at the intervention of the court. The bench agreed with his views and said that CAQM will, therefore, invite suggestions from experts and the general public on the subject.Filing its affidavit on Wednesday, CAQM informed the bench that the decisions on reopening schools and lifting the ban on construction in Delhi-NCR will be taken by Friday.“The representations put forth by various project proponents and associations in the building and construction/ demolition sector, as also by the association of schools/educational institutions are under active examination and consideration by the commission and a decision on these would also be taken soon on or before December 17, based on the impact of the relaxations given above,” CAQM’s affidavit said.Schools in the national capital have been shut on four instances since March last year – twice owing to concerns over Covid-19, and twice because of air pollution, amid concerns expressed by experts over learning loss with little to no respite from the hazardous air even indoors.The Delhi government on December 2 closed all schools in the city, hours after it was questioned by the top court over reopening schools despite high pollution levels. Later that day, the air quality monitoring panel came out with a fresh order expanding the closure order to all of NCR.The ban on construction was imposed by the top court on November 24. However, on December 10, the court permitted CAQM to consider requests for relaxing the construction ban in the wake of improvement in air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-asks-for-long-term-pollution-fix-101639692430488.html
17-12-2021||Gurugram||Namaz row: Contempt plea against top officials||A former Rajya Sabha member has approached the Supreme Court with a petition to initiate contempt proceedings against the Haryana chief secretary and the state’s director general of police over the recent row involving problems faced by Muslims in offering namaz at public spaces in Gurugram.The petition filed by Mohammad Adeeb, a resident of Gurugram, pointed out that a few persons have been attempting to spread hatred and communal disharmony against Muslims following which they feel threatened and have addressed several complaints to the police, which have gone unanswered. Lately, truckloads of persons are approaching namaz sites and raising communally divisive slogans and spewing hatred against the religious community through social media posts, the petition said.“Such hateful campaign, communally divisive incidents and rampant dissemination of propaganda through use of social media, is easily identifiable and is being perpetrated by a limited number of unruly members of the society who are continuously giving effect to their nefarious plans to further hatred and communal disharmony,” the petition said.The petition filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi referred to the July 2018 decision passed by the Supreme Court directing police and state authorities to take both preventive and remedial steps to prevent incidents of hate crimes, mob lynching and communal violence.“The continuous inaction, apathy of the state machinery and failure of the local law enforcement agencies and administration to prevent such incidents or to find a solution to the crises before it spirals into a monstrosity, is precisely what had been indicated by this court in Tehseen S Poonawalla case (of 2018) and is thus clearly a contempt of this court’s direction,” the petition said. The petition has named chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal and DGP PK Agrawal as contemnors.The petition said Muslims of Gurugram have been performing Friday prayers peacefully and without causing any disturbance at 37 open spaces for lack of places of worship. This was being done after approval from the relevant government authorities, including municipal and police functionaries. “In the recent months, there has been a constant rise in incidents revolving around the said Friday prayers at the behest of certain identifiable hooligans, with no local support, who portray themselves falsely in the name of religion and seek to create an atmosphere of hatred and prejudice against one community across the city,” the contempt petition said.“The perpetrators are well-known to the respondents/alleged contemnors herein, who have continuously failed to take any effective measures and have rather been bystanders in the entire controversy,” the former independent member from the Rajya Sabha said.He pointed out that Gurugram is an industrial township where persons of different faiths and religions come to work and such provocative actions are witnessed during working hours when people from the neighbouring areas of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh gather.The Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind made complaints to the police, followed by local residents of all faiths, to take note of the growing hate campaign at the behest of a few persons aimed at singling out one community and creating an atmosphere of hatred and lawlessness. “By October 29, the local police, instead of taking any action against such communally divisive incidents, chose to change the pre-approved locations of Friday prayers,” the petition stated, adding that the intensity of hooliganism has increased over the past months every Friday as people are arriving in trucks, in a manner of pre-planned conspiracy to create hateful and communally divisive atmosphere at the places where namaz is offered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-contempt-plea-against-top-officials-101639691692390.html
17-12-2021||Delhi||HC stays ban on cross-gender massages in Delhi||The Delhi high court on Thursday allowed licensed cross-gender massage spas to operate across the national capital even as it called illegal spas offering prostitution services in the city “unfortunate”.In an interim order, justice Rekha Palli said that just because the city police and the municipal corporations had failed to keep a strict check on the prostitution rackets operating in the garb of spas, there was no reasonable connection between the absolute ban and preventing prostitution at spas.“I am, however, of the prima facie view that merely because the corporations and Delhi Police have not been able to take effective steps to ensure that no illegal spas are operated in Delhi and the ones holding licences do not indulge in any illegal activity whatsoever, this kind of absolute ban on cross-gender massages cannot be said to have any reasonable connection with the aim of the policy which purpose thereof seems to be regulation of the spas and ensure that no illegal trafficking or prostitution takes place in the city,” the court said in a verbal order.The court was hearing a batch of petitions by owners of several spa centres and therapists challenging the Delhi government’s policy guideline prohibiting cross-gender massages and the consequent directions passed by municipal corporations.The court also said that the policy to impose a ban was framed without any consultation with professionals involved in spa services. It said that while the authorities ought to keep a strict check on prostitution rackets, the livelihood of people was getting affected and hence such a ban could not be continued.It directed the three municipal corporations and the city police to inspect areas under their jurisdiction within a week, and take appropriate steps to close all unlicensed spas. It asserted that in case of any illegality, the police should register appropriate cases and immediately pass the information to the municipal bodies for action. “It is however made clear that just because this court has stayed the operation of clause 2b of the guidelines, none if the petitioners or the therapists will carry out any activity which is not expected,” the judge said. Clause 2b of the impugned guidelines prohibits cross-gender massages.Senior advocate Sachin Datta, appearing for one of the petitioners, said that application of the said clause has been excluded from spas and massage centres in physiocentres operated in government or private hospitals or any other hospital run by autonomous bodies.Appearing for the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, told the court that the ban was meant to protect women and children from the menace of prostitution at the spa centres.
17-12-2021||Delhi||Pollution levels worse in small towns: Study||Winter smog and the accompanying severe air pollution is a problem usually associated with Delhi-NCR, but a new analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found that when pollution spikes during winter, all of northern India experiences smog episodes, with otherwise cleaner, small towns matching or exceeding pollution levels reported in Delhi-NCR.The study, released on Thursday, also found that while there are episodes of smog in November across the entire northern region, it lingers longer in Delhi-NCR and Uttar Pradesh for the rest of the winter as compared to Punjab and north Haryana.“Atmospheric changes during winter that include inversion, calm conditions, change in wind direction and a seasonal drop in ambient temperature across north India entrap pollutants. This is further tripped into the ‘severe’ category by smoke from farm fires and Diwali firecrackers during November. But air quality improves from ‘severe’ to ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ categories in cities of Punjab and North Haryana post stubble fire season but it remains in the ‘very poor’ category in NCR and UP till February,” the analysis found.For the study, data from 127 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) across 56 cities was analysed as part of the air quality tracker initiative of CSE’s Urban Data Analytics Lab. Annual and seasonal trends in PM2.5 concentration were analysed from January 1, 2019, till November 30, 2021--the findings showed that while Delhi’s average PM2.5 concentration during winter was nearly 4.5 times the national safe standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre, smaller towns such as Agra, Vrindavan and Firozabad fared much worse. “For instance, smaller cities such as Vrindavan, Agra, and Firozabad have a comparatively lower annual average of PM2.5 than Delhi but during the early winter of 2021, their weekly average PM2.5 levels exceeded that of Delhi. While the annual average level of Delhi is 97µg/m³ and that of Agra is 78 µg/m³ -- 20% lower --the weekly average in Agra touched 282µg/m³ and exceeded Delhi’s weekly average of 270µg/m³ by 5%,” said the analysis. Similarly, the weekly average of Vrindavan’s PM2.5 was found to be nearly 286µg/m³ and that of Firozabad 272µg/m³. However, both Noida and Ghaziabad exceeded these levels. While Noida’s weekly average PM2.5 was 292µg/m³, Ghaziabad’s was 360µg/m³.“This analysis has shined a spotlight on [small] cities for us. This shows even smaller cities with lower annual levels record pollution levels that are as bad or even worse than Delhi,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, stating action against pollution was needed across a much larger area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollution-levels-worse-in-small-towns-study-101639691207388.html

There have, however, been incentives for students who attended offline classes. A parent whose children attend a private school in the city described how the school has given special awards to students who have been coming for offline classes, before adding that the children attending classes online have to deal with glitches and often feel neglected.Discussing the situation for exams, Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents Association (CPA) said, “Looking at the situation, the exams conducted at school level must be taken online. Further for board classes also should look into holding the remaining term one exams online.”While Class 10 exams for both CBSE and ICSE boards have already been completed, Class 12 still has a few pending.Goyal also revealed that some private schools have also made it mandatory to attend offline classes, adding that it was an issue that the UT education department must look into. “While parents are afraid to come forward, whatsapp groups of most big schools all share this sentiment,” he added.Attendance remains highMeanwhile, private schools have insisted that attendance continues to remain high. HS Mamik, president of the Independent School Association (ISA), said, “Our attendance for junior classes has touched 99% and will stay high as parents feel that their children miss out on online classes.”Gurpreet Bakshi, administrator of St Kabir, added, “It remains to be seen whether there is any dip in attendance after we reopen for physical classes from Monday but the online model was successful for us earlier and we can make the hybrid model work. For the term one board exams we are still getting 100% attendance.”Department continues to monitor situationThe UT education department is keeping a close look at the Covid-19 situation. Prabhjot Kaur, district education officer (DEO), said, “We will monitor the cases and the winter vacation may be shifted and school level exams can be rescheduled seeing the situation. The rest we will go by the directions of the higher officials. All Covid protocol is being strictly followed in schools.”Officials further revealed that a total of three students had tested positive for Covid-19 in recent weeks, two of which are from private schools.

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||PGIMER: Only 50% doctors on National Digital Health Mission portal||The UT health department on Wednesday asked the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to speed up the registration of doctors for the National Digital Health Mission portal.As per the PGIMER’s own data, around 50% of doctors have registered on the portal for the centre’s ambitious health project.“In a recent review meeting at union level, it was desired that the registration of doctors on NDHM portal has not been achieved up to optimum level in UT, Chandigarh. This is because not all the doctors of PGIMER have been registered so far. Institute must take required action towards completion of 100% registration”, the health department’s notice to PGIMER read.Explaining the delay, Dr SS Pandav, the nodal officer of the project at PGIMER, said, “The project is delayed as the institute has several mobile doctors. A number of doctors leave and join every month. We are organizing registration camps in each department and providing technical support to ensure timely completion.”Dr Suman Singh, director of the health services, meanwhile, stressed on the importance of completing the process, saying, “Doctors’ registration at the portal is necessary as it will allow people who have already got their health IDs to use the facility.”GMCH-32 numbers also lowThe UT health department also highlighted GMCH-32’s low numbers, saying only 35% of the doctors have registered. Elaborating on the issue, Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent at GMCH-32, said, “As per hospital’s data, around 90% of the doctors registered at the national portal. Initially, some doctors had not uploaded certain documents that later became necessary and only 35% of the registrations were regarded as complete. We are asking doctors to complete the process quickly.”46% of UT’s population register for health IDsHaving launched the National Digital Health Mission in August last year, the UT health department has already made the health ID cards of over 4.93 lakh residents of Chandigarh, which accounts for around 46% of the total population. BOX: Through digital health IDs, issued under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (AB-DM), people will allow the registered doctors and medical institutes (both from government and private facilities) to access all of their medical records, including digital test reports, medications, and diagnoses. This will also provide doctors access to their patients’ whole medical history in one place - but only with their agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-only-50-doctors-on-national-digital-health-mission-portal-101639689060764.html

In an order issued on Saturday, the DC said that he has been informed by the superintendent of police that residents of the colonies on the west side of the airbase are taking photos and videos of the landing and take-off of aircrafts. “Due to this, the confidentiality of the Air Force Station is breached and anti-social elements ran take undue advantage of any kind of untoward incident,” the order states. Vikram added that the decentralised airspace has to be regulated in view of the recent episodes of the misuse of drones and other media devices. Moreover, the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) has also provided the guidelines to regulate its use, he said. “Keeping in view the security situation apart from concerns of threat to privacy, nuisance and trespass, it is extremely dangerous to let unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) wander around in the skies within the territorial jurisdiction of Ambala,” the order further reads.The order will not be applied to police officers or other public servants. Any person found guilty of the violation of this order shall be prosecuted and punished under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Congress tells ticket seekers to submit applications by December 20||The Punjab Congress on Thursday kickstarted the process for selection of its candidates for the assembly elections in the state, asking ticket aspirants to submit their applications by December 20, even as the state election committee of the party held its first meeting here. Punjab Congress general secretary Yoginder Pal Dhingra said that all those keen to contest the upcoming polls would have to fill and give their applications with all relevant documents. “The application forms are available with district president and working presidents and on the Facebook page of the Congress. No application fee will be charged with the application,” he said, crediting state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu with the decision to waive off the fee. In the 2017 assembly elections, the state unit had taken application fee of ₹10,000 from each aspirant. As per the decision, all prospective candidates, including sitting MLAs, will be required to submit their applications. Sonia to take a final callThe state election committee (PEC) headed by Sidhu, which has been tasked with shortlisting candidates, passed a resolution vesting all powers with regard to finalising the candidates with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. When the resolution was proposed, Punjab Youth Congress president Brinder Dhillon said the candidate selection should be left to the high command because it takes decision in larger interests of the party. “Dhillon said that Channi may not have had the support among the MLAs for the chief minister’s position but the high command selected him and they also selected Sidhu as the state chief and both are doing good job,” said a party leader who was present in the meeting. The PYC chief also sought due representation for women and youth leaders. ‘Generals should take on generals’Punjab Congress working president and MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra suggested that party’s generals (senior leaders) should take on general of other parties instead of focusing on their seats, said sources. The suggestion drew a quip from the chief minister who said that the MLA was probably angling to for a face-off with (SAD chief Sukhbir Singh) Badal. To which, the MLA said that he was willing to contest from any constituency decided by the party, reiterating that generals should fight against generals, they added. After the meeting, Sidhu said the committee passed the resolution giving all rights for selection of candidates to the Congress president. “We will also fight the elections unitedly, giving responsibility to each worker as per their capability. Tickets will be allocated on merit,” he said. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar, Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary, former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, former state Congress presidents Shamsher Singh Dullo and HS Hanspal were among those who attended the meeting. Screening committee chairman Ajay Maken and two other members will meet members of the state election committee, ticket seekers and others over the next three days. “Along with my colleagues Sh. Krishna Allavaru and Sh. Chandan Yadav – as an exercise of the Screening Committee – I would be meeting aspiring Congress workers at Punjab Congress Bhawan, Chandigarh,” Maken tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-congress-tells-ticket-seekers-to-submit-applications-by-december-20-101639688209288.html

Addressing a press conference here, after meeting all the stakeholders engaged in the election process and taking stock of the arrangements, he said instructions have already been issued to the state government on November 1 that transfer and posting of officials, especially those involved in the revision of electoral rolls and other poll preparations, should be done only after permission from the election commission. He said representatives of the political parties have requested the commission to take stern measures to create a conducive atmosphere for free-and-fair elections. “Most political parties voiced concern regarding partisan behaviour by the local administration. Some political parties also complained that the local administration was not granting permission for holding rallies at designated government grounds in a free manner. They also raised the issue of law and order situation and the use of cash, liquor, drugs and other freebies during the forthcoming elections,” Chandra said. The commission has asked the state excise department to keep a vigil on the movement of liquor stock, he said. “The NCB director will be asked to check the flow of drugs during the elections. The income tax department, directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) and enforcement directorate (ED) have been told to form joint teams to check flow of cash,” he said. Chandra who was accompanied by election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, and state chief electoral officer S Karuna Raju, announced that keeping the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in mind, the number of voters per polling booth has been reduced from 1,500 to 1,200. “1,478 more polling booths have been added, taking the total number to 24,689. We will also ensure voters verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines and webcasting at all booths,” he announced. Referring to the polling percentage (77.4%) in 2017, the CEC said efforts will be made to better the number by focusing on booths where voting figures have fallen in the previous elections. He also assured adequate deployment of the central forces during the elections, underlining the concern for Punjab being a border state. “We will assess the situation to decide the deployment,” Chandra said. Chandra said the commission was identifying sensitive polling booths and an action plan will be unveiled accordingly. He also said fake news on the social media will also be under the EC glare. --- IN NUMBERS 2.02 crore: Total voters 2.74 lakh: New voters 902: Gender ratio (per 1,000 males) 24,689: Total polling booths January 5, 2022: Last date for revision of electoral rolls March 27, 2022: Tenure of present assembly ends

Just like Mamata Banerjee’s success in West Bengal, we will also defeat all the forces pitted against us to emerge victorious in 2022,” Sukhbir told mediapersons after addressing an impressive rally in favour of party candidate Raj Kumar Gupta in Sujanpur. Earlier, Sukhbir’s roadshow received a warm welcome upon entry at Sujanpur. He said “empty chairs” at events being presided over by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi were a testament to the popularity of both Channi and the Congress party. “The countdown of the Congress has started and the frustration is evident from the infighting,” Sukhbir said. The SAD president also asked AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal why did his government file an affidavit in the Supreme Court seeking the closure of four power thermal plants in Punjab. He said the Delhi government had similarly filed affidavits, demanding registration of criminal cases against Punjab farmers for burning crop residue. Asserting that the SAD will never ask Punjabis to fill forms as the Congress had done earlier and the AAP is doing now, Sukhbir said, “We have always stood by all commitments made in our election manifesto. Be it free power to farmers or welfare schemes like Shagun and the Aata Dal, all were implemented immediately after government formation.” The SAD president also participated in a bike rally from Pathankot to Sujanpur. He also addressed gatherings at Naushehra Majha Singh in Batala at party leader Ramandeep Singh’s residence in support of the party’s Batala candidate Sucha Singh Chhotepur.

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chattopadhyaya replaces Sahota as officiating DGP of Punjab||In a late-night reshuffle, the Punjab government appointed Sidharth Chattopadhyaya as officiating director general of police replacing IPS Sahota. The development comes as a surprise as Sahota is considered close to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and continued on the post even after pressure from Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Sidhu to remove him. Along with his new assignment, Chattopadhyaya, a 1986-batch IPS officer, will continue to hold the charge of chief director, vigilance bureau. Sahota will continue as DGP, PAP, Jalandhar. Sahota, officials, privy to the matter, say has himself stepped down expressing his inability to “follow some orders which the government wants him to execute under pressure from the certain political quarters.” Interestingly, the Union Public Service Commission has set October 5 as the cut-off date with criterion of six months of remaining service for the selection of the state police chief. This has put Chattopadhyaya and 1988-batch IPS officer Rohit Chaudhary out of the DGP race. The much-awaited meeting of the UPSC for shortlisting a panel of three officers from the state government’s list of 10 has been scheduled on December 21 in New Delhi. According to the Supreme Court guidelines set for the selection of a DGP, only those officers with at least six months of service left will be considered for the job.

Did we elect politicians for our protection or for the murder of innocents?” Charuni told mediapersons.Charuni was in Karnal on Thursday to pay tributes to Sant Baba Ram Singh, who had committed suicide at the Singhu border. He hailed Singh’s sacrifice in support of farmers’ agitation.Without naming anybody, Charuni raised questions over farmer leaders objecting to his decision to contest polls: “The elected leaders are killing people and still we say that we are apolitical. I think it is also a crime if you elect people with criminal backgrounds.”He said the government was framing policies for the corporate houses and industrialists, and now they were left with no other option but to enter politics, as political reforms were needed in the country. Charuni clarified that he will not contest the Punjab assembly polls, but he will field candidates: “Mai khud chunav nahi lad raha hu, magar ladwa raha hu.” He also made it clear that he will not use the name of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of several farmer unions of the country, in the Punjab elections, as the morcha leaders had announced that they will not allow anybody to use its name for polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charuni-demands-immediate-action-against-ajay-mishra-101639684068858.html

17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly session starts today: Congress set to raise storm over recruitment scam||The winter session of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha, beginning on Friday, is unlikely to be a smooth affair for the ruling BJP-JJP coalition government with the principal opposition party, the Congress, already on the offensive on the issue of alleged irregularities in recruitments.Already the Congress has moved at least nine calling-attention notices and one adjournment motion on the issue of paper leak, setting the stage for a heated exchange on a host of issues.If the hullabaloo the Congress has already raised over what it terms “cash-for-job-scams”, involving the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) and the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC), is of any indication, the opposition is set to create pandemonium in the House.“There are plenty of burning issues such as recruitment scandal, unemployment, law and order, and the problems farmers have been facing,” said Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader.“We will force the government to hold a meaningful debate on these issues, especially recruitment scams, troubling the citizens of the state,” he added.The opposition will also seek to target the state government on the farmers’ plight and their demand for a legal backing for minimum support price.Hooda said the shocking irregularities in recruitment and bribes being paid to get government jobs had fully exposed the state government. Alleging that the recruitment mafia had been selling jobs like goods at a grocery store, he reiterated the demand for a probe by a sitting high court judge.By upping the ante on alleged irregularities in recruitments and bribes paid for jobs, the Congress is striking at the root of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s claims about “mission merit” in recruitment and people getting government jobs without “parchi-kharchi”.Khattar has been countering the Opposition onslaught saying that transparency is being exercised in recruitments being done by the HSSC and HPSC, and that the state government has provided 83,000 government jobs over a period of seven years without ‘parchi-kharchi’.Speaker holds BAC meetingAhead of the first sitting of the House on Friday at 2pm, Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta held a business advisory committee (BAC) meeting to decide the duration of the session.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, home minister Anil Vij, deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal attended the meeting, and agreed to hold the session till December 22. According to the speaker, the Vidhan Sabha secretariat has received 273 starred and 173 unstarred questions, besides 33 calling-attention notices. On Friday, the Haryana Private Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021 will be tabled.The amendments in the recruitment procedure of teaching and non-teaching posts in the universities of Haryana is also set to rock the House proceedings on Friday as at least 11 MLAs, including Bharat Bhushan Batra, Geeta Bhukkal, Aftab Ahmed and Jagbir Singh Malik have moved a calling-attention notice on this issue.Even as the winter session is being held after the Centre repealed the three farm laws, the issues revolving around farmers are likely to dominate the House proceedings.The repeal of three farm laws has come as a political relief for the BJP-JJP coalition government in Haryana that had been fire-fighting the law and order as a fallout of the farmer agitation for over a year.But the opposition MLAs, including a section of the independents and INLD’s lone MLA, Abhay Chautala, are set to generate heat on the treasury benches on issues bothering the cultivators.

The much-awaited meeting of the UPSC for shortlisting a panel of three officers from the state government’s list of 10 has been scheduled on December 21 in New Delhi. According to the Supreme Court guidelines set for the selection of a DGP, only those officers with at least six months of service left will be considered for the job. A senior state government official privy to the development confirmed the UPSC setting October 5 as the cut-off date. Chattopadhyaya and Chaudhary are scheduled to retire on March 31, 2022. As Chattopadhyaya’s name was being backed strongly by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for the top job, the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government had had hurriedly sent 10 names to UPSC on September 30 evening.The government wanted to ensure that he be considered at any cost, it is learnt. A senior official in the chief minister’s office said, “The reason behind the UPSC considering October 5 as the cut-off date was that Dinkar Gupta continued in the top post till October.” Now, seven officers will be considered for the job. They are officiating DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota of 1988 batch, Dinkar Gupta, BK Bhawra and Parbodh Kumar of 1987 batch, Sanjeev Kalra and Parag Jain of 1989 batch and BK Uppal of 1991 batch. Officials said it was not clear whether Gupta’s name would be considered by the UPSC for the panel of three officers as the entire process for replacement had started after the state government removed him as DGP. The government will pick one officer from the panel of three for the post. The Punjab chief secretary will also be part of the meeting with the UPSC panel while officiating DGP Sahota, himself being a contender for the post, won’t be participating. Usually, the incumbent DGP is expected to be part of the meeting with the UPSC to shortlist the candidates. Bone of contention between CM, Sidhu The appointment of the police chief has been a bone of contention between chief minister CM Channi and Sidhu in poll-bound Punjab. Sidhu had criticised Channi’s move to appoint Sahota as DGP, saying as head of the Bureau of Investigation (BoI) during the SAD-BJP government he conducted a probe into the Bargari sacrilege and termed desecrations as handiwork of two local youths and their foreign handlers. With the UPSC deciding the cut-off date, a section of the Sidhu camp wants Bhawra to get the top job, it is learnt.

Sidhu’s backing of Kamil is a major setback to Jagtar Singh Jagga Hisowal, the sitting MLA from Raikot, who had only recently quit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and joined the Congress. In his address, Sidhu added that Punjab has become a state that was running only on reputation, but was extremely low on income and very high on debts. “You should vote for Congress to save the next generations and to save Punjab,” he told the gathering, assuring the people of bringing in fresh policies and a new beginning for the state with an innovative model of governance, if voted to power in the forthcoming elections. “Everyone should be part of the election process,” he added. “Punjab khokhla hui janda hai (currently Punjab’s sources are depleting),” said Sidhu in his address. “I will be representing Punjab and showing a new Punjab model,” he asserted.PROMISES DOUBLING WAGESOF GRAIN MARKET LABOURERS In Moga, Sidhu promised labourers involved in the loading and unloading of foodgrain (‘Palledaar Mazdoors’) that they would be paid directly into their bank accounts and the contractor system between them and food procurement agencies would be scrapped.“I am promising you, all Palledaars (labourers) will be made free from contractors. You will be paid directly in your account by the state government,” he said at an event that Foodgrain and Allied Workers Union, an organisation of palledaar union, had organised. He also promised that these labourers will get a minimum of ₹3.5 per gunny bag. Now, these workers are getting a maximum of ₹1.8 per bag by contractors, who hire them after getting the tender from food procurement agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/i-am-new-representative-of-people-in-2022-sidhu-101639683348805.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Will take Congress ministers to task for pushing Punjab under debt: Kejriwal at Lambi rally||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that after being voted to power, their party will hold ministers of the current Congress government accountable for making Punjab a debt-ridden state. Addressing the party’s maiden election rally at politically important assembly segment of Lambi, which is represented in the Vidhan Sabha by former five-time CM Parkash Singh Badal since 1997, Kejriwal appealed to the voters to test AAP in Punjab for “one time”.“The guilty will be identified and brought to justice,” said the Delhi CM at the event named ‘Ik mauka Kejriwal nu’ (one chance to Kejriwal) where the party leadership highlighted the issue of Punjab’s debt of ₹3 lakh crore.“Several Punjab politicians have stashed ill-gotten money in Swiss bank accounts. If voted to power, the AAP government will expose them. The Congress government in Punjab is ‘nautankibaz’ and the ‘most corrupt ever in India,” he claimed.Of the state’s estimated annual budget ₹1.70 lakh crore, ₹34,000 crore is swindled in political corruption, said Kejriwal, adding that financial crunch gets reflected in the poor facilities in key sectors like education and healthcare. He sought one chance for the party to introduce people-oriented programmes like free medical treatment for all, strengthening infrastructure of government schools and providing a monthly grant of ₹1,000 each to women above 18 years. Accusing CM Charanjit Singh Channi of patronising the sand mafia, the AAP supremo said Channi indulged in political gimmickry and pushed a false narrative to hide the non-performance of the Congress government. He slammed the government for canechaging qualified teachers demanding government jobs.“The pre-poll promises like loan waiver for farmers, enhancing old-age pension, distribution of smartphones to students were not fulfilled. Channi’s announcement of lowering rates of sand, cable TV subscription and electricity rates have still not been executed,” he said.“Till date, the Congress has ruled the state for 25 years whereas the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was at the helm for 19 years. The two parties took turns to rule Punjab and Punjabis continue to suffer. If we fail to implement the Delhi model of governance in Punjab, change us next time,” he said.No reference to Badal family in their bastionIn his speech, Kejriwal kept the focus of his attack on CM Channi and his predecessor Captain Amarinder Singh and made no reference to the Badal family, including SAD chief Sukhbir Badal and former union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who represents the Bathinda Lok Sabha seat. Also, he made no reference to the BJP that is preparing to contest the state elections on its own for the first time.The SAD has not announced its candidate from the Lambi segment yet.AAP state president Bhagwant Mann said their candidate from Lambi Gurmeet Singh Khuddian carries the legacy of his father late Jagdev Singh Khudian, an Akali Dal (Mann) MP from Faridkot. Khuddian, a former president of Muktsar district Congress, had quit the party in July this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-take-congress-ministers-to-task-for-pushing-punjab-under-debt-kejriwal-at-lambi-rally-101639683171402.html

17-12-2021||Delhi||10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi to lose registry on Jan 1||An estimated 200,000 diesel vehicles that are at least 10 years old will be de-registered by the Delhi government on January 1 according to a December 14 order issued by the Union Territory’s transport department that comes six years after the National Green Tribunal and three years after the country’s apex court passed orders to the effect in an effort to contain air pollution in the National Capital Region. “In compliance of the direction of the NGT, the transport department de-registered a number of vehicles; however, in the meantime, a new set of diesel vehicles completing more than 10 years in Delhi is due for de-registration. Accordingly, the transport department will de-register all such diesel vehicles in Delhi on 01.01.2022 which have completed/would be completing 10 years on that date,” read the order dated December 14, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT. While the NGT and Supreme Court orders also mentions petrol vehicles that are at least 15 years old, it says that they will not be de-registered immediately. Thus far, the Delhi transport department has de-registered at least 100,000 old diesel vehicles . There are an estimated 3.8 millionvehicles in Delhi that are technically overaged. Of these, 3.5 million are petrol vehicles that are at least 15 years old. The rest are diesel vehicles that are at least 10 years old. Transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said the huge difference is because the government first deregistered the oldest diesel vehicles in the city, meaning those that are at least 15 years old. Old petrol vehicles are not being targeted as of now because they are relatively less polluting than old diesel vehicles, Kundra said.According to the transport department’s order, the Delhi government has given three options to owners of such vehicles: either get a No Objection Certificate (NOC), which is issued by the state transport department, and sell it in any other state; retrofit it with approved electric kits; or scrap it.  The NOCs, issued by Delhi’s motor licensing officers can be used in some states to get the vehicle re-registered there. “It is illegal to drive any such vehicle without re-registration in that state,” said a senior transport official who asked not to be named.States where such vehicles are allowed to be sold and re-registered include Rajasthan, which allows it in all its districts; Bihar (18 districts); Maharashtra (26 districts); Uttar Pradesh (33); West Bengal (all districts but only BS-IV vehicles); and Meghalaya (all districts). The second option of retrofitting with electric kits, started on November 18 this year. “The transport department will soon empanel manufacturers of pure electric kits by approved testing agencies. Once empanelled, this will enable vehicles to continue plying here beyond 10 yrs,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on November 18.As for the third, Delhi has authorised six scrapper. “Owners of such vehicles,are advised to get such end of life vehicles scrapped through the authorised scrappers of the transport department, the list of which is available at the website of the department. The money is given as per the weight of the scrapped vehicle,”the transport official cited above said.The transport department conducts checks to identify such end of life vehicles from time-to-time. From September to November, the department conducted a drive wherein any diesel vehicle older than 15 years if found plying on city roads or parked in public spaces, is immediately impounded and sent to the scrapping yard.There is no penalty for driving such a vehicle because technically such vehicles are deemed de-registered. So, the department directly impounds such vehicles and sends them to the scrap yard.

Police said they are suspected to be drug peddlers and had come to supply drugs ahead of the New Year. Police said that during the night patrolling, a police team spotted the two, identified as Emek and Emul from Nigeria, walking near a private school and found their presence suspicious. Manoj Kumar, station house officer of DLF Phase 3 police station, said that police intercepted them and asked to show their passports and visas which they could not. “The suspects changed their statements frequently. Firstly they said they lived in Delhi and came here to meet their friends but could not share any details of their friends. Then they said they were staying here only. After a few minutes, they got agitated and fled from the spot,” he said. Both were caught after a chase of 200 metres in DLF Phase 3, but they still tried to escape and assaulted three policemen, Kumar said, adding that they could not furnish any details of their passports and visas and were staying in India illegally. Kumar said during questioning the suspects revealed that earlier they used to live in Sultanpur and Devli in Delhi. A case under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public function), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) of IPC, and Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and Section 12 (1A) of the Passport Act was registered at DLF Phase 3 police station on Wednesday night.

17-12-2021||Noida||Five members of ‘exam solver’ gang held in Noida||The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Wednesday arrested a gang of five men that was allegedly involved in impersonating candidates and appearing in their places for different government recruitment examinations, several of which had exam centres in Noida as well. Each candidate was charged around ₹6 to 7 lakh by the gang with a promise that they would clear the exams on behalf of them, said police on Thursday.All five suspects are residents of Aligarh and have been identified as Lalit, Anil Kumar, Yashvir, Rohit and Rakesh. According to the police, the mastermind of the gang, a man named Harshit, also a resident of Aligarh, is still on the run. The suspects were arrested from Sector 58 police station jurisdiction, officers said.“On Wednesday, the five were arrested from D-Park in Sector 62 where a government exam was taking place. The police recovered six mobile phones and 70 admit cards of various government examinations from them,” said Ranvijay Singh, ADCP, Noida.The admit cards are for various competitive exams such as the SSC (staff selection commission), Allahabad high court recruitment main exam, Indian Coast Guard exam, Central airmen selection board and more.On questioning, the suspects revealed that they would forge documents of the real candidate and would send another person — a solver — in his place to take the examination.“The solver would be given ₹20,000 by the gang and if he cleared the examination, he would be given ₹60,000-70,000 more, once the results came. Of the five arrested, Yashvir was the solver and others were mediators who would bring in leads on candidates. Yashvir admitted that he has taken the examinations in place of real candidates at least 10 to 15 times previously,” said Singh.He further said the gang has been active in Noida since last three or four years and has managed to get at least 10 to 15 candidates clear different government recruitment examinations through these fraudulent means.“Their motive was to penetrate almost all such government exams that are held online at various centres in Noida. We are trying to find out the candidates who cleared the examinations with the help of this gang. We have also recovered mobile chats from the phones of the arrested men which point to bank accounts in Dubai and Singapore. All these leads are being probed,” said Singh.He added that teams have been formed to nab mastermind Harshit and police will remain on alert whenever such recruitment exams are held in Noida.The five men have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 419 (cheating by personation) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-members-of-exam-solver-gang-held-in-noida-101639682089234.html
17-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s namaz row: Will offer prayers at 20 designated sites, say Muslims||Muslims in the city on Thursday said that they will perform Friday namaz at the 20 sites designated earlier by the city administration in the absence of any new order regarding the prayers even as Hindu outfits said they will not allow anybody to use these spaces to pray. Last Friday, the permission for the sites was withdrawn by the administration after Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the practise of offering namaz at public spaces will not be tolerated as it is leading to controversies and confrontations. The chief minister then said that new sites will be earmarked after discussions between the Muslims and Hindu groups and the district administration.However, till late Thursday evening no fresh order was issued by the administration for the prayers. “At least, the administration should release a new list of designated places so that we can inform the members of the community, and they can gather there on Friday to perform prayers. Seniors officials are not giving any clear answer,” said Mohammad Adeeb, a former Rajya Sabha member who is leading a 21-member committee to resolve the ongoing issue. Administration officials who spoke on the condition of the anonymity confirmed that no new sites have been earmarked yet. They said the police have been asked to deploy force at the spots where Muslims were likely to gather for prayers on Friday. “We have tried to conduct several meetings between the two groups, but neither is ready to compromise. We want to reach an amicable decision to resolve the issue,” said a senior official.The police said that personnel from at least six police stations were on alert, and have been assigned specific duties for Friday. Members of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, however, threatened to disrupt namaz again, if Muslims used open public spaces. Mahavir Bhardwaj, state president of the group, said, “The Gurugram Imam Sanghathan has agreed to not offer namaz in the open and people who have vested interests are trying to politicise the issue. We will not allow anyone to use the public spaces, and if anyone does, they will be responsible for any untoward incident,” he said. Hindu right-wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram for the last three years. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, last month, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing groups and locals continued to protest and disrupt prayers. Muslims, however, have maintained that they were forced to use public spaces since there were not enough number of mosques in the city. Praveen Yadav, a member of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, said local residents will occupy the namaz sites in Sector 37, Sector 12, 44 and Udyog Vihar. “Last Friday, we informed the Muslim community not to usee these spaces. Many of them went to Sector 22 to offer namaz in parks and open grounds without the consent of the local residents but we will not let them offer prayers in open on Friday,” he said, adding that they have formed teams of six members each to keep a check at the namaz sites. Adeeb, on Wednesday, filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court on Wednesday against Haryana chief secretary and the director general of police for not complying with a 2018 order of the apex court in which the apex court laid down guidelines to prevent mob vigilantism. “We have filed a contempt petition against Haryana government for its failure to stop fringe elements from disrupting the Friday namaz at designated sites in Gurugram. For the last three months, there has been a constant rise in incidents on Friday where the Hindu group members disrupt namaz in the open. They claim they were doing it in the name of religion, and try to create an atmosphere of hatred,” said Adeeb.

The ropeway project is being planned as an alternative to a Metro extension to connect Mohan Nagar on the Red line and Vaishali on the Blue line of the Delhi Metro Rail Network (DMRC). The proposal was suggested by General (retd) V K Singh, who is also the minister of state for road transport and highways and civil aviation, besides being an MP from Ghaziabad, earlier this year. “Two days ago (Tuesday), we held meetings with General V K Singh and other officials in Delhi and an in-principle approval was given for the Centre’s share of 20% towards the project. Since the project will be taken up on public private partnership mode, the company developing the project will fund 60% of the project. The remaining share will be borne by the GDA,” said Krishna Karunesh, vice chairperson of GDA. “Now, we need to put forward the proposal before the GDA board before sending it to the state government. The board meeting was scheduled for Thursday but it got postponed as the session of the UP assembly is going on. Once the session ends, we will hold the board meeting and get the approval for the proposal,” said Karunesh. The ropeway is a transport system for ferrying goods or people especially used in mountainous areas or mines, wherein the carrier cars are suspended with the help of moving cables, powered by a motor system. Earlier in October, the cost of the project, which was originally pegged at ₹487 crore, was further reduced to ₹450 crore. Officials said the entire ropeway project will be elevated and based on 27 pillars and will move over the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) alignment near Sahibabad. The detailed project report (DPR) has proposed four stations for the ropeway at Mohan Nagar, Sahibabad, Vasundhara and Vaishali. The starting and ending stations will be connected to the respective Metro stations with the help of skywalks of 150 metres, which will be constructed by the authority. As per the DPR estimates, a passenger will have to shelve out a minimum of ₹20 and a maximum of ₹30 for covering the entire distance in the ropeway. It is also estimated that the ropeway system will cater to 80,000 passengers in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/centre-to-provide-20-funds-for-urban-ropeway-project-in-ghaziabad-101639681910065.html
17-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi logs 85 new infections but caseload trajectory remains flat||The national capital added 85 Covid-19 infections on Thursday, the most in 161 days, even as the positivity rate hit a nearly six-month high of 0.15% -- and while the absolute numbers are still very small, experts advised caution given the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Delhi has added an average of 52 cases a day over the past week, showed state government data higher than the seven-day average two weeks ago. In the seven days ending December 2, Delhi added an average of 33 cases a day.The city last saw more cases on July 8, when it added 93 infections. The positivity rate on Thursday was last at this level on June 29, and higher on June 22, when the number touched 0.20%.Delhi has completely vaccinated 10 million of its residents against Covid-19. And while nearly 97% of Delhi’s 15 million adults have received at least a single vaccine dose, the remaining five million children are still beyond the ambit of inoculation.Experts termed Thursday’s case spike a matter of concern, especially when read in the backdrop of the Omicron threat.So far, six people in Delhi have been diagnosed with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.“It is definitely a cause for concern especially because Omicron is now all over the world. So far, 71 countries have reported Omicron cases. So if you look for it you will find it,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at AIIMS and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical CareTo be sure, Delhi’s caseload is still at record lows, as it has been for around seven months, after the fourth wave of infections (between April and May) flattened out. The city hasn’t seen a single Covid-19 death in eight days, according to government data, with the last fatality on December 8. As of Wednesday, 25,100 people in the city have succumbed to the infection since the outbreak of the pandemic in early March last year. But Covid-19 fatalities have been rare since the fourth wave bottomed out in May, and resultant deaths fell to single-digits in mid-June. The last 100 Covid-19 deaths in Delhi have been recorded over 164 days, state government data shows. In comparison, the previous 100 deaths came in 14 days, while the 100 before those came in just six days.A devastating wave between April and May left hundreds of thousands infected, and 13,100 dead. At the peak of this period, Delhi added over 400 deaths for three straight days (from May 1 to 3).Experts have previously that the sheer scale of infection spread in that period, coupled with a strong rate of vaccinations would have contributed to Delhi’s thin Covid-19 caseload over the past few months. This was borne out by results of the city’s sixth serological survey, samples for which were collected in end-September. A preliminary report released by the state government last month showed that 97 of every 100 people living in the city had antibodies to the coronavirus, either due to previous infection or inoculation.However, doctors pointed out that immunity due to vaccines waned significantly after six months, reaffirming the need for booster doses.“Research in Israel, Canada and US has shown immunity is 20% to 50% after six months of vaccination. So there is no question that boosters are important. The elderly, those with comorbidities and frontline workers should be prioritised,” said Dr Khilnani.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-logs-85-new-infections-but-caseload-trajectory-remains-flat-101639681849281.html

Farmers, who have been protesting against the authority since September 1, said they will intensify their agitation from Friday onwards if their demands are not accepted.Around 1pm on Thursday, the farmers marched towards Sector 14-A, where the authority’s CEO Ritu Maheshwari and other top officials stay, and staged a sit-in for at least three hours. They also blocked the Chilla border between Delhi and Noida. According to the Noida traffic police, traffic movement on the Noida-Delhi border was affected between 2pm and 4.30pm and vehicles coming from Delhi to Noida were diverted towards DND and Ashok Vihar. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic) Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “The farmers reached Chilla border at 2pm and protested for two hours. We diverted the Delhi-bound traffic to the DND flyway and towards Ashok Vihar.” The farmers left the spot at around 4.30 pm, he added. Sukhbir Yadav, founder president of Bharatiya Kisan Parishad, who was leading the protest, said, “Our intention was not to trouble the public but to make our demands heard. We were barely there for two hours and restricted our protest to just one lane of the road.” Ritika Saha, a commuter, was caught in a traffic jam on the Chilla border for half an hour. “The traffic police should have alerted the commuters in advance about such a protest,” he said.The farmers returned to the protest site outside the Noida authority’s administrative building in Sector 6 around 5pm. The authority officials tried to discuss the issues with farmers but they refused to end the protest.“We will not end the protest until we are given in writing that all our demands will be met and subsequently be accepted in the board meeting of the authority. We do not believe the authority officials because they have been fooling us for many years. If they do not accept our demands, we will launch an indefinite agitation,” said Yadav. Farmers want 10% of residential land for their families against the total land acquired by the authority, 64% more compensation in addition to what they have got so far, old Abadi settlement in villages, unregulated construction in villages among other demands.“Why does the authority have to regulate the buildings in the villages?...Villages should grow naturally,...” said Prempal Chauhan, a farmer from Nagli Wazidpur.Praveen Mishra, additional CEO of the Noida authority, said, “We are trying to discuss and address the farmers’ issues. We hope soon the issues will be resolved and the protest will be over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-hit-on-chilla-road-as-farmers-take-to-streets-to-press-for-their-demands-101639681730396.html

In an order on Wednesday, the DDMA said activities currently permitted in Delhi will continue up to the intervening night of December 31 midnight. However, it stated that all political, social, cultural, religious and other such gatherings shall continue to remain prohibited. But given all existing relaxations, Christmas and New Year’s Eve will not be a muted affair like they were last year, when there were stricter restrictions in place due to the third wave of the pandemic in the city. But, the order also implies that no big parties, gatherings or events will be allowed in the city during the festive season. Apart from a cap of 50% seating capacity in bars and restaurants, the order also said restriction will continue on halls to hold events other than meetings and conferences, exhibitions and marriages.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 86 Covid cases and zero deaths, according to the state health bulletin.The positivity rate in Delhi is 0.15%.“And whereas, the status of Covid-19 in NCT of Delhi has again been reviewed and it has been observed that though the overall number of Covid-19 patients and positivity rate has declined considerably and the overall situation has improved, due caution and care has to be continued so that adequate standards of Covid appropriate behaviour continues to be followed and any such activity, that can lead to a surge in cases, is allowed only after rigorous and due diligence,” read the order. “In case any person is found violating the aforesaid instructions, the defaulting person(s) shall be proceeded against as per the provisions of section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws. This order shall not prohibit any further restrictions / measures imposed by any other department or authority or institution empowered under any relevant law to control the spread of Covid-19 virus as well as for any other purpose,” it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-disaster-management-authority-extends-all-covid-related-curbs-till-dec-31-101639681490011.html
17-12-2021||Noida||Traffic resumes on Delhi-Meerut Expressway after a year||After a gap of over a year, traffic resumed on the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway on Thursday, after the last batch of farmers vacated the UP Gate area a day earlier. The officials of the Ghaziabad police said they have removed all barricading on the DME and so has the Delhi Police. The UP Gate area used to see about 60,000 passenger car units (PCUs) a day before the farmers’ protest began. The Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageways of the DME, as well as lanes of National Highway 9 (NH-9), of which the DME is a part, were shut on November 28 last year, in the wake of farmers occupying the UP Gate site to protest against the three contentious farm laws that were finally withdrawn in December. “The Ghaziabad-Delhi lanes of the DME have been opened and two lanes of NH-9 have also been opened to traffic. Two lanes of the highway are still closed as some barricading is left to be removed. Traffic is plying smoothly on the expressway, besides regular traffic on the highway lanes. The Delhi-Ghaziabad lanes of the DME were already operational,” said Arvind Kumar, project director, NHAI. The UP Gate area comprises three expressway lanes on each side, while the four outer lanes on each side are the NH-9 lanes. Together, the DME and NH-9 have 14 lanes up to Dasna in Ghaziabad. The officials of the Ghaziabad police said they removed the barricades that they had put up near Khoda and also near Pratap Vihar to restrict the movement of commuters towards the UP Gate protest site. Due to the restrictions, daily commuters were using the alternative routes through Noida’s sector 62, Hindon canal road near Khoda and Anand Vihar border near Kaushambi. “With the opening of the DME, the diversions have automatically ended. This will reduce congestion and give relief to thousands of commuters who had a harrowing time taking detours to reach their destinations. The service lane to Vaishali is yet to be opened due to barricading while the UP Gate underpass area is now open,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). The traffic police said it is coordinating with the Delhi Police for removal of remaining barricades. “The service lane from Delhi to Vaishali is yet to be opened and so are two lanes of NH-9 — from Ghaziabad to Delhi. The Raj Nagar Extension to UP Gate lanes of the Hindon elevated road are yet to open as cleaning work is still on at UP Gate. We expect the remaining routes will to be opened in the next 24 hours,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). The commuters heaved a sigh of relief on traffic resuming on DME. “I started about an hour early each day during past one year to reach my office in south Delhi on time. Resumption of traffic is a major relief for thousands of commuters who battled jams, snarls and pollution due to diversions,” said Kuldeep Saxena, resident of Indirapuram. The RWA office bearers from Kaushambi said their township witnessed a major inflow of vehicles due to closure of UP Gate during the farmers’ protest. “From about 6,000 estimated vehicles on a normal day, the traffic in our township spiked to about 70,000 vehicles per day due to diversion. At last, the DME has opened and we expect that the traffic chaos in our township will end now. We faced huge traffic issues and pollution on account of diversions,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments RWA.

The drive started at 10am and continued till late evening, officials said. Till 8pm, 306 vehicles were issued fines for not having HSRPs, while 20 vehicles were penalised for plying without number plates, the officials said, adding that a fine of ₹500 was imposed on each offender. Ravinder Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said that special emphasis was laid on people driving vehicles without the high security plates. “We conducted several drives in the past and urged people to get these number plates. But they are being negligent and trying to delay it, following which we have started taking action,” he said. The officials said there are nearly 20 lakh vehicles, including two-wheelers, in the city and more than 20% do not have the high security plates. These plates come in handy for police in checking vehicle theft cases, which have seen an average rise of 11% annually. “Our teams were also deployed at all intersections and major stretches to catch violators. Next on our agenda is to enforce traffic discipline at dark spots across the city and on National Highway 8, as our goal is to reduce fatalities on the road,” said Tomar. The officials said they are taking all the traffic violations one by one and next on radar is speeding and drink driving during the night ahead of New Year. “We will be focusing on MG Road, Golf Course Road, Sohna Road and Golf Course Extension Road where many clubs, bars and restaurants are located,” Tomar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-300-vehicles-fined-for-hsrp-violation-in-gurugram-101639681428689.html

The speed for heavy vehicles has been fixed at 60 kmph from 80 kmph, said officials.“The speed limit of 80 kmph for light vehicles and 60kmph for heavy vehicles will be applicable from December 15 to February 15, 2022. Commuters who are caught violating the speed limit will be fined,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yeida.In the past couple of days, the visibility on the expressway has been very poor leading to accidents, said officials.On December 13, two men from Delhi died and two more sustained injuries after the car they were travelling in reportedly collided with a moving truck on the Yamuna expressway, said Yeida officials.On November 6, five people, including the wife and son of a UP government official, and a driver of a private bus died in a car-bus collision on the expressway. Police later said the bus driver dozed off when he was returning from Agra to Greater Noida.On November 5, as many as five people were killed in a car-bus accident on the expressway as the bus driver reportedly fell asleep. The bus crossed over to other side of the expressway, killing the driver and four others travelling in the car.The authority has also suggested to arrange tea for commuters at the toll plazas so that drivers stay alert and do not fall asleep in the early morning hours.Data provided by Yeida shows that 45% of the accidents are a result of drivers falling asleep while driving. Speeding and violation of traffic rules on the expressway account for 19% and 11% of the accidents respectively. The stationary vehicles on the expressway have also been found as a major cause of accidents.The Yeida has also directed the toll operator, Jaypee Infratech Limited, to expedite the work of installing crash barriers on the median of the Yamuna Expressway from Greater Noida to Agra.The expressway operator will spend ₹75 crore on the installation of crash barrier. A crash barrier is a strong fence at the side of a road or in the middle of a dual carriageway or motorway that prevents a vehicle from diverting to the other side and reduces the risk of serious accidents.“We have directed the toll operator to expedite the work to ensure the safety of commuters driving on the expressway,” said Singh.
17-12-2021||Mumbai||MVA-Koshyari cold war may intensify||Mumbai: The ongoing cold war between the state government and Raj Bhavan may intensify, with the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime curtailing the powers of the governor in overseeing functioning of state universities. The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to create a new position of the pro-chancellor for universities, which will be headed by the higher and technical education minister. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, by law, is the chancellor of universities. According to the proposal, the governor’s powers to appoint vice-chancellors will be trimmed, with the search committee set up to identify probable candidates submitting five names to the state, which, in turn, will forward two to the governor. At present, this list is submitted directly to Raj Bhavan. To be sure, the MVA and the governor have clashed on a range of issues, the most notable being the appointment of 12 persons to the state legislative council that has been pending for over a year. MVA leaders accuse the Governor of acting as a proxy for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A senior minister from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) admitted that the state cabinet’s decision had been prompted by the tussle with the governor. “The governor often sits on decisions and this move will streamline the functioning and administration of universities… it is the right of a government and the legislature to legislate. The position of a governor is an ornamental one, and does not have executive powers. If impediments are being created in the working of a government, it must remove them,” he said. Shiv Sena Lok Sabha MP and spokesperson Arvind Sawant, however, denied this was an attempt to encroach on the governor’s turf. “But, considering how the governor has been behaving for the past two years, this has created an impediment in the functioning of varsities,” Sawant said. “It was necessary to understand why the state government was compelled to take such a decision.”Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) spokesperson Atul Londhe said, “This is not a tussle between the government and the governor. In a democracy, a popularly-elected government has certain authority,” Londhe said. He added that the BJP was using the office of the governor to encroach upon the government’s rights. “While the appointment of 12 MLCs from the Governor’s quota was cleared in 24 hours in Bihar, in Maharashtra, it is pending for over a year,” said Londhe, adding that the amendments to the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, were meant to strengthen and streamline functioning of universities. While Raj Bhavan officials declined to comment, BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar alleged that the decision was taken with an eye on the land controlled by universities. He also alleged that the new system introduced for the appointment of the VCs will lead to corruption, resulting in appointment of persons like Sachin Vaze. Shelar said they will approach the courts, and if needed, will also launch a ‘save universities’ drive. He said, “The MVA government has changed the laid-down, scientific method of picking VCs under Maharashtra Public Universities Act. The powers of the governor who is also the chancellor of the university have been curtailed. This clearly means that selection of VCs will now be done by the ‘Yuva Sena kitchen cabinet’ (the youth wing of Shiv Sena led by state minister Aaditya Thackeray). Looking at the style of working of the MVA government, the change in the selection method appears to be to enable itself someone like (dismissed police officer) Sachin Vaze.” Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar denied that the amendments trimmed the powers of the governor and refuted claims of this being a political move. Instead, he asked, “Does the delay in appointing 12 MLCs fits into democratic norms?”Political analyst Hemant Desai said such a friction between the government and the governor was unprecedented in the history of Maharashtra, barring the tenures of former governors PC Alexander and SM Krishna, when they had insisted on funds for regional development corporations for backward areas. “Such political use of the governor’s position by the opposition (BJP) is unprecedented,” noted Desai, stating how Koshyari had frequently granted audience to BJP leaders and actress Kangana Ranaut, who had taken on the Shiv Sena. The governor had also stuck to his post despite criticism from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar, NCP president Sharad Pawar and others, said Desai. BOX: The MVA is upset at the governor’s role in the controversial early morning swearing-in of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar in 2019 as part of their short-term arrangement. The governor, a former BJP leader, has kept the MVA’s list of 12 nominees to the state legislative council in cold-storage for over a year. In February, Koshyari was denied the use of the state government’s aircraft to fly to Mussoorie, and had to take a commercial flight at the last minute. The Governor also lent a patient ear the actress Kangana Ranaut, who had relentlessly attacked the Shiv Sena. The government also saw red at Koshyari’s review meetings with officials during his visits to Marathwada in August. In August, State Congress chief Nana Patole had charged that a meeting between a MVA delegation headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, and the governor could not be held as he refused to give them an appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mvakoshyari-cold-war-may-intensify-101639681070824.html
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||High court stays formation of SIT in rape case against Punjab MLA Bains||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday stayed the Punjab Police’s decision to constitute a special investigating team (SIT) into rape allegations by a widow against MLA from Atam Nagar (Ludhiana) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjeet Singh Bains.The SIT was constituted on November 26. The woman had alleged that the SIT was constituted even as final charge-sheet (challan) was presented. Also, the decision was taken without permission of the competent court.In her plea, the woman had claimed that the case has a “chequered history” as the FIR was registered only after the court’s intervention. Investigation was concluded and challan was presented and there are a total of 7 accused and none of them was arrested nor any proclaimed offender proceedings were initiated against them, the court was informed.Surprisingly, the state government has constituted a fresh SIT on the basis of a “motivated application” filed by the brother of the accused, she contended.It was further alleged that the constitution of the SIT is for the purpose of re-investigation of the case without seeking permission from the competent court. Though it has been constituted supposedly for further investigation, the actual motive is to save the accused against whom even non-bailable warrants were issued but never executed till date, it was submitted. The petitioner also claims that Bains has been prosecuted in 13 different FIRs.Seeking response from the Punjab Police by March 24, the court stayed the November 26 order on constitution of the SIT. It was on July 6 that a Ludhiana court had ordered registration of FIR against Bains on the complaint of the woman who initially lodged a complaint against the MLA eight months ago alleging that she had come into contact with him in a property dispute case and was trapped. The case was finally registered at a Ludhiana police station on July 12 on the court orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-stays-formation-of-sit-in-rape-case-against-punjab-mla-bains-101639681070190.html

The bench headed by KK Khandelwal ordered the Delhi Police to arrest directors of Sepset Properties Pvt Ltd and Supertech Limited. “It is directed that the directors and the managing director of the judgment debtor (developer) be arrested and brought before the authority through the commissioner of police, Delhi and concerned SHO(s) of the police station(s) where the registered office and the residence of the judgement debtor corporation is located, to show cause as to why they should not be detained in civil imprisonment. These decisions of the authority are very significant and shall send across a clear message to all errant promoters who attempt to evade compliance of the directions of the authority or satisfaction of its decree on one pretext or the other,” the order said. According to H-Rera, in the case of Satish Kumar Chawla versus Sepset Properties Pvt Ltd, the authority directed the developer to submit a list of its assets but it did not comply with the order. The authority also ordered the attachment of the bank account of the developer, but this was not complied with despite repeated notices were issued to the bank, the authority said. The authority ordered the developer to pay ₹38 lakh to the buyer for delay in the delivery of a flat in Paras Dew project in Sector 106. Officials of Sepset Properties could not be contacted for comment.Khandelwal said that due to repeated non-compliance, the authority has issued notice of arrest. “Despite repeated directions the managements failed to act. These directions are meant to provide relief to the aggrieved home buyers,” he said.

The authority said Supertech was directed to pay ₹53 lakh to the buyer for delay in delivery of a flat in Araville project in Sector 79. However, the company did not pay the homebuyer despite repeated reminders. RK Arora, chairman, Supertech Ltd, did not respond to repeated phone calls and messages sent by HT for response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-h-rera-issues-arrest-notice-against-two-realty-firms-101639681068774.html
17-12-2021||Delhi||Fear, hope in Delhi’s new African enclave||Bablu Gupta runs a departmental store in R block of west Delhi’s Mohan Garden with two names displayed on either side. The original name is MH Food mart, but in the last few years, Gupta has added another name -- African Food Shop – for the new residents of the colony.Next to Gupta’s shop is Attraction Unisex Saloon, run by a Nigerian man. His customers are mostly people from African nations who have settled in the area in recent years. Some distance away is Franco African, a shop that sells edible items with ties to African nations.The reason: Hundreds of people from various African countries who have settled in Mohan Garden in the past five years, often moving away from other areas like Malviya Nagar after facing humiliation and discrimination, and making the humble neighbourhood Delhi’s new African enclave. Chiyozu, who works at a saloon, said that he directly came to Mohan Garden about three years ago from Nigeria, but his friends were earlier living in Malviya Nagar and Lajpat Nagar. “I live with my wife and daughter. Some of my friends had troubles living in parts of south Delhi. Foreigners like us are assumed to be criminals, who live illegally and do drugs. In south Delhi, that was the problem they faced. The media and police also visited there regularly so there was no privacy,” he said. Local residents said the influx of people from various African countries was due to reasonable rents in the area.“It wasn’t like this until 5-6 years ago. One would hardly see a foreigner on the streets here. Today, you will find around 60-80 shops being run by the foreigners, that cater to people from African nations here,” said Alok Gupta, a member of the A-block Resident Welfare Association. Mohan Garden represents a growing trend in the Capital of people from African nations being forced to move from south Delhi localities such as Khirki Extension, Chhatarpur, Kishangarh and Mehrauli to west Delhi colonies such as Tilak Nagar, Vikaspuri and Mohan Garden. They say the shift was necessitated by hostilities and racism from local residents, who often accused them of being criminals. HOW MOHAN GARDEN CHANGED A middle-income neighbourhood on the western fringes of the Capital, Mohan Garden was a nondescript area known for its abundant farm land till three decades ago. With the Delhi Metro making its way to nearby Uttam Nagar about 15 years ago, the area quickly developed, becoming an affordable residential colony with land rates much lower than other west Delhi localities such as Janakpuri or Tilak Nagar. About three years ago, local residents started noticing the first foreigners in the area, where rents were often a third of more upscale localities in south Delhi. But many people from African nations said a bigger reason to leave their old neighbourhoods was the everyday discrimination they faced. A 28-year-old man from Nigeria was one of them. The man, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said he worked at a local salon, and shifted to Mohan Garden from Malviya Nagar. “I want to clarify that I am living legally here. I have my papers and carry them round the clock,” he said. The man said he came about three years ago to work at a salon owned by a friend from his native village in Nigeria. “We had a salon in Malviya Nagar, too, but were forced to shut shop as the population of African people decreased in that area. My friend told me that until five years ago, he would get about 10-15 customers daily. But people started leaving the place and shifted here. Business is good here,” he said. He said Mohan Garden was cheaper to live in than Malviya Nagar. “Here, we pay a rent of about ₹8,000-10,000 for a one room set. In south Delhi, it would cost almost three times for the same space. Even shops here are easily available on rent. It is difficult to find spaces and that too at reasonable rates there (Malviya Nagar),” he added. But even in their new home, problems linger. In the last two-and-a half months, Delhi Police caught and deported at least 180 people from African nations who were allegedly living illegally in Mohan Garden. Police said all 180 people overstayed in the country or were involved in crimes. According to police data, since January 2021, police caught around 250 people from African nations living in Mohan Garden and deported them. Last year, the number of similar violators living in Mohan Garden was 18, police added. Officers involved in these operations said they were going door-to-door to check the papers of foreigners. They added that they launched operation “Varchasv” (domination) after receiving complaints from local residents about alleged criminal activities by the African residents. On October 2, police busted a heroin manufacturing unit from a ground-floor building and arrested three men from R Extension Block of Mohan Garden, who were allegedly living on an expired visa. Police recovered 1.3 kg of heroin and claimed there was a factory on the terrace of this building and launched a crackdown against house owners who give their premises on rent to foreigners without getting their documents verified by police. At least 11 persons from Mohan Garden were booked in this connection under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order issued by public servant). It is mandatory to conduct tenant verification in Delhi. Some local residents have also been less than welcoming. Anil Aggarwal, president of the R Block RWA said some “greedy locals” were responsible for the influx of foreigners in the area. “The foreigners are ready to pay twice the rent than locals. This is why their numbers have increased. For those living illegally, the rent is much cheaper compared to the other places in Delhi. From a business point of view, it is working. Not all foreigners are involved in crime, but some of them are and the cases are only increasing,” he said. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT Thousands of people from various African countries live in Delhi but members of the community battle repeated racist attacks and discrimination at the hands of local residents and politicians. In 2014, a midnight raid by a former Delhi minister Somnath Bharti at the house of some foreigners triggered a huge row. Bharti said he merely accompanied the local residents after receiving complaints of drug smuggling and prostitution racket being run by nine women. In 2016, a 29-year-old Congolese teacher was allegedly beaten to death over a petty dispute in south Delhi’s Kishangarh. The same year, in the twin villages of Rajpur Khurd and Maidan Garhi in Chhatarpur, there were four cases of attacks on African nationals. (please check) On September 26,2021, rioting broke out outside the Mohan Garden police station after 100 people from different African countries protested against police and accused them of killing an African national while chasing him. Police say they receive many complaints from local residents against the foreigners in Mohan Garden and its nearby areas such as Uttam Nagar and Dabri. In the first week of November, the police in Dwarka -- the policing district under which Mohan Garden falls -- formed a cell called CAIFAN (Cell Against Illegal Foreigners and Narcotics). The unit has busted at least 200 illegal foreigners and three reported cases of drug smuggling so far. Police claim that in the last two months, CAIFAN has recovered drugs worth ₹120 crore in the international market. “CAIFAN has not been formed to harass legal residents. We are taking action only against those living illegally or without proper documents and indulging in crimes. Our officers are working round the clock and developing intelligence to crack down on illegal activities by foreigners,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary. Local residents have cheered the police action and said it will stop Mohan Garden from becoming “infamous as Malviya Nagar”. But the police crackdown has struck fear among many people from African countries, who say they are scared of being targeted. Christian Chinonso, a shopkeeper in Mohan Garden who lives with his wife and children, is one of them, “We have all the necessary papers. We are worried about the high number of foreigners being arrested and deported from here. Police are randomly stopping our people and asking us to produce our papers. I know it is the right thing but this has scared me. I step out only when necessary.”

The incident was captured by the CCTV cameras, and the footage was shared on the social media. The woman, who works as a nursing attendant with a private hospital, was admitted to a nearby hospital from where she was discharged after medical attention later in the night. A case was registered in connection with the snatching incident and teams were formed to identify and nab the suspects, said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani.“We have got some clues about the suspects. The information received so far is being developed. The suspects will be caught soon,” said the DCP.Police said the snatching incident took place around 5.30 pm and it came to their notice around 7.30 pm. The nursing attendant was returning home after finishing her day’s duty at a nearby hospital when the scooter-borne snatchers targeted her.She was walking on the roadside when the pillion rider tried to snatch her phone. The woman caught the pillion rider by his jacket. The man who was riding the scooter accelerated the vehicle in a bid to escape from the incident spot. However, the woman did not lose her grip and fell on the road due to the sudden jerk. The snatchers continued riding the scooter at a high speed because of which the woman was dragged on the road. The snatchers took the wrong carriageway after crossing the road intersection, where they had snatched the woman’s phone. The CCTV footage shows that the woman lost her grip on the wrong carriageway and fell on the road just next to a four-wheeler that was coming from the opposite direction. She could have suffered serious injuries or was run over by the four-wheeler had she fallen in front of it. The snatchers managed to flee. Some passersby helped the injured woman and admitted her to the hospital, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-snatchers-drag-woman-on-road-for-150-metres-at-shalimar-bagh-101639680829544.html

It appears to be a case of electrical short-circuit, officials said, adding that no casualty was reported in the incident.Police said the incident was reported from Chandeni camp 2 at Ferozepur Namak village around 8pm. Sahoon, in-charge of Nuh fire station, said that three fire tenders, two from Nuh and one from Tauru, were sent to the spot within minutes after they received a call. “The fire was controlled in two hours. A short circuit of a wire in one of the shanties is suspected to be the cause. All the shanties made of bamboo, jute and plastic materials were completely gutted,” he said.  According to the officials, the district administration has arranged for temporary accommodation, medical camps, and police deployment for the victims. Varun Singla, superintendent of police, Nuh, said that 10 teams were sent to the village. “We immediately arranged for relief material and ensured their safety and security. We are mobilising NGOs for their rehabilitation,” he said. Shakti Singh, deputy commissioner of Nuh, said that the administration has organised accommodation and food for the 106 displaced people. “Some of them were shifted to a school building and the others to a few houses of villagers. The victims were also given blankets. Today, we arranged for their breakfast, and dry ration kits which will last for 15 days were distributed to each family,” he said. Singh said they are coordinating with state authorities and NGOs to rebuild their shanties and financial aid would also be provided to them for the structures. “Medical facilities have also been provided to them and a team of doctors has been deployed,” he said. According to the officials, 1,695 Rohingya refugees (around 500 families) have been living in 10 refugee camps in Nuh since 2012. These camps are situated in Shahpur Nangli, Ferozepur Namak, Chandeni, Saddik Nagar and Punhana. The victims said that the damage was already done by the time fire tenders reached the site. Kamal Hussain, one of the victims, said that they were preparing dinner when the incident took place. “Our houses were burnt down to ashes within an hour. Nothing is left now. We will have to start all over again,” he said. Ali Johar, a Rohingya youth leader and a resident of the camp who has seen three fire incidents since 2018, said, “Such incidents are bound to happen with the poor living conditions.” Sabber Kyaw Min, founder and director of Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, an NGO that works for the betterment of the community, said that the victims have lost all their belongings, including the documents issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). “We request the government agencies and the UNHCR to provide them a safe shelter and to fulfil their daily basic needs. It is not the first time such a tragedy has taken place. We urge the Government of India to independently investigate the matter so that no such tragedy takes place in the future,” he said. Jafarullah, a counsellor of the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, said, “Except three shanties, all have been gutted in fire. People are now homeless. Fortunately, there was no human loss as people ran out of shanties as soon as the fire broke out. A total of 106 people, including children, have been displaced. The authorities and nearby villagers are making arrangements for temporary accommodation in a school, a madrasa and nearby houses for the refugees,” he said. The Rohingyas are a Muslim minority community from Myanmar. According to the UNHCR, Rohingya refugees are spread across six locations in India — Jammu, Nuh, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Chennai.

17-12-2021||Delhi||Understanding the global Omicron threat||On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that preliminary evidence appears to indicate that vaccines may be less effective against infection and transmission linked to the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2, which also carries a “higher risk of re-infection”. According to data compiled by GISAID, a global science initiative that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses, a total of 60 countries have so far submitted to it sequencing data that shows the presence of this highly mutated variant on their shores.With its ability to evade vaccines and higher transmissibility, the new variant has sparked concerns that it could drag the fight against the pandemic back several months. The expanding global spread of Omicron Of the 60 countries that have confirmed Omicron infections to GISAID, the United Kingdom has the largest share with 4,120 confirmed sequences of the variant till December 13, the latest date for which this information is available. It is followed by South Africa with 1,000 samples, the United States with 321 samples, Denmark with 216, and Switzerland with 125.[Map: Countries with identified Omicron infections, as per data submitted to GISAID] A better picture is provided by looking at the share of Omicron in all cases in these countries in this period. South Africa, unsurprisingly, with 90.1% of all infections being Omicron features among the top, closely behind Mozambique where the heavily mutated variant constituted 94.4% of all samples sequenced.To be sure, the Delta variant still easily remains the world’s most dominant variant, accounting for 97.9% of the nearly 3.17 million genome sequences uploaded in the four weeks ending December 13 to GISAID. But the real cause of worry is that despite Omicron barely being flagged in even half GISAID’s 60-day sample period, it has already outstripped the combined proportion of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants. A total of 6,700 samples – about 2.1% – were Omicron and the other three variants of concern together numbered 22, less than 0.01% each in GISAID’s database.A week ago, Delta’s share was 99.2% while Omicron’s share was 0.4% in the same database.[Chart 1: Countries highest proportion of Omicron infections] Regions where the new variant is taking hold are not faring well A key characteristic of Omicron that has been observed is that it can lead to a massive spike in new cases. For instance, in South Africa, on average, there have been 22,852 new Covid-19 cases every day in the past week – far surpassing the previous peak of 19,766 cases a day in the first week of July this year. South Africa, however, is far from being the only that has seen a record spike at the same time that Omicron infections have seen a spike. On Wednesday, the United Kingdom recorded 78,610 new Covid-19 cases — the highest in a single day since the start of the pandemic. This has pushed the seven-day average of daily infections to 57,417 – just below the peak of 59,508 touched on January 8. Similar peaks can be seen even in smaller countries such as Norway and South Korea where the share of Omicron cases in the overall new infection tally has been rising in recent days. In each of these countries, the seven-day average of daily infections is currently at the highest ever , according to data gathered by Our World in Data. In Norway, there has been an average of 4,925 new cases a day in the past week, while in South Korea this number is 6,790. The corresponding charts also show that the share of Omicron cases have been increasing at the same time in these countries.[Chart 2: New Covid-19 infections and proportion of Omicron cases in South Africa, the UK, Norway and South Korea] Omicron appears to be single-handedly capable of pushing new waves To truly understand the impact that Omicron can have on the outbreak in a region, it is crucial to look at how these infections are changing the outlook of the Covid wave. Very few countries (or even localised regions) consistently release data on the spread of particular variant. This exercise is generally done so by extrapolating genome sequencing data on the overall case turnout. This system is utilised by agencies such as the US’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine a prevalence of a variant — on Wednesday, it estimated that 2.9% of new Covid cases emerging in America were Omicron. However, one advantage that Omicron’s heavily mutated nature offers is that in a widely used RT-PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S-gene dropout) and this can therefore be used as marker for this variant, while sequencing is awaited. Using this approach, some regions have been tracking this variant at near real-time, offering early clues on how prevalent it is.In London, the prevalence for Omicron cases (those with S-gene dropout) has been steadily rising. In the past week, 38.4% of all infections in the British capital have been Omicron cases. But what is even more alarming is that on a daily level, this proportion is rising fast — on December 12 (latest date for which data is available) 1,669 of the city’s 2,779 Covid cases were Omicron (60.1%), according to data released by the UK Health Security Agency. Similarly, this proportion is also rising in Denmark (the only other major region which is currently publicly releasing S-gene dropout data). In just 10 days between December 1 and December 11, daily Omicron proportion has gone from 1.6% to 15.6%, data shows. In both these regions, a worrying trend is that Omicron appears to be the cause of the spike in new infections as the new cases of the other variants appear to be stagnant.[Chart 3: New cases of other variants and Omicron variants in London and Denmark] 
17-12-2021||Delhi||Three murders in two days reported in Delhi||Three persons, including a minor girl, were killed over trivial issues in three separate murder cases reported from south and east Delhi areas between December 13 and 15. All the three cases were solved with the arrest of the alleged accused, police said.In the first case, a 16-year-old girl was killed after the alleged live-in partner of her mother slit her throat with a knife following an altercation during which they slapped each other in south Delhi’s Jasola Vihar on Wednesday afternoon, police said.The suspect, identified as Shan Mohammad,32, was caught in the evening while he was trying to escape to Uttarakhand. His interrogation revealed that the girl used to insult him for having a relationship with her mother and surviving on her earnings. Also, the man used to object and stop her from having long telephonic conversations with her relative in the absence of her mother, the police said.On Wednesday, an altercation took place between them over the same issue. The man slapped the girl after which she slapped her back. In a fit of rage, he picked up a knife and slit her throat, killing her on the spot, said a senior police officer, associated with the crime.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey said that around 2 pm on Wednesday, the Sarita Vihar police station received a call regarding a girl’s mother at her home in Janta flats in Jasola Vihar. A police team reached the house and learnt that the girl named Ruksar, was found dead on a folding cot by her mother, Reshma, who worked as a domestic help in a nearby residential colony.The woman told the police that she had left home in the morning, leaving her daughter and Shan Mohammad, whom she had adopted as her son. When she returned home around 1.30 pm, she found the house locked from outside. She tried to contact her daughter and Mohammad. The girl’s phone was not reachable while Mohammad’s response over the phone made Reshma suspicious. With some neighbours’ help, the lock was broken and the girl’s woman was found in a room, the DCP said.A case of murder was registered and teams were tasked to identify the whereabouts of Mohammad, as he was the prime suspect in the case. Through technical surveillance, the teams located Mohammad in east Delhi and caught him while he was trying to leave for Uttarakhand.“Mohammad confessed to the crime and revealed that he killed Reshma in a fit of rage because she had slapped him. He claims he was drunk at the time of the crime. After killing Ruksar, he panicked and locked the house before fleeing,” added DCP Pandey.In the second case, a 30-year-old man was killed after he was repeatedly attacked in the head with an iron pipe by his friend following an altercation that started over playing cards in a tempo in south Delhi’s Kotla Mubarakpur on December 13. The suspect, Dharmendra Singh, who fled the crime scene, was arrested from his native village in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao on December 15, the police said.“They fought over the issue of who won the playing card game. Singh attacked Deepu with an iron pipe and fled. Deepu was admitted to a hospital, where he succumbed to his head injuries,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker.In the third case, a 25-year-old man was killed after he was thrashed by a group of five-six men who suspected him of stealing the mobile phone of one of the them in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri on December 14. The victim, identified as Mohammad Shabir, was found injured and unconscious near a park I Trilokpuri. He was admitted to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries the next morning.“We have arrested two suspects, including Keshav, who accused Shabir of stealing his mobile phone,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-murders-in-two-days-reported-in-delhi-101639680719666.html
17-12-2021||Mumbai||Ample proof available of dual identities of NCB’s Sameer Wankhede, father: Nawab Malik||Ample proof is available of the dual identities adopted by Dnyandev Wankhede and his son Sameer Wankhede, Mumbai zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for their personal benefit, NCP leader Nawab Malik has claimed in his affidavit in response to the defamation suit filed by Dnyandev Wankhede before the Bombay high court. Malik in his affidavit stated that the tweets by him were intended to only expose the illegalities committed by Sameer Wankhede while securing a job through the reserved category quota and misusing his position in the NCB. The affidavit added that there was no malice intended on his part while making revelations on social media and the suit was intended to curtail his fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. Referring to the maintainability of the suit, Malik has stated that the relief sought against him by Dnyandev Wankhede are only intended to suppress the facts which he has been exposing about Sameer Wankhede. The affidavit states that the relief sought cannot be granted as they are intended to benefit persons who are not party to the suit. “All the material/evidence published by me shows the illegal manner in which Mr Sameer Wankhede has acquired his job and also the illegalities in the manner in which he has discharged his duties as a public official,” the affidavit states. Stating that the claim by Dnyandev Wankhede in the suit that he (Malik) had started the slur campaign against Sameer Wankhede after his son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB and released after being kept behind bars for almost eight months was false and he had been questioning the working of NCB even before his son-in-law was arrested. Malik has stated that he had made statements as the national spokesperson of the NCP in November 2020 against the action being taken by NCB against consumers of drugs and not tracking down and arresting drug traffickers/suppliers for the sake of publicity. With regards to the posting of the birth certificate, school leaving certificates and nikahnama of Sameer Wankhede online, Malik’s affidavit states, “This material was published by me after reasonably verifying the truth of the same and believing the same to be true. The material available on record shows that Mr Sameer Wankhede is leading a dual life i.e. as a Muslim and as a Hindu. He has illegally obtained his job under ‘Scheduled Caste’ (SC) category thereby depriving a genuine SC candidate of the opportunity of employment and livelihood by suppressing that he was born a Muslim.” The affidavit while referring to the illegalities committed by Sameer Wankhede in the course of his duty as NCB zonal director states that during raids the officer has given a complete go by to the procedure and indulged in activities which are likely to compromise the investigations carried out under his charge. The affidavit states that he (Malik) has posted evidence to show that the pancha Mr Fletcher Patel called by Wankhede during raids was known to him and his family. The affidavit states that the revelation by Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the Aryan Khan case wherein he has alleged that Wankhede had made him sign 10 blank pages as a panch witness shows that Sameer Wankhede has been resorting to illegal procedures in the course of discharging his duties. Malik has further reiterated his stand that both Dnyandev Wankhede and his son have been involved in illegal activities by referring to the liquor license issued to a hotel in Vashi in the name of Sameer Wankhede in 1997. The affidavit states that the license was issued to Sameer by the excise department even though he was only 17 years old at the time and Dnyandev was also working as an officer in the said department. The affidavit also claims that the revelations made by him (Malik) regarding the illegalities by Sameer Wankhede have helped the appropriate agencies/authorities to initiate appropriate steps against the erring public servant. The affidavit states that the transfer of six cases being investigated by Sameer to NCB vigilance was an example of the effect of his revelations. The defamation suit by Dnyandev Wankhede is expected to come up for rehearing on his interim plea before a single judge bench in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ample-proof-available-of-dual-identities-of-ncb-s-sameer-wankhede-father-nawab-malik-101639680718262.html
17-12-2021||Lucknow||Two shot dead in Agra village after dispute||Agra Two men of the same family were shot dead in broad daylight after a dispute over water entering their farm land in Chitrapura village under Kheda Rathod police station of Agra on Thursday. The duo, identified as Mahesh Kumar (38) and Dinesh Kumar (35), both cousins, was declared dead after being rushed to a nearby hospital. SSP Agra Sudhir Kumar Singh reached the village in the wake of the double murder. “Mahesh Kumar and Dinesh Kumar had complained that water from another field was entering their farm area and were going to object against this to the family of Kalyan Singh alias Kallu of the same village,” said the SSP. “There was no other ongoing dispute between the two families and a dispute in the past had been resolved. However, the incident today claimed two lives from a family. The accused have fled from their houses and hunt is on to nab them. Teams have been constituted and the guilty will be placed behind bars soon,” claimed SSP Agra. An FIR was registered under Section 302 of IPC (murder) at Kheda Rathod police station against five named accused, including Kalyan Singh alias Kallu, Ghanshyam Singh, Ashok Singh, Hukum Singh and Shiv Kumar, informed police sources at Kheda Rathod police station. Police force was deployed in the village and the bodies were sent for post mortem examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/two-shot-dead-in-agra-village-after-dispute-101639680717065.html
17-12-2021||Delhi||New regional plan proposes a ‘30-minute NCR’||The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) has proposed several measures in the draft Regional Plan-2041 for sustainable development of the region, including limiting the National Capital Region (NCR) to a 100km radius from Rajghat in Delhi, and the reduction of travel time between NCR cities to 30 minutes. The NCRPB has invited public comments on the draft plan until January 7.The NCR, which includes Delhi and 24 districts from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan, is spread over 55,083sqkm. Its size has increased by almost 20,000sqkm since 2005. The present NCR, according to the Regional Plan-2041, is bigger than states such as Punjab, Uttarakhand, Kerala, and Sikkim.The latest document notes that despite two long-term regional plans there has been haphazard growth in the NCR.Delineation of NCRThere is a need for a compact area to ensure planned development of the region, a senior official of the planning board who asked not to be named said.In October, the NCRBP in-principle approved a proposal to limit the NCR to a 100km radius from Rajghat in Delhi. “Beyond the 100km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, all notified cities/ towns along with a corridor of 1km on either side of connecting expressways/national highways/state highways/the Regional Rapid Transit System will be included,” the official said.While the delineation exercise is still going on, the NCRBP said the redefined boundaries will come into effect after being notified by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.According to the regional plan, there will be no change in the number of areas from Uttar Pradesh that is part of NCR now. But Rajasthan is yet to work out the area to be included in NCR, and the Haryana government has given tentative details, following which the total NCR area (25,327 sqkm) will reduce to 10, 546 sqkm.Transport and mobilityTo address the problem of increasing vehicular traffic, the draft plan proposes improving regional transport connectivity. Lack of adequate regional public transport and poor frequency, lack of integration of the system, and multiple interchanges are major issues being faced by the commuters in the region, according to the plan.“It is necessary to minimise journey time across NCR areas... Delhi should have 30-minute connectivity through superfast trains with major cities of NCR,” the plan says.With the people living in the NCR region facing several issues due to the closure of interstate borders last year due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the plan proposes, “Steps shall be taken to prevent the closure of interstate borders by NCR states, except in emergency situations like crime control etc.”It also proposes an elevated or at grade Outer Ring Road to be constructed parallel to the existing outer ring road in Delhi, as well as the development of integrated multimodal transport hubs, among other measures.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “The plan focuses on multimodal facilities, including freight. With mass transit systems such as RRTS coming up in the NCR, there is a need to have multimodal integrated transport hubs.”Area development and resource managementThe plan promotes mixed land use development in the NCR. It pushes for Transit-Oriented Development and greenfield development projects in the sub-regions. With a lot of villages falling in the newly urbanised areas, the regional plan stresses on the need for a comprehensive scheme for the redevelopment of villages.The plan proposes that the Delhi Land Reforms Act should be repealed to ensure the planned development of rural areas. “Archaic laws like Delhi Land Reforms Act, etc. hold back development and create islands of chaos like Lal Dora/ Extended Lal Dora, etc,” the plan says.Paras Tyagi, a resident of Budhela village who runs the Centre for Youth Culture and Law and Environment, a voluntary group working in the rural belts in Delhi, said, “We have been talking about the need for a village development plan. While the regional plan talks about it, there is no effort in Delhi to implement it. As for the land reforms law, it should have been repealed long back. Landowners have been facing a lot of problems due to the current law.”The plan also proposes measures for developing the NCR as a heritage and tourist hub, managing water requirement and sanitation issues, promoting economic growth, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-regional-plan-proposes-a-30-minute-ncr-101639680658376.html
17-12-2021||Delhi||System to gauge role of pollutants in fog, visibility forecasts in Delhi-NCR||The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has developed an early warning and prediction system, which will for the first time take into account the role of pollution in causing foggy conditions and low visibility in Delhi-NCR during the winter season, scientists said on Thursday.They said the new system will also enable agencies to avoid flight delays and cancellations, while making available forecasts for the public.The fog prediction system, which has now been launched by IITM in collaboration with the United Kingdom’s Met office, on an experimental basis, will give out advance forecasts of fog and visibility status in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), while also outlining how aerosols impact foggy conditions and visibility.Currently, the system makes predictions two days in advance, but the technology is being studied and changes will be made in the coming weeks before the portal is made public, scientists said.“Under the project initiated by the Union ministry of earth science, we took a deep dive into understanding fog in Delhi nearly three to four years ago. Based on our knowledge and learning, we have launched the fog prediction system on a pilot basis. This will not only help agencies prepare for severe fog spells that Delhi sees in December and January, but also forecast these conditions make it available for public consumption,” said Sachin Ghude, a scientist at IITM Pune, who is also the lead for the government’s Winter Fog Experiment (WiFEX).The site, through various graphical representations, will give a clear picture of the range of visibility that the city is likely to see at any given hour of the day, the possibility of dense fog (visibility below 200 metres), presence of dust in the air, the size of dust particles and its impact on visibility.For example, for December 17, the fog forecast said the visibility in Delhi is likely to be above 2,000 metres in the morning hours and will consistently improve as the day progresses.Gaurav Govardhan, a scientist at IITM, and a member of the team that developed the system, said aerosols or pollutants cause formation of fog droplets.“The technology is the same as we use for general weather forecasting— just that this time, we are taking into account the impact of aerosols or pollutants on fog formation. Aerosols can help in the formation of fog droplets, which essentially means that more pollutants in the air the greater is the possibility of the formation of fog droplets. You don’t need very humid air for fog,” Govardhan said.
17-12-2021||Lucknow||Country needs Ram Rajya, not socialism: Yogi||In a jibe at the Opposition, particularly the Samajwadi Party (SP), chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said the country needs “Ram Rajya”, not Samajwad (socialism) or Samyavad (communism).He was speaking in the UP legislative assembly while making some populist announcements after minister for finance Suresh Khanna presented the second supplementary demands for grants for 2021-22 in the House. “We have already said that this country neither needs communism or socialism. This country only wants Ram Rajya and Uttar Pradesh only wants Ram Rajya. Ram Rajya means the one which is everlasting, universal and eternal, not affected by circumstances,” Yogi said.Yogi also used the occasion to target Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for his Jinnah remarks (without naming him).He said socialism was the biggest dogma and the Samajwadi Party (SP) was pursuing different brands of socialism that include “parivarvadi” (dynastic socialism), mafiavadi (mafia socialism), arajaktavadi (anarchist socialism), dangawadi (riot socialism) and atankvadi samjwad ( terrorist socialism).“The people take Samajwad as a red alert now,” he said.Continuing his attack on the SP, he said, “When they celebrated Saifai Mahotsav a special buggy (wagon) was called from England.”Yogi also questioned the SP leadership for banning Krishna Janmashtami celebrations in jails.“If Janmashtami can’t be celebrated in jails then where?” he asked. He targeted the SP government for changing the names of institutions that had been set up in the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram.He said his government, however, changed the names of cities to Prayagraj and Ayodhya that find a mention in the epics.Yogi said 25 crore people of the state were a family for his government while during the previous regimes, different family members of those in power — ‘chacha’, ‘bhatija’, ‘mama’, ‘nana’ — indulged in extortion.“We did not differentiate among people of different classes and communities and followed the principle of ‘sabka saath, sabkaa vikas’ for the state’s development… Mafia cancelling bail to go back to jail is an example of the functioning of this government…The Opposition is not affected by suicide of farmers and hunger of the poor and instead was affected when bulldozers demolished the property of the mafia,” he said.Yogi also said, “A hug with the mafia gives them a feeling of being in heaven.” He also said a competition is going on among the mafia to join different political parties. This will be good if the mafia becomes the cause of their defeat in the 2022 assembly polls, he added.Listing his government’s achievements, Yogi, in his nearly two-hour speech, said UP was the first state to honour every medal winner and participant in the Olympics.“We are also setting up a sports university in Meerut in the hockey legend Dhyan Chand. But what connection you have with sports? Your sport was ‘tamancha’ (country made pistol),” he said in a dig at the Opposition.Leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary (SP) sought to counter the attack by saying let there be a wrestling match or of any other sport between the government and the opposition and the people would know about the real sportsperson.“I have been a wrestler and you have been into wrestling too. Let there be a match here,” said Chaudhary.Though his government was about to complete five years in office it only got 3.5 years to work as a period of about 20 months was spent in the fight against Covid-19, Yogi said. He referred to the work done by his government to fight Covid-19. He also recited a poem by former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Targeting the opposition, he said, “They home quarantined themselves during fight against the Covid-19 wave. Now the people will home quarantine you.”In a lighter vein, Yogi used the occasion to give an open invitation to Ram Govind Chaudhary to join the BJP.“I want you to be active in the field. We can open ways for your induction in the BJP,” he said.Chaudhary, however, said he would remain in the SP throughout his life.“Look at what your party (SP) is doing. The late (former PM) Chandra Shekhar never allowed his family members in politics. You are a follower of Chandra Shekhar who set standards in politics. His son is now with us,” Yogi said.The CM claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi realised the dream of socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia. Lohia had said that no power in the country will be able to remove a government, which builds toilets for the poor and keeps their stoves burning, the chief minister said, referring to works done by the Centre. “Lohia had said that a true socialist would stay away from property. The socialist should keep away from property and progeny,” Yogi said.(WITH PTI INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/country-needs-ram-rajya-not-socialism-yogi-101639680651619.html
17-12-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh, uncle Shivpal form alliance ahead of UP elections||A five-year-old feud within Uttar Pradesh’s influential Yadav family finally ended on Thursday with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav announcing an alliance with his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav for the upcoming state polls.Akhilesh drove to Shivpal’s residence in Lucknow and later tweeted a photo with his uncle, who left the SP and formed the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) in 2019.”Met PSP-L national president and the alliance has been decided. The policy of taking along regional parties has continuously strengthened Samajwadi Party and taking the SP and alliance partners towards historic victory,” said Akhilesh.Later in the day, Shivpal also tweeted the picture of the two. ”Today the Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav ji had a courtesy meeting with me at (my) residence. During the meeting, I had a long discussion with him over the strategy of contesting the forthcoming assembly elections 2022 together,” he said.This is the sixth alliance forged by the SP, which is aiming to dislodge the Bharatiya Janata Party from power in Uttar Pradesh in elections scheduled early next year. On November 3, Akhilesh had hinted about an alliance with PSP-L at his ancestral village Saifai in Etawah district of UP. Shivpal, the younger brother of Akhilesh’s father and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, was considered a top leader of the SP and served as a senior minister when Akhilesh was chief minister between 2012 and 2017.But the two leaders had a bitter fallout over control of the party before the 2017 assembly elections. Beginning August 2016, both leaders hurled verbal barbs at each other for months, eventually leading to more dissension in the party and its poor performance in the 2017 assembly elections, when it was routed from everywhere except its pocket boroughs in central UP.Shivpal floated the PSP-L before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He contested against SP candidate and then sitting MP Akshay Yadav from Firozabad. However, both lost as the BJP wrested the seat from the SP. Shivpal has had limited electoral success but continues to wield influence in districts like Etawah, Mainpuri, Forozabad, Agra and Mathura.On Thursday, as the two leaders came together, hundreds of supporters of both parties gathered outside Shivpal’s residence, raising the slogan “chacha bhatija zindabad (long live the uncle and nephew)”.“This is a happy and positive political development. This will strengthen the anti-BJP forces and consolidate the Lohiawadi and socialist movement in the country. Shivpalji had always been trying for this alliance for removal of the BJP,” said Deepak Mishra, a PSP-L leader.Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said “Akhilesh Yadav ji is allying with small, regional parties. And SP will form the next government”.
17-12-2021||World||Russia sets out tough demands for security pact with NATO||Russia on Friday published draft security demands that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance's military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe — bold ultimatums that are almost certain to be rejected by the U.S. and its allies.The proposals, which were submitted to the U.S. and its allies earlier this week, also call for a ban on sending U.S. and Russian warships and aircraft to areas from where they can strike each other’s territory, along with a halt to NATO military drills near Russia.The demand for a written guarantee that Ukraine won't be offered membership already has been rejected by the West, which said Moscow doesn't have a say in NATO's enlargement.NATO’s secretary-general responded Friday by emphasizing that any security talks with Moscow would need to take into account NATO concerns and involve Ukraine and other partners. The White House similarly said it’s discussing the proposals with U.S. allies and partners, but notes that all countries have the right to determine their future without outside interference.The publication of the demands — contained in a proposed Russia-U.S. security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and NATO — comes amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has raised fears of an invasion. Moscow has denied it has plans to attack its neighbor, but is seeking legal guarantees precluding NATO expansion and deploying weapons there.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia’s relations with the U.S. and NATO have approached a “dangerous point,” noting that alliance deployments and drills near Russia have raised “unacceptable” threats to its security.Moscow wants the U.S. to start talks immediately on the proposals in Geneva, he told reporters.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had received the Russian documents, and noted that any dialogue with Moscow “would also need to address NATO’s concerns about Russia’s actions, be based on core principles and documents of European security, and take place in consultation with NATO’s European partners, such as Ukraine.”He added that the 30 NATO countries “have made clear that should Russia take concrete steps to reduce tensions, we are prepared to work on strengthening confidence building measures.”White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that strategic security talks with Moscow go back decades, adding that “there’s no reason we can’t do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we’re going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.”“There will be no talks on European security without our European allies and partners,” Psaki said. ”We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy free from the outside interference."President Vladimir Putin raised the demand for security guarantees in last week’s video call with U.S. President Joe Biden. During the conversation, Biden voiced concern about a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine and warned him that Russia would face “severe consequences” if Moscow attacked its neighbor.U.S. intelligence officials say Russia has moved 70,000 troops to its border with Ukraine and is preparing for a possible invasion early next year. Moscow denies any intention to attack and accused Ukraine of planning an offensive to reclaim control of rebel-held eastern Ukraine — an allegation Kyiv has rejected.Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine began after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. It has killed over 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine’s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas.The Russian demands would oblige Washington and its allies to pledge to halt NATO's eastward expansion to include other ex-Soviet republics and rescind a 2008 promise of membership to Ukraine and Georgia. The alliance already has firmly rejected that demand from Moscow.The demands also would preclude the U.S. and its allies from setting up military bases in Ukraine, Georgia and other ex-Soviet nations that aren't members of NATO.The proposal also contains a new demand to roll back NATO troops deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, stating that the parties agree not to send any troops to areas where they hadn't been present in 1997 — before NATO's eastward expansion started — except for exclusive situations of mutual consent.Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999, followed in 2004 by Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the following years, Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia also became members, bringing NATO membership to 30 nations.The draft proposals contain a ban on the deployment of U.S. and Russian warships and aircraft to “areas where they can strike targets on the territory of the other party.”Moscow has long complained about patrol flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russia's borders and the deployment of U.S. and NATO warships to the Black Sea, describing them as destabilizing and provocative.Russia's draft also envisages a pledge not to station intermediate-range missiles in areas where they can strike the other party’s territory, a clause that follows the U.S. and Russian withdrawal from a Cold War-era pact banning such weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sets-out-tough-demands-for-security-pact-with-nato-101639755352588.html
17-12-2021||World||UK reports third consecutive record of daily Covid-19 cases||The British government on Friday reported 93,045 new coronavirus cases, a third consecutive record daily tally, as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in infections across the country.The latest data brings the total number of infections during the pandemic to more than 11.1 million, while the UK also registered a further 111 deaths from the virus, taking the death toll to more than 147,000.Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Omicron is now the country's dominant coronavirus strain, adding "the tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us".And Welsh leader Mark Drakeford told citizens to brace for the "storm of Omicron" having announced the country's nightclubs will close after December 26 and social distancing reintroduced in shops and workplaces.Britain is currently rolling out a mass booster drive in order to vaccinate as many people as possible before the end of the year.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the aim was on "trying to make sure that we not only have the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe" but also "to avert some of the more damaging consequences of Omicron".Johnson is under pressure to announce further restrictions, but minister Oliver Dowden said that the government has "the balance right".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-third-consecutive-record-of-daily-covid-cases-101639759505392.html

The rest are due to arrive in the next few months and will be looked after and integrated into Italian society by the Catholic Sant' Egidio charity group.The first group included doctors and information technology workers in their native countries, among others.The pope will provide for 50 migrants to resettle in Italy as part of a deal between Italy, the Vatican and Cyprus to commemorate his trip earlier this month to the Mediterranean island.Francis, who was elected the first pontiff from Latin America in 2013, has made defence of migrants and refugees a cornerstone of his pontificate.Ethnically-divided Cyprus, the closest European Union member state to the Middle East, has struggled to manage an influx of migrants and refugees in the past two years.Many asylum seekers access the southern government-controlled areas through the "Green Line" splitting the island after previously arriving in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in its north.The pope also visited Greece during the Dec. 2-6 trip, including a stop at a refugee camp on the island of Lesbos.During a previous visit in 2016, he left Lesbos, then at the frontline of Europe's migration crisis, taking 12 Syrian refugees with him. (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Susan Fenton)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrants-help-pope-francis-celebrate-85th-birthday-101639757458887.html

The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing the work.Questions have centered on alleged harassment and discrimination in the workplace, according to the emails. Conversations have taken place as recently as last month, one of the sources said.The DFEH declined to comment.Google said it is focused on "building sustainable equity" for its Black workers and that 2020 was its largest year for hiring what it calls "Black " workers, a designation inclusive of people belonging to multiple races."Our goal is to ensure that every employee experiences Google as an inclusive workplace," it said. "We’ll continue to focus on this important work and thoroughly investigate any concerns, to make sure our workplace is representative and equitable."The DFEH has interviewed workers who have filed formal complaints and those who have not, the people said, showing that the regulator has sought more examples of potential mistreatment.The agency is involved in ongoing lawsuits against video game companies Tencent Holdings' Riot Games and Activision Blizzard Inc alleging widespread discrimination and harassment.But its cases do not always result in charges.For years Black men in the tech industry have said they have faced disparaging comments and discouraging experiences, such as being shut out of offices because security guards and colleagues questioned whether they actually worked there.As more Black women have joined the workforce, such complaints have increased. Seven current and former Google employees told Reuters this year about being marginalized on projects as Black women and not taken as seriously as colleagues with different backgrounds.Artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru has said Google fired her a year ago for criticizing its lack of workforce diversity and for fighting managers who objected to publishing a critical paper she co-wrote. Erika Munro Kennerly, who oversaw diversity and strategy teams at Google before resigning last year, told magazine Corporate Counsel in January that "there's an overall tone of being undervalued" as a Black woman at Google.Workers identifying as "Black female" left Google at the highest rate of any racial-gender group other than "Native "American female" last year, according to company data. Google last year said it planned to boost retention by increasing support staffing and programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-probes-google-s-treatment-of-black-female-workers-101639742596926.html
17-12-2021||World||12 dead as Typhoon Rai strikes the Philippines||A powerful typhoon that battered the central Philippines left at least 12 people dead in massive floods that trapped residents on roofs and damaged buildings including a hotel and an airport, officials said.Typhoon Rai slightly weakened after slamming ashore Thursday on the country's southeastern coast but still packed destructive and deadly winds of 150 kilometres (93 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 205 (127 mph). Meteorologists said it was moving away into the South China Sea on Friday.Officials were assessing the damage and casualties wrought by one of the strongest typhoons to hit the country in recent years but said efforts were hampered by widespread power outages, downed communications and roads clogged with fallen trees and debris.Witnesses described ferocious winds that ripped off roofs and forced down trees.“I have never experienced such ferocity of the wind in my life and we were not even directly hit,” Mayor Jerry Trenas of central Iloilo city told The Associated Press by telephone, adding that at least one resident was killed when she was hit by a cluster of bamboo blown down by the storm on her hut.Workers were clearing roads in the coastal city of nearly half a million people, which remained without power and struggled with erratic cellphone signals, he said.Eleven other people died, mostly after being hit by fallen trees, collapsed walls and ceilings and debris, and seven villagers were missing, Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government's disaster-response agency, told President Rodrigo Duterte in a televised meeting.A large number of houses and buildings, including an airport and a hotel, were damaged by the wind or inundated by floodwaters, officials said.In central Bohol province, which was directly hit by the typhoon, Gov. Arthur Yap said many residents remained trapped on their roofs by floodwater for a second day in the riverside town of Loboc, where his own house was swamped by water up to the second floor.Yap pleaded for volunteers from other regions to help save residents, saying he and other officials were struggling to find a way to deploy rescue boats to Loboc.“Hundreds of families are trapped on the rooftops right now,” Yap told DZBB radio, adding that residents were exposed to rain and wind overnight. “We need first responders. What's important now is to save lives.”It was unclear what happened in other towns in the hard-hit province, which still had no electricity, Yap said.Presidential spokesman Karlo Nograles said more than 332,000 people were evacuated as the typhoon approached, including nearly 15,000 who were brought to evacuation centers.Crowding in those centers complicated efforts to keep people safely distanced after authorities detected the country's first infections caused by the omicron variant of the coronavirus. Vaccination campaigns were also halted in provinces lashed by the typhoon.The coast guard grounded all vessels in dozens of ports, stranding more than 4,500 passengers and ferry and cargo ship workers.An international airport in central Cebu province was closed and several mostly domestic flights were cancelled while schools and workplaces were shut in the most vulnerable areas, Nograles said.At least 62 cities and towns either lost power entirely or were experiencing disruptions.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago is located in the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” region, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-dead-as-typhoon-rai-strikes-the-philippines-101639740327738.html

Zamir Kabulov, the Kremlin's envoy to Afghanistan, said the Sunni Pashtun group has to ensure inclusiveness in power-sharing but clarified that it wasn’t an ultimatum, reported Russian news agency Sputnik."Ethnic political inclusiveness is needed. They might lose power in the near future if they keep acting like that. They will have to ensure inclusiveness. By the way, we say this without ultimatums, calmly - just do it. They will have to do it," Sputnik quoted Kabulov as saying.The Taliban announced a Cabinet expansion in September insisting that the Sunni Pashtun group has opted for an inclusive government. But a closer look showed that the government remained dominated by Taliban officials, including members of the Haqqani network. The ethnic minorities were not given any significant posts and all induction were unknown faces. They also didn’t include a single woman in the Cabinet.The international community has repeatedly called on the hardline Islamist group to share a greater fraction of the power pie with the member of ethnic minority communities such as Hazaras and Tajiks. It has not recognised the Taliban as countries around the world continue to monitor the actions of the Islamist fundamentalists on the human rights front as well as inclusiveness.Kabulov said that the Afghan assets will be unfrozen if the outfit starts making concessions, noting that the assets frozen in Western nations are the resources of the Afghan people and not the funds of the Taliban. As Afghanistan is witnessing a serious humanitarian crisis, the Russian diplomat said Western countries should bear full financial responsibility for the situation.When asked about the possibility of Russia providing a loan to the war-torn country, Kabulov said, "We can, of course, if (Russian) President (Vladimir Putin) decides. But you understand, have we got some extra money?”“Let us be careful with this. Our priority is the provision of humanitarian aid, food supplies, the provision of specific products and other essentials. Things due to what the Afghan people can survive this winter," he added, as quoted by Sputnik.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-risk-losing-power-without-inclusive-government-in-afghanistan-warns-russia-101639740378042.html

Watch here||Internet users have, once again, managed to find a “doppelganger” of none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk. A short video first posted on TikTok of a man bearing striking resemblance to the billionaire business magnate and SpaceX chief has gone viral on social media platforms over the past few days. But some have contested that the video is, in fact, just a clever deepfake.In the video, the man, who is a self-proclaimed “Chinese Elon Musk”, is seen standing next to a car, mimicking the Tesla chief. According to a New York Post report, the video has already garnered more than 878 reactions and 1,801 shares, but sparked a debate around its authenticity in the comments.See video here:中国山寨ELON musk 还真像Most users have claimed that the video is digitally altered or a ‘deepfake’ in which Musk’s face has been superimposed on just another guy. Users have claimed that there’s a small glitch around his eyes and mouth if one looks closely.“It's a deep fake. There's a small glitch when he speaks as the camera is panning around; it's in the eyes and the mouth, looks delayed,” a user wrote in the comments.The video has, however, left many users in awe over the uncanny resemblance. Some of them even dubbed the doppelganger as “Yi Long Musk” as a joke.Similar doppelgangers and deep fakes have been spotted across the internet of many other celebrities. Earlier this year, a deep fake of Tom Cruise went viral on social media platforms. It was later debunked by TikTok users. Other celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and many others have discovered doppelgangers on the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-doppelganger-viral-video-stuns-netizens-but-some-say-it-s-deep-fake-watch-here-101639733087324.html
17-12-2021||World||Top Pakistan Taliban commander escapes suspected drone strike||A top leader of the Pakistan Taliban escaped unhurt from a suspected drone strike on a safe house in eastern Afghanistan, the militant group said Friday.The strike on Thursday evening came a week after a ceasefire between the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the government collapsed, with militants accusing Islamabad of killing its fighters.The TTP -- a separate movement but sharing common roots with Afghanistan's new leaders -- plunged Pakistan into a period of horrific violence after forming in 2007.Two TTP sources currently in Afghanistan told AFP that Maulvi Faqir Mohammad was the target of what they described as a drone strike on a compound in Chawgam village, in the eastern province of Kunar bordering Pakistan."Maulvi Faqir Mohammad was not present at the time... two fighters of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan were wounded," one source said.The compound was being used as a base by TTP fighters from Pakistan crossing the porous border with Afghanistan, he said.Mohammad was arrested by the previous US-backed Kabul government and spent years in Afghanistan's notorious Bagram prison, but was released after the Taliban's lightning takeover of the country in August.It was not clear who was responsible for Thursday's attack, but both Pakistan and the United States have previously used unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct assassinations in the region.Bilal Karimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, told AFP from Kabul that the strike was an explosive fired from the ground.The TTP emerged 14 years ago and have been blamed for around 70,000 killings by successive Pakistani governments.Thursday marked the seventh anniversary of the TTP massacre of nearly 150 schoolchildren in Peshawar, an atrocity that remains seared on Pakistan's national consciousness.It prompted a 2014 crackdown by the military which crushed the movement and forced its hardline Islamist fighters into hiding in Afghanistan.Pakistan is now trying to quell a TTP comeback after the victory of the Taliban in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-pakistan-taliban-commander-escapes-suspected-drone-strike-101639731972077.html
17-12-2021||World||Taliban prepares Afghan budget without any foreign support||Afghanistan's finance ministry under the new Taliban government has prepared a draft national budget that, for the first time in two decades, is funded without foreign aid, a spokesman said.It comes as the country is mired in economic crisis and faces a looming humanitarian catastrophe the United Nations has called an "avalanche of hunger".Finance ministry spokesman Ahmad Wali Haqmal did not disclose the size of the draft budget -- which runs until December 2022 -- but told AFP it would go to the cabinet for approval before being published."We are trying to finance it from our domestic revenues -- and we believe we can," he earlier told state television in an interview shared on Twitter.Global donors suspended financial aid when the Taliban seized power in August and Western powers also froze access to billions of dollars in assets held abroad.The 2021 budget, put together by the previous administration under IMF guidance, projected a deficit despite 219 billion Afghanis in aid and grants and 217 billion from domestic revenue.At that time the exchange rate was around 80 Afghanis to the dollar, but the local currency has been hammered since the Taliban's return, particularly in the past week, slumping to 130 on Monday before recovering Friday to around 100.Haqmal accepted that public servants are still owed several months of wages, saying "we are trying our best" to make good on overdue pay by year-end.He warned, however, a new pay scale had also been prepared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-prepares-afghan-budget-without-any-foreign-support-101639726806871.html

17-12-2021||World||Amid new election laws, Hong Kong is all ready to cast vote||Hong Kong voters are preparing to vote for the first time this weekend since election laws were changed, amid a dearth of opposition candidates months after the city began cracking down on dissent.The legislative elections, to be held Sunday, come after Beijing in March passed a resolution for electoral reform in Hong Kong that gives Beijing more control over who is elected to Hong Kong's legislature. Beijing has tightened its grip over the semi-autonomous Chinese city following months of pro-democracy protests in 2019 that at times descended into violent clashes between police and protesters.Hong Kong later amended its laws in May, reducing the number of directly elected lawmakers to 20 from 35, even as the legislature was expanded from 70 to 90 seats. Most of the lawmakers in the legislature would be appointed by largely pro-Beijing bodies.Under the new laws, legislative candidates will also be vetted by a largely pro-Beijing committee to ensure that only “patriots” loyal to Beijing rule the city.The elections also come amid a crackdown on dissent in the city. Most of Hong Kong's prominent pro-democracy activists and opposition politicians are either in jail or awaiting trial after 47 pro-democracy figures were charged with subversion under a national security law in January over their roles in an unofficial primary election.The electoral reforms and stringent vetting processes have also led to fewer pro-democracy candidates. For the first time since 1997, no members from Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, submitted applications to be nominated.Overall, the number of candidates for the elections has also fallen. This year, the elections committee approved the nominations of 153 candidates — about half of the 289 nominated to run in the 2016 race.Regina Ip, a pro-establishment candidate running in the Hong Kong Island West constituency, said that voters will take some time to get used to the new electoral system.“In the long term, this is a system that permits people of different political ideologies to take part as long as they support our basic constitutional system,” she said. “That is not too much to ask.”Voter turnout is widely expected to be low for Sunday’s elections. Polls by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in November found that 53% of respondents opposed the new electoral system and only 52% planned to vote — which would be the lowest turnout in three decades.But Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam dismissed concerns of low voter turnout, saying that low voting numbers could indicate that people were happy with the government and did not see a need to elect different lawmakers.To encourage people to vote, authorities announced that public transport will be free on Sunday. The government also set up polling stations at border checkpoints that will allow registered Hong Kong voters living and working in mainland China to cross the border briefly to vote, before returning to the mainland without having to undergo quarantine.Earlier this month, Lam said that some 18,000 people had registered to vote at the border polling stations.Some activists abroad, such as London-based Nathan Law, have called for Hong Kong residents to boycott the elections, describing the race as a “selection” in which candidates have been vetted by “political police.”“Figures representing people have no hope of running,” Law said in a tweet earlier this week.New election laws have also banned residents in Hong Kong from inciting others to cast invalid votes or boycott the elections. Those convicted of doing so face up to three years in jail and a 200,000 Hong Kong dollar ($25,600) fine.The new electoral reforms are a “derailing of the democratization process,” said Kenneth Chan, an associate professor in Hong Kong Baptist University’s department of government and international studies.“At the end of the day, 4.4 million eligible voters in December would only be choosing 20 of the 90 lawmakers,” he said. “If you just run the arithmetic, you can easily tell there isn’t really any progress towards democracy.”The lack of candidates with different political inclinations in the elections also does not inspire confidence in terms of the possible checks and balances that could exist between the government and the legislature, according to Chan.Still, some election hopefuls are running for seats with a moderate stance. Jeffrey Chan, a so-called “non-establishment” candidate and a member of local think tank Path of Democracy, is reluctant to define his position on the political spectrum.“We would support pro-establishment lawmakers or the government if what they propose is good for Hong Kong. We will oppose if they don’t make sense,” Chan said. “We don’t have a fixed stance. This is what we are. We stand with Hong Kong citizens and we strive for democracy, rule of law and freedom.”Another candidate, Adrian Lau, is one of the few in this election who have described themselves as “pro-democracy.” Lau previously owned a public relations business, before turning to politics.He ran in the 2019 district council elections, beating veteran pro-establishment politician Michael Tien in the Tsuen Wan district. District councillors typically look after municipal matters, such as the maintenance of public facilities and organizing community events.“Now, we don’t have the power to oppose, but we could still monitor the government and officials as well as the budget,” Lau said.“A legislator also has an important role to communicate with foreign media. Do we still need someone from the pro-democracy camp to do this job? If no one is doing it, we are just sitting back and doing nothing,” he said. “I choose not to sit back and surrender.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-new-election-laws-hong-kong-is-all-ready-to-cast-vote-101639718889660.html
17-12-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau government outlines Indo-Pacific strategy||In assigning responsibilities to his new Cabinet, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asked ministers to focus on the Indo-Pacific and develop a comprehensive strategy for the region.While the 38-member Cabinet was sworn in October, the mandate letters were issued by Trudeau on Thursday and underscored the significance the region now holds in future Canadian policy-making.In his mandate letter to Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly, Trudeau said she “will lead Canada’s contribution to addressing global challenges, including by deepening our partnerships in regions of strategic importance, such as the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions, and strengthening Canada’s diplomatic capacity”. He also added that her remit will include the responsibility to “develop and launch a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic, economic and defence partnerships and international assistance in the region”. Global Affairs Canada, her department, will be supported in this objective by at least three other departments - defence, international trade and international development.Defence minister Anita Anand was asked to “support the minister of foreign affairs in developing and launching a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic and defence partnerships in the region”.Meanwhile, directions for Mary Ng, Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, included “negotiating, as part of a new Indo-Pacific strategy, new bilateral and regional trade agreements, expanding foreign investment promotion and protection agreements and building stronger economic linkages”. Discussions between India and Canada over a streamlined free trade agreement have resumed this year.Finally, Minister of International Development and Minister Responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada Harjit Sajjan was told to “support the Minister of Foreign Affairs in developing and launching a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic partnerships and international assistance in the region”.The Indo-Pacific has not figured so prominently in prior mandate letters during Justin Trudeau’s tenure at PM, which began in 2015, or even earlier.As the House of Commons met for the first time in November after the September elections, Canada’s governor-general (GG) Mary Simon outlined the policy priorities of the government and among those was “making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”. That was its maiden appearance in what is described as the Throne Speech, since the GG represents Canada’s head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.“Mandate letters outline the commitments that each minister will work to accomplish, as well as the pressing challenges they will address in their role. Mandate letters are not an exhaustive list of all files a minister will work on,” a release issued by the prime minister’s office noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeu-govt-outlines-indo-pacific-strategy-101639723612384.html

Authorities, however, have deemed the threat to be fake.But parents are concerned, and so are students. So, school officials in states like Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania have increased police presence on campus. Some of them have even announced plans to close school buildings on Friday.Important message from @laschools regarding keeping our schools safe. We look forward to seeing everyone at school tomorrow!

Authorities believe it originated in Arizona; they are trying to assure the parents saying that viral posts are not considered credible.“Law enforcement agencies have investigated this threat and determined that it originated in Arizona and is not credible,” the Baltimore County Public Schools said on its Twitter account.(2/3) Law enforcement agencies have investigated this threat and determined that it originated in Arizona and is not credible. We want to continue to encourage members of Team BCPS to report suspicious or threatening activities or postings.TikTok, meanwhile, said it is cooperating with law enforcement agencies in the investigation.“We handle even rumored threats with utmost seriousness, which is why we’re working with law enforcement to look into warnings about potential violence at schools even though we have not found evidence of such threats originating or spreading via TikTok,” the social media company said in a statement.The threat comes just two weeks after the United States witnessed one of the worst school shooting incidents since 2018, in Michigan.On November 30, a 15-year-old boy opened fire inside Oxford High School in Michigan, killing four students and injuring seven others. He was later identified as Ethan Crumbley and is facing murder charges in the wake of the shooting.What’s worrying the parents and school authorities most is the disturbing trend that has gripped the children hooked to social media. In September, a “devious licks” challenge saw students across the schools in the US vandalising school bathrooms and stealing soap dispensers.Then in October, students were challenged to slap a teacher. This led to National Education Association call representatives of Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to intervene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/viral-tiktok-challenge-warns-of-shooting-across-us-schools-on-friday-101639720530449.html

He was succeeded by present leader Kim Jong Un. In a report, Radio Free Asia confirmed the ban, quoting a resident of Sinuiju, a border city of the country. According to the resident, all leisure activities have been banned for this period. Residents can't go grocery shopping, the report said. The offenders will be arrested as it happens every year, the resident said."In the past, many people who were caught drinking or being intoxicated during the mourning period were arrested and treated as ideological criminals," the unnamed citizen said adding, "They were taken away and never seen again."The mourning period will go on for 11 days this year as this is the 10th death anniversary. Generally, a 10-day mourning period is observed every year."Even if your family member dies during the mourning period, you are not allowed to cry out loud and the body must be taken out after it's over. People cannot even celebrate their own birthdays if they fall within the mourning period," the resident added.The crackdown this year has been going on since the beginning of December as the North Korean Police were preparing for the mourning period.Kim Jong il died of a heart attack on December 17 in 2011 at the age of 69.Every year since his father's death, Kim pays respects at the memorial of his father but this year the state media did not immediately report any public activities by Kim on Friday morning, news agency AP reported. “Great leader and comrade Kim Jong Il is always with us ... and he is the eternal ‘suryong’ and sun of ‘juche (self-reliance)’ of our party and revolution,” the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in an editorial, referring to a revered title reserved for North Korean leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-bans-laughing-shopping-to-mark-kim-jong-il-s-death-anniversary-101639718917294.html

So far twenty-three people have been taken to nearby hospitals, he said.The building houses an internal medicine clinic, an English language school and other businesses, NHK national television said.The cause of the fire and other details were not immediately known. Osaka police said they were investigating to determine whether the fire was caused by arson or an accident.People on other floors of the building were believed to have been evacuated, Kishimoto said.NHK footage showed dozens of fire engines and police vehicles on the street near the building, with onlookers watching the development from across the street.NHK quoted a witness saying she heard a woman's voice coming from the fourth floor asking for help. Another witness told TV Asahi he saw orange flames and grey smoke coming out of windows on the fourth floor of the building when he stepped outside after hearing a commotion.In all, seventy fire engines were mobilized to fight the fire, which was mostly extinguished within about 30 minutes of an emergency call, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/27-feared-dead-in-building-blaze-in-japan-s-osaka-101639714333610.html

Here's why||Gold prices climbed on Friday, poised for their best week since mid-November, as the dollar weakened after the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to withdraw its pandemic-era stimulus in response to fight to broaden inflationary risks.Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,802.87 per ounce, as of 0323 GMT, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,802.60. The metal has risen 1.1% so far in the week, heading for its first weekly gain in five.The dollar index remained under pressure after hitting a one-week low in the previous session, making greenback-priced bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies. The benchmark 10-year yield dropped 3.8% so far in the week."The gold market is benefiting from high inflation, which is outweighing the Fed's hawkish stance. U.S. 10-year real yield moved deeper into negative territory, keeping the investment backdrop supportive," ANZ analysts said in a research note."Should negative interest rates stay longer than expected, it should favour investor demand for gold."Britain became the first G7 economy to hike interest rates since the onset of the pandemic on Thursday, with the U.S. central bank also signalling plans to tighten in 2022 but the European Central Bank only slightly reining in the stimulus.The Bank of Japan on Friday decided to taper its corporate debt purchases to pre-pandemic levels and scale back some of its emergency funding scheme upon reaching the March 2022 deadline.Reduced stimulus and interest rate hikes tend to push government bond yields up, raising the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which bears no interest.The U.S. Fed said it would pave the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases by the end of 2022 as the economy nears full employment and the Fed copes with a surge of inflation.Silver dipped 0.1% to $22.44 per ounce, platinum was flat at $936.01, and palladium rose 1.2% to $1,750.57.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gold-prices-surge-set-for-best-week-since-mid-november-here-s-why-101639713084309.html

It also said that Pakistan made “limited progress” in its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay or discrimination."Pakistan made limited progress on the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter-terrorism, specifically in its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay or discrimination," the US State Department report said in its 2020 ‘Country Reports on Terrorism’.At the same time, the US report stated that Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats and respond “in a timely manner” to the requests made by the United States for information related to terrorism investigations.On Pakistan, the US report said that in February and again in November, a Lahore anti-terrorism court convicted LeT founder Hafiz Saeed on multiple counts of terrorism financing and sentenced him to five years and six months in prison but failed to take action against other terrorist leaders.It then listed the terror attacks that took place in Pakistan last year, including the one in Quetta in which 15 people were killed and 18 others injured. Islamic Stae had claimed responsibility for the attack.The report said that on June 29, four Balochistan Liberation Army militants carrying guns and grenades charged the security barrier of the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi.

Nadim Qadir, the son of a Liberation War martyr, told Hindustan Times' sister publication HT Bangla that pro-Pakistani forces, in hiding, are still attempting to lay waste to Bangladesh and that the country's security forces must exercise alert and remember that the fight against anti-national elements is not over yet.Nadim, the son of Liberation War martyr Colonel Abdul Qadir, recalled in an interview with the publication painful memories from 50 years ago when the Pakistani militia pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities, and armed personnel.“Family members of the Mukti Bahini (the Bangladeshi resistance army) fighters are forever haunted by these traumatic recollections,” said Nadim. “I find myself getting extremely emotional every time it comes up.”He continued, “I was barely a ten-year-old kid back when my father answered the call of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and went to the frontlines. This was also the time when my mother was in a delicate state, pregnant with a child on the way. He (Nadim's father) received the news and decided to come visit my mother in the hospital pod, but he was caught by the Pakistani militia.”Gathering his thoughts, Nadim resumed, “They (the Pakistani armed forces) killed my father, less than two weeks before my younger brother Arun was born. We located Col Qadir's grave in 2007, but my mother had already passed away in 1999.”Looking back at the struggle, Nadim Qadir thanked India for lending its hand to the neighbouring country's struggle for Independence all those years ago. He said Bangladesh, with the support of its allies, is progressing under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, but there is cause for concern yet.Recalling the 2004 Dhaka grenade attack, Nadim said, “Our leader was targeted by pro-Pakistan militant outfits, many of which are still active in Bangladesh. These anti-national forces need to be eliminated. If these Pakistani collaborators continue to exist even 50 years after the war for independence, for what purpose had the Muktijoddhas laid down their lives?”Nadim Qadir, for his part, is playing his role in instilling Bengali nationalism among the new generation in his country. A foundation, named ‘Muktadhara '71’, has been established with a complex in the Mustafapur village of the Rangpur district, which serves to teach younger children the values of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/propak-forces-still-trying-to-ruin-bangladesh-says-son-of-liberation-war-martyr-101639708210597.html

(Prince Mohammed) is no longer a king in the making, he is a king in the palace."His path to the throne is clear and has been for some time, with no foreseeable obstacles after he drove out one rival after another."There is no identifiable source of effective opposition inside or outside the royal family," said Hussein Ibish, a Washington-based Middle East expert.He added that "MBS is indeed becoming more prominent and powerful".Despite some concern that the international community would not want to deal with Prince Mohammed, especially after the Khashoggi murder, a Riyadh-based diplomat said that such fears "dissipated after Macron's visit to Saudi Arabia".While US President Joe Biden vowed a tougher approach than his predecessor Donald Trump, and has yet to directly communicate with Prince Mohammed, the administration has made it clear that it is inevitable."It's only a matter of time," said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-prince-mohammed-becomes-uncrowned-king-amid-father-s-failing-health-101639711377182.html

Since its detection in South Africa three weeks ago, Omicron cases have already been found in 77 countries.In the United States, which was the worst affected country by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the number has been increasing alarmingly.The first case of Omicron was detected in the United States on December 1 after an individual travelled from South Africa to San Francisco in late November. The traveller was vaccinated.Since then, the Omicron cases have been steadily increasing in the United States.Where has Omicron been detected in the United States?According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the highly transmissible variant has been reported in 38 states of the country. It now makes up three per cent of the reported cases across the United States. (See map)In some states, like New York and New Jersey, there is a high presence of Omicron - in as many as 13 per cent of the total samples.In New York, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positivity has doubled in three days, which the experts say is due to the Omicron variant. “It is clear that the Omicron variant is here in New York City in full force,” New York mayor Bill de Blasio said.However, Delta continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States.According to the CDC, 200 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, but only 56 million have received a booster shot.President Joe Biden sounds alarmAmid the unabated spread of the Omicron variant, US President Joe Biden on Thursday warned about a winter of "severe illness and death" for unvaccinated Americans."...I want to send a direct message to the American people: Due to the steps we've taken, Omicron has not yet spread as fast as it would've otherwise done and as is happening in Europe. But it's here now, and it's spreading, and it's going to increase," said Biden after meeting with members of his Covid-19 response team.Biden empathised on the need to get booster shots in guarding against the virus amid the spread of a new variant.The situation in AmericasSince the start of the pandemic, more than 98 million people in the Americas have developed Covid-19 and more than 2.3 million have died from the disease.More than a third of all cases reported worldwide, and one in four deaths, have occurred in the region.In the United States, the Covid-19 death toll surpassed the tragic number of 800,000 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-38-states-have-omicron-cases-covid-positivity-rate-doubles-in-new-york-101639711469966.html

The variant has been reported in 77 countries and has been spreading faster than any other strain, according to World Health Organization (WHO).'Omicron may have higher reinfection risk but...': Watch WHO warning on OmicronThe scientists across the globe are putting their heads together to understand the behaviour of Omicron, which is considered to be highly resistant to existing vaccines. So far, the results have shown that this new strain causes less severe Covid-19 symptoms, compared to early variants of the virus.But those infected with Omicron have one symptom in common: Scratchy throat.Also Read | Why antibodies aren't the only defense against OmicronThe chief executive of South Africa-based Discovery Health recently said at a briefing that doctors have noted a slightly different set of symptoms among those testing positive.The most common early sign was a scratchy throat, said CEO Dr Ryan Noach, followed by nasal congestion, a dry cough and myalgia manifesting in lower back pain.Most of these symptoms are mild, said Dr Noach, but stressed that this does not mean that Omicron is less virulent.Also Read | Biden predicts winter of severe illness and death for unvaccinatedA leading British health expert also concurred with Dr Noach and said that preliminary data suggests Omicron is behaving “rather differently” as compared to previous strains of coronavirus.“The symptoms people get from this particular virus are different to the previous variants,” Sir John Bell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday, adding that stuffy nose, sore throat, myalgia and loose stools are the symptoms to look out for.In India, the countrywide tally of Omicron cases reached 87 on Thursday as three states – Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat – and national capital Delhi reported fresh cases.Karnataka reported five new cases of the heavily mutated variant, while Delhi and Telangana registered four such new infections, and Gujarat saw a single case.So far, 11 states and union territories have reported Omicron infections - Maharashtra has seen 32 such cases, Rajasthan has reported 17, Delhi has 10, Karnataka has seen eight infections, Gujarat and Kerala both have reported five, Telangana six, and one case each has been reported in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-scientists-identify-1-symptom-that-confirms-presence-of-variant-101639708918826.html
17-12-2021||World||Why antibodies aren't the only defense against Omicron||In the fight against the coronavirus, one key component of the human immune system has hogged the limelight: antibodies.These Y-shaped proteins have made top news recently because Covid-19 shots don't produce as many of them that work against the heavily mutated Omicron variant compared to past strains -- at least, not without a booster.In the fight against the coronavirus, one key component of the human immune system has hogged the limelight: antibodies. But while they're rightly celebrated, they're not the only game in town.https://t.co/1FtKNBqgF8 pic.twitter.com/kcjWmgIfnTTrained by both vaccines and infection, antibodies grab on to the spike protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus, stopping it from penetrating cells and sickening the host.But while antibodies are rightly celebrated, they're not the only game in town.In fact, "there's a complex and coordinated response that is really beautiful from an evolutionary standpoint," Harvard immunologist Roger Shapiro explains.Here are some key points:'Carpet bombers' of the innate immune systemIn the minutes and hours after the virus first comes calling, signaling proteins send out alarms to recruit the tough-but-dim brutes of the "innate" immune system.First to the scene are "neutrophils," which makeup 50 to 70 percent of all white cells and are quick to fight, but also to perish.Others include hungry "macrophages" that snarf down pathogens and spit out key bits to help train their smarter colleagues, menacingly named "Natural Killer" cells, and "dendritic" cells that pass on their intel to more elite fighters."It's sort of like carpet bombing the whole area and hopefully you damage the invader as much as possible... at the same time calling into the headquarters to get your SEAL units ready to go," said John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.B and T cells: Intelligence officers and trained assassinsIf the invaders aren't driven off, the "adaptive" immune system comes into play.A few days into a first infection, "B cells" wise up to the threat and start pumping out antibodies.Vaccination also trains B cells -- mainly inside lymph nodes in our armpits, near the site of injection -- to be primed and ready.Shapiro likened them to intelligence operatives, holding vital information about threats.The most potent kinds of antibodies, known as "neutralizing," are like chewing gum sticking to the business end of a key, stopping it from unlocking a door.There are other, less-heralded antibodies that aren't as sticky as the neutralizing kind -- but still help grab a hold of the virus, dragging it towards immune cells, or calling for help and escalating the overall response.B cells' key partners are "T cells," which can be broadly split into "helpers" and "killers.""Killers are like assassins, and they go and attack the cells that have been infected," said Shapiro -- but these assassins also inflict collateral damage for the sake of the greater good.The helper T cells "are like generals," added Shapiro, marshaling troops, spurring B cells to up their production, and directing their lethal counterparts toward the enemy.Stopping severe diseaseBecause of its heavily mutated spike protein, the Omicron variant may more easily slip by neutralizing antibodies conferred by prior infection or vaccination.The bad news is this makes people more prone to symptomatic infection. But the good news is that T cells aren't nearly as easily fooled.T cells have a "periscope" into infected cells, where they can look for the constituent parts of the virus during its replication cycle, said Wherry.They're much better at recognizing tell-tale signs of foes they've encountered before, even if their clever disguises get them past antibodies.The killer T cells carry out search-and-destroy missions, poking holes in infected cells, bursting them open, and triggering reactions to bring inflammatory proteins known as "cytokines" to the fight.Depending on the speed of the response, a vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection might get mild, cold-like symptoms, or moderate, flu-like symptoms -- but the chances of severe disease are drastically reduced.None of this detracts from the case for boosters, which skyrocket the production of all types of antibodies, and also seem to further train B and T cells."Omicron is concerning, but the glass is still half-full -- it's not totally going to evade our responses," Wherry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-antibodies-aren-t-the-only-defense-against-omicron-101639708342408.html

This comes days after the Pakistan government gave visas to 112 pilgrims who wanted to visit the sacred complex.The visas have been given for a duration of seven days - from December 17 to 23 - during which these 112 pilgrims are expected to visit.The Katas Raj Temples complex is situated in Punjab's Chakwal district and built around a pond, which is considered sacred by Hindus.After granting the visas on Tuesday, the high commission for Pakistan in New Delhi said that it “remains committed to preserving sacred religious sites and extending all possible assistance to the visiting pilgrims of all faiths”.Earlier in December, the Pakistan high commission in India issued visas to more than 130 Indians to attend the 313th birth anniversary celebrations of Shiv Avtari Satguru Sant Shadaram Sahib in Sindh province.According to news agency PTI, visits to religious places are covered under the Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines, 1974 and the Pakistani government issues visas to Indians for pilgrimage every year.Last month, the Narendra Modi-led Union government announced the reopening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor from November 17 for the benefit of Sikh pilgrims.The Kartarpur Corridor is a visa-free border crossing that joins the Indian border to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. The 4.7-kilometre long stretch allows devotees from India to pay a visit to the Gurudwara without a visa.In 1999, India and Pakistan proposed the idea of the Kartarpur corridor as a part of the New Delhi-Lahore bus diplomacy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-today-indian-pilgrims-to-visit-temple-in-pakistan-s-punjab-province-101639703748780.html

On December 14, it had shot up to 117,000 -- an increase of 35 percent.Biden stressed the importance of vaccinated people getting a booster and of those who have yet to be vaccinated receiving their first shot.Health ministers from the G7 on Thursday called for international cooperation in the face of the Omicron strain, which they called the "biggest current threat to global public health."The outbreak linked to the new variant has spread globally, and more European nations are implementing travel restrictions.The United States, the hardest-hit country in the world, is currently averaging 1,150 Covid-19 deaths per day, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Americans do seem to be in for a rough winter.Broadway shows are being canceled because of more and more positive tests among drama companies.Tools 'are working'Major US universities are reverting to classes and tests online to try to halt the spread of the virus.The National Football League has introduced stricter health controls after 100 or so players tested positive since the beginning of the week. The NBA has also been hit with games being postponed.At the White House, too, there has been a change in tone.A few weeks ago, Biden told Americans the new strain of the virus was no reason to panic.On Thursday, he brought reporters in at the end of a meeting on the pandemic to, as he said in a no-nonsense voice, send a message directly to Americans: vaccinated people should get a booster and the non-vaccinated should get their shots.Shortly before, deputy White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre had suggested the administration did not intend to take specific restrictive measures for the moment and to focus instead on vaccination."The tools that we have, we know are working," she said, adding, "We're just going to continue pushing forward... to get Americans vaccinated and boosted."Biden, who was elected largely on a pledge to end the health crisis in America, unveiled on December 2 a plan to ward off a steep rise in infections, hospitalizations, and death.But he stopped short of taking more restrictive measures, knowing the issue is very sensitive.Like people elsewhere, Americans are fed up with the pandemic, and Republicans regularly speak out against the idea of forcing people to get vaccinated or wear masks.When the Omicron strain was identified weeks ago, the United States halted travel from several southern African countries but did not introduce any other restrictions, and has not tightened health measures on domestic flights.Biden's maneuvering room is limited in any case, as seen in several lawsuits that have held up his order for larger companies to force their workers to get vaccinated.The United States surpassed 800,000 Covid deaths Tuesday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.That is higher than the population of some states, such as Alaska or North Dakota.This year, around 450,000 people have died of Covid, most of them non-vaccinated, even though effective and free vaccines became available in the spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-biden-predicts-winter-of-severe-illness-and-death-for-the-unvaccinated-101639704260448.html
17-12-2021||World||Meta calls out spy firms for targeting 50,000 people across its platforms||Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc is calling out half a dozen private surveillance companies for hacking or other abuses, accusing them in a report published Thursday of collectively targeting about 50,000 people across its platforms.The company's fight with the spy firms comes amid a wider move by American tech companies, US lawmakers, and President Joe Biden's administration against purveyors of digital espionage services, notably the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which was blacklisted earlier this month following weeks of revelations about how its technology was being deployed against civil society.Meta is already suing NSO in a US court. Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta's head of security policy, told Reuters that Thursday's crackdown was meant to signal that "the surveillance-for-hire industry is much broader than one company."Meta's report said it was suspending roughly 1,500, mostly fake accounts run by seven organizations across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta said the entities targeted people in more than 100 countries.Meta did not provide a detailed explanation of how it identified the surveillance firms, but it operates some of the world's biggest social and communications networks and regularly touts its ability to find and remove malicious actors from its platforms.Among them is Israel's Black Cube, which became notorious for deploying its spies on behalf of Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein. Meta said the intelligence firm was deploying phantom personas to chat its targets up online and gather their emails, "likely for later phishing attacks."In a statement, Black Cube said it "does not undertake any phishing or hacking" and said the firm routinely ensured "all our agents' activities are fully compliant with local laws."Others called out by Meta include BellTroX, an Indian cyber mercenary firm exposed by Reuters and the internet watchdog Citizen Lab last year, an Israeli company called Bluehawk CI, and a European firm named Cytrox - all of whom Meta accused of hacking.Cognyte, which was spun off from security giant Verint Systems Inc in February, and Israeli firms Cobwebs Technologies were accused not of hacking but of using fake profiles to trick people into revealing private data.Cognyte, Verint, and Bluehawk did not immediately return messages seeking comment.In an email, Cobwebs spokesperson Meital Levi Tal said the company drew on open sources and that its products "are not intrusive by any means." Messages left with Ivo Malinovski – who until recently identified himself as Cytrox's chief executive on LinkedIn – received no immediate response. BellTroX founder Sumit Gupta has not returned Reuters reporters' messages since his firm was exposed last year. He had previously denied wrongdoing.Gleicher refused to identify any of the targets by name but Citizen Lab, in a report published at the same time as Meta's, said that one of Cytrox's victims was Egyptian opposition figure, Ayman Nour.Nour blamed the Egyptian government for the spying, telling Reuters in an interview from Istanbul that he had long suspected he was under surveillance by officials there."For the first time I have evidence," he said.Egyptian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gleicher said other targets of the spy firms included celebrities, politicians, journalists, lawyers, executives, and regular citizens. Friends and family of the targets were also swept up in the espionage campaigns, he said.Meta cybersecurity official David Agranovich said he hoped Thursday's announcement would "kickstart the disruption of the surveillance-for-hire market." There were some signs that other social media firms were taking similar action, with Twitter announcing the removal of 300 accounts a few hours after Meta's announcement.Whether the takedowns deal with the companies involved more than a temporary setback remains to be seen. Two of the companies, Black Cube and BellTroX, have bounced back after being embroiled in previous spy scandals.Gleicher said that targets of the spy firms would receive automated warnings, but he said Facebook would stop short of identifying the specific firms involved or their clients. That's despite the fact that Facebook said it had identified several customers of Cobwebs, Cognyte, Cytrox, and Black Cube - the latter of which includes law firms.Marta Pardavi, one of several Hungarian human rights defenders who say they were targeted by Black Cube in 2017 and 2018, said she was gratified by the news of Facebook's report but wanted more information."They name law firms," she said. "But law firms have clients. Who are the clients for these law firms?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meta-calls-out-spy-firms-for-targeting-50-000-people-across-its-platforms-101639701416575.html
17-12-2021||World||Nicholas Burns appointed US envoy to China||The US Senate on Thursday confirmed veteran diplomat Nicholas Burns as ambassador to Beijing, filling a position vacant for more than a year despite Washington's growing focus on China.The Senate reached the key 50-vote threshold to approve Burns in an ongoing confirmation that took place after Senator Marco Rubio lifted objections. The final vote was 75-18.Burns, a former US ambassador to Greece and NATO, at his Senate hearing in October called China an "aggressor" in the region and vowed to "compete vigorously," while also seeking cooperation on areas such as climate change.President Joe Biden nominated Burns in August, more than half a year into his term. Rubio held up the nomination as he accused Burns of not being tough enough and not being clear on past dealings with China.Rubio allowed the vote, while also voting against Burns, after prolonged negotiations brought bipartisan support and passage earlier Thursday of an act to ban virtually all imports from China's northeastern region Xinjiang due to concerns of forced labor by the Uyghur minority.Democrats argued that the United States needed an ambassador in Beijing to implement the law, and Burns largely enjoyed support from a number of other Republicans after his long record in government."If you're looking for a bipartisan person to put in a position, this is your guy," said Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."He's done an outstanding job, has an outstanding reputation amongst the cadre of ambassadors."The 65-year-old served as the State Department's number three official under former president George W. Bush and as the spokesperson of the department under Bill Clinton.Burns retired from the Foreign Service in 2008 and became a professor at Harvard University.He was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, accusing the former president of abandoning a longstanding US consensus of standing up for US allies, encouraging democracy and welcoming legal immigration.Trump's ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, resigned in October 2020 to help the Republican president's campaign against Biden.A longtime governor of Iowa, Branstad was described as an "old friend" by President Xi Jinping who visited the agricultural state when he was a lower-ranking official.Despite Burns' confirmation, Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voiced alarm that the Senate has not acted on more than 50 diplomatic nominees due to Republican stalling.sct/to/jh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nicholas-burns-appointed-us-envoy-to-china-101639699487165.html

"They have to go somewhere, and it's probably not imprudent to build them here in Western Europe, centralized under our laws, and to see what they can mean in this case for Zeewolde."Meta spokeswoman Melanie Roe said initial construction costs would be around 700 million euros ($795 million) and no date has been set yet for completion.The 800,000-strong population of Amsterdam are heavy users of data services provided by Meta, yet regional authorities have issued a ban on the construction of further data centres in the city due to strains on its electric grid.The Dutch Data Centre Association estimates that currently data centres make up about 3% of all Dutch electricity usage, but that may rise to 10% by 2030.($1 = 0.8812 euros)(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and David Gregorio)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meta-to-build-its-largest-data-centre-in-netherlands-zeewolde-101639697783472.html

In the end, we contracted by four percent, and Britain by 9.7 percent," he said.He also accused IMF officials in the country of being more interested in "football and feijoada" -- a meat-and-bean stew that is one of Brazil's most famous attractions -- than in helping the economy.The IMF opened its office in Brazil in 1999, when the country turned to the Washington institution for financing to help get out of an economic crisis.That program ended in 2005.The IMF said it had maintained the office to "facilitate dialogue," but Guedes said that was no longer needed."They've been here long enough. There was a lot of imbalance in the relationship," he said.Guedes and Bolsonaro have been at pains to shore up confidence in Brazil's recession-hit economy as the president heads toward elections next October with his popularity at an all-time low.Bolsonaro has alarmed investors by maneuvering to break Brazil's constitutional spending cap in order to fund big social spending, a move condemned as economic populism by critics.Guedes insists the pessimism is unwarranted and that the Bolsonaro administration will leave a stronger economy than it inherited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-can-go-take-a-walk-imf-closes-its-brazil-office-after-guedes-criticism-101639696841149.html
17-12-2021||World||US CDC committee recommends Moderna, Pfizer Covid jabs over J&J's||A panel of outside advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday voted to recommend Americans choose to receive one of the other two authorized COVID-19 vaccines over Johnson & Johnson's shot, due to rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting.The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization voted unanimously to make the recommendation in favor of the vaccines made by Moderna Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech over the J&J shot. The regulator still needs to sign off on the guidance.Fewer Americans have received the J&J shot than the other two vaccines by a significant margin. Out of more than 200 million fully vaccinated people in the United States, around 16 million received J&J's vaccine, according to CDC data.J&J said in a statement that the safety and well-being of those who use their vaccine is its top priority and it looks forward to working with the CDC on the next steps.Cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets, have previously been reported in recipients of the J&J vaccine. The highest reporting rates are in women under 50.The CDC said that the rate of such incidents is higher than previously estimated, both in women and men. The agency has identified more than 50 cases of TTS in the US, about 3.83 cases per million J&J doses administered.At least nine people have died following the blood clotting incidents in the United States, the CDC has said.Members of the panel also said J&J's vaccine is less effective in preventing COVID-19 than the other two authorized vaccines.In a presentation to the committee, a leading J&J vaccine scientist said the vaccine generates a strong and long-lasting immune response with just a single shot."In the setting where many people do not return for a second dose or a booster, the durability of the single shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine as a primary regimen could make a crucial difference in saving lives in the U.S. and around the globe," J&J's Dr. Penny Heaton said.J&J's vaccine uses a technology based on a modified version of an adenovirus to spur immunity in recipients, while the other two authorized vaccines use messenger RNA technology.In the United States, the shot has been useful for reaching some hard-to-reach populations and settings like the homeless and residents of corrections facilities. The vaccine can also be stored and moved at higher temperatures than the mRNA vaccines, which could allow it to be used more easily in some low- and middle-income countries.J&J's one-dose vaccine received emergency use authorization in March. In April, U.S. regulators paused administering the vaccine for 10 days in order to investigate the blood clotting.A CDC scientist said on Thursday that the rate of deaths from TTS did not decrease after the pause in April.J&J shares closed up around 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sells the vaccine at a not-for-profit price, so it has not been a significant revenue driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-committee-recommends-moderna-pfizer-covid-jabs-over-jjs-101639696539160.html
17-12-2021||World||US sanctions China, imposes new trade curbs over Uyghur rights||The United States on Thursday unleashed a volley of actions to censure China's treatment of the Uyghur minority, with lawmakers voting to curb trade and new sanctions slapped on the world's top consumer drone maker.The United States has been ramping up pressure on China amid a crop of disputes, with President Joe Biden's administration a day earlier targeting producers of painkillers that have contributed to America's addiction crisis.The US Senate unanimously voted to make the United States the first country to ban virtually all imports from China's northwestern Xinjiang region over concerns of the prevalence of forced labor."We know it's happening at an alarming, horrific rate with the genocide that we now witness being carried out," said Senator Marco Rubio, a driver behind the act, which already passed the House of Representatives and which the White House says Biden will sign.After prolonged negotiations to secure its passage, Rubio lifted objections and the Senate confirmed veteran diplomat Nicholas Burns as ambassador to China.Burns, a widely respected former ambassador to Greece and NATO and a professor at Harvard, has described China as an "aggressor" and denounced the "genocide" of the Uyghurs, but has also voiced a willingness to cooperate on issues such as climate change.Some US businesses had voiced unease about the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans the import of all goods from the region unless companies offer verifiable proof that production did not involve slavery.Xinjiang is a major source of cotton, with an estimated 20 percent of the garments imported each year into the United States including some material from the region.Rights experts, witnesses and the US government say more than one million Uyghurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims are incarcerated in camps in an effort to root out their Islamic cultural traditions and forcibly homogenize them into China's Han majority.Beijing describes the sites as vocational training centers and says that, like many Western nations, it is seeking to reduce the allure of radical Islam following deadly attacks.The United States has described the campaign as genocide and, along with Australia, Britain and Canada, has planned a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Games next year over the issue.High-tech surveillanceThe Biden administration on Thursday also fired off a round of new sanctions over surveillance in Xinjiang, where rights groups say China has been honing new technologies in artificial intelligence and DNA tracking to keep tabs on Uyghurs.Companies hit by Treasury Department sanctions include SZ DJA Technology, by far the world's largest producer of consumer drones of the type used in filmmaking and aerial photography."These eight entities actively support the surveillance and tracking of members of ethnic and religious minority groups in the PRC, predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, referring to the People's Republic of China.The United States had already restricted trade exports to the company, but the new Treasury Department sanctions will criminalize any US investment in it.Other companies targeted included Xiamen Meiya Pico Information, which has developed a mobile application to track files on individuals' phones, and Cloudwalk Technology, which was developed to recognize faces of Uyghurs and Tibetans and has since been deployed to Zimbabwe to help improve the technology, according to the Treasury Department.Separately, the Commerce Department restricted sensitive exports to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and 11 of its research institutes over biotechnology work including "purported brain-control weaponry," a notice said.The research institutes include centers focused on blood transfusions, bio-engineering and toxicology."The scientific pursuit of biotechnology and medical innovation can save lives," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement."Unfortunately, the PRC is choosing to use these technologies to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of ethnic and religious minority groups," she added.Based in Beijing, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences has been active in development of a Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-china-imposes-new-trade-curbs-over-uyghur-rights-101639696287363.html

Lawyers representing the BJP -- which moved the division bench on Thursday hours after the single bench of justice Rajasekhar Mantha dismissed the same petition -- told the court that BJP candidates and voters may face violence on Sunday and cited the alleged killings after the March-April assembly polls as the ground for such apprehension. Hours after hearing all the parties, the division bench passed its order on Friday night. “So far, no instance of violence has been pointed out nor along with the writ petition, any such material has been enclosed which furnishes a ground for deployment of the central paramilitary forces in the forthcoming Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections. Therefore, at this stage, we do not find sufficient material to accept the prayer,” the order said. “However, we take note of the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that within six hours, the central paramilitary forces can be sent to avoid any untoward incident. Hence, we direct the (state) election commission to take an appropriate decision having due regard to the ground situation in consultation with the state authorities for deployment of central paramilitary forces, in case, if the need so arises, to ensure free and fearless elections,” the order added. Lawyers representing the BJP said they will move the Supreme Court on Saturday, challenging the order. BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar had moved the Supreme Court with the same petition last week. On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear it and asked the BJP to approach the Calcutta high court. The division bench, however, did not close the matter and said it will hear all parties again on December 23 and by then the state government and the state election commission (SEC) have to file their reports. During the hearing, the SEC and the state government told the division bench that adequate police arrangements have been made. Reacting to this, the chief justice said, “We have kept it (the matter) pending to see if what has been stated in this court is being complied with.” When the bench was informed during the day that 22,621 police personnel would be deployed in the city, the chief justice inquired whether the number was adequate. The SEC submitted that additional police personnel can be deployed if the court asks for it. Appearing for the central government, Additional Solicitor General Y J Dastoor told the bench that the Centre can deploy CAPF in Kolkata by Sunday morning and the forces will be at the disposal of the SEC. Observing that the SEC was depending entirely on a Kolkata Police report on deployment of policemen on Sunday, the order said: “Having examined the same, we find that the state authorities and the election commission should reconsider the same. Having regard to the fact that the deployment is to be done not only for preventing violence but for also building confidence in the voters in respect of their safety, we are of the opinion that deployment in polling booth should be strengthened.” Lawyer Loknath Chatterjee, who appeared for the BJP, said the court was reminded of the murder of a BJP worker in Kolkata on May 2, the day the assembly poll results were announced. The case is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. In its order, the division bench said: “It cannot be disputed that free and fair election is the backbone of democracy. Forthcoming Kolkata Municipal Corporation election must be held in a transparent manner in such an atmosphere where voters can vote without fear. Though no concrete incident of violence in reference to coming election has been pointed out till now but the appellants have raised an important issue for taking up adequate measures so that voters come out fearlessly to vote because, on account of the past incidents of post-poll violence after general elections, they have fear in their mind.” The BJP’s lawyers also cited the Supreme Court order which asked the Tripura government to deploy CAPF during the recent civic body elections. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) had moved the apex court in the run-up to these elections saying its candidates were facing threats. Referring to this, the division bench said that the apex court order was passed under different circumstances and it directed the DGP and IGP (law and order, Tripura) to hold a meeting with the state election commission for assessing the requirement of CAPF. “Hence, a decision in this regard is required to be taken by the concerned state authorities and the state election commission, keeping in view the ground situation,” the bench said. Ratnanko Banerjee, a senior lawyer representing the SEC, told the court that the poll watchdog has been monitoring the situation in Kolkata and has held several meetings with the administration and the city police to ensure free and fair elections. When the SEC told the division bench that 22,621 police personnel will be deployed, the chief justice asked, “Have you fixed responsibility on any officer to ensure that these police forces will be present?” The SEC told the court that the commissioner of Kolkata Police and the director general of the state police will be responsible for the arrangements and security cameras have been installed in all polling booths following an order the court earlier passed. Appearing for the state government, advocate general S N Mookherjee said adequate security arrangements have been made for the four BJP candidates on whose complaints the petition is based. He also said no incident of violence has been recorded in Kolkata so far. Addressing a rally before the campaign came to an end at 5 pm, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee took a swipe at the BJP for filing the petition. “Did deployment of CAPF during the assembly polls make any difference? We swept the elections. Let them bring the CAPF on Sunday. We will win all seats in Kokata. I have information that other parties may create trouble in a few civic wards. We will be vigilant. The troublemakers will be handed over to the police. If I find even one TMC worker intimidating voters he will be expelled,” Banerjee said at a rally in Kalighat. Addressing a BJP rally, leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, said, “If there is trouble in even one polling booth in Kolkata, our workers in the districts will hit the streets and start a movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-high-court-rejects-bjp-s-plea-for-central-forces-during-kolkata-civic-polls-101639764720157.html

17-12-2021||India||Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte joins BJP, says has buried animosity with Sawant||Independent legislator Rohan Khaunte on Friday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party amid much fanfare promising to take forward his vision for Goa but this time round by aligning with a political party. Khaunte, a two-time independent legislator, had pledged support to the Manohar Parrikar led BJP government that was formed after the 2017 assembly polls and was made a minister. However, he was dropped soon after Pramod Sawant took charge. As a consequence, Khaunte turned into one of the most vocal and often acerbic critic of the Sawant-led government personally targeting the chief minister and taunting him with nicknames like ‘Pappu’ or even accusing his government of being a “Sawantwadi Sarkar” a dig at Sawant’s ancestral roots in a town in Maharashtra. “There are differences but these are differences about the issues afflicting the state and about how to take the state forward. It is never about personal enmity?” Khaunte told the gathering who had come to witness his induction. Khaunte’s induction has caused dissension within the BJP as the local unit of the party has vowed to work against him while questioning the party’s decision to induct someone who has been deeply against the BJP.“You should ask me about what I am going to do and not what I have done,” was Khaunte’s retort when pressed to explain his sudden change of heart and decision of joining the BJP. The BJP, on the other hand has also lost an MLA to the AAP with Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha resigning as an MLA before joining the AAP in the presence of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi. “Recent happenings in the state had forced me to take a stand that was in opposition to the government,” Saldanha said explaining how she was opposed to the contentious three linear projects, particularly the railway track doubling that she said would come at the cost of the residents in her constituency. “I felt it was my duty to stand by the people. I will do that till my last breath. I was feeling suffocated. The party also felt that I was an obstruction to their goal which was anti-people,” Saldanha said. A total of five MLAs have resigned in recent weeks with three having joined the BJP, Saldanha joining the AAP and Faleiro joining the Trinamool Congress. A sixth -- Churchill Alemao of the NCP has joined the TMC without resigning as an MLA. The Congress has meanwhile said it has shut its doors to those who had ditched the party and joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independent-mla-rohan-khaunte-joins-bjp-says-has-buried-animosity-with-sawant-101639762319278.html

In a series of tweets, Owaisi said that the decision to increase the age of marriage for women to 21 is “typical paternalism that we have come to expect” from the central government. He opined that both men and women should be allowed to get legally married at 18, the age at which they can choose lawmakers and are treated as adults by law for all other purposes.“They can consent to sexual relationships and live-in partnerships but cannot choose their life partners? Just ridiculous,” Owaisi tweeted.The Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad argued that education and economic prospects impact the age of marriage than the legality around it. Highlighting the high number of child marriages but negligible criminal cases against it, Owaisi said social reform and government initiatives in education and human development are critical to preventing child marriages.“If Modi was sincere, he would have focused on increasing economic opportunities for women. Yet India is the only country where women’s participation in workforce is dwindling,” he wrote on Twitter. Referring to a government report on India’s female labour participation, he noted, “It fell to 16% in 2020 from 26% in 2005.”Govt may table bill to raise women’s marriage age to 21Owaisi stressed the need to improve the educational outcomes of women to ensure autonomous decision-making. It’s essential to improve their educational outcomes to ensure autonomous decision-making. What has the govt done to improve education for girls? 79% of ₹446.72 Beti Bachao Beti Padhao budget was spent on adverts. You want us to believe that this govt has sincere intentions? 7/nHe said the marriage age in many US states is as low as 14 and in the UK and Canada it is 16, adding that these nations improved the human development of young people so that they can make “informed decisions rather than fixing arbitrary age restrictions.”“In contrast, Modi govt acts like a Mohalla Uncle. Deciding what we eat, who/when we marry, what God we worship, etc,” Owaisi wrote.“It’s time to stop thinking of young people as children in perpetuity. They should be allowed the space to think & decide for themselves,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-modi-was-sincere-owaisi-slams-centre-for-acting-like-mohalla-uncle-over-legal-age-for-marriage-101639759845010.html
17-12-2021||India||Why legal experts are concerned about the Biological Diversity Amendment Bill 2021||NEW DELHI: The Biological Diversity Amendment Bill 2021, introduced in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, exempts Ayush practitioners from the ambit of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and facilitates access to biological resources and traditional knowledge by the Indian traditional medicine sector. Legal experts have, however, expressed concerns that easing the norms for the sector could be detrimental to ecology and go against the principle of sharing commercial benefits with indigenous communities.Here is a 6-point FAQ on the proposed legislation.What is the Biological Diversity Amendment Bill 2021?The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 was enacted for the conservation of biological diversity and fair, equitable sharing of the monetary benefits from the commercial use of biological resources and traditional knowledge. Now, according to the statement of objectives of Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, it seeks to reduce the pressure on wild medicinal plants by encouraging the cultivation of medicinal plants; exempts Ayush practitioners from intimating biodiversity boards for accessing biological resources or knowledge; facilitates fast-tracking of research, simplify the patent application process, decriminalises certain offences; bring more foreign investments in biological resources, research, patent and commercial utilisation, without compromising the national interest.Why is the Biodiversity Act 2002 being amended?According to the bill, concerns were raised by Ayush medicine, seed, industry and research sectors urging the government to simplify, streamline and reduce the compliance burden to provide for a conducive environment for collaborative research and investments. They also sought to simplify the patent application process, widen the scope of access and benefit-sharing with local communities. In most cases, this is a certain percentage of the sale price.Ayush companies have been seeking relaxation of the benefit-sharing provisions. A case in point is the case relating to Divya Pharmacy founded by Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna in Uttarakhand. The Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board (UBB) sent a notice to Divya Pharmacy in 2016 stating that the company was in violation of the Biodiversity Act for using biological resources from the state for its ayurvedic formulations, without intimating the board and that it was liable to pay an access and benefit-sharing fee. Challenging the board’s notice, the company filed a writ petition before the Uttarakhand high court in December 2016 challenging the powers of the biodiversity board to determine benefit-sharing by Indian companies. The court in 2018 upheld the powers of the biodiversity board in its judgement.Why are legal experts criticising the bill?The Biological Diversity Amendment Bill 2021 has been introduced without seeking public comments as required under the pre-legislative consultative policy. “The bill has been only introduced. The environment ministry will also publish the bill for public comments and a month’s time will be given to respond,” a senior official of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said.What are the changes proposed to be introduced by the Biological Diversity Amendment Bill 2021?The bill focuses on regulating who can access biological resources and knowledge and how access will be monitored. Ayush practitioners have been exempted from the ambit of the Act, a huge move because the Ayush industry benefits greatly from biological resources in India. The role of state biodiversity boards has been strengthened and better clarified in the bill. There are also significant changes proposed in the offences section, according to Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research. Violations of the law related to access to biological resources and benefit-sharing with communities, which are currently treated as criminal offences and are non-bailable, have been proposed to be made civil offences.“This bill would have been an important opportunity to reconcile the domestic law with free prior informed consent requirements of the 2010 Nayogya Protocol on ABS. However, this has been a missed opportunity as the proposed amendments continue to marginalise biodiversity management committees (BMCs). Their powers have not been enhanced, and the proposed amendments also allow for state biodiversity boards to represent BMCs to determine terms of benefit sharing,” said Kohli.Under the Biodiversity Act 2002, national and state biodiversity boards are required to consult the biodiversity management committees (constituted by every local body) while taking any decision relating to the use of biological resources.What are the other concerns with the bill?One of the major changes in the new bill is that registered Ayush practitioners who have been practising indigenous medicine can access any biological resource and its associated knowledge for commercial utilisation, without giving prior intimation to the state biodiversity board. “The amendment seems to be done with the sole intention of providing benefit to the Ayush industry. The main focus of the bill is to facilitate trade in biodiversity as opposed to conservation, protection of biodiversity and knowledge of the local communities. The amendments are completely contrary to the aim and objective of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002,” argued Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer.Dutta also underlined that the bill has excluded the term “bio-utilisation.” “Bio-utilization is an important element in the Act. Leaving out bio utilization would leave out an array of activities like characterization, inventorisation and bioassay which are undertaken with commercial motive,” added Dutta.The bill also exempts cultivated medicinal plants from the purview of the Act but it is practically impossible to detect which plants are cultivated and which are from the wild. This provision could allow large companies to evade the requirement for prior approval or share the benefit with local communities under the access and benefit-sharing provisions of the Act.What is access and benefit-sharing?Under the Convention of Biological Diversity, and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing to which India is a party, it is mandated that benefits derived from the use of biological resources are shared in a fair and equitable manner among the indigenous and local communities. When an Indian or foreign company or individual accesses biological resources such as medicinal plants and associated knowledge, it has to take prior consent from the national biodiversity board. The board can impose a benefit-sharing fee or royalty or impose conditions so that the company shares the monetary benefit from commercial utilisation of these resources with local people who are conserving biodiversity in the region.The December 2018 judgement of Uttarakhand high court in the Divya Pharmacy matter clarifies that the board has a core function of regulation, which also includes asking for benefit sharing and determining the terms and conditions to be imposed on the user/accessor against access said legal researchers, Kanchi Kohli and Shalini Bhutani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-legal-experts-are-concerned-about-the-biological-diversity-amendment-bill-2021-101639759979049.html

The headless bodies were found by a river and after initial investigation; Sindhu was arrested and later tried in a fast-track court which sentenced him to life in August 2005 after the prosecution told the court that Sindhu, a Santhali tribal had confessed to his crime before gramrakhis.The same year, Sindhu, appealed against the order of the fast track court before the Orissa High Court. In April this year, the High Court ordered retrial of the case. As the fast track court had been abolished, the case was heard by the sessions judge of Mayurbhanj. Considering the sensitivity of the case, the HC appointed amicus curiae to probe the case.The amicus curiae handed over the investigation reports to the District and Sessions Court. The investigation showed that there was not enough evidence against Sindhu.Sindhu, who did not even get bail after his arrest in 2003, said he is feeling happy. “I have spent more than 18 years in jail. I want to be with my family,” said the tribal man, who has a son and a daughter.Advocate for Sindhu, Asit Otta said the officials investigating the case should be held responsible for the wrongful incarceration of the tribal. “The officials failed to investigate the case fairly and without studying the case they filed the investigation report. The prosecution failed to produce any circumstantial evidence,” Otta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-court-frees-tribal-who-spent-18-years-in-jail-says-extra-judicial-confession-doesn-t-count-101639759198970.html

17-12-2021||India||India prudent on new FTAs, old pacts hollowed out supply chains: Jaishankar||India is very prudent about new free trade agreements (FTAs) because such pacts signed over the past 25 years affected domestic supply chains and had not provided adequate benefits to Indian businesses, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. Economic diplomacy is a major part of the activities of Indian missions abroad, and 300 lines of credit with a total value of more than $30 billion extended to about 70 countries have enhanced India’s image and opened up new opportunities for domestic businesses, he said during a conversation at the annual convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). “When it comes to new FTAs, we are very prudent...we need a lot of analysis of the person with whom you are getting into a relationship. It’s not like everybody is the same,” Jaishankar said, adding he works closely with commerce minister Piyush Goyal and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on such issues. India’s priorities for FTAs reflect strategic convergences and domestic business comforts. “I would hope very much that in a few years from now, we will end up with a better set of FTAs,” he said. Jaishankar said India has had “a very tough experience” with FTAs over the past 25 years because it was largely dealing with “non-market actors”. He added, “As a result, we have seen in many cases our domestic supply chains very badly affected. In some sectors, they’ve got completely hollowed out.” Some economies with which India finalised FTAs were very protective of their supply chains and MSMEs, and even competitive Indian products were not selling because of non-tariff barriers. “We’ve got to get real about this...I have some discomfort with the old mantras of globalisation,” he said. “If after 25 years of mounting evidence, if you’re not listening then we are in trouble,” he said. The government listens to the problems of domestic businesses and this led to the push for reviewing FTAs with many partners. Indian embassies have placed trade and business at the forefront, and regularly take up policy and regulatory issues with host governments and speak up for India’s economic interests abroad, Jaishankar said. The 300-odd lines of credit worth more than $30 billion were extended for some 600 projects in 70 countries, and they helped promote projects and Indian products. At the same time, India has provided 80 grants worth around $5 billion to some 12 countries. These are great platforms for Indian companies to promote their products and abilities and such partnerships create jobs and enhance the strength of the country, he said. India also couldn’t have ramped up the production of Covid-19 vaccines without economic diplomacy, which helped open supply chains for ingredients from the US, Jaishankar said. However, he pointed out that the post-pandemic world would be difficult and tougher, and India will need to “look at supply chains in a very different way”. Talking about the situation in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said it had been clear since the second term of US president Barack Obama that American forces would be withdrawn from the war-torn country. “At one level, it’s not a surprise but I would say a lot of the concerns came from how those negotiations [with the Taliban] took place in Doha and how it then unfolded on the ground,” he said. “As a proximate neighbour we are very concerned. After all there is some history there,” he said, adding the world community has reached a basic consensus on helping on humanitarian issues while calling for a more inclusive government and counter-terrorism measures. Jaishankar said the standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control was “largely because they are not following agreements” and acting like a party that has “violated a contract”.

It said no works were taken up for RLIS at the project site after they were stopped in the first week of July, following a stay order from the NGT pending the hearing.

In a blog post for NDTV, Nidhi Razdan talked about her Harvard “nightmare” which left her “angry, shocked, disappointed and embarrassed” as she came to know about the truth behind the job offer from the Ivy League university. Razdan said many victims of cybercrime contacted her to share their stories and talk about the fear of being mocked.“I want them to know there is nothing to be ashamed of when you are the victim of a crime. Those who think they are infallible - I wish them luck. Don't kick a person when they are down. It's not easy to admit you are human,” she wrote.According to the NYT report, the first known target was also a woman journalist, Rohini Singh, who received a message on Twitter from a user identifying himself as Tauseef Ahmed. Another woman journalist was targeted soon after but she broke off contact after she got suspicious about the scammer’s UAE phone number, the Times said.A spokeswoman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was also contacted by the scammers but she checked directly with one of the administrators at Harvard after they pushed her for passport details and other personal information, the Times reported. The report claimed that Harvard did nothing to act on information received from the BJP spokesperson, who shared troves of emails, screenshots of fake Harvard documents with the university.Online scammers target 'prominent' Indian women journalists with promises of jobs at Harvard: ReportThe scammers, now well practised and aware of the loopholes in their plan, took "bolder steps to impersonate Harvard, buying a website in their name and setting up a server that allowed them to send messages stamped with Harvard's name."Nidhi Razdan said that “no one at Harvard reacted when I publicly announced I was leaving NDTV for the University.”“I had even tagged them in my tweets where I said I was joining Harvard to teach journalism,” she wrote.The NYT investigation not only revealed the scope and sophistication of cybercrime but also raised questions about Harvard’s lack of action to prevent such scams when one of the victims explicitly warned the university about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-to-be-ashamed-of-nidhi-razdan-on-her-harvard-nightmare-of-fake-job-offer-101639749236624.html

The Samajwadi Party is a progressive party and has launched schemes for the progress of girls and women,” he told news agency ANI when asked about the MPs’ remarks.Also read | 'India is a poor country...' Samajwadi Party MP says will not support bill to raise minimum marriage age of womenHe was addressing a poll rally at Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh as part of his campaign.The Union government might table a bill in Parliament, during the ongoing Winter Session, to raise the minimum legal age of marriage for women in the country to 21, according to several reports on Thursday.The proposal regarding the move has reportedly been cleared by the Union Cabinet and if implemented, it will raise women’s legal marriage age to 21, from the current 18, at par with that of men’s.Earlier in the day, SP’s Lok Sabha member Shafiqur Rahman Burq opposed the bill and said many people would want to marry off their daughters at an “early age.”“India is a poor country and everybody wants to marry off their daughter at an early age... I will not support this Bill in Parliament,” Barq was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Another party leader ST Hasan asked if girls could vote at the age of 18 why could they not marry at the same age.“Girls should be married when they attain the age of fertility. There is nothing wrong if a mature girl is married at 16. If she can vote at the age of 18, why can't she marry?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-to-do-with-it-akhilesh-yadav-over-mps-remarks-on-proposal-to-raise-women-s-legal-marriage-age-101639748410510.html
17-12-2021||India||SC asks states to clear Covid-19 ex-gratia claims in a week, sends notice to Delhi, 2 others||The Supreme Court on Friday put a one-week deadline for states and union territories to clear the backlog of claims for providing ex-gratia compensation for deaths due to Covid-19 and sought information from the Delhi government and states of Chhattisgarh and Karnataka on the progress achieved with regard to receiving applications and releasing payment under the same scheme.The Court, while monitoring the implementation of its order passed on June 30 and October 4 directing ₹50,000 compensation for Covid-19 deaths, noticed that some states were slack in implementing its orders that required wide publicity about the scheme and payments to be made immediately to the beneficiary families of the deceased. However, with regard to Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, the information was not available as no notice was issued in this regard.A bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said, “We issue notice to the chief secretaries of Karnataka, NCT of Delhi, and Chhattisgarh, directing them to file status reports on deaths registered, applications/claims received and claims sanctioned or paid.”Going through a chart prepared by additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, the Court found that in states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, West Bengal, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu, there existed a huge gap between the total deaths/claims received and actual payment released. From some states such as Rajasthan, no information was forthcoming on the total claims received.This chart also indicated that in Delhi, out of 26,128 claims received, payment was disbursed for 21,179 while the corresponding figures for Karnataka were 7,277 claims settled against 38,220 deaths and for Chhattisgarh 11,329 settled claims out of 17,567 applications received.In Maharashtra, out of 141,025 Covid deaths – the highest reported by any state, only about 8,000 claims were processed out of the 109,000 applications received. “Despite strong observations made earlier, only in 8,000 cases, payments have been made,” the bench said. Directing the state to process the remaining claims within a week, the bench observed, “We don’t understand the problem that always we have to fire at you. Tell your officers, this can’t become a daily affair.”Kerala, with an official tally of 40,855 Covid deaths had managed to release payments only to 548 persons out of the 10,778 applications received so far. “It is a sorry state of affairs,” the bench remarked, adding, “As a welfare state, it is the duty of the state to pay compensation/ex-gratia to persons who have already suffered.” Within a week, the state was directed to process remaining claims by giving wide publicity through newspaper advertisements issued in local and vernacular newspapers on the same model as issued by Gujarat government giving particulars about the portal for making applications, form to be filled, and grievance redressal committee to approach for any complaints.The Court noted similar gaps in Tamil Nadu (17,448 persons paid out of 31,850 claims), Punjab (2840 persons paid out of 16,234 deaths), and West Bengal (3355 claims settled out of 19,630 deaths). “It seems everybody has woken up after our orders,” the bench observed, putting all states and union territories to a one-week deadline to clear remaining claims.The only state to be singled out for not reporting progress on compensation claims was Rajasthan with the state recording a total of 8,955 deaths. “Who will believe that in a state such as Rajasthan, only 8,965 persons have died due to Covid,” the bench observed, adding, “It seems state is suppressing something.” When the Court wanted to know the total applications received, senior advocate Manish Singhvi appearing for Rajasthan denied having the said information.The bench posted the matter on January 17 and asked all states and union territories to file status reports of compliance by January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-states-to-clear-covid-19-ex-gratia-claims-in-a-week-sends-notice-to-delhi-2-others-101639748037334.html

Often though, the measure of the importance the party is attaching to the new entrant is the stature of the people conducting the induction. By those, or any standards, on December 3, 28-year-old Sidhu Moosewala had laid in front of him the proverbial red carpet. To his left was Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, to his right was the Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu. Both sang paeans for the ‘youth icon’ that would invigorate the Congress, with Channi even calling it a “revolutionary day in the state’s politics.” Later that day, Moosewala would travel to Delhi, Channi, Sidhu and state in charge Harish Choudhary, Rahul Gandhi. Clearly, the Congress believes, Moosewala is an important inductee in Punjab.

Truecaller, a global platform for verifying contacts and blocking unwanted communication, said in its annual Global Spam Report just one phone number disturbed over 664,000 people every day and 27,000 people every hour with spam calls.“Truecaller actively maintains a list of top spammers in each region in order to automatically block them, but this one spammer is so far ahead of the rest that they will find it very hard to catch up,” the report said, wondering how Indian telecom operators even allowed this kind of call volume.The company noted that the vast majority of all the spam calls in the country were of sales and telemarketing. The report suggests that KYC (know your customer) scam remained one of the most common scams where fraudsters pretend to be working for a bank or digital payment service and ask for user KYC documents as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).Citing multiple users reports to Truecaller, the company said scammers continued to operate in a typical way by targeting unsuspecting victims under some pretext of One-Time Passwords (OTPs), online sales, lotteries and make them download a remote access app that captures sensitive information, leading to a huge loss of money from banks, cards and digital mobile wallets.According to the report, every user on average received about 17 spam calls per month while spam volumes received by Truecaller users were in excess of 3.8 billion calls in the month of October alone.With Truecaller users receiving 32.9 spam calls per month, Brazil remained the most spammed country in the world, followed by Peru.“In a time when the ongoing pandemic continues to impact people as well as countries and is now going into a new round of lockdowns, this year’s report has shown that not only has the pandemic affected communication behavior but also spam, sales and scam patterns around the world," Alan Mamedi, CEO of Truecaller, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-users-received-over-202-million-spam-calls-from-one-phone-number-report-101639744078666.html

According to the police, Jackson Rongphar, 35, the self-styled chairman of Karbi Democratic Liberation Front (KDLF) was killed at a place under Rongmongway police station around 9:00 am. “Rongphar was earlier a member of Karbi Peoples’ Liberation Tiger (KPLT) and had formed KDLF recently. They were engaged in extortions and had kidnapped the manager of a construction site a few days back,” Pushpraj Singh, Karbi Anglong police superintendent said. According to the police, the manager was rescued a few days back and a KDLF cadre involved in the abduction was arrested. “On Friday morning we got information about Rongphar’s hideout and sent a team to nab him. But he and his associates started firing at us and the police team also retaliated,” Singh said. “While some others managed to escape, Rongphar was later found injured at the site. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. We have recovered a pistol and some ammunition from his possession,” he added.

The decision on seat-sharing will be taken on the seat to seat basis, with winnability being the priority. We are 101% sure of winning this election,” Amarinder Singh said. Punjab is scheduled to go to the polls next year and what makes the election more interesting is the political development in the state in the last six months. Amarinder Singh was asked to resign from the chief minister's post by the Congress high command as Congress MLAs rebelled against him. Following the 'insult', Singh quit the Congress and floated Punjab Lok Congress. The room for forging an alliance with the BJP was always open with the farm laws being the only roadblock as Amarinder Singh opposed the three farm laws since the beginning. With the Centre repealing those laws just ahead of the Punjab election, the road for an alliance with the BJP became clear from Singh.In the alliance, BJP will be the senior partner and is likely to contest in more seats than Punjab Lok Congress. Apart from BJP-Punjab Lok Congress, the AAP factor will also be crucial in the upcoming election as Arvind Kejriwal's party is campaigning in the state with all guns blazing.Congress is likely to opt for Navjot Sidhu, the chief of the party's Punjab unit, as the CM face, instead of present chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-s-party-to-fight-punjab-election-in-alliance-with-bjp-101639741660861.html

17-12-2021||India||Kerala Muslim bodies resent decision to hike marriageable age of women||Many Muslim organisations in Kerala have criticized the Centre’s move to hike the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. Muslim League leader E T Mohammad Basheer on Friday introduced an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha saying the decision was against Muslim personal law and it was another step towards introducing a uniform civil code in the country. “We will oppose this. The government is trying to implement the Sangh Parivar’s favourite agenda of uniform civil code. The Muslim Personal Law Board clearly defines marriage, divorce and right to property. These issues relate to our faith,” said Basheer adding he will talk to other political parties to form a consensus on the issue. The Congress is yet to make its stance clear on the matter. The Union government is planning to bring a bill to increase the minimum legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21, people familiar with developments said, underlining a far-reaching decision that will require modification in faith-based personal laws dealing with marriage and inheritance.The Union Cabinet cleared the proposal in its meeting on Wednesday and the government plans to bring the bill — which will bring the minimum age of marriage for women at par with that of men — in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, said the people quoted above.The Samastha Kerala Jamait-ul-Ulema, an organisation of Sunni scholars, and many other religious bodies also opposed the move. The women’s wing of the League also opposed the decision saying delaying the age of marriage will give way to “live-in relationships and illegitimate relations”. “The necessity for increasing the age from 18 to 21 is not known. No medical study indicates any psychological or physiological problems if girls are married at 18. The stipulation that girls should wait till 21 to marry is an affront to individual freedom and religious belief,” said T K Ashraf, leader of the Salafi group Wisdom Islamic Organisation.Muslim organisations got support from an unexpected quarter, the CPI (M) women’s wing-- the All India Democratic Women’s Association. “We oppose the decision strongly. This will do more harm to women than helping them. Instead of bridging the gender gap and empowering women the government is coming out with a new legislation laced with communal outlook,” it said in a statement. But, the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council (KCBC) however, has welcomed the move. The apex body of Christians, KCBC, lauded the decision to bring uniformity in the marriageable age of men and women. “We feel education remains a key factor and by 21 women will get an opportunity to complete their graduation. This will pave the way for a mature relationship and healthy family. Therefore, we view the decision positively,” said KCBC family commission secretary Father Paul Simenthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-muslim-bodies-resent-decision-to-hike-marriageable-age-of-women-101639740956740.html

India’s longstanding defence relationship with Russia extends to counterterrorism issues, the US State Department report added.The US report, meanwhile, pointed towards the “gaps” in the interagency intelligence and information sharing.It said that the “Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats, although gaps remain in interagency intelligence and information sharing”.“The Indian Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) collaborates with the US on exchanging terrorist screening information. In the absence of a National Counter Terrorism Center, the MAC conducts real-time collation and sharing of intelligence among federal and state security agencies.“Several Indian states have established state-level MACs to disseminate terrorism information to law enforcement,” the report said.It also said that Indian security forces demonstrate limited capacity to patrol and secure extensive maritime and land borders.“India is implementing UNSCR 2396 to improve detection and deterrence of terrorist travel by using watchlists, implementing biographic and biometric screening at ports of entry, and expanding information sharing,” it said.The United Nations Security Council Resolution 2396 (2017) requires Member States to develop and implement systems to collect biometric data in order to identify terrorists responsibly and properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/66-known-indian-origin-fighters-affiliated-with-isis-us-state-department-101639735850797.html

Naidu said that ministers will have to take permission from the Chair before skipping parliamentary proceedings. Those missing from Friday’s proceedings included minister of state for railways Danve Raosaheb Dadarao, minister of state for food and consumer affairs Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare Shobha Karandlaje. Minister of state for parliamentary affairs V Muraleedharan tabled the papers on behalf of the three ministers in the Upper House of the Parliament.Naidu said, “The ministers who were supposed to lay papers on the table of the House, having given notice to the Chair, should not be absent. Next time, in extreme circumstances, if they have any problem, they must approach the Chair in advance and seek permission.”Asking the leader of the House Piyush Goyal and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi to take note of the ministers’ absence, Naidu said it won’t be allowed again. “Some of them are doing it, while others think it is casual. It cannot be casual, it cannot be usual. I’ll not allow such things in the future. The leader of the House and the parliamentary affairs minister are here. I hope they take notice. I’m not objecting to others laying [the papers] on their behalf with prior notice and permission. This has to be kept in mind.”Opposition leaders slammed the government over ministers missing from parliamentary proceedings. After Naidu’s statement, CPI(M) lawmaker John Brittas said “they (ministers) have no respect for the Parliament”, to which Naidu replied, “This applies to all the people who do not respect the Parliament and the Chair.”Speaking to HT, Brittas said, “The ministers are taking cues from the Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] and the home minister [Amit Shah]. The PM has spent very little time in Parliament. During the last monsoon session, he must have attended the Parliament for an hour. Earlier, there were times when the PM used to sit through the debates.”He pointed out that recently the Rajya Sabha had to be adjourned for 15 minutes because Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya was not around. “It was not an impromptu discussion. It was a short notice discussion on Omicron, but the minister was absent. The deputy chairman had to adjourn the House for 15 minutes for the minister to come to the Parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-fumes-as-ministers-skip-parliamentary-proceedings-101639736214133.html

He is not allowed to speak to anyone which makes him feel as if he can't breathe, the conman said. Sukesh Chandrashekhar is a high-profile billionaire conman who duped people by impersonating government officials. Even when he was inside Rohini Jail, he operated his extortion racket by paying jail officials crores of rupees. Those jail officials have been taken to task and the Enforcement Directorate has filed chargesheet against Sukesh. But details of his crime, as they emerge, never failed to surprise.Here are 10 things to know about Sukesh Chandrashekhar1. Bengaluru-based Sukesh's entry into the crime world took place at a young age. From Bengaluru, he expanded his extortion racket to Chennai and then to other cities.2. Sukesh posed as an influential personality who has political sources. In fact, when he started dating his wife Leena who is also an accused in the extortion case, Sukesh told her he was a son of a big politician.How did conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar befriend actor Jacqueline Fernandez? Using Jayalalithaa, home ministry's name3. Sukesh Chandrashekhar is well-versed with technicalities and uses virtual numbers. According to reports, he has a spoofing app from which he used to make calls impersonating government officials. He even spoofed the landline number of Union law secretary so that if crosschecked, the caller actually comes across as genuine.4. Sukesh also knows how to evade phone tracking, the ED chargesheet said.5. When he was in Rohini jail, an entire barrack was vacated for him where he used his two phones freely. He also covered the CCTV cameras. From there, he called Aditi Singh, wife of one of the ex-promoters of Ranbaxy. He met Aditi in the jail itself when she came to visit her husband.6. The calls used to be made from virtual numbers and he used to end his telephonic conversation saying 'Jai Hind' to impress that he was a government official. He also spoke to Jacqueline Fernandez from the jail.7. When he came out on bail early this year, he reportedly booked a chartered flight to Chennai and booked a flight for Jacqueline and the duo reportedly met in Chennai. Jacqueline told ED Sukesh hid his identity from Jacqueline and told her that he is the owner of Sun TV and that he belongs to the family of Jayalalithaa.8. While Sukesh has been conning people since the age of 17 (now he is around 32), his first high-profile case was AIADMK's two-leaves symbol bribery case. He acted as the middleman for TTV Dinakaran and took money to bribe an EC official to obtain the two-leaves symbol for then Sasikala faction.9. In connection with this Dinakaran case, Sukesh has been in jail since 2017, but that has not disrupted the functioning of his extortion network. When he started out, he was caught and jailed in 2007 in Bengaluru but he did not stop. Instead, he expanded his network.10. Sukesh had over a dozen luxury cars that have now been seized by the ED. The agency also found ₹82.5 lakh in cash when it raided Sukesh's properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conman-who-used-to-end-calls-saying-jai-hind-10-things-to-know-about-sukesh-chandrashekhar-101639733118792.html

He has expressed regret,” Kageri said.He said that Kumar has expressed regret and women have always been kept with high respect and regard in the House.“Therefore the incident that took place here need not be escalated as a controversial incidentIt has ended here. So please nobody try to escalate it anywhere is what I ask,” Kageri said, swiftly moving on to move to the assembly’s listed business despite protests by some legislators, including Anjali Nimbalkar of the Congress.Before his statement in the assembly, Kumar posted an apology on Twitter, where his remarks triggered massive outrage; some of them from party colleagues such as Anjali Nimbalkar and Sowmya Reddy.“I would like to express my sincere apologies to everyone for the indifferent and negligent comment I made in today’s assembly about “Rape!” My intention was not (to) trivialise or make light of the heinous crime, but an off the cuff remark! I will choose my words carefully henceforth!” he said.I would like to express my sincere apologies to everyone for the indifferent and negligent comment I made in today’s assembly about “Rape!” My intention was not trivialise or make light of the heinous crime, but an off the cuff remark! I will choose my words carefully henceforth!Anjali Nimbalkar, who wasn’t allowed to speak on the topic in the assembly, later spotlighted the conduct of other lawmakers and the speaker when Kumar first made the comment. “But did the house apologise. What about the speaker & other members that were present & laughing….Each & every member of the house should apologise,” she said, questioning that the speaker’s advice to legislators “not to drag” the issue.But did the house apologise.What about the speaker & other members that were present & laughing.Don’t drag the issue is that it.Women legislatures were not given a chance to speak at all…Each & every member of the house should apologise. https://t.co/57SIDmAw7sTo be sure, this was not the first time that KR Ramesh Kumar has landed in a controversy over a distasteful comment on rape.He drew another analogy with rape in February 2019, when lawmakers repeatedly mentioned his name during a discussion on an audio clip released by then chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, months before he finally had to make way for the Bharatiya Janata Party’s BS Yediyurappa.“My situation has become like that of a rape victim. The rape happened just once and had you left it, it would have passed. But when a complaint is made and the accused is put in jail, his lawyers or others like Eshwarappa (then just a legislator and now BJP minister) probe on how it happened, the time and how many times,” Kumar, who was the assembly speaker at the time, said.The legislators present in the house had laughed at the comments then too. The next day Kumar blamed the media for highlighting his comment, saying ‘the media needed to put out such things because they also had a job’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-apologises-for-his-off-the-cuff-rape-analogy-that-triggered-outrage-101639732793496.html

Sampat Paswan was a resident of Rambag locality under Purnia Sadar police station.Officials said a woman, who confessed to the crime, has been arrested. The land broker went missing on Sunday. According to police, the matter involved some land dealing between Paswan and Asha Devi. Devi killed the broker after taking him into confidence and later buried him in her house. Sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) SK Saroj said “The body of the land broker was exhumed from the house of the arrested woman at Sarna chowk under Sadar police station on Thursday in presence of an executive magistrate, Janki Devi.”He said, “The arrested woman, 35-year-old Asha Devi, confessed her crime before the police” adding “The crime was committed in the land dealings between the two.” He said, “Police are probing the matter from all angles.”He said Sadar police lodged an FIR on the basis of the written complaint of Sunny Kumar, the son of the deceased. The woman allegedly purchased a plot of land measuring two katthas from Paswan and was getting a house built there. “But the broker was dilly-dallying in transferring the land in her name for about two years which compelled the woman to take the step,” police said. People familiar with the matter said the arrested woman has been involved in the liquor trade and the deceased used to visit her house to consume liquor. “The deal of land with the deceased was done in her friendship with the land broker and when he delayed in getting the land registered he was offered a heavy dose of liquor and later killed,” people cited above said. The husband of the arrested woman, Subodh Singh, is in jail in connection with the liquor trade. Recently, Anil Oraon, an LJP leader who was also a land broker, was killed and a woman was arrested in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/land-broker-goes-missing-body-exhumed-after-5-days-woman-arrested-101639729133620.html

Defence industrial cooperation, including future collaborations and co-production, also figured in the discussions between the two ministers.“I am very happy that the Indian Air Force is satisfied with its Rafales and we are very proud that despite Covid-19, the 36 aircraft will be delivered on time according to the contract. It’s a real achievement,” Parly said, responding to a question on whether France would provide more Rafale combat aircraft to India.Also Read: 6 Rafale fighter jets with India specific enhancement to arrive in Dec-Jan 2022She described the use of Rafale jets by the air forces of both countries as a “real asset and strength” for bilateral cooperation, and said: “I am sure that there is room for new developments. We are ready to answer any additional needs [or] request that could be made by India,” she said.Parly, who is on an official visit to India to enhance strategic and defence ties, further noted that more aircraft will be needed for India’s new aircraft carrier. “We are open and ready to provide any other Rafales if this is India’s decision,” she said.India’s indigenously built aircraft carrier INS Vikrant is expected to become fully operational in 2022.India and France inked a ₹59000-crore deal for 36 Rafale jets in 2016. All the aircraft are being manufactured in France to Indian specifications. Parly attended the event marking the induction of the first batch of Rafales into the IAF in July 2020. France has so far delivered 33 of the jets.Parly also outlined France’s commitment to backing the “Make in India” initiative, especially for defence hardware. “France, more than any other country, understands the necessity of the Indian content and we are fully committed to the Make in India initiative as well as to the further integration of Indian manufacturers into our global supply chains,” she said.“Make in India”, she said, has been a “reality for French industry” for several years, particularly for defence equipment such as submarines.Responding to a question about France’s views on China’s assertive activities, Parly said: “It’s a delicate balance that must be found. China is a major country, there are areas where cooperation can be envisaged and developed. You probably remember that China played an important role when the Paris conference about climate change happened six years ago. And China is, of course, a major player to implement this fight against climate change.“China is also a partner for trade and commerce but we see as well that China is getting more and more aggressive in the region, and it is even more specific when it comes to the [South] China Sea.”She contended that France and India share the same views on international maritime law and freedom of navigation. “And most of the goods use these...maritime lanes. So these maritime lanes must remain free. We see that sometimes there are attempts to close this [South] China Sea and we want to make sure that this freedom of navigation is respected,” she said.France regularly deploys its warships in this region to “express our right to navigate freely in these waters”.Parly responded to another question on the potential impact on India-France relations of the AUKUS alliance between Australia, the UK and the US by asserting that France “is an Indo-Pacific country” since it has 1.6 million citizens in the region.AUKUS was created to build nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. This coincided with Australia cancelling a lucrative contract for French-made conventional submarines. The move angered France and affected the country’s ties with all three members of AUKUS.“So, we are an Indian-Indo-Pacific country and we want to develop a very close multilateral relationship with the neighbouring countries. Of course, India is at the centre of this strategy. We have developed a very good relationship with Australia,” Parly said.“Then Australia made its own decision. I will not comment on it. It is of course very disappointing for us but (it would) continue being a major partner...,” she added.The situation in Afghanistan, India’s concerns about cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, the standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), joint exercises, maritime security and new projects figured in the third annual defence dialogue between Parly and Singh, officials familiar with the discussions said.Received French Minister for Armed Forces @florence_parly today and discussed bilateral defence cooperation, regional security, Indo-Pacific and France’s forthcoming Presidency of the EU Council.I reiterated India's commitment to further deepening our Strategic Partnership. pic.twitter.com/GbmLSKcHkkNEW DELHI: France stands ready to meet any requirement for more Rafale combat jets from India even as it works to bolster the Make in India initiative by integrating Indian manufacturers into global supply chains, French defence minister Florence Parly said on Friday.Parly noted that China’s behaviour in the region is becoming “more and more aggressive”, and France seeks to find a “delicate balance” between addressing such behaviour and cooperating with China on issues such as climate change and trade.She made the remarks during a virtual conversation organised by Ananta Centre on India-France cooperation to defend a rules-based Indo-Pacific, before her meeting with defence minister Rajnath Singh.

Yet, a survey of 9,694 parents from across India has revealed that 49% of them want authorities to shut physical classes only if multiple cases of Omicron are recorded in a particular district, while only 27% feel that schools need to shut down immediately.“With many parents realising that Omicron could again shut in-person schools for several months, a high percentage of parents are keen that in-person learning is maximised till it comes to their district”, said Sachin Taparia, Founder, LocalCircles, acommunity social media platform enabling citizens and small businesses to escalate issues for policy enforcement and interventions. “With 5 times more transmissibility of Omicron, lack of outdoor air ventilation in most classes, the risk of spread in schools is real and therefore, school and district authorities must keep a close watch on the state of affairs and take timely decisions,” added Taparia.The survey received 9,694 responses from parents residing across 332 districts of India. 61% of the participants were men while 39% were women. These participants also include 1,557 parents from Maharashtra, who share different opinions. As per data revealed, nearly 63% of respondents in Maharashtra felt that in-person schools should shut down already due to rising cases, including 13% who felt such action should be taken by authorities even if a single case of Omicron is recorded even in nearby districts.“The decision of school reopening was taken without majority consent of parents, and even schools who don’t want to take chances are currently being forced to do so. While we know that the growth of children is best when in school but we cannot have this at the cost of our children’s health and lives,” said Ranjana De, parent and member of a parent association in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/49-of-parents-want-offline-classes-to-shut-if-multiple-omicron-cases-are-reported-in-a-district-survey-101639725414656.html

According to those familiar with the developments, the talks will also cover aspects of counter-terrorism cooperation and wide-ranging Indo-French defence cooperation, including operational defence cooperation, particularly maritime security in the Indo-Pacific.There were several major Indo-France joint exercises this year, accompanied by the successful implementation of defence-related ‘Make in India’ projects, which includes the Rafale deliveries to the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Scorpène-class submarines to the Indian Navy.India received as many as 32 of the Dassault Rafale multirole fighter jets promised by France this year. Noting the timely deliveries, the French defence minister said that the rest of the ten twin-engine aircraft will also be delivered on time despite the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.According to the French embassy, Florence Parly's visit to India highlights France's engagement in the Indo-Pacific and the centrality of India in the French strategy.The French Minister will also detail the recently unveiled EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific that brings a multiplier effect to this comprehensive approach for the region. Upon taking the presidency of the Council of the European Union on January 1, 2022, France will make the Indo-Pacific and India a key priority, the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-provide-additional-rafale-jets-to-india-france-101639720404643.html

Places like Kallara, Vechoor and Aimanam were affected by bird flu,” said Kottayam District Collector PK Jayasree, as quoted by news agency ANI.Bird flu scare was reported first in Alappuzha after many ducks and local birds in the district perished last week, forcing authorities to rush samples to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal. “The government has instructed the district collector to take necessary measures,” informed Animal Husbandry Minister J Cinchu Rani in the state capital Thiruvananthapuram.The district administration had already banned the use and sale of eggs, meat and manure of ducks, chickens, quails and domestic birds in the affected areas. Additionally, the district administration said that rapid response teams will be deployed in areas where the bird flu has been confirmed and preventive medicines will be distributed to the people.In Alappuzha and neighbouring Kottayam, duck rearing is an important business and there is high demand for eggs and meat of the bird, generally priced higher than poultry.

The development came two days after Naidu’s meeting with several Opposition leaders failed to make any progress. Naidu, keen to end the crisis that stalled proceedings in the Upper House of Parliament for the past two weeks, called up a senior Congress leader on Friday morning to discuss how to end the stalemate, said the official who wished not to be named. The telephonic conversation, which lasted a few minutes, is seen as a significant step towards restoring order in the Rajya Sabha with just six days left for the winter session of Parliament to wrap up. The Opposition leader who received Naidu’s call, the official told HT, has sought an all-party meeting to be chaired by Naidu with the aim of resolving the issue. The stalemate has continued with those in government seeking an apology from the suspended MPs, while the while the Opposition has ruled out any such move. Instead, they have been questioning the legality of the suspension. On Wednesday, Naidu’s meeting with Opposition leaders ended abruptly after the discussion took a rough turn. At the meeting, leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress deputy leader Anand Sharma, the party’s chief whip Jairam Ramesh, the Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Manoj Kumar Jha together told Naidu that his predecessors, including Bhairon Singh Sekhawat and Hamid Ansari, used to conduct all-party meetings to resolve issues. An official present at Wednesday’s meeting, who wished not to be named, said, “The [Rajya Sabha] chairman observed that an all-party meeting will be called when it is appropriate. It implied that a meeting would serve no purpose when either the suspended MPs or leaders of their respective parties are not willing to reflect on their conduct and regret the same in an appropriate manner.”

Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the head of state of the country,  pronounced Modi's name for the much-coveted civilian decoration and highlighted the “unconditional friendship” and support that India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, had extended to Bhutan over the years and particularly during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Overjoyed to hear His Majesty pronounce Your Excellency Modiji’s @narendramodi name for the highest civilian decoration, Ngadag Pel gi Khorlo.https://t.co/hD3mihCtSv@PMOIndia@Indiainbhutan pic.twitter.com/HdZm5GozAR“Much deserving! Congratulations from the people of Bhutan,” the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) of the country noted in an official post on Facebook. “In all interactions, seen Your Excellency as a great, spiritual human being. Looking forward to celebrating the honour in person.”According to the ministry of external affairs, mutually beneficial economic inter-linkages between India and Bhutan have been an important element in bilateral relations. India continues to be the largest trade and development partner of Bhutan and has extended its assistance to several developmental projects in the country – such as the 1020 MW Tala Hydroelectric Project, Paro Airport, and the Bhutan Broadcasting Station.In addition, India is also a leading trade partner of Bhutan, with a free trade regime existing between the two countries. Bhutan was, in fact, the first country to receive the Narendra Modi regime's gift of Covid-19 vaccines, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). Earlier this year in January, the country received the first consignment of 1.5 lakh doses of the Covishield vaccine from India as a gift.Later, the Himalayan country also received an additional 400,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from India, thus enabling the nationwide inoculation process against the pandemic. Bhutan's prime minister Lotay Tshering, expressing his gratitude, prayed that these gestures turn into boundless blessings for the people of India.“Pleased to receive additional 400,000 doses of Covishield, making possible the nationwide rollout of our vaccination programme,” Tshering had tweeted, tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The people of Bhutan and I remain grateful.”Last year, Prime Minister Modi had visited Bhutan to diversify partnership with the kingdom from the hydro-power sector and to enhance trade and linkages in space and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhutan-confers-its-highest-civilian-award-on-pm-narendra-modi-101639716774847.html

Know its significance||Union home minister Amit Shah will on Friday address a rally organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ally Nishad Party at 1pm on the Ramabai Ambedkar ground in Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow. The programme, named ‘Sarkar Banao, Adhikar Pao’ (form the government, claim your rights), is expected to bolster the ruling BJP's efforts to secure a scheduled caste (SC) status for the Nishads, who have proved themselves to be a useful electoral asset for the saffron party as was seen during the previous elections.“Home minister Amit Shah will be attending a rally of the Nishad Party on December 17,” the party's president Sanjay Nishad told the ANI news agency. “Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior leaders of the BJP will also join the rally.

The ruling party also expects to team up with several other small and regional parties to contest the upcoming 2022 assembly polls in the state.For its part, the Nishad Party launched a survey in various districts of eastern and central Uttar Pradesh in August to identify the seats on which Nishad party nominees will be in a winnable position in the upcoming polls, which are due early next year. The results of the survey, are said to have been submitted to BJP national president JP Nadda, who will now be finalising the seat-sharing formula for the elections.A total of 18 districts in Uttar Pradesh have a sizeable population of the Nishad community. They are Prayagraj, Firozabad, Ballia, Sant Kabir Nagar, Banda, Ayodhya, Sultanpur, Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Auraiya, Lucknow, Unnao, Meerut, Mirzapur, Sant Ravidas Nagar, Muzaffarnagar, Varanasi, and Jaunpur.The BJP is dominant in about 20 Lok Sabha constituencies and 60 Assembly segments in Uttar Pradesh.

17-12-2021||India||Despite 8% dip in cost, oil prices remain unchanged||State-run fuel retailers have kept basic prices of petrol and diesel unchanged at ₹47.93 per litre and ₹49.33 respectively since November 4 despite over 8% slump in their average crude import cost.According to official data, public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) have neither raised nor reduced petrol and diesel rates in last one-and-a-half months even as international oil prices remained volatile with benchmark Brent crude plunging below $70 a barrel on November 30 from the period’s peak at $84.78 on November 9. State-run fuel retailers have kept basic prices of petrol and diesel unchanged at ₹47.93 per litre and ₹49.33 respectively since November 4 despite over 8% slump in their average crude import cost.According to official data, public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) have neither raised nor reduced petrol and diesel rates in last one-and-a-half months even as international oil prices remained volatile with benchmark Brent crude plunging below $70 a barrel on November 30 from the period’s peak at $84.78 on November 9.|#+|Technically, daily changes in retail prices of petrol and diesel have been paused from November 3, the day the Union government announced its decision to reduce central excise on the two fuels, effective from the next day. The reason is to save people from extreme volatility, two executives working in different oil firms said on condition of anonymity.Even in rupee term, OMCs’ average crude oil import cost (factoring in rupee-dollar exchange rate), which was ₹6,234.94 a barrel on November 10, fell sharply by about 12% to ₹5,490.79 on December 15, but firms kept basic prices of petrol and diesel static unchanged November 4.The oil ministry and three state-run fuel retailers – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – did not respond to an email query on the matter.The government, however, told both houses of the Parliament that oil companies align pump prices of fuel with their respective international benchmarks every day transparently. “Public Sector OMCs have implemented daily revision of retail selling price (RSP) of petrol and diesel in the entire country with effect from June 16, 2017. Daily pricing has been introduced to bring more transparency... to benefit consumers,” minister of state for petroleum Rameshwar Teli told the Lok Sabha on December 9.Four days later Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri, in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question, said prices of petrol and diesel have been market-determined and public sector OMCs take “appropriate decision” on pricing in line with their international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, freight and other costs.“Effective June 16, 2017, daily pricing of petrol and diesel has been implemented,” he said.“Since oil prices have fallen from $84 per barrel in November 2021 to about $72 per barrel now, India’s oil marketing companies should pass on the benefit of reduced oil prices on daily basis in order to give benefit to the consumers as also to facilitate higher economic growth,” SC Sharma, a former officer on special duty at erstwhile Planning Commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-8-dip-in-cost-oil-prices-remain-unchanged-101639695991133.html
17-12-2021||India||Woman who took 32 bullets for nation ignored by govt: Rahul||A political row erupted on Thursday after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the government for allegedly ignoring former prime minister Indira Gandhi’s role in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war, even as the country celebrated the 50th anniversary of victory over Pakistan.“The woman took 32 bullets for this country, but her name is not there even on the invitations,” Gandhi said, referring to the government’s official function in New Delhi to celebrate the 1971 War, which led to the birth of Bangladesh.“This is because the government is afraid of truth. But I don’t care as I know what she (Indira Gandhi) has done for this country,” he said while addressing a rally at Dehradun’s Parade Ground to launch the Congress campaign for the 2022 Uttarakhand assembly elections.However, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rejected Gandhi’s allegations, saying the day was not about remembering any politician, but soldiers.BJP Uttarakhand unit vice-president Devendra Bhasin said, “The day is not about politicians but the bravery and sacrifices made by soldiers on the ground, which made victory possible in the 1971 war.” “That is why the BJP is focussing on soldiers and not politicians,” he added.Stressing that India won the war in 1971 in just 13 days as the country was united and fought collectively, Gandhi alleged that now India was being divided and weakened. “Brothers are being made to fight each other. Weak are being killed. The government is operating for just 2 to 3 capitalists,” he claimed.Gandhi also felicitated war veterans and ex-servicemen in recognition of their contribution to the country. Huge cut-outs and banners of India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat — who died recently along with 12 others in a chopper crash in Tamil Nadu’s Coonoor — were put up in the rally.General Rawat hailed from Uttarakhand.However, BJP leader Devendra Bhasin objected to the use of cut-outs, alleging the Congress was misusing General Rawat’s legacy for electoral advantage. “I just want to ask them, who had called Gen Bipin Rawat a goonda; who was dancing in Goa when everyone was mourning his loss; who had stopped one rank, one pension of security forces; who had asked for proof of surgical strikes,” he said.Recalling the martyrdom of his father and grandmother, the former Congress chief said he has relation of sacrifice with the people of Uttarakhand. “Only those who have given their blood, like you, will understand this relation of sacrifice (kurbani ka rishta). Those who haven’t made such sacrifices can’t understand this. Uttarakhand has given maximum blood for this country and it will keep doing so in future also,” he said.Listing unemployment as the biggest problem of Uttarakhand, the Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad in Kerala said, the problem can only be solved when small and middle-level traders, shopkeepers and farmers are strengthened. He alleged that the BJP government has “destroyed these sections by just working for two to three capitalists, who it wants to benefit at the behest of these sections”.
17-12-2021||India||Zydus’s needle-free Covid vaccine may be introduced next week||The Zydus Healthcare’s anti-coronavirus disease vaccine, ZyCoV-D, could be introduced in the national vaccination programme by next week, according to people familiar with the development.“The training of vaccinators who would be administering the shots is nearly complete and the vaccine could be introduced very soon; likely by next week,” said a person aware of the matter on condition of anonymity.ZyCoV-D, which is world’s first DNA-based and needle-free Covid-19 vaccine, has been approved for emergency use in people 12 years of age and above. However, in the absence of any policies in place on vaccinating children, the Union government has decided to first use the vaccine in adults.According to the company, the Centre has placed an order of 10 million vaccine doses, at ₹265 per dose. Additionally, ₹93 will be charged as the cost of the needle-free intradermal applicator, which is required to administer the shot. The supplies are being released in a phased manner, according to people familiar with the matter.ZyCoV-D, which is only the second indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine besides Covaxin, will be initially used in districts of seven states that have low first dose coverage before being rolled out nationwide, one of the people cited above said. The seven states are Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.The Central Drugs Laboratory in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, has cleared for market release close to 250,000 doses of the Zydus vaccine after putting the vials through stringent quality tests.On August 20, the Drugs Controller General of India granted emergency use authorisation to ZyCoV-D but it is yet to be included in the vaccination drive.Once rolled out, ZyCoV-D will become the third vaccine being used in the national vaccination programme, along with Covishield and Covaxin.As on December 16, 87.5% of the eligible population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while 57.1% has been fully vaccinated.
17-12-2021||India||Delhi-Howrah train route affected due to protest on tracks in Uttar Pradesh||Trains on the Delhi-Howrah route were affected after a group of people belonging to the Aheriya community blocked the railway tracks not allowing trains to operate in Uttar Pradesh. According to senior railway officers, 14 trains were stalled due to the agitation that began at 1.30 pm and ended at about 7.40 pm. Bobby, one of the members of the community, however said that his community members had blocked the tracks since 11am on Thursday.“Our community members have been on ‘dharna’ in Lucknow for over a month and our only aim is to meet the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. However, we have not been allowed to do so. Hence we decided to stage a protest by not allowing trains to run on one of the busiest routes of the railways.” According to railway officials around 300 trains operate on the Delhi-Howrah route. “Few of them are not operating due to Covid-19 restrictions,” the officer clarified. A statement from the North Central Railways read, “This is to inform that the Delhi-Howrah route is affected due to ongoing agitation between Hathras and Pora stations. Trains are regulated at different stations. The Civil Administration is trying it’s best to persuade the agitators. Inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.”Pramod Kumar, another member of the community said, “Nearly 5000 of our members have blocked the railway tracks since morning but no government or railway officials have reached the spot to talk to us. Our only aim is to get CM Yogi Adityanath’s appointment so that we can put forth our reservation concerns.” Community members from Western Uttar Pradesh, particularly from Hathras and Aligarh participated in the agitation. The community members who spoke to HT, clarified that they aimed to continue their agitation until the state government of UP assured them of an appointment with the CM. “No trains were cancelled but over a dozen of them were delayed due to the protest. However, the agitation got over at 7.40 pm after which normal movement of trains resumed,” the statement read.“We have decided to stop our agitation temporarily, looking at the issues faced by the passengers on board and also because we have been told that we will be able to meet the CM. However, we have decided to block the tracks on Friday too,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhihowrah-train-route-affected-due-to-protest-on-tracks-in-uttar-pradesh-101639687909190.html
17-12-2021||India||House report on data bill tabled, Opposition flags concern||The report of the joint parliamentary committee studying the proposed data protection law was tabled in both houses of parliament on Thursday, after almost two years of deliberations, but continued to cause concern among civil society members and opposition leaders that the proposals will be inadequate in protecting individual privacy and give the state far-reaching powers.The report carries several suggestions that in effect give the government a wider berth on obligations and private companies a stricter guardrail to follow, as reported by HT on November 23, while also suggesting new mechanisms to regulate social media companies.Among some of the new proposals is a plan to “age-gate” content and access to digital services for children, requiring companies to appoint guardians of data and needing those that deal primarily with services for children to to register themselves with the government.The report will likely be slotted for a discussion, following which the government will re-introduce the bill — the recommendations are not binding.The JPC was set up in 2019 after parliamentarians were divided over several provisions of the personal data protection bill, which was meant to put a legal shape to the Right to Privacy that was made a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in 2017. The law will cover the rights people will have over their data and obligations for those that deal with such data, which will impact the industry at large.Seven of the 30 members in the committee submitted dissent notes, saying the proposals give “unbridled power” to the government while creating a differentiating in the obligations of private and government entities.According to an industry expert who asked not to be named, the recommendation around age-gating will only act as a deterrent. “Children use social media platforms for a lot of different, including to access educational material,” the person said. “This has been a concern that has been highlighted to the committee.”Experts said the committee did not address the significant concerns that arose with the bill that was introduced in 2019.“The committee has not done enough to tighten restrictions on the government. The committee has added “reasonable and necessary” to Clause 35, but it is no safeguard and can be easily circumvented. The committee should have recommended the deletion of this clause in entirety,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, a global tech policy think tank.“The exemptions provided are exemplary as compared to data laws internationally. There seems to also be a degree to which industry lobbying has worked, they have diluted the penalty, which is remarkable since even the Competition Commission of India says a percentage of the global turnover has to be paid. Even the [European Union law] GDPR has such provisions,” he added.Chima also said the panel’s proposal to treat social media companies as publishers and determine their liability “is a first for any data protection law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-report-on-data-bill-tabled-opposition-flags-concern-101639686116946.html
17-12-2021||India||Tributes pour in for brave heroes of 1971||Leaders across political parties and current and former servicemen on Thursday hailed the sacrifices of soldiers in the 1971 war, which liberated Bangladesh, as the country celebrates the golden jubilee celebration of India’s triumph over Pakistan.On the occasion of Vijay Diwas, martyrs of the 1971 war were remembered in a memorial service in Kolkata. Wreaths were laid by war veterans, next of kin of those who fought for the country, Army commanders of the three services and Lt General Manoj Pande, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Command.As buglers sounded the ‘Last Post’ and ‘Rouse’ from the rampart behind the magnificent edifice of the memorial at Fort William, the headquarters of the Army’s Eastern Command, participants observed two-minute silence to pay homage to the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in the war.Former Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshall (retd) Arup Raha, Lt General (retd) JR Mukerji and Lt General (retd) Praveen Bakshi were among the retired officers who paid floral tributes at the Smarak. “On behalf of the grateful nation, saluted the incomparable valour of the brave soldiers by paying floral tributes at ‘Tanot Vijay Stambh’, a symbol of India’s victory in the 1965 and 1971 wars and the amazing valour of our brave soldiers,” Union minister Amit Shah tweeted. Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal saluted the soldiers of the country on the day. “On this day in 1971, the bravery and valour of the Indian Army brought Pakistan to its knees. On Vijay Diwas, I salute all the brave soldiers of the country whose bravery and valour make us proud,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who met Bangladesh assistant high commissioner, Mohammad Jobayed Hosen, in Agartala, said he “salutes all the bravehearts of the Indian armed forces who fought the enemy and liberated a new nation”. Hosen said, “Bangladesh government is keen to identify all the places that are related to Liberation war. The issue has been raised during a meeting with a Tripura minister. It appears that there are more than twenty such places here.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tributes-pour-in-for-brave-heroes-of-1971-101639684744369.html

17-12-2021||India||Vijay Diwas: The battles that won the war||Just around the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the country in paying homage to the heroes of the 1971 India-Pakistan war at the National War Memorial at India Gate, 70-year-old Mukesh Khetarpal stood in front of his brother’s bust and paid tribute with folded hands to one of India’s best known military heroes in a solemn ceremony at a cantonment 500km away in Punjab.The celebration at Mamun in Pathankot to mark the golden jubilee of the 1971 victory over Pakistan and honour Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, one of India’s youngest soldiers to be awarded the hallowed Param Vir Chakra, blended pain and glory, and was a moving throwback to their childhood days for Mukesh, the younger brother.Khetarpal is among the only 21 Indian soldiers decorated with the PVC, India’s highest wartime military honour, for their heroism in independent India’s history. Arun was only 21, and commissioned in Poona Horse only six months before the war began, when he destroyed seven Pakistani Patton tanks in the Battle of Basantar fought exactly 50 years ago on December 16, 1971, making it a glorious and unforgettable chapter in India’s military history.“Arun’s glorious past is what we remember. The loss still hurts but there’s tremendous pride too. It’s humbling to see that even after 50 years, and that’s a long stretch of time, that Arun is still remembered for what he did. He was my parents’ favourite son,” said Mukesh.Pakistan suffered huge losses in the battle fought on the banks of Basantar river in enemy territory -- 50 Patton tanks were decimated and its eight (Independent) Armoured Brigade was wiped out. Arun, commanding a Centurion tank named Fama Gusta JX202, single-handedly inflicted maximum damage on the enemy. “I feel lucky to be alive. The tank is a part of my destiny. But whenever I see the Fama Gusta, I remember Arun saheb, my commander, who fought like a tiger,” Khetarpal’s gunner Nathu Singh told this correspondent in an earlier interview.Khetarpal breathed his last in Singh’s arms.The Black Arrow Brigade, which included Poona Horse, spearheaded the Indian Army’s assault. It won 79 gallantry awards including one PVC, five Maha Vir Chakras and 12 Vir Chakras. The brigade commander, Brigadier AS Vaidya, was decorated with MVC, and rose to become the army chief....the tough get goingThe 1971 war, which ended with the liberation of Bangladesh, gave India a new generation of heroes including Major Hoshiar Singh, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Captain MNR Samant and Lance Naik Albert Ekka, their heroism and accomplishments still inspiring not only the country’s soldiers but millions of Indians who grew up reading their unbelievable stories of courage and sacrifice.Sekhon, then 26 and decorated posthumously with PVC, is the Indian Air Force’s only winner of the top military honour.His moment of wartime glory came on December 14, 1971, when the Srinagar airfield faced a furious attack by at least six Sabre aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force. In the midst of the strafing of the airfield by the enemy aircraft that presented grave danger to his own safety, Sekhon took off in his Gnat, heroically engaged a pair of Sabres, shot them down and forced the PAF package to retreat before his own aircraft was hit and exploded into a fireball.He was commissioned in IAF as a fighter pilot four years before the war.In the eastern sector, the Indian Navy pulled off the unimaginable.The naval component of the Mukti Bahini -- armed, trained and launched by the Indian Navy’s Directorate of Naval Intelligence (DNI), carried out some of India’s largest special forces attacks. They were part of a covert maritime warfare unit called Naval Commando Operations (X) which existed in the run-up to the 1971 war.On the night of August 15, 1971, more than 170 combat swimmers of the naval wing carried out near simultaneous attacks on the ports of Mongla, Narayangunj, Chittagong and Chandpur destroying or disabling 25 vessels --- the largest such attacks since the Second World war.The core of this irregular force comprised eight Bengali sailors who had deserted the Pakistani submarine PNS Mangro in France in March 1971. They were attached to DNI that began to raise a force of limpeteers (naval saboteurs) trained on the battlefield of Plassey in West Bengal’s Nadia district.The eight Pakistani sailors formed the core of what would be called Naval Commando Operations (X). A total of 457 combat swimmers/limpeteers were trained under the operation run by DNI but supervised by the Eastern Army Command.Between August and November 1971, they sank and disabled 100,000 tonnes of shipping in East Pakistan.Major General JFR Jacob, then Chief of Staff, Eastern Army Command, called these the most effective operations of the Mukti Bahini.The role of this tiny unit has never been officially acknowledged by the Indian Navy. It was documented for the first time in the book Operation X written by Captain MNR Samant, MVC, and journalist Sandeep Unnithan.Setting the stageAnother key operation that took place in the eastern sector involved the Indian Army’s elite paratroopers. India last week marked 50 years of the historic battalion-sized Tangail airdrop north of Dhaka during the 1971 war. The critical operation set the stage for surrender by the rival.The Tangail airdrop is the biggest airborne operation ever mounted by Indian paratroopers.The aim of the operation was to capture the Poongli bridge on Jamalpur-Tangail-Dhaka road and the ferry site on Louhajang river to intercept Pakistan army’s 93 Brigade that was retreating from the north to defend Dhaka.Around 750 men of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were involved in the successful mission. The paratroopers defeated a force that was three times numerically superior and shattered the will of the Pakistani army to defend Dhaka.On December 11, Central Army commander Lieutenant General Yogendra Dimri led a mass jump at a premier base in Agra to mark the golden jubilee of the Tangail airdrop. The mass jump involved 120 paratroopers and four veterans who took part in the 1971 war. The army and the air force dedicated the jump at Agra to India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the others killed in the December 8 Mi-17V5 crash near Coonoor.Last month, India quietly marked the 50th anniversary of a key battle in erstwhile East Pakistan -- fought 11 days before India and Pakistan officially went to war in 1971 -- in which the Indian Army completely wiped out a Pakistani tank squadron, IAF shot down three enemy fighter jets, and an estimated 300 Pakistani soldiers were killed or injured.The Battle of Garibpur, which included a fierce confrontation between rival tanks on November 21, 1971, and an air battle a day later, ended with the Indian Army creating an important launch pad for the upcoming offensive into enemy territory and set the stage for the creation of military history 24 days later with the liberation of Bangladesh.Paying tributes to the soldiers who took part in the 1971 war, defence minister Rajnath Singh on December 12 said the “glorious victory” 50 years ago changed the history and geography of South Asia and the country would forever remain indebted to the sacrifices made by its warriors. He said the memories of 1971 were still fresh in the heart of every Indian.

If you (corporations) do not allow encroachments to happen, there will be planned development everywhere.”While the Court said that the primary responsibility to prevent encroachment and protect government land is that of the local authority, it also apportioned the liability equally upon railways (owner of land in question) and the states. Together, the three will have to pay a solatium of ₹2000 per month to each of the households affected by the demolition for the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-major-cities-turning-into-slums-sc-101639683870700.html

They said I do not allow Durga Puja in Bengal. The UNESCO’s recognition has exposed their lies. Their faces have been blackened. I thank the UNESCO. I feel proud that so many of our social welfare projects have attained international recognition. We will elevate Bengal’s image before the world in the coming years,” Banerjee said at a rally in Behala.The attack on the BJP was unleashed on Wednesday evening by the chief minister’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee who also addressed several rallies on Thursday.“Two minutes of silence for @AmitShah and all the tall leaders at @BJP4India who, during their pre-election political tours, HILARIOUSLY CLAIMED that DURGA PUJA IS NOT CELEBRATED IN WEST BENGAL. Your BIGOTRY and HOAX has been BUSTED, you stand EXPOSED YET AGAIN!” Abhishek Banerjee tweeted on Wednesday, targeting the Union home minister who campaigned extensively in March-April.The BJP could win only 77 of the 294 assembly seats against a target of 200.Countering the young TMC leader, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar tweeted: “Keep extra 2 minutes silence for yourself, @abhishekaitc, the proposal was sent by Modi govt. Also, your govt tried to impose ban on Durga Puja & now trying to take credit by spreading lies.”The Bengal BJP also claimed that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who proposed to the UNESCO that Bengal’s Durga Puja should be given a heritage tag.“Thanks to PM Shri @narendramodi Ji for making this possible, it happened because of the proposal by the central government to include Durga Puja in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage,” tweeted the Bengal BJP.As many as 36,946 community Durga pujas are organised in Bengal. Of these, around 2,500 are held in Kolkata. According to a study the British Council of India conducted last year, the economic value of the artistic creations and cultural activities during Durga Puja in West Bengal is more than ₹32,300 crore.Traditional yoga and the Kumbh Mela got the UNESCO’s recognition in 2016 and 2017 respectively. On Wednesday, the Durga Puja was the only Indian festival to make it to the list of 20 events and traditional activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unesco-recognition-for-kolkata-s-durga-puja-triggers-slugfest-between-tmc-bjp-101639683170033.html
17-12-2021||India||Senior Congress leader and former Karnataka speaker makes crass comment on rape in winter session||Senior Congress leader and former Karnataka speaker Ramesh Kumar on Thursday courted controversy as he made a crass comment on rape in the ongoing winter session in Belagavi, about 505 kms from Bengaluru.“There is a saying that if rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it. That’s exactly the situation into which you are,” Kumar said on the floor of the assembly session.The statements come at a time when elected representatives, on more than one occasion and across regions, made insensitive comments on rape and sexual assault which they claim are made in ‘lighter vein’.There were at least 504 instances of rape in Karnataka in 2020, according to data by the National Crime Records Bureau. Kumar made the statement amid a ruckus in the lower house when the Congress MLAs demanded time to speak on the rain-related damages in their constituencies.The speaker, Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, was trying to defuse growing calls for time to speak when he said that since it was getting difficult to control the house it was better to enjoy it, making a brief reference to Kumar on his predicament. That’s when Kumar made the distasteful remarks.Kumar had made similar comments during his term as speaker between 2018-19.“My situation has become like that of a rape victim. The rape happened just once and had you left it, it would have passed. But when a complaint is made and the accused is put in jail, his lawyers or others like Eshwarappa (then just a legislator and now BJP minister) probe on how it happened, the time and how many times,” he had said in February 2019.He added that at the end of the trial, the victim would say that she was raped just once in reality but multiple times in court during cross examination.“My situation has become like that,” he had said.The legislators present in the house laughed at the comments with no single legislator protesting against the insensitive remarks. There were women legislators present in the house who appeared to be uncomfortable but did not register a protest.The next day Kumar did not apologise and instead said, “The media needed to put out such things because they also had a job.”Dona Fernandes, a women’s rights activist based in Bengaluru, said, “The women’s movement has come so far, but this is how our legislators behave. What is more concerning is that people were laughing at these comments. I recently read that Bengaluru police are setting help desks in hospitals to help victims of rape. The sad part is that we are taking these remedial measures while lawmakers are making such remarks. This is a serious matter and the legislator should be suspended. A suspension would be a small punishment considering the times we live in.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-congress-leader-and-former-karnataka-speaker-makes-crass-comment-on-rape-in-winter-session-101639683168731.html
17-12-2021||India||‘Suicide prevention’ step: IISc students in Bengaluru oppose removal of ceiling fans||Students at the Indian Institute of Science have come out against the institute’s decision to remove ceiling fans from hostel rooms and restrict access to terraces and rooftops to prevent suicides. Since the management has already begun the process of the replacing ceiling fans in a boys’ hotel with a wall-mounted fan, students conducted a survey to show that they are not in favour of the decision. IISc has reported six suicides on the campus since last year. According to students, the removal of fans and other restrictions are part of a kneejerk reaction from the institute, instead of taking steps towards addressing the mental health-related issues of the students. A letter sent to the Student’s Council by a group of students in the institute had the results of the poll conducted. In the survey, which had 305 participants, 273 said they didn’t want the ceiling fan in their room replaced with wall-mounted fan. While 14 agreed to the change, 18 said they didn’t care. In the second question on whether they thought replacing ceiling fans with wall-mounted fans would help curb student suicides, 267 out of 305 voted no. While 19 voted yes, 19 said they didn’t have an informed opinion on the matter. “Even though more than 80% of the participants of the survey saying that it was dumb idea, the institute is going ahead with the plan. The fact is that nothing has been done to address the pressure, academic or otherwise, faced by the students. Such kneejerk reaction won’t make a difference. Instead, they should make the student welfare centre better,” said a student of IISc who took part in the survey. The letter to the chairman of the Student’s Council stated that students have been informed that the work of replacing the fans would be done within 15 days. “Taking this poll as a sample indicator of the entire student population of the IISc, it is clear that currently, the student community does not wish to proceed with this installation. They see no worth in its value proposition,” the letter stated. A member of the Student’s Council said the matter will be taken up with management. Senior officials of IISc didn’t respond to the queries sent by email and phone calls made to get their comments on the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suicide-prevention-step-iisc-students-in-bengaluru-oppose-removal-of-ceiling-fans-101639682868682.html
17-12-2021||India||Indian culture won’t survive if conversions not stopped: Karnataka minister||The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has proposed to bring a bill to stop conversions done by force or inducement in the ongoing winter session of the Karnataka legislature. Since it was first proposed in September, the anti-conversion bill has fuelled attacks against the Christian community, with the right-wing and other vigilante groups perpetrating violence, instilling fear in those they believe are converting people. During an interview, Karnataka minister for home affairs Araga Jnanendra said the bill would help police take action against those converting by force or inducement and will only prevent vigilante attacks in the future. Excerpts Why is the BJP government proposing to bring this bill (law)? We are studying all models implemented in other states and bringing a law here. These people (referring to missionaries) approach several people and convert them, and the family or anyone can take objection and get agitated, which will adversely impact law and order. They (missionaries) convert thousands of families every day like some strict target to achieve. This is one of the reasons for bringing the bill. Some (religious) seers in Chitradurga have also met with their counterparts on this issue. Religious conversion is a social challenge, and now even the Lingayats are being converted. If we don’t stop these conversions, Indian culture and core religions will not survive. We are being asked to bring this bill by members of society since it (the issue) has reached such alarming levels. When a (BJP) legislator himself said that his mother was converted, imagine the extent! They (missionaries) are doing this in every household and it is dividing families and villages. It happens in rural areas and urban centres on a large scale. What are the provisions of this bill? Those willing to convert would have to mandatorily submit an application to DC (deputy commissioner or district collector), who will observe and inquire the case if it was forcible or by inducement. If there is no issue, it will be approved and communicated to other departments. They (converting person) will lose their caste/religion status and all government benefits that come with it. This aspect was not there before in Karnataka or anywhere else. Under Section 25 of the Constitution, there is an article saying that there should be no conversion by inducement or force but nothing to state what happens if it happens. That is why we are bringing out this bill. You said that the bill would also stop double benefits like Dalit Christians? There is no category called Dalit Christians. They call themselves this. Why does Dalit go to Christianity? There are untouchable castes who may not get the respect they want. So, to live more peacefully and for mental peace, they go there. There is no SC in Christians or Muslims. So, when the bill is streamlined, any possibility of double benefits is closed. Let people who are still under that category get the benefits like job promotion, where the caste or religion category is applicable. Will this bill have retrospective applications to check earlier conversions too? All these aspects are being discussed. There is a provision to register a complaint with the DC against such activities. They will investigate and can take appropriate action. They will serve the converted person notice and probe to check how the conversion took place. We are formulating categories on who can be the complainant, which is yet to be finalised. There have been targeted attacks on the Christian community and a sense of fear since the bill was proposed. There is no fear as such. They (missionaries) sit in someone’s house and conduct prayers and start the religious conversion process. And others in the village have forced themselves into these houses and questioned their intentions and actions, probing if conversions were taking place. This law has been implemented in eight other states, and there have been no problems. Some people and Congress are creating this fear itself as part of their politics. For Congress, it is vote bank politics, and they have groomed some communities. They said that they will oppose the bill even without knowing what is in the bill. Congress itself drafted this bill in 2016 ( in Karnataka), and our bill would be on the same lines. Senior Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa has sent out a circular within his community that religious conversions were happening and that people should get ready to combat this. We are not after vote bank politics. How will you gain their confidence? There is no question of fueling hate. Some 10-15 Christian priests came to me, and I told them there is no intention to create any problems. I told them that this government is committed to giving all protection to follow their respective faith. If this law is made and given to the police, they will be there instantly. There will be no room for confusion and no clarity. Since the police now think twice before taking action, others may take up law in their own hands. Police should have clarity on this. There are fears that this bill will fuel vigilante culture like it was seen after the anti-cattle slaughter law.Nothing of this sort (religious conversions) should happen, which spoils the harmony of the society, and people should remain peacefully within their religion. When there is a situation where illegal has become the norm, the police should stop this. When the police fail to act, the public takes the law into their hands. Now the police are stopping this (cattle slaughter). When we make a law and arm the police with it, there will be clarity as they are not certain on how to handle such incidents. With this law, the police will intervene, and there will be no chance for law-and-order problems. Do you think such a law will prevent conversions entirely? We want to do it. There are allegations that this law targets one community? There are Christians or Muslims who become Hindu or vice versa. Let all these religious conversions become streamlined. So, when it happens, that person will lose the benefits of being a minority (if Christian or Muslim), and society too will know that the person has converted. We want to be impartial and transparent that all these should happen within the framework of the law. Otherwise, people would do things on their whims and fancies, and this cannot be tolerated.What powers will the DC have? If the DC thinks it (a religious conversion) is not genuine, then the application can be rejected. An FIR will be lodged, and there is a strong penal clause that is not yet finalised. But it could be between 3-10 years jail and penalty on all those involved and based on the violations. There are allegations that the BJP government is introducing this bill to deflect attention from the corruption allegations. There is no connection between the two. We have been saying that we will introduce this bill for many years, and there is pressure from society. Is the bill being rushed? Nothing of the sort. But whenever we get a bill, every single word has to be carefully drafted. The same process is being used for all bills. But since everyone is more curious about this one, you are finding out. There has been enough time and discussion on this and not being done in haste. In Bengaluru, at least two comedy shows were cancelled. Is it right for the police to do this? The shows of two such people have been cancelled. When they were in different regions of the country, there were FIRs against them. They don’t just do comedy, but they criticise religion and other things. If it is just comedy, there would be no problem. No license or permission is required to perform it. But these people attack the sentiments of the people through their shows. With that in mind and to protect the harmony, the police had imposed certain restrictions, including denying them space. If a programme has the potential to create unrest, then the police will restrict it and order that no space is given to such elements. What is the proposal to bring in the special marriages act (Love Jihad)? This is under discussion on how to do it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forced-conversions-threaten-indian-culture-says-karnataka-home-minister-araga-jnanendra-101639682688722.html

Further details would be disclosed on Friday,” Rao said.On Thursday, as many as 120 persons landed in Hyderabad international airport from “at risk” countries and none of them tested positive for Covid-19. However, out of the 21 samples sent for Genome sequencing in the last two days, four more fresh cases of Omicron variant were reported – one from at risk country and three from Kenya, which is not in the list of “at risk” country.On Wednesday, the health officials shifted the two Omicron infected persons – a 24-year-old woman from Kenya and another 23-year-old man from Somalia – to Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences at Gachibowli on Wednesday.The health department intensified measures to trace all the contacts of the two Omicron cases. They managed to trace around 150 persons who came in contact with these two African nationals in the last two days and conducted Covid-19 tests on them.The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities declared the Paramount Colony at Tolichowki, where the two Omicron-affected persons were located, as containment area. The GHMC teams sanitised the entire area was sanitised with disinfectants in the last two days.“We are carrying out intense searches for others who might have come into contact with these two persons since December 12, when they landed in Hyderabad and we shall conduct tests on them. We are also not leaving other citizens in the area as the virus can spread through air as well,” the health department official said.If any of the people in the area test positive for Covid-19, their samples would be sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology for genome sequencing, he said.

We have arrested and produced him before the magistrate in Tirunelveli and we have taken him back to Theni where he is lodged for another case,” said NK Senthamaraikannan, superintendent of police, Tirunelveli district. The Tirunelveli district magistrate has posted the case for December 30.It pertains to a video that Maridhas had uploaded where he allegedly blames Muslims and the Tablighi Jamaat congregation for the spread of Covid-19. After watching the broadcast online, a resident of Tirunelveli’s Melapalayam, Mohamed Kader Meeran, filed a complaint against Maridhas. Police have booked Maridhas under Sections 292 (a), 295 A, and 505 (2) of Indian Penal Code and 67 B (a) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Maridhas known to have leaning towards right-wing ideologies has been engulfed in controversies and has the support of the BJP unit in Tamil Nadu which blames the ruling DMK government for such arrests.The party had welcomed the court quashing the FIR which had sedition charges against Maridhas and party members were seen protesting against his arrest in the case earlier in December.Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai had reacted that they will continue to fight for all the nationalist voices when it is suppressed. The party even met Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi last week to submit a memorandum that there has been “illegal police case against” 22 of BJP IT wing members and “nationalist social media voices in Tamil Nadu on flimsy grounds”.A day after the tragic crash, Maridhas had tweeted in Tamil that Tamil Nadu under the DMK rule was becoming another Kashmir. A DMK IT-wing member filed a complaint and the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on December 14 quashed the FIR stating that that a ‘Youtuber’ and any social media personality regularly commenting on public affairs would also be entitled to the very same rights which are accorded to journalists and the media under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and that Maridhas is entitled to the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youtuber-maridash-held-again-for-controversial-video-linking-muslims-with-covid19-101639682151356.html
17-12-2021||India||Vague statement not enough to prove rape, says Kerala high court||A vague statement of an alleged victim of sexual assault without any indication of intercourse would not constitute the offence of rape under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Kerala high court observed while acquitting a convict in a rape case. A single judge bench of Justice Kausar Edapaggath on Wednesday made the observation while hearing a petition of a man convicted of rape by a lower court based on the statement of a woman that the “accused hugged and impregnated” her. The court held that a vague statement would not be a substitute for the statutory mandate contained in the IPC section, reports Bar and Bench. The case was registered in 2009 and the accused was convicted by a lower court on the basis of the testimony of the victim and her mother.According to the prosecution, the accused developed physical relation with the woman and impregnated her on the pretext of a false marriage promise. The defence counsel, however, contended that not forceful intercourse was suggested by the petitioner and both (victim and mother) withdrew from the marriage proposal after the accused failed to return a gold chain borrowed by him from the victim for pledging. The court found that in the victim’s statement there was no mention of intercourse or that the victim gave birth to a child as alleged in the petition. The court noted that if a man retracts his promise to marry a woman, the prosecution must give evidence that the accused had no intention to marry the victim from the very inception, to attract the offence of rape. “There must be proof of penetration and only the victim can tell about this. But after going through her statement, such a fact is not revealed. She has not stated anything relating to penile penetration or such attempt. She only stated that the accused hugged and impregnated her,” the court held. Going by the records, statements and the attending circumstances, they do not remotely suggest that it was non-consensual, the court noted. The court also found the promise of marriage was given after the alleged sexual act and not at the initial stage. The bench then set aside the lower court judgment and set him free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vague-statement-not-enough-to-prove-rape-says-kerala-high-court-101639682028815.html
17-12-2021||India||Metro Man Sreedharan retires from active politics||Less than a year after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala, ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan on Thursday announced his retirement from active politics, much to the surprise of the party’s state unit.Celebrated as a chief architect of the Konkan Railway as well as of the Delhi and Kochi Metros, Sreedharan lost the Palakkad seat to sitting MLA Shafi Parambil by 3,859 votes in the Assembly elections in April this year.Addressing reporters in Ponnani, his hometown in Malappuram district, Sreedharan said, “Defeat in the assembly election made me wiser. When I lost, it made me sad. But now that I realize it, I would have been an MLA if elected. I could have done nothing much by being an MLA alone. I have never been a politician. I remained a bureaucratic politician for some time,” he said, adding his entry into politics was late, but the exit was as early.“I am 90 now. I cannot run around like a youngster. I am associated with three different trusts, and I will spend the rest of my time with them,” he said. When asked whether he was leaving the arena in disgust, Sreedharan said when he joined the BJP in March 2021, there were enough chances for the party, but the situation is different now. “The party will have to do enough to get a foothold in the state. That I mentioned in my report to the party president after the election debacle. I don’t want to discuss those things now,” he said.The BJP-National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which fought the April 2 Assembly polls, fancying a win in at least 35 seats in Kerala, failed to retain even its lone seat of Nemom. All its major contestants, including Sreedharan and party state chief K Surendran, were defeated.“My short stint in politics, I am leaving neither disgusted nor contended. You can say late entry and early exit. I will serve people the rest of my life through three bodies I am associated with,” he said.Five years ago, Sreedharan founded an NGO called Foundation of Restoration for National Values, which took up many issues, including Kerala floods and advertisements.BJP state unit expressed surprise over his sudden exit. “We heard about this through media only. He will be around, and we will seek his guidance and advice on key issues,” said state president K Surendran.In the assembly election, the BJP had projected him as the chief ministerial candidate thinking his stature would fetch the party political dividends. Yet, it remained an also-ran in the Left surge, and its vote share also went down from 15 per cent to 13. The railway civil engineer acquired the sobriquet of the Metro Man after he oversaw the launch of the metro rail project in the national capital. He also played a key role in the Konkan railway and rebuilding of the Pambhan railway bridge in Rameswaram, which was destroyed in a storm in 1964. 
17-12-2021||India||Kerala: No trace of tiger on prowl in Kerala, villagers launch stir||Efforts to trap a tiger that encroached Kurukkanmoola and nearby villages in the Wayanad district of Kerala failed yet again, resulting in two more killings on Wednesday night. On Thursday, harried forest officials had a tough time dealing with angry local people who blocked them, and assurances were needed to cool their tempers. State forest minister A K Saseendran, who called a special meeting in the state capital on Thursday, said the government would do everything possible to alleviate the fear and agony of the villagers. “We have pressed into service innovative methods including drones and night vision cameras to track the tiger. We understand the plight of local people, and we will do everything to end their misery,” the minister said after the meeting. Two divisional forest officers, 200-odd forest personnel, three tranquillising teams, a trained elephant squad and selected local volunteers have been trying to locate the elusive tiger, which has made 17 killings in the last 20 days. On Wednesday night, it killed a calf belonging to a retired teacher M John, and its carcass was found 30 m away from his home. At least one kms away from his house, the tiger killed a goat belonging to a farmer. “We heard the cries of the calf, but we were strictly told not to open doors during night hours,” said John, adding that the marauding tiger restricted their lives inside their homes. In Kurukkanmoola, the worst affected village with 12animals killed, farmers said they have not gone to their farms for more than two weeks and school-going children remain at home. Though district administration has promised protection to children, villagers are not ready to take any chance. “Once it won’t get animals, it may turn to human beings,” said a resident P Vipin. Section 144 is in force for more than two weeks in the area, where night travel is also banned. Visuals captured show it is a big male tiger and has a deep gush on its neck. Officials suspect that it might have been severely injured over a fight for territory or mate and turned to domestic animals as it could not hunt down its prey.Forest officials could not match the image of the tiger in the database collected from Wayanad in the last two years. A photo and pug mark details have been sent to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to ascertain its territory and identity, said north zone conservator of forests D K Vinod Kumar. “We have sent camera trap pics and other details to NTCA to find out its details. Our records show it is not a resident of Wayanad forests,” he added. Wildlife experts have said it is normal for injured tigers to travel many kms in forests and camp near human habitats for easy prey. Wayanad wildlife sanctuary is spread over 344 sq kms, and is home to 80 tigers, according to the last wildlife census. “Trapping or tranquillising a big cat is a strenuous exercise. We can’t set a deadline for it,” said wildlife expert Dr P S Esa adding best teams are at work. 
17-12-2021||India||Andhra to engage 15L college students in community service||The Andhra Pradesh government has come up with a novel scheme of engaging all college students in community service, so that they could identify the issues confronting the society at various levels and give a feedback to the government to help it frame better policies.“It is a first of its kind initiative in the country wherein nearly 15.70 lakh students studying various professional and non-professional colleges and universities would be involved in the community service, so that they would come out with suggestions on addressing the needs of the society,” Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education Society (APSCHE) chairman K Hemachandra Reddy said.The state government has created a separate organisation – the Community Planning and Development Board, aimed at advising the government on matters related to community development by involving the students of engineering, pharmacy, education, law and conventional degree colleges.“These students would act as a bridge between people and government. They would visit the villages, blocks, revenue divisions and districts assigned to them. In coordination with the village and ward secretariats, they would interact with the educated people and elders, identify the community needs, match them with locally available resources and prepare the reports. They would these micro-level findings with concerned departments when required,” Reddy said.The APSCHE will instruct the Community Planning and Development Board to take up the surveys and build the required database, through the involvement of educational institutions.In each mandal (revenue block), a college would be identified as a nodal agency. There will be a resource centre for a cluster of mandals. Similarly, there would be similar centres at the revenue division and district level. The students at different levels will be involved in the task assigned to them by the board.The student groups collect the complete data pertaining to the villages of that mandal. A suitable questionnaire shall be designed for this purpose. The data will be studied and analysed with the help of village/ward secretariat and the faculty members of the college. The output has to be discussed with the people and the felt-needs of the community need to be drafted.“After consolidating data on all the issues found by these centres, the data will be grouped into categories, following a series of discussions with the social engineers, scientists, professors, and NGOs on how to tackle them,” Reddy said.The tasks assigned to the students could be on any issues – infrastructure, social issues, health, education, agriculture, environment and the community requirements.“Unlike the previous community based programmes like National Service Scheme (NSS) wherein only interested students participate, we have designed this programme to involve all the students by integrating with Choice Based Credit System (CBCS),” he said.Every student must put in a minimum of 180 hours for the community service project during the summer vacation, so that they would get four credits within the CBCS. They would submit their reports in the form of dissertation to the board, which in turn, submits the same to the government with specific recommendations.“The community planning and development board aims to encourage people to participate in building government policies and become a part of the governance. This way, students can become socially responsible which can bring about a happier atmosphere to live in,” said Nedurumalli Ram Kumar Reddy, chairman of the board.
17-12-2021||India||Change in mindset required to restore jurisprudence on bail, says Supreme Court||A change in the mindset of courts and prosecution is required to restore the jurisprudence on bail, observed the Supreme Court on Thursday while regretting that its order to facilitate bail in cases where the accused has not been arrested during the investigation was being construed in a reverse manner.“The problem is with the mindset. We may lay down a law but the mindset has to change... our endeavour was to reduce the numbers of bail applications coming to this court. But the way our order is being interpreted, we will end up having more applications coming to this court,” observed a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh.“A change in the mindset is required both in courts and in prosecution. The whole thing is that the prosecution thinks whether we are able to convict or not in the end of the trial, let’s put them behind bars for some days. Bail petitions are heard for days and days...Some change-over is necessary,” it added.The bench pointed out that when it passed the guidelines on bail on October 7, the idea was to send out a message that an accused, whose arrest was not felt necessary by a probe agency during the course of the investigation, should not be thrown behind bars just because a charge sheet is being filed and the accused has now been summoned. This order said that the trial court, on receipt of the charge sheet and appearance of the accused, should decide the bail applications without taking the accused into custody.However, as pointed out by a clutch of senior advocates including Mukul Rohatgi, Amit Desai and Vikram Chaudhri, who appeared for some of the accused in criminal cases, the prosecution was now asking the trial courts to decide bail applications even in cases where there was no requirement of bail and the accused could be released merely by furnishing a bond.“You can take this order as a discouragement to keep people in custody or you can take it as an additional reason not to give bail. We can change the law but the greater challenge is of the mindset. And this is a real problem. We have been issuing notices and granting interim relief in 40 to 50% cases of bail,” said the bench. It also went on to clarify in its previous order: “The idea of the October 7 order is not to put any additional fetters but it is in line with the judicial thinking on enlargement of bail... We also clarify that during the course of the investigation, if the accused has not been arrested, filing of chargesheet alone won’t be a ground to arrest the accused.”The court also requested all the lawyers and additional solicitor general SV Raju, who appeared for the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforce Directorate in the cases, to sit together and come up with additional directions that should be issued by the bench on the next date to convey the intent of the previous order.However, Raju, on his part, complained that most offenders are in hospital. “They cheat people of ₹100 crore and spend ₹20 crore on lawyers for bail or hospital,” said the ASJ.To this, the bench retorted: “So, you keep them behind bars and they end up in hospitals. In a lighter vein, there seems to be an economic distribution of wealth.”

A police spokesperson said that acting on a specific input about the presence of terrorists in village Redwani Bala late on Wednesday night, the J&K police along with the Army and the Central Reserved Police Force (CRPF) launched a joint cordon and search operation in the area. “The house where the terrorists were hiding was cordoned and an opportunity for surrender was given to them. But they opened indiscriminate fire upon the security forces. Intermittent exchange of fire kept taking place and at around 2.20 am and the two trapped terrorists were killed,” the spokesperson said. Later in the day, police identified the slain terrorists as Aamir Bashir Dar alias Danish of Kujjar Yaripora and Yousuf Shan of Sursano Hatipora in Kulgam district. Both were ‘C’ category terrorists and affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of LeT, police said, adding Dar was active since April. “Arms and ammunition were recovered from the encounter site,” the spokesperson said, adding that a case has been registered at Qaimoh police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-let-terrorists-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-101639681128675.html
17-12-2021||India||Winter session: Biological diversity bill tabled amid Opposition protest||A bill which seeks to reduce the pressure on wild medicinal plants by encouraging cultivation of such plants and facilitating fast-tracking of research, patent application process and transfer of research results was introduced in Parliament on Thursday.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav introduced the Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 amid din created by the Opposition over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence issue.The bill was drafted following concerns by traditional Indian medicine practitioners, seed sector, and industry and research sector over compliance burden in the Biological Diversity Act 2002, which was enacted for conservation of biological diversity and ensure fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources with indigenous and local communities.According to the bill, these sectors urged the Centre to “reduce compliance burden in order to encourage a conducive environment for collaborative research and investments, simplify patent application process, widen the scope of levying access and benefit sharing with local communities and for further conservation of biological resources”.The bill proposes to give exemption to registered AYUSH medical practitioners and people accessing codified traditional knowledge, among others, from giving prior intimation to state biodiversity boards for accessing biological resources for certain purposes, the statement of objects and reasons of the bill said.“The amendment seems to be done with the sole intention of providing benefit to the AYUSH Industry. The main focus of the bill is to facilitate the trade in biodiversity as opposed to conservation, protection of biodiversity and knowledge of the local communities. The amendments are completely contrary to the aim and objective of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002,” environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-session-biological-diversity-bill-tabled-amid-opposition-protest-101639680779994.html
17-12-2021||India||Govt may table bill to raise women’s marriage age to 21||The Union government is planning to bring a bill to increase the minimum legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21, people familiar with developments said, underlining a far-reaching decision that will require modification in faith-based personal laws dealing with marriage and inheritance.The Union Cabinet cleared the proposal in its meeting on Wednesday and the government plans to bring the bill — which will bring the minimum age of marriage for women at par with that of men — in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, said the people quoted above.At present, the legal age of women to get married is 18 while that of men is 21. The decision is based on the recommendation of a task force led by former Samata Party chief Jaya Jaitly.“If we talk about gender equity and gender empowerment in every field, we cannot leave marriage out because this is a very odd message that a girl can be fit to be married at 18 that cuts away her opportunity to go to college, and the man has the opportunity to prepare himself for life and earning up to 21 years,” said Jaitly.Jaitly said the task force submitted its recommendations to the Prime Minister’s Office, the Union ministry of women and child development and NITI Aayog last December. The other members in the panel were V K Paul, member (health) NITI Aayog; the secretaries of the higher education, school education, health, women and child development, legislative departments apart from academicians Najma Akhtar, Vasudha Kamat and Dipti Shah.The government may amend the 2006 Prohibition of Child Marriage Act to enact the watershed reform, said the people quoted in the first instance. The decision comes a year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Centre was deliberating on what the minimum age for marriage of women should be.If passed by Parliament, the amended minimum age for women will require amendments in a raft of laws, including the 1954 Special Marriage Act, the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act, the 1872 Indian Christian Marriage Act, the 1936 Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, among others. Also laws on inheritance, maintenance and divorce might need to be amended too. Jaitly said the panel conducted assessment calls with young people and found almost everyone agreed. “We should give the girl an opportunity to earn and be equal to a man and she cannot become equal at 18 years when man has 21 years to do that.”Some experts, however, cautioned that the move might backfire as it didn’t address the underlying causes of early marriages and ignored existing socio-economic differences.“No one is in disagreement that women should not be married early.... We need to make investments in educating both girls and boys so that they themselves don’t get married early,” said Bharti Ali, director of HAQ: Centre for Child Rights, a child rights NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-table-bill-to-raise-women-s-marriage-age-to-21-101639680778337.html
17-12-2021||India||Congress releases 1st list of candidates for Goa polls before EC announcement||The Congress on Thursday released its first list of eight candidates for the assembly elections in Goa which is slated to take place next year.The Congress is the first party to announce its candidates even before the announcement of polls by the Election Commission, and will give its candidates a head start for campaigning.According to an official communication from the party, former chief minister Digamber Kamat will contest the polls from Margao constituency and Sudhir Kanolkar from the Mapusa assembly seat.Kamat, who served as chief minister from 2012 to 2017, currently represents the Margao assembly seat. He is also the leader of opposition in the Goa assembly. Kanolkar has been a municipal councillor and was earlier a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party state executive. He had quit the saffron party to join the Congress in early 2019.Besides, the party fielded Tony Rodrigues from Taleigao assembly seat and Rajesh Verenkar from Ponda constituency.Among other candidates are Sankalp Amonkar from Marmugao seat, Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco from Curtorim seat and Yuri Alemao from Cuncolim assembly constituency while Altone D’Costa has been fielded from Quepem seat.

17-12-2021||India||India’s Central Asia meet to focus on Afghan issue||The situation in Afghanistan and regional connectivity will be in focus when external affairs minister S Jaishankar meets his counterparts from five Central Asian states for the third India-Central Asia Dialogue in New Delhi on December 19. India is hosting the three-day dialogue for which the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan will be visiting the country. Tajikistan foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin will also be on an official bilateral visit from December 18 to 20 at the invitation of Jaishankar.New Delhi is looking at the possibility of having the leaders of the Central Asian states as the chief guests at next year’s Republic Day celebrations.The India-Central Asia Dialogue will see the foreign ministers discuss ways to strengthen relations, with the focus on trade, connectivity and developmental cooperation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular media briefing. “India considers Central Asia as part of its extended neighbourhood,” he added.Bagchi indicated that developments in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in August are expected to figure in the discussions. “I would think that given the interests of the members of this dialogue, regional developments will certainly be an important element of their conversation,” he said.Regional connectivity, too, is an important element and the foreign ministers will discuss ways to strengthen trade and transit links between India and Central Asia, he said. They would look at multiple modalities, including Iran’s Chabahar port and other options, he added.The Indian government has focused on bolstering its ties with the Central Asian states by capitalising on the relations of both sides with Russia. In 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the first Indian premier to have visited all five Central Asian states in a single trip.The outreach towards Central Asia is seen as a counter to China’s creeping influence. The Taliban takeover of Kabul and shared concerns about the spillover of terrorism and instability from Afghanistan have emerged as a shared concern and the national security chiefs of all five Central Asian states attended a regional security conference on Afghanistan hosted by India last month.Jaishankar visited Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan this year, and also held a meeting with his Turkmenistan counterpart.The dialogue is “symbolic of the interest on the part of all member countries for greater engagement...in a spirit of friendship, trust and mutual understanding”, Bagchi said. The five Central Asian foreign ministers will make a joint courtesy call on Modi.
17-12-2021||India||1,002 women clear written exam for NDA||Allowed to take the examination for admission to the National Defence Academy in November after the Supreme Court shattered the glass ceiling at the premier military school, 1,002 women have cleared it, striking a strong blow for equality in the armed forces.“Of the 8,009 candidates who have cleared the exam, 7,007 are men and 1,002 are women,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. That means 12.51% of the people who cleared the test are women. They will now have to clear a personality and intelligence assessment and physical and medical tests before being admitted into the NDA.Annually, less than 5% of the men who cleared the written examination made it through.HT on October 30 reported that a third of the candidates appearing for the NDA examination on November 14 for entry into the premier joint services training institution were women.This was their first attempt at the entrance exam being conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) at centres across India , after the Supreme Court, in a landmark order on August 18, opened the doors of the academy to women.“Nearly 570,000 applications have been received and of these 178,000 are women,” a second official said, also on condition of anonymity.The apex court’s order making women eligible to join the NDA, which was formally inaugurated 66 years ago and was thus far a male preserve, came almost three decades after they were allowed to serve in select branches of the army, air force and navy as short-service commission (SSC) officers.A fortnight ahead of the exam, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane set the tone for welcoming female cadets into the Khadakwasla-based academy, which currently has a maximum training capacity of around 2,000 cadets every year.“As we open the portals of NDA to women cadets, I expect you all to welcome them with the same sense of fair play and professionalism that the Indian armed forces are known for the world over,” Naravane said, while addressing cadets during a passing out parade at the academy. Naravane said the induction of women will be the “first step towards gender equality” in the armed forces, and added that women officers will be in the same position 40 years later that he is in now.The top court in September told the Union government that women aspiring to join the armed forces should be allowed to take the NDA entrance examination in November, days after the government informed the court that the academy will be ready to welcome the first-ever batch of women cadets in January 2023, after they sit for the entrance exam in May 2022.The court said it “cannot belie the aspirations of young girls” and rejected the Centre’s request to delay the examination for women on the ground that much groundwork was still to be done.The aspects that the NDA will now have to quickly work on include medical standards for women, accommodation, training capacity, security and privacy arrangements, physical segregation of living quarters, associated physical and electronic surveillance measures, and additional gender-specific requirements. The physical and medical standards for men for entry to the NDA are extremely stringent. Equivalent standards for women in the NDA entry age group (16.5 to 19 years) are being formulated, said a third official, who asked not to be named.Students become eligible to take the NDA and Naval Academy Examination, while they are in the 12th standard.Those who clear the entrance exam have to face the Services Selection Board (a rigorous personality and intelligence test spread over five days); candidates accepted by the SSB will undergo a medical examination before UPSC releases the final merit list. After training at the NDA for three years, split into six terms, cadets head for further training at different academies depending on their choice of service before being commissioned as officers.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace. As of February 9,118 women were serving in the Army, Navy and Air Force.The SC on February 17, 2020, ruled that SSC women officers in the army are entitled to permanent commission (PC) and they have to be considered irrespective of their service length. Five months later, the defence ministry issued a formal sanction letter for granting PC to them. The order specified grant of PC to SSC women officers in 10 streams.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the Indian Air Force decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Earlier this year, the Indian Navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years.But tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1002-women-clear-written-exam-for-nda-101639680774251.html
17-12-2021||India||Team arrives in South Africa under shadow of captaincy saga||Mumbai The image of India’s Test skipper Virat Kohli, wearing spectacles, a face mask and a shield, and immersed in his smartphone after the team landed at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, greeted millions of cricket fans on BCCI’s social media handles on Thursday evening. Kohli will lead India’s quest for their first-ever series win in South Africa, though it may not be surprising if he was scrolling for news from back home, having left BCCI officials in a fix with his comments in the pre-departure media conference on Wednesday. Kohli refuting BCCI president Sourav Ganguly’s comments that he asked him not to step down as T20 skipper, and then detailing that he was only told of his removal as ODI skipper by chief selector Chetan Sharma 90 minutes before the meeting to pick the Test squad, has sparked a raging controversy. Ganguly, when asked about Kohli’s comments and the divergence in their narratives -- or “discrepancy”, as former captain Sunil Gavaskar called it -- responded on Thursday with a cryptic and terse comment: “I have no comments. We will deal with it appropriately. Leave it to the BCCI,” he told TV journalists in Kolkata. Even without the foreboding that Ganguly’s comment carried, Kohli will be under intense scrutiny in the series. The final Test in Cape Town is set to be his 100th, and his average in South Africa is better than his impressive career average of 50.65 (5 Tests, 553 runs at 55.80, two hundreds). But the Indian skipper averages 28.4 across 10 Tests in 2021 and his last century came in November, 2019, 14 Test matches ago. Apart from having to regain his best form, he will also have to contend with the struggles of Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, the senior batsmen low on confidence but included to make their experience of the conditions to count. With Kohli saying on Wednesday that Ganguly’s comments over the manner of his removal as ODI captain were “inaccurate”, he has taken on the BCCI president directly, and there were rumours on Thursday that BCCI could respond -- either a rebuttal through a statement, or through a press conference by chief selector Chetan Sharma. There was also some talk that Kohli could be asked to “show cause”. Some senior cricket officials, however, said that they had advised against it because targeting Kohli when he is leading India on an important tour would reflect poorly on BCCI. India cricket legend Kapil Dev said the saga was were ill-timed. “I would say Board president is Board president, but yes the Indian cricket team captain is also a big thing. But talking badly about each other in public, I don’t think it is a good thing, whether it is Sourav or Kohli... You must control the situation, it’ll be better if you think about the country,” he said.The current controversy was sparked when BCCI announced Rohit Sharma as ODI skipper as a footnote in its statement announcing the Test team for South Africa. Following widespread criticism of BCCI not showing respect to a great cricketer, it thanked Kohli on its Twitter handle. Ganguly then told the media that he had tried to persuade Kohli from quitting as T20 skipper and said having two separate captains for white-ball teams was untenable. Amid speculation that Kohli has fallen out favour with the BCCI and did not get along with Rohit Sharma, the Test skipper said he had an excellent relationship with his teammate and that Ganguly’s comments he had tried to stop him from quitting T20 captaincy was “inaccurate”. Kohli also said he was told about the ODI captaincy change by Chetan Sharma only 90 minutes before the selection meeting to pick the Test squad. India will go into the Test series without Rohit Sharma, their most successful batsman in the summer tour of England where his blunting of the bowling as opener was key to India taking a 2-1 series lead with a game to play. While Sharma, nursing a hamstring injury, could recover to lead in his first full ODI series that follows, Kohli dismissed some media reports that he had sought a break and that he was available for the series. India play Tests in Centurion (Dec 26-30), Johannesburg (Jan 3-7) and Cape Town (Jan 11-15). The ODIs will be played in Paarl (Jan 19, 21) and at Cape Town (Jan 23). And, as far as press conferences go, Kohli is likely to address the media on Christmas Day before the Centurion Test, when the topics covered will not be restricted to the 22 yards. 
17-12-2021||India||What we know about Omicron variant so far||Infections of the Omicron variant are spiralling globally.The United Kingdom, reeling under separate outbreaks of the variant as well as Delta, set a record for new cases on Wednesday and logged a 10% increase in hospitalisation compared to last week. The worst, England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned, may yet to come as Omicron takes over.Across the English Channel, France responded by banning people from entering from the UK, while on the other side of the Atlantic, officials in the United States confirmed regular vaccine doses may become insufficient and boosters will be crucial.Globally, there are more than 75 countries that have confirmed cases of Omicron and scientists are racing to uncover how the mutated virus will shape the next few months of the pandemic, which is almost certain to flare in several regions of the world.Are boosters enough?On Wednesday, White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci said Omicron has not mutated enough to need redesigned vaccine (or a booster), and third doses of the existing jabs work adequately.Fauci’s comments are based on a body of scientific evidence unveiled recently. Researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Johns Hopkins University last week published preliminary findings that suggest the adaptive immune response of the human body – which learns a pathogen and can later identify and kill infected cells – recognises Omicron almost as effectively as it does the other variants.This is different from the case of another component of the immune system, which consists of antibodies that bind to circulating viral particles before they can infect cells. Antibodies created in response to an infection with one of the older variants or via vaccination are less able to bind to Omicron.The authors said this is because Omicron has mostly not mutated in regions that the adaptive immunity’s killer T cells target. “These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-Sars-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognise the Omicron VOC, and that Sars-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this point,” the authors said in the study, and added that those with vaccination and a past infection will still have protection from Omicron-triggered Covid-19.Or should vaccines be updated?But two other studies contend that the evolution of Omicron represents a striking leap that could necessitate the work on revising vaccines, even if they are for a future, even-worse configuration of the virus that looks increasingly inevitable.In the first study, the scientists (a group comprising teams from Switzerland, US and Italy) said they found that antibodies trained on one part of the Sars-Cov-2, known as the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, were largely ineffective in neutralising Omicron.But antibodies that target other parts of the virus retained ability to neutralise even Omicron, since those parts did not undergo as significant a mutation in the new variant.Almost all vaccines at present target the spike protein of the virus, which has evolved significantly in Omicron.The first study also found that Omicron had gained an ability to bind to mouse ACE2, an enzyme the Sars-Cov-2 previously couldn’t attach to.The second study, by researchers from Hong Kong and the US, too found that most antibodies that target the spike had become ineffective. “The Omicron variant presents a serious threat to many existing Covid-19 vaccines and therapies, compelling the development of new interventions that anticipate the evolutionary trajectory of Sars-CoV-2,” the study said.The authors of this study called for efforts to be made to pre-empt further evolution of the coronavirus. “It is not too far-fetched to think that this Sars-CoV-2 is now only a mutation or two away from being pan-resistant to current antibodies… We must devise strategies that anticipate the evolutional direction of the virus and develop agents that target better conserved viral elements.”Fauci, writing separately along with two other American experts in the New England Journal of Medicine, pitched for a universal coronavirus vaccine.“We need a research approach that can characterise the global ‘coronaviral universe’ in multiple species, characterise the natural history and pathogenesis of coronaviruses in laboratory animals and in humans, and apply this information in developing broadly protective ‘universal’ vaccines (protecting against all betacoronaviruses, and ideally all coronaviruses),” they wrote in the piece published on Wednesday.Until that happens, the Sars-Cov-2 is “unlikely to be eliminated, let alone eradicated; it will probably continue to circulate indefinitely in periodic outbreaks and endemics”, they said.
17-12-2021||India||SC nod to bullock cart races in Maharashtra||The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the resumption of bullock cart racing in Maharashtra, which was banned by the Bombay high court in 2017, as it observed that the tradition sport is going on in other states across the country.A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar also observed that the validity of provisions of the state amendment in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the rules framed by Maharashtra, which re-introduced the bullock cart race in the state in a regulated manner, ought to operate during the pendency petitions as the entire matter had been referred to a Constitution bench.The law was stalled by the Bombay high court in October 2017 on the basis of a 2014 Supreme Court judgment which prohibited the use of bulls for any sport or race. “It does not appeal to common sense that all across the country, the bullock cart race is permitted but not in one state. This court had applied its mind to these laws while referring the matter to a Constitution bench….We are on a limited issue whether to stop the race across the country or permit it for Maharashtra as well,” the bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, said. The bench’s remarks came after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the state, pointed out that the sport was allowed in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu under similar laws passed by the respective state governments. These laws, Rohtagi said, were not stayed by the top court when separate petitions were filed against them in 2017. In 2018, the laws passed by the three states permitting bullock cart races were referred to a Constitution bench of five judges to ascertain whether they had overcome the 2014 top court judgement. The state’s plea to resume the sport was opposed by several NGOs and animal rights activists. Appearing for one such NGO, senior advocate Anand Grover said the 2014 top court judgment had held such races to be illegal and that state laws do not overcome the “unconstitutionality” imposed by that judgment. The court said that this aspect would be reviewed by the Constitution bench and allowed the parties to approach the chief justice of India (CJI) for urgent hearing of the matter listed before a larger bench.“Unless there are changed circumstances, we see no reason why similar treatment should not be extended to all states where the same dispensation applies with regard to the amended provisions of law,” the court noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-nod-to-bullock-cart-races-in-maharashtra-101639680713963.html
17-12-2021||India||India marks 50 years of 1971 victory||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday led the nation in paying tribute to the heroes of the 1971 India-Pakistan war and marking 50 years of victory in the third war with the neighbour that led to the liberation of Bangladesh and is globally recognised as a glorious and unforgettable chapter in India’s military history.Pakistan’s unconditional surrender involving 93,000 soldiers was the biggest in the world after the Second World War.A solemn ceremony was organised at the National War Memorial at India Gate to commemorate the golden jubilee of the war that gave India a new generation of heroes and forever altered the history and geography of south Asia. It also marked the culmination of the year-long Swarnim Vijay Varsh Celebrations of the spectacular victory achieved under the leadership of then PM Indira Gandhi and army chief General (later Field Marshal) Sam Manekshaw.“On this special day of Vijay Diwas, I had the honour of paying my respects at the National War Memorial and merging into the Eternal Flame, the four Vijay Mashaals which traversed across the length and breadth of the country over the course of last one year,” the PM wrote on Twitter.The ceremony was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari, navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar and other top military officials. Late chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, who was also scheduled to attend the event, was killed in a helicopter crash last week along with 13 others.As a part of the Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations to commemorate the war’s golden jubilee, the PM — exactly a year ago on December 16, 2020 — lit the Swarnim Vijay Mashaal from the eternal flame at the National War Memorial along with four flames that later travelled across the country.“Since then, these four flames have traversed across the length and breadth of the country, including to Siachen, Kanyakumari, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Longewala, Rann of Kutch, Agartala etc (before returning to Delhi). The flames were taken to key battle areas and also to the houses of gallantry award winners and veterans of the 1971 war,” the government said in a statement.Modi on Thursday merged the four flames with the eternal flame at the war memorial during the reception ceremony of the Swarnim Vijay Mashaals.Families of the 1971 war heroes appreciated the government’s gesture to celebrate the golden jubilee in a big way. Mukesh Khetarpal, the brother of one of India’s greatest war heroes 2/Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, said it was humbling to see that even after 50 years, the country still remembered the heroes, including Arun.Arun is among the only 21 Indian soldiers decorated with the Param Vir Ckakra (PVC), India’s highest wartime military honour, for their wartime heroism in independent India’s history.Arun was only 21, and commissioned in Poona Horse only six months before the war began, when he destroyed seven Pakistani Patton tanks in the Battle of Basantar fought exactly 50 years ago on December 16, 1971.Rajnath Singh recalled the courage and sacrifice of soldiers in the war. “On the occasion of Swarnim Vijay Diwas, we remember the courage and sacrifice of our armed forces during the 1971 war. The 1971 war is the golden chapter in India’s military history. We are proud of our armed forces and their achievements,” he said.Singh also unveiled a commemorative stamp marking the golden jubilee. December 16 is celebrated as Vijay Diwas every year to mark Pakistan’s surrender and India’s decisive victory. The 13-day war ended on December 16 with the creation of Bangladesh, and the Indian Army taking 93,000 Pakistanis as prisoners of war. “The 1971 war was commenced with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on a large number of IAF bases... Offensive action by the Indian armed forces led to the capture of Dhaka, surrender of around 93,000 Pakistani soldiers and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent Nation,” the defence ministry said in a statement.On December 12, the defence minister said the atrocities committed on the people of then East Pakistan were a threat to entire humanity and it was India’s responsibility to liberate them.He was referring to the barbarism carried out by the Pakistan army under Operation Searchlight, a crackdown to crush the voices of self-determination.He said that the 1971 war was among the most decisive wars in the world after the two World Wars. “This war tells us that the partition of India on the basis of religion was a historic mistake. Pakistan was born in the name of one religion but it could not remain one. After the defeat in 1971, it is continuously fighting a proxy war…We won in a direct war and the victory will be ours in indirect war as well,” he added.
17-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 17, 2002: Mumbai’s Taj Mahal turns 100||It was on this day a century ago, that Bombay’s Taj Mahal Hotel first opened its doors. It has since gone on to give its name to India’s largest hotel chain and has often appeared on lists of the world’s best hotels. And as it completes its centenary, it is probably the oldest luxury hotel in India to still be operational under the original owners. The Taj is, of course, Tata-owned and traditionally the profits that the Tatas make from the hotel have always gone to charity. The benevolence is not surprising considering that the hotel was never built for commercial reasons. According to legend, Sir Jamsetji Tata went to visit an English friend at the Yacht Club, then Bombay’s classiest place to stay. But the Club had a ‘whites only’ policy and Jamsetji, despite his knighthood, was barred from entering its premises. Furious, he vowed to build a hotel next to the club that would be so grand that nobody would even look at the Yacht Club again. And so, he built the Taj. These days the Yacht Club is a rather pale shadow of its former self while the Taj has grown to expand a new skyscraper wing. So Jamsetji did get his revenge. Unfortunately there is no official corroboration for this story but it is so delightful, that people believe it anyway.But then many legends surround the Taj. There is the false story that the hotel was designed by a French architect who sent his plans by post. The contractors got it wrong and built the hotel back to front. When the architect finally made it to India, the story goes; he was so heartbroken that he threw himself off the roof of the Taj to a tragic death. In fact the original plans for the Taj have been located and they show that it was designed by a Bombay firm. The Swadeshi spirit was maintained in the sign that the hotel placed outside its door (in response to apartheid) ‘No Dogs and South Africans allowed’. The Taj plans a year of celebrations. There will be parties, events, exhibitions and two books, one on the Taj and the other on the group. It promises a centenary to remember.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-17-2002-mumbai-s-taj-mahal-turns-100-101639680711843.html

The court listed the matter for December 20.As first reported by HT on November 12, the central agency sought prosecution sanction against Shukla upon completing its investigation. The government accorded the sanction in November last week, enabling the CBI to submit the charge sheet in court.Officials who didn’t want to be named said they presented “sufficient evidence” against Shukla and others in the final report (charge sheet).Shukla, who retired from service in July 2020, is accused of taking a bribe for passing an order that favoured the Lucknow-based medical college, which was disbarred in May 2017 from admitting students by the Medical Council of India (MCI), the country’s medical education regulator.He was under investigation for criminal conspiracy, sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act which deal with accepting bribes, and criminal misconduct along with retired Orissa high court judge IM Quddusi, Bhagwan Prasad Yadav, and Palash Yadav of Prasad Education Trust, an intermediary, Bhawana Pandey and another alleged middleman Sudhir Giri. In all, two first information reports (FIRs) were filed in the Prasad Education Trust matter – first in September 2017 naming Quddusi and the middlemen and another in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-charge-sheet-on-retired-allahabad-hc-judge-in-graft-case-101639680659515.html

When I talk about nature’s laboratory, it is completely science-based. Today, the more modern the world is becoming, the more it is moving towards ‘back to basic’. It means connecting with your roots. We not only need to re-learn the ancient knowledge of agriculture, but also need to sharpen it for modern times. In this direction, we have to do fresh research and mould ancient knowledge into the modern scientific frame,” the prime minister said. Modi also recalled that at the climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow last month, he had called upon the world to make “Lifestyle for Environment” i.e. LIFE a global mission. India and its farmers are going to lead in this regard in the 21st century, the PM said.“There is no doubt that fertilisers led to green revolution. But this is also true that we have to keep working on alternatives. The main reason for this is we have to import fertilisers for other countries, which increases the cost of farming. Hence, there is a need to be aware (about natural farming),” Modi said.He also urged the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and other institutions as well as agricultural universities to adopt the concept of ‘Lab to Land’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-take-agriculture-out-of-lab-and-link-it-with-nature-pmmodi-101639680655836.html

Several MPs had also made such complaints. Many incidents of deaths due to lack of oxygen had come to light. Is there any information with the government about these deaths in the entire state? Did the government not see the bodies floating in the Ganga and people suffering due to lack of oxygen?” he asked..Rejecting the government’s claims, Samajwadi Party MLC and state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “Barring the government, all know the truth behind Covid deaths.

17-12-2021||India||Government drops four clauses from draft electricity bill||New Delhi: The Union government has dropped at least four major clauses from the draft Electricity (amendment) Bill, 2021 after receiving objections from various stakeholders, including the farmers, state-owned distribution companies and power utility staff associations, according to senior officials in the power ministry. The Centre has dropped the clause of direct benefit transfer (DBT) on power subsidies from the proposed bill besides dropping the provision of creating a new “Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority” that was supposed to adjudicate on contracts, senior ministry officials told HT, on condition of anonymity. These changes will soon be tabled before the Union Cabinet for approval, they said.The introduction of the DBT system for power subsidies in the draft bill could have most adversely impacted the end-consumers, who would have had to pay the unsubsidised bill to discoms (state government-owned power distribution companies) first and the state governments were then required to pay subsidies directly to the consumers. This clause saw a lot of criticism from the farmers. At present, states provide a number of subsidies to consumers, almost all of which fall in the agricultural and below poverty line (BPL) segments. Under the existing system, the end consumer does not have to pay for the subsidy amount, which is borne by the state governments. The bill, senior officials told HT, is unlikely to the tabled in the ongoing session of Parliament. This is because according to the agreement between Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), one of the key farmer unions that protested against the now repealed farm laws for over a year, and the Centre, the government will now discuss the Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2021 with farmers before it is tabled in Parliament. Power ministry officials also clarified that all existing power distribution companies will continue to operate as usual even after the bill becomes an Act. “The existing distribution companies shall continue to operate as they are at present. No change has been proposed in the structure of the existing distribution company. Similar to delicensing of electricity generation, it is proposed to delicense electricity distribution to reduce entry barriers to this segment of the power sector. Delicensing the sector will enable multiple distribution companies to operate in the same area of supply leading to competition and choice to the consumers. There will be requirement of only registration with the appropriate commission,” a senior power ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The clarification assumes significance as the Bill has been opposed by states that own distribution companies, including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 12 last year, expressing outrage over the draft Bill, which, she said, was an attempt by the Centre to “destroy” the country’s federal structure. The Bill has also witnessed protests by power employees and engineers across the country under the banner of the National Coordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers (NCCOEEE). Explaining the need for the electricity amendment bill, Union power minister RK Singh on December 9 told Parliament that the condition of most state government-owned power distribution companies (discoms) was of “grave concern” as the combined revenue losses of all discoms in the country had climbed up to ₹5,07,416 crore. “Discoms have not been able to pay the generation companies for the power procured, and the outstanding payments to generation companies are estimated to be in excess of ₹156,000 crore. The outstanding dues to renewable generators are around 11 months of revenues,” the power minister said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. A second senior power ministry official said the concept of distribution sub-licensee has also been dropped. “It is also clarified that the power of appointment to the SERCs will remain with the State Government as per the existing Act. Dispute resolution with respect to contracts etc will remain with the Appropriate Commissions. The Single Selection Committee for appointment of Chairman and Members of SERCs and CERC has also been dropped. The selection process will continue as per the present provisions in the Act,” the official said. “Their (state government-owned discoms) AT&C losses at the end of 2019-20 range from an average of 21% to a maximum of 60.16 %. The gap between average cost of supply (ACS) and average revenue realised (ARR), excluding regulatory assets and Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) grants, averages 60 paise per unit in 2019-20 and the accumulated losses of all discoms in the country by 2019-20 have risen to ₹507,416 crore,” Singh added. The bill seeks to enable the entry of private firms in distribution, thereby bringing in the benefits of competition. This is currently practiced only in cities such as Ahmedabad, New Delhi and Mumbai. It also intends to allow consumers to have the option of choosing the service provider and switch their power supplier as in the industry. This option of choosing the power supplier, however, is not available even in the three cities mentioned above. 
17-12-2021||India||Judge who gave skin-to-skin ruling not confirmed by SC collegium||The Supreme Court collegium has decided against making Bombay high court judge, justice Pushpa Ganediwala, who delivered controversial rulings last year on “skin-to-skin contact” in the sexual assault of a minor, as a permanent judge in the high court, sparking uncertainty over her future.People familiar with the development told HT that though justice Ganediwala’s name was considered by the collegium in its meeting on Wednesday, there were strong objections by some senior justices against promoting her as a permanent judge.Even as the collegium, in the same meeting, made recommendations for making three other additional judges as permanent judges in the Bombay high court, justice Ganediwala’s name could not find favour with the collegium, the people cited above said. This is the second time this year that she has failed to make the cut for permanent judgeship in the high court.Justice Ganediwala, 52, is currently posted at the Nagpur bench of the high court. Her term as an additional judge ends on February 12 next year, and if the collegium, headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, decides not to make her a permanent judge or extend her term as an additional judge yet again, she will be reverted to being a district judge again in Maharashtra. She can continue as a district judge, if she so chooses, till the age of 60.Besides the CJI, justices Uday U Lalit and AM Khanwilkar are part of the three-member collegium that takes decisions related to appointments, transfer and posting of high court judges.Under the constitutional provisions, an additional judge can be appointed for a maximum of two years, unlike permanent judges, who are appointed till the age of 62. Further, an additional judge can either be made permanent following a recommendation by the collegium to the central government, or the tenure can be extended for up to two years at one go, pending review of the judge’s performance.Justice Ganediwala, who was initially appointed in February 2019, courted controversies after a series of her judgments in January 2020 on the interpretation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act came under severe criticism.In the first ruling, she held that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not a case of sexual assault but only of molestation, since there was no “skin to skin” contact. In another judgment, the judge ruled that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault”. Both these judgments were recently overruled by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court.Former CJI KG Balakrishnan told HT: “An additional judge is made permanent after a complete assessment of his or her work. There are various factors that are taken into account before the chief justice takes a decision... Assessment of judgments authored by a judge is just one part of such assessment.”

The minister who killed farmers should resign and should be punished.”As Gandhi continued to press for Mishra’s resignation amid the din, Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi objected. “The members of the Congress party are in the Well but he (Gandhi) want to speak and ask questions. This can’t happen that they will stay in the Well and yet they will talk,” the minister said.Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra, is facing attempt to murder charges for allegedly mowing down four farmers and a journalist in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, when eight people died. On Tuesday, an Uttar Pradesh court added stringent charges to the police complaints against Ashish Mishra and 12 other accused. after a special investigation team (SIT) said the violence was “deliberate, pre-planned conspiracy”. This touched off protests by Opposition parties who demanded that Ajay Mishra should resign for an impartial probe, and stalled Parliament on Wednesday.On Thursday, both Houses started on a sombre note with Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla paying tribute to 1971 war heroes and group captain Varun Singh, the only man to have survived the December 8 Mi-17V5 chopper crash that killed 13 people including chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, who breathed his last on Wednesday. But disruptions soon took over and many Opposition leaders rushed to the Well and others demanded a debate on the SIT report. Amid chaos in both Houses, the Lok Sabha couldn’t take up the discussion on the Appropriation Bill for supplementary demand for grants and two debates on price rise and climate change were again derailed. But minutes before the adjournment, The Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill was introduced in the Lower House of Parliament.The Upper House failed to take up the all-important discussion on the Omicron variant and the bill to amend the narcotics act didn’t go through. Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh managed to start the debate on Omicron variant and pointed out to the Opposition that it demanded a debate on two issues—price rise and Omicron—and both were accepted.

17-12-2021||Today's||To bring about real change, put money in people’s pockets||Three years for any government is the time for taking stock and introspection. It is the time when you not only evaluate your performance against your avowed goals, but also put your goals and values to question against the people’s reception of them, the changing socio-economic conditions, the emerging best practices, and emerging challenges.As the Chhattisgarh government completes three years, we can say with confidence that our leaders’ vision along with the Indian National Congress’s valuable legacy have led us well and our performance has strengthened the faith of the people of Chhattisgarh and the millions of Congressmen across the country.When the people of Chhattisgarh displayed exceptional political wisdom and political foresight, and got rid of 15 years of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) misrule, they were clear that they wished for a fundamental change in governance and policies, which is more people-centric, in sync and in continuous communication with their lived realities. The assured price of ₹2,500 per quintal for paddy, and the blanket farm loan waiver, cemented their faith and made trust-based communication possible. Our commitment to restoring land and forest rights to our forest-dwelling people is unequivocal and we have distributed 3.63 lakh hectares of land as individual forest rights along with more than 45,000 community rights which cover 18.95 lakh hectares of forest land. We have also given community forest resource rights in 13.75 lakh hectares of forest land in 3,113 cases.Our primary concern was to restore the autonomy and agency of our villages and forests which was constrained by the unholy alliance of totalitarian political ideology, along with a predatory market and aided by insentient technology. For this, we needed to revalue their produce and assets, as well as restore their rights over their commons. “Narwa, Garwa Ghurwa Bari” was the articulation of this sentiment. Through the Godhan Nyay Yojana, we have tried to improvise the idea of resource and economic goods and started state procurement of cow dung at ₹2 per kg, and the gains have been across multiple dimensions. People started valuing their ageing cattle, which led to a reduction in stray cattle, and farmers heaving a sigh of relief. It has propelled Chhattisgarh to the cleanest state, as was recognised by the Centre recently. Our village gothans have ushered in innovative and entrepreneurial spirit and culture in the villages, and more so among the women. While their diyas from gobar (dung) became a national rage, they went on to chappals and are now producing carboxymethyl cellulose and organic paint out of the same gobar. This year they have earned ₹45 crore from the sale of this organic paint.Health and education are the biggest bridges that our people need, to come at par and engage with the larger world, and it needs to start with nutrition. The Mukhyamantri Suposhan Yojana has reduced low birth weight by almost 15% and malnutrition by 19% in these two years, and served us well in the pandemic. Increasing health coverage through the Mukhyamantri Vishesh Swasthya Yojana to ₹20 lakh, and targeted health delivery through haat bazaar clinic and dai-didi clinics schemes are a result of this very continuous communication and a political consciousness sharing lived realities of the people.The Swami Atmananda English Medium Schools are reducing the existing language barriers for children, and 172 such schools have already been commissioned so far. We have launched a drive to help our village youth develop leadership and communitarian spirit and have started to set up a Rajiv Gandhi Mitaan Club in each of our gram panchayats. Giving agriculture status to fisheries and pisciculture is also a step in the same direction. We aim to establish food, agro and forest produce processing parks in each of our 146 blocks and have identified land in 110 of them; 478 processing units have already been set up in these three years with investments of ₹1,167 crore.We have extended government employment to more than 400,00 youth, and have been the best performer in delivering Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme jobs and more than four million families benefited from it.Our leader Rahul Gandhi had given me one key idea, “put money in common people’s pocket” and this very idea has become the central theme for the revival of Chhattisgarh. We are the poorest state of the country, but I am sure this formula will change everything in the coming years. We are committed to reshaping Chhattisgarh.Bhupesh Baghel is the chief minister of ChhattisgarhThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-bring-about-real-change-put-money-in-people-s-pockets-101639759738419.html
