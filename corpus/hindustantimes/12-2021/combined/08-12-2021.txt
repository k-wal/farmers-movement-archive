The city’s average air quality index (AQI) at 4pm on Wednesday was 185, according to the Central Pollution Control Board, an improvement from Tuesday’s reading of 248. The city had last witnessed ‘moderate’ air quality on October 28 with an AQI of 182. Experts said that the improvement in air quality was due to increased wind speed and cyclonic depression over the Bay of Bengal. Neighbouring Faridabad district also recorded ‘moderate’ air quality on Wednesday, while air quality in Delhi was in the ‘poor’ zone. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. “Due to a depression over Bay of Bengal, the entire passage got cleared where air along with pollutants was getting stuck in lower atmospheric zones. The western disturbance over the Himalayan region also helped. With clear sky, the lower atmospheric air got warm, which helped the pollutants rise and with higher mixing depth, the air quality improved,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert. However, the relief is likely to be short, as according to the weather bulletin issued on Wednesday by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality is likely to remain in ‘poor’ category till Monday and deteriorate marginally on December 14. On Thursday, the predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed of 4kmph with mainly clear sky and shallow to moderate fog in the morning, the bulletin said, adding that the wind speed is likely to increase to 6-8kmph on Friday. Meanwhile, Gurugram on Wednesday recorded a maximum temperature of 24.7°C, which was one degree above normal, and minimum temperature of 10°C, which was three degrees above normal, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre Chandigarh, a regional centre of IMD, said, “As per predictions, the minimum temperature is likely to drop by 2-3 degrees in the plain areas over the next three days, but we are still recording temperatures higher than normal. A cold wave situation is likely to happen only when temperatures fall, while moderate to shallow fog is likely at isolated places in the state. Due to the drop in temperature, air quality is also likely to get affected.” According to the weekly forecast of IMD, Gurugram is likely to witness generally cloudy sky on Sunday, which IMD officials said is an impact of light western disturbance, but rain is not predicted. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (north Gurugram) of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board did not respond to calls for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-air-enters-moderate-zone-for-first-time-in-41-days-101638988042855.html

The party has finalised candidates on 100 assembly seats. Of them, 60 are women and 40 are male candidates.” The women manifesto was not drafted in a room but the members of the manifesto committee under the chairmanship of senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid visited several districts and held talks with various groups before drafting the manifesto, she said. “A help line will also be set up at the state level as well as in the districts to assist the victims of domestic violence, sexual exploitation and destitute. Hostels will be constructed for the working women in 25 cities of UP, assistance in the employment will be given to them who were affected due to Covid-19, besides the ASHA and Aganbadi workers will get monthly remuneration of ₹10,000 each month,” she claimed.

08-12-2021||Lucknow||About 20K BTech seats vacant in colleges affiliated to AKTU in UP||About 20,000 B Tech seats remained unoccupied in the engineering colleges affiliated to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University this year. Against a total of 1,09,000 seats, 89,616 candidates took admission and 19,384 seats left unoccupied.“There are multiple reasons for such large number of vacant B Tech seats. Poor faculty and poor placement of students. Barring government colleges and a few private institutions in NCR region, colleges hire substandard and under qualified teachers on nominal salary. Hence the quality of B Tech education has suffered a major blow, an official said who do not wish to be named.The University, however, claims that the admission percentage in session 2021-22 has increased as compared to 2020-21. This time, a total of 89,616 students have taken admission in undergraduate level courses till the last date of admission till November 30. And there are about 1,09,000 seats in undergraduate level courses in about 763 affiliated institutes of the university, said AKTU vice chancellor, Prof Vineet Kansal.Last year, there were 1,38,000 seats and 75,684 students took admission, which was 55% of the total seats. This year 82% seats were occupied, said university official.There are two ways to get admission to the university. One is through counseling and other is through direct admission. This time 19,057 students took admission through counseling and 70559 students took direct admission.This time the attitude of the students towards the affiliated institutions of the university has been positive. Over the years, facilities like centralized placement and innovation have been provided by the university to the students, which has changed the attitude of the students, said AKTU vice chancellor.To ensure quality technical education, a campaign for NBA accreditation has been run by the university. As a result of this, 74 branches of 33 affiliated institutions have got accreditation, said AKTU spokesperson, Ashish Mishra.To improve students’ strength, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) has now started the exercise to facilitate all its engineering and management colleges to apply for the Ministry of Education’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings.AKTU vice chancellor Prof Vineet Kansal has also issued a letter and instructions to the affiliated institutions to participate in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) as it will help institutions to understand about their shortcomings and work on those areas so they may improve on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/about-20k-btech-seats-vacant-in-colleges-affiliated-to-aktu-in-up-101638986902694.html
08-12-2021||Pune||FMAI oppose new rules imposed on students going abroad for medical education||PUNE In a bid to oppose rules set up by the National Medical Commission (NMC) for students who want to pursue medical education abroad, the Foreign Medical Association of India (FMAI) held a press conference in Pune on Tuesday. Due to these NMC regulations, children from middle-class families will not be able to become doctors, FMAI members claimed. “We are protesting and the NMC should immediately reverse this decision. This rule is likely to be a major obstacle. It’s a kind a conspiracy with their future,” said Dr Sudarshan Gherde, president of the FMAI. He further said, “The new rules will affect around 10,000 students seeking medical education abroad every year. It is a conspiracy to prevent ordinary students from becoming doctors. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is one of the world’s leading institutions for medical education abroad. The NMC should not impose such oppressive rules on world-class education.” “Another issue is that if the NMC Act 2019 was passed on December 30, 2019, then how is it possible to issue a notification on November 18 this year? While NMC will be conducting ‘Next One’ and ‘Next Two’ examinations for students studying abroad, the question is, why insist on 54 -month course and medium of language as English. The NMC should answer whether a doctor with 54 months of medical education will be good and a doctor with 48 months of education will be uneducated. The NMC should regulate medical education in India and control unregulated donations. However, the right of students to get cheap medical education abroad should not be taken away,” said Dr Gherde. Box Rules for obtaining a permanent doctor’s licence in India after studying abroad have changed 1) Half in India and half outside India; or half in Russia, such a degree will not be accepted in the Philippines 2) Medical degree abroad should be for 54 months. 3) Twelve months internship should be done from the same foreign university from which you have learned. 4) Medical degree abroad should be in English medium. 5) If the university you are attending in a foreign medical university is WHO- approved, then you will need permission from MCI / NMC and Government of India. 6) All subjects mentioned in Schedule One should be in foreign medical university. 7) Twelve-month internship is required after coming to India 8) All government, private and deemed university and college students studying abroad, and in India, will have to take a board exam called National Exit Exam (NEXT) to get a licence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fmai-oppose-new-rules-imposed-on-students-going-abroad-for-medical-education-101638986667111.html

Both of the injured are undergoing treatment at Sassoon hospital. Sunil Tonpe, senior police inspector, Sangvi police station, said, “Ramesh Manaram and Kumar Dilip Sukaram were illegally filling gas a commercial cylinder with gas from a domestic cylinder. Due to a gas leak, an explosion occurred.” The blast was so intense that the windows of the house were shattered and the walls on one side were smashed. The door of the house also flew off. “A case will be registered against the accused. If the tenant is not registered with the police station, a case will be registered against the landlord,” added Tonpe. Due to the very small lane, fire brigade personnel faced a lot of trouble. The vehicle was stopped 700 metres away and two firemen reached the spot on two-wheelers then. “We are also looking at the illegal gas filling angle. If the practice continues then major action will be taken against the landlord,” added Tonpe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-injured-in-gas-cylinder-explosion-in-pune-101638986489024.html

An important change made by the Railways is that autorickshaws are now allowed inside a section close to the foot overbridge (FOB) just outside this entrance, allowing passengers easier access to the station. On Tuesday, senior railway officials inspected the entry gate. “As train operations have started and we are looking at the increasing number of passengers, this second entrance to the Pune railway station is an important one. Our railway officials checked passenger-related amenities. Accordingly, autos which were earlier waiting outside on the road are now been allowed to stand in the circle-road area nearby the FOB. This will help passengers arriving to carry luggage and easily get an auto from the FOB,” said Manoj Jhawar, spokesperson, Pune railway division. The main entry gate on this side of the station also has an internal road full of potholes and the public toilets built here are currently closed. “While the public toilets here will be opened once the tender is given. Also, the potholes on this road were checked and the repairing will be carried out soon,” added Jhawar. After the statewide lockdown was eased and restrictions were normalised, daily train operations from the Pune railway station increased gradually. Daily, at least 100 train operations are carried out from the station with a passenger footfall of over 30,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/autos-allowed-public-toilets-to-open-at-pune-railway-station-101638986307679.html
08-12-2021||Pune||New research says early intervention important for premature infants in neonatal ICU||PUNE Parents with preterm babies who are at risk of intelligence and physical disability should seek intervention as early as three months, revealed a recently published study. The research conducted on 245 high risk preterm babies and 245 normal babies from Maharashtra by an Ahmednagar-based pediatrician, Dr Suchit Tamboli revealed that early intervention can improve motor skills and intelligent quotient of the child. The paper ‘Predictive Value of Developmental Quotient at Three Months in Determination of Neurodevelopmental Outcomes at One Year in High-Risk Neonates’, was recently published in the international journal Medica for clinical medicine. It was found that a significant reduction in mental developmental delay was observed in both high risk newborn babies by 35.1 per cent and low-risk groups by 35.1 per cent by early intervention. Likewise, motor development delay has also significantly decreased in both groups by 32.9 per cent and 41.9 per cent respectively, as per the study due to early intervention. Speaking about the research, Dr Tamboli, shared that during the study, high-risk, low-risk and healthy babies were included in the sample of 490 children. “After 12 months of monitoring the child and using intervention through the children’s mothers, it was seen that the number of children with mild mental disability quotient were reduced significantly. In newborns with severe symptoms, the number was again reduced,” said Dr Tamboli. He further added that Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar level at birth can also cause scholastic backwardness among kids. “If the blood sugar level at birth is less than 50, children can develop scholastic backwardness at school. Hence blood sugar of the child should immediately be checked and corrected if needed,” he added. Speaking about physical disability among newborns, 8.2 per cent of newborns with severe symptoms were reduced to zero per cent in 12 months. “Preterm infants discharged from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) were a high-risk group of neurodevelop-mental disablement that can exhibit improvement by early intervention. High-risk babies need developmental assessment and regular follow up. Indian standardised stimulation programs given since birth, considering mother as therapist improves the developmental outcome of high-risk newborns,” said Dr Tamboli. Dr Ram Dhongade who works with Sant Dnyaneshwar Medical Education Research Centre at Pune and researcher with this study said that for neurodevelopment of high-risk infants, occupational therapy should be carried out. “There should be physical movement and occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy for the child till the development of the child is complete,” he said.

08-12-2021||Pune||100% vaxxed with first jab in Pune||PUNE Almost 11 months after the city saw its first vaccine shot being administered, the district’s entire eligible population, as per an estimation based on the 2019 voters’ list, has received a first shot of the vaccine under its Covid-19 inoculation drive. As per the population estimation for 2021, Pune district has a population of at least 11.35 million, of which 8.34 million are eligible to get the vaccine shot as they are above the age of 18. Of the 8.34 million, 3.36 million have got their first shot of the vaccine as of December 8, which exceeds the 100% mark, according to the Central government’s CoWin dashboard. Officials said this may include people from neighbouring districts who took the vaccine in Pune during the initial period, when registrations were mostly online and doses were in short supply. They may have replaced numbers for those from the hilly areas of Pune district who have not yet received their first shot. With this, Pune district becomes the second in the state after Mumbai to ensure 100% vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries with at least one shot of the vaccine. Mumbai achieved the feat on November 13 when the eligible adult population of 9,236,546 got their first shot. Pune, however, also has the highest number of beneficiaries due for their second shot of the vaccine. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) chief health officer Dr Suryakant Devkar said, “Pune city has vaccinated more than 100% of its estimated eligible population almost 20 days ago, but we kept all our Covid19 vaccination centres running in full swing as we kept getting beneficiaries coming in who may be coming in from rural areas or from the neighbouring districts as well.” Although the records may state that everyone in Pune district is vaccinated for first dose does not necessarily mean every eligible adult has been inoculated as some voters registered in Pune may have returned to their native places during restrictions. At the same time, those not registered in Pune but living here may also have got their jab. A senior officer at the Zilla Parishad pointed out that the target for vaccination in Mumbai was 9,200,000, 400,000 less than the number of voters. Mumbai has vaccinated 9,600,000 persons, roughly equal to the number of voters in 2019. On the other hand, Pune district had 7,600,086 lakh voters in 2019 and a target of 8,300,000. “We have vaccinated 600,000 people more than the number of voters in 2019. Nearly 500,000 people are those who live in Mumbai, but are registered as voters in Pune’s villages, especially in hilly regions such as in Maval and Khed, as per reverse migration data during lockdown. Now the challenge for us is to find those beneficiaries,” said the officer, requesting anonymity. While Pune is a major vaccine manufacturing centre considering that Serum Institute of India (SII) is producing Covishield doses here, the district also has the highest number of people who refuse to take the second dose. As of December 4, Pune district has over 1.22 million people who took the first dose almost 84 days ago but have not turned up at the vaccination centres to be fully vaccinated. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh did hint at stern steps like a mandatory double vaccination certificate to avail some facilities to ensure that people take both the shots which is essential. “There is no question of vaccine shortage as of now. But people are still not turning up in large numbers at the vaccination centres to take their second dose. The state government has suggested that we start call centre services and call up all those people who are registered when they took their first dose and follow up on them for the second dose. There could be issues with data updation as well. However we have also launched a door to door vaccination scheme to provide easier access to vaccination,” said Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/100-vaxxed-with-first-jab-in-pune-101638984626420.html

Health professionals across the globe are already engaged in controlling this on-going crisis. The Home Insect Control Association (Hica), a non-profit industry body promoting safe use of household insecticides in India, has urged people to stop buying or selling mosquito repellent incense sticks (agarbattis) in the state, as a majority of them are illegal and do not have necessary certification/licences. As per recent government data, 116,991 cases of dengue have been reported across the country in the last one month. States like Maharashtra, Haryana, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and New Delhi have seen a sharp increase in the cases. Jayant Deshpande, honorary secretary, Hica, said, “At a time when respiratory issues are occurring frequently, we strongly urge people to stop or avoid using mosquito repellent incense sticks. Most of them available in the market are illegal and have potential to damage consumer health.” According to people in the industry, these sticks are sold cheap and have a visible drop-down impact on mosquitoes, yet are illegally made and sold without proper licenses and permissions from the relevant government departments. Illegal and spurious incense sticks/agarbattis available in the market are laced with unapproved harmful chemicals (insecticides/ pesticides). This can cause health issues such as asthma, bronchitis, reactive airways disease and other respiratory ailments. Basic checks on safety parameters which is mandatory for all home insecticide products are not carried out by these manufacturers producing the illegal agarbattis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hica-urges-to-not-use-illegal-mosquito-repellent-incense-sticks-to-reduce-health-risk-101638984502468.html

AAP spokesperson Abhijit More claimed that 25per cent of junior engineers recruited having engineering diplomas most of which are allegedly fake; also, a maximum number of junior engineers are from Rajasthan. PMC’s vigilance officer Rajendra Muthe said, “We will conduct an inquiry and inspect all the documents. If found guilty, the administration will take necessary action. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol has instructed the inquiry.” Mohol said, “I asked the administration to conduct an inquiry. If it is found that any candidate does not having the educational qualifications, action will be taken.” PMC recruited junior engineers recently and published a list of candidates that had qualified. AAP members alleged that many of the candidates who were selected for the post of junior engineer were directly related to either the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). AAP’s More said, “The PMC had published a list of qualifying employees, but 18 candidates have done their diploma from the JRN university in Rajasthan. The question is, when did the candidates get the time to attend a full-time course if they were PMC employees. There are no records of any study leave.” “When Prakash Jawadekar was human resource minister, he had cancelled all the degrees and diplomas from JRN college on December 18, 2017.

08-12-2021||Patna||Jharkhand: Cong appoints turncoat MLA Pradeep Yadav as deputy leader of CLP in assembly||The central leadership of the Congress on Wednesday appointed senior legislator Pradeep Yadav, who joined the grand old party after splitting from JVM (P) after the 2019 assembly polls, as deputy leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) in Jharkhand assembly. Confirming the development, Jharkhand Congress chief Rajesh Thakur said, “Pradeep Yadav is a senior politician, a five-term legislator and a former minister. The party has appointed him as deputy to the legislature party leader Alamgir Alam.”A former minister and member of Lok Sabha, Yadav represents Poraiyahat in Godda district in Santhal Pargana division, had joined Congress after the 2019 assembly elections along with other senior legislator Bandhu Tirkey, after JVM (P) was merged by its leader Babulal Marandi with his former party BJP. Marandi had suspended both Yadav and Tirkey from the party before merging with BJP. Yadav and Tirkey had then claimed that they represented the real JVM (P) and they joined Congress. While the merger of JVM (P) was ratified by the Election Commission of India(ECI), both sides are facing charges under anti-defection law in the court of assembly Speaker. However, the Congress leadership has been promoting both the turncoats in the organic ideational set up. Before Yadav’s elevation, Tirkey was made the working president of Jharkhand Congress, raising eyebrows among a section within the party.The BJP described the appointment as ‘double standards’ of the ruling Congress. “The ruling dispensation has problem in recognising leader of opposition status for our legislature party leader Babulal Marandi, but the Congress has no issues appointing Pradeep Yadav, who was labelled an unattached MLA by the Election Commission, as their deputy leader in the assembly. This shows their double standards in public life,” said Jharkhand spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jharkhand-cong-appoints-turncoat-mla-pradeep-yadav-as-deputy-leader-of-clp-in-assembly-101638982702487.html

08-12-2021||Mumbai||Politicians’ kin vie for plum positions in Indian Youth Congress polls||They were launched over a decade ago as an ambitious exercise to bring in much-needed internal democracy in the organisation and give a leg-up to young blood in the ranks. However, the internal elections to the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) in Maharashtra have yet again seen the dominance of dynastic politics, with the kin of established leaders vying for organisational positions. Kunal Raut, the son of state energy minister Nitin Raut, is contesting for the position of president, and so is Sharan Patil, the son of former minister and incumbent Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) working president Basavraj Patil. Also in the contest is Aniket, the son of former Navi Mumbai deputy mayor Ramakant Mhatre. Mhatre is a supporter of public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan and minister of state Vishwajeet Kadam. Shivani, daughter of minister Vijay Wadettiwar and Abhijit Chavan, grandson of former minister Madhukarrao Chavan; are in contention for the general secretary’s post. The election process - which includes nominations, enrollment of voters, and polling - was launched on November 12 and will be completed on December 12. This is being done through an online, app-based system. So far, over 1.4 million voters have been enrolled. In a break from convention - where the party leadership nominated office-bearers of the IYC and National Students Union of India (NSUI) - the Congress in 2008 launched internal elections at the behest of senior leader Rahul Gandhi. Since 2011, the internal elections in Maharashtra have seen Vishwajeet Kadam, the son of former minister (late) Patangrao Kadam, being elected as president for two successive three-year terms. While Satyajit Tambe, the nephew of revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, is the present IYC Maharashtra president. He defeated Amit, the son of former minister Subhash Zanak, and Kunal Raut. Zanak, an MLA from Risod, and Kunal were appointed as vice-presidents. These polls saw allegations of rigging. Other nominees in the fray have alleged that established leaders are using the machinery and resources at their disposal. “The elections were launched to ensure that youngsters from common families can enter politics. However, the motive has been hijacked by the kin of politicians who are at times misusing the official machinery to enroll voters from educational institutions and exercise their franchise in bulk,” said an aspiring candidate. However, Sharan, the leader of the opposition in the Osmanabad zilla parishad (ZP) and district Youth Congress chief, said that he is committed to strengthening the organisation and promoting fresh blood. “We are elected because the people support us… (however) the organisation also includes youth who lack a political background, but are doing good work,” he said, when asked about the charges of dynastic politics. Meanwhile, Kunal Banerjee, who is the election commissioner for these polls, said that he has not received any formal complaints about such malpractices thus far. He added that the results of the polls are likely to be announced early next year. The three candidates garnering the highest number of votes for the position of president will be interviewed by the IYC leadership and one of them will be selected as the president, with the other two being appointed vice-presidents. So far, three politicians from Maharashtra have helmed the IYC nationally, namely, Gurudas Kamat (1987 to 1988), Mukul Wasnik (1988 to 1990), and Rajiv Satav (2010 to 2014).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/politicians-kin-vie-for-plum-positions-in-indian-youth-congress-polls-101638982102742.html

The investigation will also focus on providing help to the workers currently in hospital,” said Manvendr Singh, district magistrate, Bareilly. Four other workers, who entered the tank, have also been hospitalised, and their condition remains critical. According to district administration officials, the accident occurred while cleaning a tank of the effluent treatment plant located inside the refinery situated in the CB Ganj area of Bareilly. “Prima facie, it appears that the laid down procedures for cleaning the tank were not followed. This resulted in the accident. We got the area checked by experts, and there is no danger of more poisonous emissions,” said the DM. Three workers, including Vijay Pal, Neeraj Yadav and Yasin Khan, all in their twenties, were killed in the accident. The trio was first to enter the tank. Meanwhile, the management of the factory has assured district officials of providing assistance for medical care to those injured. The factory management is also in talks with the families of the deceased workers to finalise the amount of compensation.

08-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Omicron tally stands at 10||Mumbai For the second straight day, Maharashtra did not report any Omicron cases on Wednesday. So far, the state has 10 reported Omicron cases, which are from Mumbai, Pune and Thane districts. As the state government awaits results of the 52 suspected Omicron samples, the state government is going to discuss key issues, including booster dose, vaccination of those below 18 years, and stricter guidelines on air travel, with union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday preparing to tackle the imminent increase in cases. Health minister Rajesh Tope will participate in the video conference with the union health minister and health ministers of all the states and Union Territories on Thursday morning. Tope said that the government is going to seek approval for the booster dose for the healthcare workers and frontline workers, and also demand vaccination for children between 12 and 18 years, as the schools and colleges in the state have largely resumed physical classes.The minister further said that as the new variant of concern has spread in 54 countries, they would seek guidelines from the Centre on air travel. “Mumbai is an international financial hub and in the meeting, it would be discussed that since it has spread in 54 countries, then what should be done about flights. We are awaiting their guidelines on this,” he said, and further added, “We have never sought a ban on flights, nor do we intend to make any such request.”Tope further said that the state will follow strict screening at the airports in Maharashtra to contain the spread of Omicron, especially from the passengers that arrive from at-risk countries. “Tighter screening is the strategy for us. We are strictly following testing, tracing and tracking. In terms of surveillance, we are tracing and tracking high-risk contacts and low-risk contacts,” he said. Meanwhile, Tope added that the state government will decide to lower the rates of RT-PCR tests at the airports. He said the revised fares would be brought down from ₹5000 to around ₹2000- ₹3000.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday directed officials to boost the vaccination across the state. Tope said that all guardian ministers have been directed to push the second dose in their district as well as carry out initiatives to get people to get the first dose. Ahead of the meeting with the union health minister on Thursday, chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty held a meeting with all district collectors and divisional commissioners over the handling of Omicron as well as preparations on health infrastructure. The health minister reiterated that there is no need for any immediate curbs in the state as the number of cases is low. “We are not thinking about any curbs at this point. There is no need so far as the number of cases is 10 now. We are focusing on vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. Tope also said that the schools must continue to operate as planned. “There is no need to shut schools as of now. The health department, education department, and paediatric task force have given a go-ahead for schools to reopen. Definitely, children are infected by Omicron [in other countries], so, Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed. If the Centre gives a go-ahead for booster and vaccination for children, we will give preference to that as well,” he said.As per the data of the health department, 46,590 passengers, including 7,930 from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, have arrived at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports from December 1. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Maharashtra added 893 fresh Covid cases, taking the tally to 6,640,888. Maharashtra also reported 10 fatalities, pushing the death toll to 141,204.

Life is no more the same. God knows how things would be managed with scant vision left in the other eye.” “We definitely pin our all hope on CM Nitish Kumar. If my words are reaching the leaders in the corridor of power, our CM sir must extend all possible help and ensure safe cataract surgeries are conducted in the future,” said Devi, a mother of six children including four girls.However, Harendra Razak, a resident of Phulwariya in Vaishali district is shuddered at the thought of cataract surgery on his other eye. “Never in my life again. Let death bring succour for me. The only expectation from the chief minister is to provide us some help so that we could keep our heart and soul together,” said Razak, exuding the common refrain of the victims. As many as 12 out of 17 people, - whose eyes had to be removed owing to panophthalmitis (severe eye infection) after they along with others underwent a cataract surgery at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital on November 22, are undergoing treatment at SMKCH. When contacted, Dr. Babu Saheb Jha, superintendent of SKMCH stated the condition of the patients are stable. “None of the 12 patients undergoing treatment has been discharged yet. They are responding well to treatment,” said Jha.Besides the patients in SKMCH, woes of those undergoing treatment at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) are no less either. Living in penury at the fag end of his life, 90-year-old Md. Sagir Ahmad, underwent surgey for cataract hoping he would be able to manage to maintain his personal hygiene and relief himself on his own. “Now we have believe that he is rendered bed- ridden permanently. Our leaders must sit in peace, brood over the matter, probe their heart and decide as to how such patients could be helped,” said Md. Samshad Alam, son of Sagir Ahmad, who is undergoing treatment at IGIMS at Patna.Alam said that the possibility of his father getting back his eyesight is negligible. “The effort being made by the doctors is to do away with the need to remove his eyes,” said Alam, based on the feedback of doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/botched-eye-surgeries-victims-seek-cm-s-help-101638981447388.html

These pharmacists are posted at district level hospitals, medical colleges, community health centres and primary health centres and are engaged in drug distribution and at many places work in injection room to administer injectable drugs and vaccines. “We have asked pharmacists deployed at emergency wards not to abstain from work. But others will hold demonstration during the two-hour work boycott,” said Yadav. Yadav said the pharmacists are demanding wage revision, right to prescribe drugs, creation of new posts and standardisation of their work. Posts of pharmacists are less against the guidelines and at some places no pharmacists are deployed, he said. “Drug distribution is significant work as incorrect dose taken by patients can actually do more harm than benefit,” said Yadav.

Engagement tomorrow||PATNA: Bihar’s leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, considered the most eligible bachelor in the state’s politics and beyond, will marry his long-time friend, Rajshri, people close to the family said on Wednesday. The engagement ceremony is scheduled to take place in the national capital Delhi on Thursday, and the wedding early next year.The first announcement of 32-year-old Tejashwi’s wedding came from his elder sister Rohini Acharya on Twitter.Father Lalu Prasad Yadav and his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, who have been staying with their eldest daughter and Rajya Sabha MP, Misa Bharti, are already in Delhi A person close to the family said the wedding was being tentatively expected to be set for February next year.“I believe, once the engagement is over, the wedding date will be finalised,” senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) lawmaker Bhai Virendra said.The engagement ceremony is planned to be mostly a family affair. Only a small group of RJD leaders close to Lalu Yadav Prasad or Tejashwi are said to have been invited.Tejashwi Yadav, who tried his hand at a career in cricket - he did get into Delhi’s under-19 cricket team - before following his father’s footsteps, first campaigned with his father in the 2010 assembly elections when he delivered his public address.Tejashwi, Lalu Prasad Yadav’s youngest son had a flair for it. He contested his first assembly election in 2015 from Raghopur in Vaishali district, went on to be the deputy chief minister from 2015 to 2017 with Nitish Kumar as his boss. He was declared the RJD-led grand alliance’s presumptive chief minister for the 2020 polls.Not much is known about the bride or how the alliance was fixed except that she hails from Rewari in Haryana and the family lives in Friends Colony, an upmarket locality in the capital. RJD leaders said Rajshri’s family have business interests and is not into politics.Back in 2016 when Tejashwi Yadav circulated a WhatsApp number where people could complain about roads and highways - he was the road construction minister - many assumed that it was his personal number and flooded the account with marriage proposals. Bihar officials said there were 40,000-plus messages for Tejashwi, many of them marriage proposals, and only a few thousand to complain about roads.Tejashwi Yadav did then let it be known that he left it to his parents to decide on his wedding. Two years later, in 2018, Tejashwi said he could consider getting married only after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “You know, one should have the time for a honeymoon too, but where’s the time for that until the elections?” he told reporters in 2018.
08-12-2021||Lucknow||Recruitment of assistant teachers on cards before UP polls||Within days of Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Services Selection Board (UPSESSB) seeking details of vacant posts of trained graduate teachers, post graduate teachers and principals in government-aided secondary schools of the state as a precursor to initiating a recruitment drive, preparations have also begun to hire assistant teachers in government-run high schools and intermediate colleges before the 2022 UP assembly polls.The importance of the move can be gauged from the fact that a fresh recruitment is going to start after a gap of around three-and-a-half years. Earlier in June 2018, the commission had started recruitment on 10,768 posts of LT Grade teachers. However, during that time a large number of posts remained vacant due to lack of suitable candidates.Now, additional director (government) Anjana Goyal has directed all joint directors of education to make available detailed information of vacant posts of assistant teachers (LT Grade). In a missive dated December 6, 2021 sent to officials, Goyal has instructed them to provide the details through e-mail by December 10 so that the same could be sent to Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) for undertaking the recruitment process, said a senior state education department official.The missive, a copy of which is with HT, marked “very important” makes plain that as per the orders of the additional chief secretary (secondary education), this information is to be provided to the UPPSC immediately.The missive concedes that complete service details of teachers working in boys schools and girls schools cadre are not available in Directorate of Education and with transfer of more number of female teachers in boy’s schools through online and offline transfer in last two years, situation in various schools had changed and due to lack of clear information cadre wise/reservation wise details of teachers working in these institutions it was posing a challenge for the officials to prepare details regarding vacancies at the directorate level.Earlier, according to the information received from the district officials, the requisition (information about the vacancies) was sent to the UPPSC on behalf of the Directorate of Education for recruitment against the vacant posts. But objecting to some points, the commission had sent it back to the directorate. This has prompted additional chief secretary (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla to once again direct officials to update the details.“The information regarding the vacant posts has been sought on the prescribed proforma so that the cadre wise, subject wise and reservation wise vacancies in Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Education (Trained Graduate Category) Male/Female cadre can be prepared and sent to the commission. The information of assistant teachers working in DIETs or District Institute of Education and Training as well as those working on deputation has also been sought separately on the prescribed format,” said another official aware of the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/recruitment-of-assistant-teachers-on-cards-before-up-polls-101638980184976.html

The engagement ceremony will take place on Thursday in New Delhi, according to close aides of the Lalu-Rabri family. The official confirmation of the engagement of Tejashwi was made by his elder sister Rohini Archarya on her official Twitter handle on Wednesday. There is no confirmation about the marriage date yet. Tejashwi’s marriage has been a subject of speculation for long as he is considered one of the most eligible bachelors belonging to Bihar’s top political families and heir apparent to ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad. Prasad along with his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi is staying at the residence of their eldest daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti. Sources said Tejashwi’s would-be wife has been a long time friend of the Yadav scion and lives with her family at present in Friends Colony in New Delhi. Party insiders said Tejashwi would be in-laws do not have any political background and have business interests. The RJD insiders said the entire Yadav family, including Lalu’s daughters, their husbands, elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, close relatives and a few top party leaders, would be attending the function. RJD’s senior MLA Bhai Virendra said the ring ceremony of the young RJD leader would be taking place tomorrow but refrained from speaking about the wedding date of the Yadav scion. “We do not know about the wedding date. I believe, once the engagement is over, the wedding date will be finalised,” he said.

08-12-2021||Lucknow||‘Lal topi’ remark shows BJP leaders are scared: Akhilesh||LUCKNOW Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said that the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were gripped by the fear of ‘lal topi’ (red caps). The ‘lal topi’ reference by Akhilesh came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a veiled swipe at the red cap wearing Samajwadi Party leaders and cadres, during his rally in Gorakhpur on Tuesday. “Lal topi means red alert for the state,” Modi had said. Yadav countered Modi’s jibe by saying the ‘lal topi’ remark showed that BJP leaders were now scared over their political survival. The former chief minister alleged that the BJP leaders, who vow in the name of Indian culture, appear to be unaware that the colour of Lord Hanuman and the sun was also red.“Red is an important colour that fills up people’s lives. Our blood is red too, but those wearing ‘black caps’ won’t be able to understand this as their thinking is narrow,” he stated in a press release. Accusing the BJP of going back on its commitments made to farmers and the masses, he said, “The BJP has now thrown its promises made ahead of the 2017 UP polls into the dustbin and is currently engaged in misleading the masses through fake or misleading statistics and advertisements.” Yadav said the BJP had forgotten that the opposition plays a key role in a democracy. “The BJP has become so frustrated that it is stooping so very low and trying to malign the opposition. The personal attack on opposition by top leaders of the ruling establishment is shameful,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lal-topi-remark-shows-bjp-leaders-are-scared-akhilesh-101638979521951.html
08-12-2021||Lucknow||Omicron casts shadow on tourism, UP vacationers in wait-and-watch situation||LUCKNOW After being among the worst hit sectors during the first and second wave of the Covid-10 pandemic, the tourism and hospitality industry had somewhat seen a recovery following a drop in cases and high vaccination numbers. But the recent cases of Omicron (new variant of SARS-CoV2) have given a jolt to the industry with many tourists cancelling their travel bookings for New Year and Christmas bash abroad, said tour operators.“People are yet to cancel their tours to Dubai, Maldives and other countries. But they have put their bookings on hold stating that their travel plans will depend on the severity of the Omicron variant. Recently, a few bookings for Austria and Germany were cancelled because these destinations are closed since November 22 due to the spread of the virus,” said SMA Sheeraz, president of Travel Agents Association, India (UP and Uttarakhand Chapter) and MD of Sheeraz Tours. He said the cancellation of international travel operations from December 15 due to Omicron had stopped new travellers from booking tickets while the number of inquiries dropped by 20%. “There is a ray of hope for tour operators as people are still booking tickets for domestic travel. Tour operators would have done robust business had Omicron cases not surfaced now,” said Sheeraz.Director of Civica Travels, Sunil B Sataywakta, echoed similar views, saying, “Everything is on hold for now. Those who have booked tickets want to wait and watch. We feel the situation will be clear in a week. Protocols are changing constantly, which also affects our business.”“After the long lockdown in 2020, the hospitality sector had started coming back on its feet. This season when cases were dropping, we had good bookings for Dubai and other destinations. Even queries for chartered flights to Thailand were coming, but things have changed after the Omicron scare. We are lesser inquiries and most of the bookings are put on hold. It all depends on how things shape up in the next 10 days,” said Manish Arora of Arora Tours and Travels. 
08-12-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case against Param Bir Singh: Court refuses bail to two inspectors||MUMBAI The Mumbai sessions court on Wednesday rejected the bail applications of police inspectors Nandkumar Gopale and Asha Korke, both of whom were arrested in the extortion case registered against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh at Marine Drive police station. Additional sessions judge Deepak L Bhagwat rejected their bail pleas.Advocate Aniket Nikam, who represented the police officers, pointed out that two other accused in the case, Sunil Jain and Sanjay Punamiya, had already been granted bail by the court and Param Bir Singh was protected by the apex court and therefore, bail should be granted to Gopale and Korke as well. Nikam submitted that there were no call data records to prove that the meetings took place and that there was no technical evidence. The theory that the state criminal investigation department (CID) was alleging that Gopale and Korke demanded money from their own seniors to leave the accused was simply unbelievable. Nikam further pointed out that the complainant, Shyam Sunder Agarwal, was a notorious person and had several cases registered against him.Shekhar Jagtap, on behalf of the state CID (investigating agency), opposed Gopale and Korke’s bail pleas on grounds that despite being public servants, the accused had indulged in criminal activities.In July 2021, the Marine Drive police registered an FIR against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, ACP Shrikant Shinde, and other police officers. The police arrested Punamiya, a resident of Marine Drive, and an associate, Jain, both of whom got bail in the case. The case was registered for cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery and criminal conspiracy.Punamiya and Agarwal were partners in several projects at Gorai, Borivali and Bhayander but parted ways in 2011. As per Agarwal, Punamiya used his links with Param Bir Singh to extort funds after the duo fell out. According to the FIR lodged by Agarwal, Punamiya registered cases against him using his influence with Param Bir Singh.The Thane police arrested Agarwal in 2017, after which Punamiya sent an associate Manoj Ghatkar to offer a settlement. Ghatkar threatened them and asked them to pay ₹20 crore or face charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). Agarwal paid ₹9 crore and even handed over a plot at Bhayander to Punamiya’s associate, Jain.In 2021, when Param Bir Singh was the Mumbai police commissioner, Punamiya filed another complaint at Juhu police station about the threats. The police raided and confiscated Agarwal’s Vile Parle office but nothing was brought on record. Inspectors Gopale and Korke, and DCP Pathan also demanded money from Agarwal. DCP Pathan even threatened to arrest Agarwal if he failed to pay Param Bir Singh and Punamiya.On March 30, Punamiya allegedly forcibly obtained Agarwal’s signature on some property documents. Agarwal paid ₹15.5crore by cheque to Punamiya at the DCP’s office where he was taken forcibly, and also paid money to the DCP and ACP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-against-param-bir-singh-court-refuses-bail-to-two-inspectors-101638976461563.html

08-12-2021||Mumbai||At least 45 cars damaged in fire at BMW service centre||At least 45 cars including several BMWs were charred when a BMW service centre-cum-godown in Turbhe MIDC, Navi Mumbai, was gutted in a fire in the early hours of Tuesday. According to a senior fire officer from the MIDC, the fire broke out at around 5.25am in the four-storey building (ground-plus-three with a basement) and went on for more than seven hours before the officials managed to bring it under control. The fire was doused at around 1pm. There were no injuries in the incident. The exact loss of property is still being assessed. A fire officer from MIDC said, “The security officials of the building spotted the fire on the first floor and informed us. Ten fire tenders from Vashi, Koparkhairane, Turbhe and MIDC were sent to douse the fire. Around 32 cars were totally damaged. A majority of them were BMWs. Other high-end cars numbering between 13 and 18 were also partially damaged.” A fire officer said that the internal firefighting system of the building was not on auto mode when the accident occurred and its battery was also down. Had that been on auto mode with a running battery, the fire would not have been so massive, he said. BMW officials will conduct an audit to ascertain the extent of damage. “The exact reason behind the accident has not been understood yet. An electric short circuit is suspected to have caused it. We are not sure how many of these cars were new or used. We are still assessing the damage,” said a fire official. Representatives from the service centre were unavailable for comment.

08-12-2021||Mumbai||32 ha of mangrove forests may be diverted for JNPT-Navi Mumbai coastal road||Mumbai The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) has sought to divert just over 32 hectares of mangrove forests (equal to three-and-a-half Oval Maidans) in Raigad district for its proposed 10km six-lane coastal road from Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Uran’s Nhava village to Amra Marg in Navi Mumbai. The road will pass via the under-construction Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL). The first phase of the project will connect Amra Marg to MTHL across 7.02 km, including a 1.2km Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) link. Phase two will connect the MTHL to JNPT across 3.08 km. The total cost of the project is pegged at ₹681 crore.CIDCO’s proposal has not yet received stage-1 forest clearance from the state government and has in fact been pending for almost two years. The proposal is currently being examined by the divisional forest officer (Alibaug) who, after finalising land allocation for compensatory afforestation, will forward it to the Thane Circle office for further consideration. The proposed mangrove areas for diversion are located in Targhar, Vahal and Gavan villages.In a letter dated November 8, 2021, the DCF (Alibaug) wrote to the general manager (environment) at CIDCO stating that of the 126 hectares of land it has proposed for compensatory afforestation, a significant portion already falls under the jurisdiction of the state mangrove cell’s ‘Coastal Belt Working Circle’ and does not meet the criteria for CA. “The rules under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, say that when forest land is diverted, compensatory afforestation must be carried out on land which is currently not recognised as a protected area. We will identify an appropriate location and resubmit the proposal for compensatory afforestation,” said a CIDCO official privy to the development, adding that the project has already received coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance by the state coastal zone management authority in March 2019.“This development will especially improve connectivity between South Mumbai and the proposed Navi Mumbai airport via the MTHL bridge. In the Ulwe area, service lanes are planned in addition to the six-lane carriageway so that nodal traffic can also benefit without disrupting the journeys of those travelling to and from the airport. Existing routes in the area along National Highway 4B and State Highway 54 will also be decongested as a result of this project,” said the CIDCO official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/32-ha-of-mangrove-forests-may-be-diverted-for-jnpt-navi-mumbai-coastal-road-101638974541600.html
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Participation of sangat shrinking in all gurdwaras: SGPC chief||Harjinder Singh Dhami, 65, the newly elected president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex Sikh body that is responsible for the management of gurdwaras in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh, says he is a sewadar (servant) of the community who takes everyone along. Once a chela (follower) of Gurcharan Singh Tohra, today he is his one-time arch rival Parkash Singh Badal’s loyalist. “Sometimes, you have to take positions according to the need of the hour,” he says candidly in an interview in Amritsar. Excerpts: Q: How do you see Tohra’s protégé being on two top SGPC positions, after his death? It is rightly said that we were with Gurcharan Singh Tohra sahib once, but now we are closer to (Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh) Badal sahib now. There were many groups in the Akali Dal. Amid this factionalism, Badal sahib blessed me. He is a big leader of the Panth and has always honoured me. Now, I am with him and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal. We remain firm on the stand and are not men who shift our loyalty. Why did you support Tohra in the Badal-Tohra feud in 1999? Sometimes, you have to take positions according to the need of the hour. Yes, I supported Tohra sahib. However, Sardar Parkash Singh Badal was president of the Akali Dal when I was allotted a ticket in the SGPC general house elections in 1996. Then, Tohra sahib became president. I was taken into the executive committee. When one works with the president in this core panel, proximity with him is natural. Secondly, Tohra sahib was not an ordinary president. He was an institution in himself. I was inspired by his personality. So, associating my name with him was certain. However, Sardar Badal showed a lot of affection, too. Thanks to him, I remained chairman of the Hoshiarpur Improvement Trust from 2009-12. I am called the ‘chela (follower)’ of Tohra Sahib, but I will also be glad if I’m called ‘chela’ of Badal sahib. SGPC has not got an influential chief like Tohra so far. Jathedar Tohra had his own stature. He had a big skill. He along with Badal sahib devoted their whole life to the Panth. They are tall personalities having their own ways and we cannot copy them. The presidents elected after Tohra sahib, have tried to keep the SGPC system in order. It’s said that the “envelope culture” for the presidential election is the biggest hurdle in restoring independence of the top office.It’s not like that. I don’t blame the media overall, but it also spreads wrong perceptions. We have an organisation that has a head. In an organisation, no one can act on his/her own. We are elected on the ticket of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Its president first hears all SGPC members who, then resolve to authorise the SAD president to choose the gurdwara body chief from among them. If the members are asked to choose the president on their own, they won’t be able to do so due to lack of agreement. It is said the SGPC president is under political pressure. Going by my experience as working on key posts previously, I would say that at least I did not face any such pressure. It was due to lack of any pressure that we have punished all corrupt persons in the SGPC so far. How were the SGPC president and other office-bearers elected before the introduction of ‘envelope culture’? Meetings of members were held at that time too, prior to the poll session of the SGPC general house. The decision on the next president was taken at these meetings. Which are the major challenges before you as SGPC chief? When any system suffers from stagnation, it takes time to bring it back in order. Like the rest of the world, the pandemic has been a setback. Our main resources of revenue are donation, assets, commercial outlets and the interests of the money deposited. Yet, Guru Ghar has a crunch of nothing and all problems will be fixed. Today is the age of information technology. The negative use of social media has damaged the SGPC, which is another challenge. How are the SGPC’s ties with Panthic bodies since they allege restrictions by the gurdwara body? The SGPC represents the entire Sikh quam (community) and is basically a management body. Leaders of all other organisations also visit us. Yes, the SGPC personnel, including the task force, are forced to act stringently when anyone acts unruly or violates the maryada on the premises of Sri Darbar Sahib. If anyone comes to pay obeisance here, nobody stops him or her. For example, the Sarbat Khalsa-appointed parallel acting jathedar of Akal Takht Bhai Dhian Singh Mand comes here and returns peacefully. Who stops him? Members of other organisations, including Dal Khalsa and the Mann group also come. We have never restricted them. Is the SGPC facing a credibility crisis? Decreased participation of devotees at events is an example. The participation of the sangat (community) is shrinking in all gurdwaras. This trend is not only limited to SGPC-managed gurdwaras. Secondly, this statement is not fully true. People have attended functions in big numbers, such as the celebrations of the SGPC’s 100th foundation day. Actually, people don’t have enough time to sit in the gathering these days. What is your resolve while serving as chief of the SGPC? This is a sewa (voluntary service). The SGPC president is not a leader, he is a sewadar (servant). The Guru has given me an opportunity of rendering this sewa. I pray that He blesses me with success.

Gor, the first accused to be granted bail in the twin cases, approached the high court after the special NIA judge AT Wankhede granted him bail on November 20 but issued a second order on the request of NIA staying its decision. NIA wanted time to appeal against the bail order but did not file the petition.Senior advocate Shirish Gupte and advocate Aniket Nikam, appearing for Gor, told justice Sandeep Shinde that once the special court granted bail to Gor on merits, it was not open for the judge to stay its own order. During arguments in the high court, justice Shinde’s primary point to the NIA was whether a trial court judge has the power under section 309 (power to postpone or adjourn proceedings) or any other provision of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to stay his own order. The high court also asked what was the status of Gor’s detention after the stay of the judicial order.On December 7, while responding to the court’s query, additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Sandesh Patil appearing for NIA, sought to justify the special court’s stay and said that Gor’s petition was not maintainable as he had the remedy of appealing against the trial court’s order.On Wednesday, justice Shinde struck down the special NIA court’s order staying bail granted to Gor and also rejected NIA’s request to stay the operation of the high court order. The reasoned order will be available in due course. Gor was arrested in March 2021 and has been in jail after his interrogation was over. He first applied for bail in August 2021 but it was rejected on the grounds that the investigation was still continuing and the charge sheet was not filed.In September 2021, after the NIA filed the charge sheet, Gor filed another bail request claiming that he was not aware of the larger conspiracy in the case and was being made a scapegoat at the behest of Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-explosives-scare-bombay-high-court-cancels-stay-on-naresh-gaur-s-bail-101638961401308.html
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Cherry on top: Language of love transcends all species||“What is that?” My friend pointed towards the left. We were walking back from school. A dog was barking at something on the ground and was ready to attack whatever it was. We shooed the dog away and went closer to see what his object of interest was. It turned out to be a nest that must have fallen out of the tree. There was a newborn squirrel in it. It was so young that it had not even opened its eyes. “What do we do with it?” I asked. “How do I know,” my friend said. “I’ll take it home,” I decided. “Your call.” He was as nonchalant. So, I picked up the nest with the resident in it and gingerly carried it home. We are a family of animal lovers. The baby squirrel ignited parental instincts in my parents. Mom demonstrated to me how to feed the baby with a cotton wick dipped in milk. Dad got hold of a shoe box and made a house out of it. The baby was named Cherry. Cherry was painstakingly fed with the wick every couple of hours and was caressed by all family members. After a few days, she opened her eyes. Cherry looked at the faces and hands that had been feeding her and providing warmth. We were family and she immediately accepted us to be her siblings or whatever. Soon Cherry was cautiously venturing out of her shoe box. We would pick her up and place her on a shrub in the courtyard. She seemed confused initially, but was soon exploring the area and making joyful sounds. There were many other squirrels in the trees, but it was only Cherry who would come and climb on to our family members in the courtyard. Cherry started learning new tricks. Whenever we needed to feed her or just wanted it to be with her, dad would stand near the trees and whistle. Immediately, Cherry would appear and climb onto him. Our Alsatian took to Cherry as a family member. He would bark and chase away other squirrels, but Cherry could eat from his bowl. Cherry always returned to her shoe box house in the evening. We fed her fresh food whenever we had our meals. One day, I saw our Alsatian barking at something under a tree. I went to check. Cherry was lying there on a side. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing heavily. The dog looked at me and kept barking and wagging its tail as if asking me to do something for Cherry. I caressed her and tried to ascertain the reason for her distress. There were no external injury marks or other clue. Suddenly, she stopped breathing. We were all shocked. With a heavy heart, we buried her. We did not have the courage to remove her house. Cherry was there in our life for one year. It was a unique experience. She cemented our belief in the fact that the language of love transcends all species. gsbattu@gmail.com The writer is a Patiala-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cherry-on-top-language-of-love-transcends-all-species-101638960920622.html
08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court frames charges against man who pointed gun at policeman||A Delhi court has framed charges against Shahrukh Pathan, the man who had pointed a gun at a policeman during the deadly riots that rocked northeast Delhi last year, saying that it was not an ordinary case of an individual or a group committing an unlawful act. Images of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi police’s head constable Deepak Dahiya were widely circulated on social media. He was arrested on March 3, 2020 and is currently lodged in Tihar jail. On Tuesday, additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat charged Pathan with attempt to murder, assault, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act.The court also observed that it hadn’t witnessed riots of this nature since the deadly Sikh riots in 1984. The court noted that there was a prohibitory order under section 144 of the CrPC issued by the DCP (Northeast) and there was a violation also of section 188 of the IPC. The court also framed charges against Shamim and Abdul Shehzad, both co-accused, for being part of the rioters who were led by Pathan, saying they were rioting at the time of the gun-pointing incident. The Delhi court noted that both the accused have been identified through CCTV footage and by witnesses. The court also charged another accused, Ishtiyak Malik, saying that even if there was no footage showing him rioting, he cannot be absolved of the crime. The judge said that he was in constant touch with Pathan, as evident from his call records, adding that his mobile phone location was the same as that of Pathan. “This factum of the location or the presence of the accused Ishtiyak Malik @ Guddu at the place of riots where weapons are being brandished, and firing done at head constable Deepak Dahiya and others by accused Shahrukh Pathan with whom he was in continuous touch and shared the location of riots, is enough for framing charges against him, “ the court said.Additionally, the bench charged one Kaleem Ahmed for harbouring Pathan in Kairana, Uttar Pradesh, after he escaped following the incident during the riots.“On the basis of material on record, I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds for presuming that the accused persons namely Shahruk Pathan, Shamim, Abdul Shehzad and Ishtiyaq Malik @ Guddu have committed offences under sections 147, 148, 186, 188, 353, 307 of the IPC... section 149 of the IPC, and accused Shahrukh Pathan has also additionally committed offence under sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act, while accused Kaleem Ahmed committed offence under section 216 of the IPC,” the court said. Pathan, through his counsel, had earlier argued that he only intended to scare the policeman and not kill him.Communal clashes broke out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after a tense standoff between supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and its critics went out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

Organised by Chamoli district administration in collaboration with Gurgaon based Starscapes Experiences Pvt Ltd, the event is part of the vision to develop specific themes for tourism in each one of the state’s 13 districts. Chamoli, needless to say, has decided to develop Astro-tourism and is promoting Benital as an “Astro Village” Paul Savio, co-founder and chief executive officer of Starscapes said Astro-party is an event where people can have a multitude of astronomical experiences ranging from identifying planets, constellations, stars, different cosmic phenomenon, learning Astro-photography, how to make sun-dials and so on. “On the first day, around 50 visitors attended the Astro-party. As it is a very remote place, we are hoping more people will turn up in such events in future. With telescopes, our six resource persons including an expert on Astro-photography were there,” he said According to officials of Starscapes, Benital with its low light pollution and minimal human activities offers an undisturbed view of the night sky, making it an ideal location for viewing celestial bodies and promoting Astro-tourism. Also Read: Congress condemns ‘attack’ on Yashpal Arya, holds state-wide protestsSavio said with travel and tourism slowly picking up in the last few months, tourists are looking for quaint and minimally populated locations that can offer offbeat experiences. “Given this trend, Astro-tourism has seen a newfound interest among travellers and tourists. People are opting for activities such as stargazing, viewing of the moon and other planetary objects, astrophotography and other activities that give voice to their curiosity about the universe. This trend is definitely here to stay, and it may become the next big travel trend in the country” he added. Founded in 2015 by astronomy aficionado Ramashish Ray with Paul Savio joining him as co-founder and CEO in 2019, Starscapes has set up two observatories in Uttarakhand, one is situated at Bhimtal in Nainital district and another at Kausani in Bageshwar district.

08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Is it a cab? No, it’s a food stall!||He gave up his career as a cab driver. But his white cab remains a necessary element of his new career. Vikas Sharma started his pavement lunch stall two weeks ago. The cab is the stall. Its boot is the food counter.The menu is always the same - three gravy-based dishes of rajma, chhole and karhi, along with plain boiled rice. The signature dish is karhi, for that is the name of the stall - Radhe Radhe Sharmaji Karhi Chawal Wale.A cloth banner printed with this name is draped across the length of the cab, and it is in direct view of pedestrians here in Anand Vihar, a short walk from the interstate bus terminus.“These days, cab-driving doesn’t fetch much earning,” says Mr Sharma. Based on his experience, he says the coronavirus pandemic and ride-sharing companies have directly hurt the earnings of independent drivers like him. However, the switch to catering wasn’t virgin territory for him “because I’ve previously dabbled in this line”.Now a passerby pauses, looks at the banner, appears to be in two minds, then timidly asks for a plate of karhi chawal. Mr Sharma nods, picks up a disposable bowl, fills it up with boiled rice over which he pours two or three ladles of karhi along with two pakoras. He sprinkles garam masala on the serving and tops the dish with sliced onions. The customer moves towards the side and begins his lunch.This stretch of Anand Vihar is crammed with food carts targeting the bus terminus crowd. Mr Sharma’s establishment is unique in serving substantial home-style meals. The rest of the stalls are doling out chhole bhathure, parathas, kulche and Maggi noodles.A cab driver’s work is extremely hectic, Mr Sharma says. But his life as a food stall entrepreneur remains equally hectic. Every morning he gets up at four to prepare the dishes at his home in Bhopura. “My wife contributes equally to the cooking,” he says, urging that her name not be shared publicly. The dishes are ready by 9am, and he opens his stall an hour later. This being early days of the new venture, Mr Sharma cannot confirm it to be a success yet, “but all the dishes get over by the time I leave for home [at 4pm].”And now another man slows down. He, too, asks for karhi chawal.The stall is situated next to a shopping mall, right in front of a shelter for homeless people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-is-it-a-cab-no-it-s-a-food-stall-101638923243746.html

08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Passengers a harried lot as transport staff goes on indefinite strike in Ludhiana||Passengers at the city bus stand had a harrowing time after Punbus and PRTC contractual employees went on an indefinite strike on Tuesday as part of their statewide protest seeking regularisation of jobs.Around 150 public-run buses, including roadways and PRTC, were stabled at the city bus stand due to the strike, leaving the public with no option but to flag down private buses. Women, who enjoy free travel in public buses, had to shell out fare. One distressed passenger, Ravi Sharma, who was accompanied by his wife, mother and sister-in-law, said, “It is unfair that now women passengers will have to pay for their travel. We had planned to go to visit the Mata Chintpurni Mandir and have been waiting for a government-run bus to Hoshiarpur as we would only have to pay fare for one person, and the rest of my family can travel free of cost. While announcing free travel for women, the government should also ensure that public buses remain operational.”Pvt buses overcharging: Commuters Uncertainty over when the bus services would resume left both officials and passagers flummoxed. A passenger, Vishal, said, “The enquiry counters were unmanned and no one seems to know when operations will resume. Private bus operators, who are enjoying their monopoly, have increased the fare by ₹10 to ₹20. The public will have to bear the brunt for this deadlock between the government and contractual employees.” Meanwhile, authorities said that efforts were made to provide relief to passengers by playing buses on a few routes with the help of permanent staffers.Station supervisor Kuljit Singh Sodhi said, “Around 25 public sector buses were being run on busy routes such as Chandigarh, Moga, and Jalandhar. However, the services were still affected at large. The state government is working to resolve the issue with the employees’ union.” FIRs no deterrentDespite FIRs being lodged against unidentified employees for shutting down the bus stand for two hours during an agitation on December 3, employees in large numbers went on strike and staged a protest against the state government outside roadways workshop at the bus stand on Tuesday.Punbus/PRTC contractual employees union district president Satnam Singh said,”We are not afraid of any action being taken against them as out fight is for a genuine demand. The strike will continue until our demand are fulfilled, which include regularisation of employees, and addition of more buses under the roadways department. Authorities are also trying to pressure employees by threatening them with departmental action.” On December 4, unidentified transport workers had been booked for shutting the bus stand for two hours, which resulted in alleged harassment to the public.State joint secretary of the Union Shamsher Singh said they have not even been able to provide education and health facilities to their families due to meagre salaries. Different employee and farmer unions have also extended support to the statewide protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/passengers-a-harried-lot-as-transport-staff-goes-on-indefinite-strike-in-ludhiana-101638911715025.html

The alarms should be separately operable by the branch manager, cashier, and any other official of the branch from their seats. The alarm should be linked to the head offices, who are to immediately contact the police control room,” he said. “A BSNL landline phone with an auto-dialer should also be installed in the branch. As soon as the alarm goes off, a teleprompter should automatically inform the police control room of suspicious activity. Security staff should be properly verified, and names and phone numbers of all visitors should be entered in a register,” the JCP said.

He also asked the owners to ensure that there is no secret entry or exit passage and to get their employees verified at the nearest police station. Action will be taken against centers where liquor, drugs, hookah, and other intoxicants are served to customers.Schools asked to deposit list of bus drivers, other staffThe JCP also ordered schools to deposit a list of staff, including drivers and conductors of school buses with their photographs, to the police station concerned. “Verification of staff is essential for the safety of children,” he said.

08-12-2021||Chandigarh||UT adviser seeks report on shorter route to airport from Chandigarh||UT adviser Dharam Pal on Tuesday directed the deputy commissioner and chief engineer to submit a report on an alternative shorter route to the international airport from Chandigarh. The adviser has given 10-day time to the committee, which will submit its report after field study and assessing the ground situation. Pal said, “We will discuss the report with other stakeholders, including Punjab and Haryana, if the land required for shorter route falls under their jurisdictions.” Currently, Chandigarh residents have to take about 14km detour via Mohali to reach the airport. Before the construction of new international airport, the distance from Tribune Chowk to the previous terminal was 2.7km. Now, people have to travel 14.52km from the Tribune Chowk to reach the airport. In the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, another proposal of road connectivity to the airport has been given from Sector 48 (Purv Marg) through Jagatpura village, which will be about 4.7km from Tribune Chowk, thereby reducing the distance by 10km. The UT administration’s proposal to construct a tunnel for an alternative shorter route to the airport in Mohali was junked in the Northern Zonal Council meeting held in September 2019.The administration was pitching for the Centre’s help and contributions from Haryana and Punjab to construct the ₹1,200-crore underground tunnel connecting Chandigarh directly to the new airport terminal in Mohali. The proposed route was to cut down the distance for people commuting to the airport from Chandigarh and Panchkula by 10km. But both Haryana and Punjab hadn’t supported the proposal. This was also not agreed upon by the Indian Air Force authorities. ‘Simplify estates policies’In a meeting to review the functioning of the UT estate office on Tuesday, Dharam Pal stressed on resolving the issues pending at the level of Chandigarh administration at the earliest and further directed to follow up with the ministry of home affairs regarding the pending issues. Some important issues such as conversion of leasehold to freehold properties in case of commercial and industrial plots, review of fee for additional FAR to educational, social, religious and cultural institutions, renewal of lease of LPG godown and petrol pump sites and misuse/building violation charges were discussed in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ut-adviser-seeks-report-on-shorter-route-to-airport-from-chandigarh-101638909013266.html

His wife and child had also tested positive, while three other family members and contacts tested negative.“The test reports revealed that the man is infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of concern, and hence he is not infected with the Omicron variant,” Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, adding that his wife and child are also infected with the Delta variant. Dr Singh said the health department has also traced the family’s infection history and found that the child was the first to develope symptoms. “Since the man had returned from a high-risk country, he became the primary case. All three are isolated at hospital and are have a good health condition. We will conduct their repeat test on December 8, and will send them home if the results come negative,” she said.The World Health Organisation has warned that the risk related to Omicron (B.1.1.529) strain is “very high”. First detected in South Africa, the “highly divergent” strain has been spreading globally at a high speed with around two dozen cases detected across five states in India till Monday.The Delta variant, another “variant of concern” that has spread in more than 85 nations , is seen as the major reason behind the second wave in Chandigarh. Over 90% of the genome sequencing reports received by the UT health department since June have confirmed its presence. “As Covid-19 has many variants with higher chances of transmissibility, people are requested to get vaccinated at the earliest as it is the only key to controlling the infection severity,” said Dr Singh.

08-12-2021||Chandigarh||1971 War: Navyman who took part in bombing of Karachi harbour||It was his life’s toughest period. It was his life’s most exciting period. Thirty years after he slept with explosives under his mattress, Capt Arvind Kumar (retd), 71, vividly remembers his role in the bombing of Karachi harbour in 1971 during the Operation Trident, the success of which has led to December 4 being celebrated as Navy Day. For Capt Kumar, the journey in the armed forces started at the age of 20, when he joined the Navy after passing out from the Rashtriya Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, in Uttarakhand. After a year’s training in Mumbai, war broke out. And on December 4, 1971, a group of around 30 young midshipmen were rushed to the Eastern front. “Indian Navy ships Nirghat, Nipat and Veer fired their Styx missiles and sank Pakistan Navy ships Khyber and Muhafiz and it boosted our morale,” says Capt Kumar, recalling that night’s devastating offensive.Capt Kumar was deputed on INS Brahmaputra, with around 150 naval officers on it. “Captain Subimal Mukherjee had been giving our officers regular instructions regarding the targets. On March 8, we got the information that the Indian Army has attacked Karachi and there were apprehensions that Pakistan will attack Mumbai in retaliation. INS Vikrant was deployed to seal the escape route of Pakistani troops. Tactically, we started moving from East to West.”‘We were really excited & ignorant’The veteran says he still remembers those moments: “We used to move in a convoy of around eight ships, and aircraft above us. We used to throw explosives in the water suspecting Pakistan submarines. We were really excited and ignorant. I had put explosives under my mattress, so that nobody should take them without my permission. Now, I realise, it was a big blunder of my life as they could have exploded.”With the success of Indian naval operations in East Pakistan, the Indian Navy subsequently commenced two large-scale operations: Operation Trident and Operation Python. “These operations were focused on West Pakistan, the start of formal hostilities between India and Pakistan,” says Capt Kumar. To conduct successful operations against East and West Pakistan, India sorely needed to avoid a two-front war situation. Indian troops from the China border were needed in the West on the Pakistan border. “It is here that the Soviet Union came to our help, but Sri Lanka and the US were supporting Pakistan,” he says. “Also, due to the heavy presence of the Indian naval force on the Eastern front, Pakistan threat was very less. One thing we realised during the war was that Pakistani troops were cowards. During the conflict, East Pakistan’s naval ports were left defenceless as their Eastern Command had decided to fight the war without the navy. Faced overwhelming opposition, the navy planned to remain in the ports when the war broke out,” says the veteran.The Operation Trident, which saw the bombing of Karachi harbour, is considered to be one of the most successful operations in modern naval history, with no casualties being sustained by the Indian forces, he says. “I still remember, on December 16, 1971, 4.13 pm, Pakistan’s Rear Admiral Mohammad Shariff surrendered his naval command to Vice-Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan, commander-in-chief of the Eastern Naval Command… In world history, for the first time in any war, there was the massive surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops in Bangladesh,” recalls Capt Kumar, who retired in March 1990 as commander of the executive branch.

08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Cattle the major hassle in Ward 31||Despite a blanket ban, cattle are reared in this ward with impunity, leaving other residents hassled by related issues such as flies, poor sanitation, and road accidents. The ward comprises Kajheri village, Sectors 52 and 61 and surrounding colonies near Mohali border. The residents of Sector 61, which is very much a part of the smart city Chandigarh, feel alienated owing to the lack of basis facilities, such as a dispensary, library or for that matter even a PIN code, for which they have to depend on Mohali. The liquor vend in the market witnesses a lot of rush, as people not just from the city but also Mohali throng to buy alcohol that is less costly in Chandigarh.Vinit Singh Chauhan, president, RWA, Sector 61, says: “We are paying the price of staying on the border. In the evening, there is a huge rush at the liquor vend. People can be seen drinking in public, making it difficult for women to go to the market.” He adds: “We face a lot of issues in courier deliveries. Despite being a smart city, Sector 61 does not have a PIN code and residents are using the code of Mohali.” AB Gera, a member of the RWA, Sector 61, says: “We feel left out, as no one seems to be interested in development of our sector. There is no dispensary, no sampark centre, no library or even public place for recreation.” Ram Rajput of Sector 52 says, “The Chandigarh administration has a blanket ban on rearing cattle but despite this people have made huts in an open area in Sector 52 and are rearing cattle. No concrete efforts have been made to ensure that cattle do not come on roads. Despite raising the issue repeatedly, no action has been taken.” Suresh Kumar Thakur, another resident of Sector 52, says: “Road work has not been done though at some places recarpeting was done as the elections approached. A dispensary had been opened, but there is no staff.” The residents of Sectors 52 and 61 also complain that the area councillor, Chanderwati Shukla, went “missing” when the area saw a surge in Covid-19 cases. Denying that, Shukla says: “I have delivered more than what was promised. The issue of stray cattle still remains unresolved as people are rearing the animals. I have a number of times taken up the matter, animals have been impounded as well, but soon they are back on streets. Road work has been done; there are only small pockets where it is yet to be completed.” Know your ward Localities: Sector 52, Sector 61, Kajheri village, Kajheri Colony, EWS LIG Colony, Transit Camp, Karsan Colony Pandit Colony, Gwala Colony and Majdoor Colony Reserved for SC candidates Voters: 22,700 Key issuesIllegal rearing of cattle and slaughter houses Mushrooming of hotels and guest houses, leading to illegal activities Broken roads and overflowing garbage dumps Local voices Stray cattle can be seen roaming on the road and leading to accidents.

Mahajan had allegedly made the call from an acquaintance’s phone on being taken to court in the property grab case.Police have also moved an application seeking Mahajan’s voice samples to match them with the call recording submitted by the complainant. Meanwhile, Mahajan’s counsel Rajesh Sharma moved an application on his behalf seeking directions to the jail authorities to get him vaccinated against Covid-19. The application says Mahajan is suffering from asthama and has ulcer in his digestive track, and thus is a high-risk person. “The court has issued directions to the jail authorities to get him vaccinated,” said SharmaThe other application, moved in the HC, was taken up by the bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan on Tuesday and posted for hearing on December 13. Mahajan has claimed that he is a victim of vindictive attitude of police, whose senior officers have created a false story and manipulated a complaint against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhformer-scribe-arrested-in-threat-call-case-101638908893057.html
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration reinstates 178 NHM employees||The Chandigarh administration on Tuesday decided to reinstate the 178 terminated National Health Mission (NHM) workers after they met UT adviser Dharam Pal and agreed upon withdrawing the court case. During the meeting with the UT adviser, the terminated employees expressed their sincere apology and promised that such conduct will not be repeated in the future. The staff requested that the orders for termination of contractual appointment be withdrawn, their contractual employment be counted without any break in service and the intervening period of absence be regularised with leave without pay. They assured that they would like to continue as contractual employees under NHM and do not opt for the option of being outsourced employees on DC rates. “After a detailed deliberation, the UT adviser accepted the demands of the NHM staff, but on some conditions. The adviser said that employees will have to submit a written request accepting the mistake. Also, they will have to voluntarily and unconditionally withdraw the pending court case on the issue and submit a copy of the withdrawal petition,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. He added that the salary under NHM cannot be equal to the DC rates because of the lesser working hours, better leave and other service conditions. However, the department may separately consider appropriate revision of the salary under NHM, but till then, the employees will have to work with previous pay scale, Garg said. The NHM employees have filed a case — ‘Niranjan Kumar and others versus Union of India and others’ — in the Punjab and Haryana high court, hearing of which is due on January 12, 2022. At least 500 NHM employees, working under the UT health department as doctors, paramedical staff and managerial employees including nursing officers, pharmacy officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians, dental technicians and other Group-4 staffers, had been drawing salaries lower than the approved minimum wages since 2013. In August, over 300 NHM workers had gone on indefinite leave to press their demand for equal wages for equal work. Following their continuous protest, the UT administration had given a written assurance of a salary hike. The department had then offered revised working conditions for them against the salary hike. However, the services of the NHM workers were terminated on October 28 after they went on a strike without giving prior intimation.Meanwhile, Amit Kumar, general secretary of the NHM union, said, “We will take back the court case and join the duties immediately after getting written assurance from the UT administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-administration-reinstates-178-nhm-employees-101638908773156.html

08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Anurag Thakur to launch Himachal’s new sports policy on December 11||Union minister of youth affairs and sports Anurag Thakur will launch Himachal Pradesh’s new sports policy on December 11. The new sports policy aims at promoting raw talent on merit and making sports associations more professional, Himachal Pradesh youth services and sports minister Rakesh Pathania said on Tuesday. Pathania said he had submitted the draft policy to Anurag and he has suggested some changes in it, which is being done. “The biggest change we tend to bring is to make the sports association more professional. For this we have proposed that people who are heading sports association but don’t have sports background must make way to the professional people,” said Pathania. “It is my appeal to them that they should leave so that a person with a sports background could be roped in,” he added. Pathania said before this there was no proper sports policy in the state. The policy which was in place said nothing significant on how to promote sports. There were no provisions for financial incentives for Paralympics champions. “Another change we tend to bring is to make pro-sportsmen atmosphere and friendly relationship between the sports association and the government. The sports associations should not be limited to only for grants but work in tandem with the government to promote budding talent,” said Pathania. The minister said there is no dearth of raw talent in Himachal but thing was that how many of them are spotted and promoted. “We would do a talent search by way of schools sports, rural sports championships and women championships,” he said. The minister said to motivate youth to take up sports, the policy also proposes to increase the jobs under the sports quota. “There would be no place for political recommendations but the talent will be selected in the teams on merit,” he said. He said the new policy is as per the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has set a target that India should win at least win 50 medals in the Paris Olympics 2024. “Every state has been given a task to prepare sportsmen for different sports. We will have no dearth of funds. The things were hit due to Covid-19 pandemic, but the situation will improve soon,” he said. Pathania said earlier last year the total budget of the sports department was just ₹48 crore of which ₹24 crore were salary bills. “It was due to the fund crunch that we lacked in sports but now that would be a thing of the past,” said Pathania.

The interim order was extended after Jammu Development Authority (JDA) failed to furnish a reply in the matter. The JDA’s law officer has sought further time to file a reply and to produce JDA’s standing counsel. The tribunal has now fixed the hearing for December 14, 2021. The JDA had on November 8 directed Dr Nirmal Singh and his wife Mamta Singh to demolish the bungalow on their own, stating it had been constructed without requisite permission. It ordered the two to “remove the illegal structure on your own level within five days from the date of issuance of this order’’, or it would pull it down itself and recover the cost from them. Subsequently, Mamta Singh had filed an appeal against the JDA order. Advocate Muzaffar Ali Shah, who was the first to raise objections to the construction next to the Army ammunition depot, has also sought to be impleaded as a respondent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/demolition-of-nirmal-singh-s-house-jammu-and-kashmir-special-tribunal-extends-stay-till-december-14-101638908657895.html
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu: Fear Nagaland-like situation in Punjab, says Farooq Abdullah||Accusing the BJP government of autocracy, National Conference president and Lok Sabha member Dr Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday feared Nagaland-like situation in neighbouring Punjab. Addressing party’s day-long convention here, he said, “See in Punjab, they have extended the jurisdiction of the BSF up to 50 km. Isn’t the Punjab Police capable to handle the situation? They could have extended BSF’s jurisdiction by 5 km. Now same fights like Nagaland, where innocents were killed, will take place in Punjab… wait for that day… this will also happen”. He felt that such decisions could have been averted. Referring to the death of 750 farmers over farm laws, he said, “When the BJP sensed defeat in five states, it immediately rolled back the farm laws. We had said they should have been sent to select committees”. “Even Satya Pal Malik, former J&K governor, had warned them over farm Bills predicting their defeat,” he added. He said the farm laws were passed in a huff notwithstanding the demand for debate and discussion by the opposition ahead of their passage. Such was the arrogance of numbers that no plea of sending the farm Bills to the select committee was heeded to. Farooq also contradicted the government’s tall claims development post-abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A. “Go to Kashmir and see how many youths can’t pro-India slogans there…just go and see. The first bullet will be shot at us… it will be shot at those who are with India and we will remain till our last breath,” he said while explaining the “deteriorating” law and order situation in the Valley. The veteran politician demanded the restoration of the rights of the people of J&K. “We demand our rights that were snatched from us. The PM had assured to remove “Dil Ki Doori and Dillli se Doori”. May I ask him what he has done so far since June 24 when the all-party meet was held,” he asked. He warned the BJP to stop spreading hatred. Farooq expressed optimism about the restoration of special status and said the people are resolute enough and steadfast in their resolve to stand for their rights. “We will fight for our rights peacefully as we don’t believe in violence. Together we will definitely bail the state out of this morasses,” he said. He lamented that BJP calls them Pakistanis “We never picked up gun, grenade and stones. We never raised anti-India slogans but we are called Pakistanis. We follow the footsteps of Gandhi and we want to bring Gandhi’s India back. We had acceded with Gandhi’s India and not Nathuram Godse’s India,” he said. He said the communal politics was not in the interest of the nation and the BJP should better realise it. Earlier, the party adopted five resolutions seeking restoration of Article 370 and Article 35A besides statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, effective measures to curb inflation and rising prices, jobs to unemployed, repeal of decision with regard to Darbar Move and providing respite to farmers.

During the 1965 war, Singh was part of an assault team and he was injured during the capture of Gitian in Hajipir sector, Lt Col Anand said.The subedar participated in the 1971 war at Chapriyal area of Akhnoor with the 216 Field Regiment that fought valiantly there. Two officers, two junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and 64 other ranks of the regiment, including the CO, Lt Col M L Sethi, had made the supreme sacrifice during the operation, he said.On the occasion of ‘Swarnim Vijay Diwas’, Singh travelled 230 km from his residence to the gun area of the 1971 war and the 216 Field Regiment memorial at Pahariwala on his old ‘moped’ all by himself, the PRO said.The veteran remembered his CO, OC and fallen brothers with pride and tears in his eyes, he said.“His sense of patriotism and esprit-de-corps acted as a motivation for all the attendees of the wreath-laying ceremony,” Lt Col Anand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/80yearold-veteran-covers-230-km-on-old-moped-to-pay-homage-to-his-comrades-of-1971-war-101638908593116.html
08-12-2021||Jaipur||Amit Shah led BJP conspiracy to topple my govt last year, failed, says Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday renewed his attacks on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing its top leaders of trying to topple his government in 2020 and insisting that they left no stone unturned but did not succeed.“Rajasthan made history by failing their efforts to topple the state government which will be helpful in saving the democracy in future,” he said, alleging that two top BJP leaders, home minister Amit Shah and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, played a lead role in the conspiracy.Asked about Amit Shah’s statement during his Jaipur visit that the BJP will not destabilise the state government, Gehlot shot back: “Is it in his hands?”“They tried it but failed. Their own MLAs did not support them. Two planes were sent to Jaipur to shift BJP MLAs out of the state but only one plane could take off and the second plane left empty,” he claimed.Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia dismissed the charge, insisting that his party will not bring down the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in the state, but it will fall due to infighting.Gehlot’s move to target the BJP leadership for last year’s political crisis in Rajasthan comes a day his top aide appeared before Delhi crime branch in connection with phone tapping case lodged on a complaint by Union Jal Shakti minister, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.Gehlot said the minister should give a voice sample to make it clear whose voice is on the tape.An alleged leaked telephonic conversation between a Union minister and Congress leaders in Rajasthan triggered the political crisis in the state last year, which also gave rise to the charges of illegal phone tapping.The clips emerged on social media during the rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot in July-August last year.Gehlot said Shekhawat’s voice sample will clear the air about the tapes and the conspiracy.“He should give voice sample, but he tries to find a way to escape. The voice sample will make things clear. He will be exposed in which manner he was there in the conspiracy (to topple the government),” he said.On the proposed Congress rally, he claimed it will be the beginning of NDA’s downfall and mark the victory of Congress in next assembly elections in the state. He said that it will be a historic rally for which grand preparations are being made.

08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Farm law repeal has improved BJP’s poll prospects in Punjab drastically: Gajendra Singh Shekhawat||Union Jal Shakti minister and BJP’s Punjab election incharge Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is a busy man these days. An MP from Rajasthan’s Jodhpur Lok Sabha constituency, Shekhawat is at the centre of the party’s poll strategy formation ahead of the assembly polls scheduled early next year in the border state. Be it holding talks with former chief minister Captain Amarinder’s newly formed Punjab Lok Congress or the decision to induct leaders from other parties in the BJP fold, he has been taking care of it all. On his visit to Chandigarh on Tuesday, HT talked to Shekhawat on various issues. Here are the excerpts: How do you see BJP’s chances in Punjab after the repeal of 3 farm laws? The party’s prospects have improved drastically after the decision. We used to contest from 23 seats traditionally. This is for the first time that we are prepared to contest on all 117 seats. After Narendra Modi became Prime Minister and what he has done after for Punjab and the Sikhs, we will take these achievements to the common man and fight the polls with full strength. A barrier was created on the pretext of these laws but it is over now. The BJP will form government in the state or will be part of the government. You met Amarinder today. Is alliance formation with his party and SAD (Sanyukt) final? We discussed the political scenario in Punjab. It will be premature on my part to say as on what lines the BJP will or will not enter an alliance. The only thing I can tell you is that it is highly likely that we will contest the polls as part of an alliance. Union home minister Amit Shah has already given a statement in this regard. Politics is a game of possibilities. Punjab is a border state and we are eager to work with all those who want to ensure communal harmony here. In case of an alliance, will Amarinder be CM face of it? Will BJP be a major partner in it? There is no such tradition in the BJP unless a serving chief minister is going to the polls. But we generally don’t announce CM candidate where we are contesting to come to power. A strong outrage was seen against BJP in Punjab during the farm stir. Don’t you see it as a big challenge? What Prime Minister Modi has done for the Sikh community is exceptional. There is a long list of Modi government’s pro-Sikh decisions including opening up of the Kartarpur corridor, revoking the black list, waiving GST on langar etc. Someone may create a temporary outrage among the Sikhs against the BJP, but it is not be permanent. The Sikhs community’s contribution in pre- and post-Independence era to preserve our cultural ethos was immense. The people who tried to create hatred for the BJP among Sikhs and vice versa are defeated now. There is a common saying in Punjab that BJP doesn’t understand the state well.Do you still think so after the repeal of the farm laws also?BJP first said its CM face in Punjab will be an SC. But then, Congress made Channi, a SC, CM. Will there be a change in strategy? The announcement of making an SC a CM face was never from the party high command. Yes, some statements in this regard were made by our party leaders. But these were the individual statements, and not of the parliamentary board. The BJP doesn’t do caste politics. When Sirsa joined BJP, SAD called an attempt to ruin Sikh institutions. Manjinder Singh Sirsa ji first resigned as president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). It is easy to level allegations like Bhagwant Mann did by claiming that a senior BJP leader offered him something. Such claims are ridiculous. Will BJP also announce some freebies in its manifesto? Punjab doesn’t need freebies. But it is in a dire need of good administration. How can one promise everything free when you don’t even have the money to repay your debt? 
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: CM Channi’s brother resigns as senior medical officer, eyes ticket from Bassi Pathana||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s younger brother Dr Manohar Singh, who was posted as the senior medical officer (SMO) in the Kharar civil hospital in Mohali district, has resigned from the service. Dr Manohar, who is vying to contest the upcoming state assembly elections from Bassi Pathana in Fatehgarh Sahib district, has already started meeting people and addressing gatherings in the constituency which is reserved for scheduled caste (SC) category. In the past week, he has visited 35 villages of the segment and claims to have redressed their grievances. He has even set up an office at Bassi Pathana where he meets people daily. When contacted, he said, “Yes, I am interested in contesting the polls if the party high command allows me.” Presently, the constituency is represented by Congress MLA Gurpreet Singh GP who is also trying to get the ticket for the second time. Gurpreet Singh said, “Being the sitting MLA, I will contest from Bassi Pathana. I have full faith in the party high command which has assured me the ticket. Also, the majority of people from the segment support me due to the development works I have got done in the area.” On Dr Manohar’s political activities, he asked, “How can two tickets be given to members of a family?Interestingly, Dr Manohar started political activities in Bassi Pathana during the pandemic last year when he was posted at the Nandpur Kalour primary health centre in the segment. Nandpur Kalour sarpanch Manjeet Singh said that Dr Manohar was transferred to Kharar after MLA Gurpreet feared his popularity in the area.A post-graduate in anaesthesia, Dr Manohar has done master’s in journalism from Kurukshetra University and is also a law graduate from Panjab University, Chandigarh. He has been vice-president and general secretary of the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association, a body of government doctors in the state that led protests in Mohali against the 6th Pay Commission recommendations on de-linking non-practising allowance (NPA) with the basic pay.

Police said the suspects were fond of travelling and used to rob a cab to travel to different places. The suspects were identified as Rahul alias Lando (31), Shivam alias Jadugar (20), Ankush alias Monu (23), all from Gurugram, and Mahipal Singh (29), a native of Bihar. Police said they were arrested from the Dwarka Expressway while they were returning from Himachal Pradesh.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the suspects, who are friends, were jailed several times for robbery, extortion, rape, assault, murder and attempt to murder. “On the morning of December 4, they planned to visit Himachal Pradesh. So they decided to rob a car and flee to a hill station,” he said. According to police, the four suspects at Signature Tower saw a Dzire car coming from Sector 14 side and one of them flagged down the vehicle and requested the driver to give directions for an address. Sangwan said as soon as the driver rolled down the glass of car’s window, one of them pulled him out. “They snatched the driver’s mobile phone and cash, and fled with the car towards Huda City Centre Metro station,” he said, adding that they were seen driving towards Delhi in the footage obtained from different CCTV cameras. The cab driver, Hakam from Nuh district, lodged a complaint against unidentified men on the same day and a case under sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Sector 40 police station. Sangwan said the victim who lives in a rented room in Sector 65 works with a cab aggregator. “The probe was handed over to the crime investigation agency which on Tuesday morning arrested the four people and recovered the car and the victim’s mobile phone,” he said.  “The suspects had also robbed another person of cash as they hardly had ₹100 with them and that was not enough to fund their trip. They were fond of travelling and robbed over 30 cars in Gurugram in the past two years,” Sangwan said. Sangwan said that the suspects are drug addicts and used to smuggle drugs from hill stations to make money. “The kingpin of the gang, Rahul, was lodged in jail in a rape case in 2014 and later for a murder case. He came out on bail in 2016 and formed a gang,” he said. The suspects were produced before the court on Tuesday that sent them to 14-day judicial custody, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-four-arrested-for-robbing-cab-driver-at-gunpoint-101638907333454.html

Addressing a rally in Fazilka, Channi said it was for the first time when political power in the state had come out of the control of the ‘rajwadashahi’ (royalty). He said, “Now, it must stay with the middle class for inclusive growth of the state. I understand the issues of the poor and the middle class and my government has rolled out several programmes for their welfare.”Channi inaugurated a newly constructed 100-bed civil hospital and a bus stand at the Fazilka district headquarters amid strong protests by the employees demanding regularisation of jobs and trained unemployed teachers.Without naming anyone, Channi, in his public address, said his opponents questioning the rationale behind doling sops in his tenure of the last over two months.“Why it pains anyone if the government gives direct relief to people. After all, it is the public exchequer and it must be spent on the poor and the middle class,” he said, counting his earlier decisions of waiving arrears of electricity, water and sewerage bills to the tune of ₹3,000 crore. “My government’s decision to cut VAT (value added tax) on petrol and diesel and reduce electricity bills has a positive effect on the farmers and the salaried class,” he added.Channi expressed his gratitude to the first-time Congress legislator from Fazilka Davinder Ghubaya for “his role in making me attain the top political office of the state”. “Davinder was instrumental in unseating Amarinder Singh who as CM collaborated with the Akalis. He proved his acumen as he worked well with the MLAs in dethroning Amarinder,” said the CM. Announces medical, govt colleges for Fazilka On Ghubaya’s demand, the CM announced to open a medical college and a government college for the town located near the India-Pakistan border. Channi gave a call to repulse any attempts by the “outsiders” to gain electoral power to ensure inclusive development of Punjab. “Punjab is not a ‘shamlat’ (common) land that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leadership from Delhi could take control of. Punjab should not allow power control to be shifted to Delhi as we are capable of governing the state,” he said.He blamed the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for framing anti-people policies and patronising mafia during its 10-year regime. An arrear of ₹16 crore to sugarcane growers will be disbursed soon, he said.He assured restoration of three heritage buildings and examine the issues of compensation to the farmers whose cultivable land lies beyond the fence on the international border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aam-aadmi-not-elite-should-get-political-power-in-punjab-cmchanni-101638907033777.html

Interacting with mediapersons at the Sri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport in Amritsar, the AAP supremo, who was on one-day visit to Punjab for participation in party programmes in Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur, said, “There are serious allegations of direct involvement of the Congress MLAs, the ministers, including the CM, and their close associates for patronising the sand mafia in the state.” When there are allegations of illegal activities against the ruling party MLAs and ministers, who will protect the interests of the general public, he questioned.“Can the welfare of the people of Punjab be expected from patrons of the mafia? Earlier, the Badals and BJP looted Punjab by patronising all sorts of mafia. In 2017, people expressed their faith in the promises made by the Congress and Captain Amarinder Singh but they too followed in the footsteps of the Badals,” ” he said.“This money being stolen can be used for the welfare of the people, but it is going into the pockets of political leaders instead of the state government’s coffers. Once the AAP forms government in 2022, all sorts of mafia, including illegal sand mining, will be thrown out. The money that is going into the pockets of political leaders from the resources of the state will go to the pockets of women and the elderly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sand-mafia-running-rs-20-000-crore-business-in-punjab-under-congress-leaders-patronage-kejriwal-101638906794811.html

Addressing a gathering in Hoshiarpur, Kejriwal promised free education to every child of SC families and free coaching for their youth to purse professional courses, to bear expenses if a child wants to go abroad for graduation or post-graduation and free medical treatment for members of such households. Also, he reiterated that their government would deposit ₹1,000 per month in the account of every woman aged above 18. He said that all parties had “used” the SC population for their vested interests and deliberately kept them underdeveloped.“Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi is asking for votes by stating that he is also an SC. I may not belong to your community but I still belong to you. I will serve you as a brother,” he told the gathering.He claimed that people of Punjab would forget other parties, once AAP is given a chance to form the government. “I am a great fan of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar and have followed his life. I am here to fulfill his unfinished dreams,” he said.In the last 75 years, leaders and political parties had demolished the government institutions, he added. “If you want improvement in the system, vote for AAP. After coming to power, the AAP will regularise the services of National Health Mission (NHM) employees and guest faculty teachers,” he told the audience.AAP state president Bhagwant Mann said that Kejriwal had come to improve the state of affairs in Punjab. “The AAP is making only those promises which it has already fulfilled in Delhi,” he said. Ridiculing the Congress for highlighting achievements of only the Channi-led government, Mann said that people would take into account its performance of full five years. He reiterated that he was given an offer to join the BJP but he preferred to “keep my head high”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-reaches-out-to-sc-community-announces-4-guarantees-at-hoshiarpur-rally-101638906553105.html
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Contractual transport employees in Punjab start indefinite strike||Bus passengers across the state were a harried lot on Tuesday as the contractual employees of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), Punjab Roadways and Punbus kicked off their indefinite strike.The employees are demanding job regularisation as promised by state authorities in a meeting held on October 12.At least 90% of the services were crippled with buses staying parked at various bus stands. Of the 1,100 buses operated by PRTC, only 10% were operated in different parts of the state. As a result, commuters were forced to hire other modes of transport, including expensive taxis, to reach their destinations.Notably, the state transport department has already directed managements of the state transport undertakings to deploy regular staff, presently on desk jobs, on field duties to minimise the impact of the strike.“Government authorities had assured that the process of job regularisation will be started within 20 days of the last meeting held on October 12. But nothing has proceeded on the ground,” said Harkesh Singh Vicky, vice-president of Roadways/PRTC Contractual Employees Union.“The government has been making lame excuses for the past five years even after promising to bring policies for job regularisation in 2017,” he said.He said during meetings with transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring last month, they were assured that the cabinet will decide on their regularisation, but nothing had been done so far. “Moreover, the Regularisation Act, that the government is contemplating, will prove to be a bane for contractual workers as 90% of employees will not meet its criteria,” Vicky said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contractual-transport-employees-in-punjab-start-indefinite-strike-101638905954225.html

I am sure they will manage to win a maximum of 7-8 seats across the state because people know that the AAP failed to unite itself. When Kejriwal started working with Anna Hazare, there were many people associated with the movement, but everyone left Kejriwal because he is a dictator,” said Badal, talking to the media in Sunam.Earlier in Tapa, he said, “Kejriwal had claimed that he would not make alliance with the Congress, but he had formed a government in Delhi with the Congress’ support. He also announced that he and his MLAs will not take salary, but he increased their salary from ₹25,000 to ₹2 lakh. He is a cheater who also took heavy security. I want to ask Kejriwal why are the announcements that he’s making in Punjab not implemented in Delhi.”Raising questions on the registration drive by AAP to credit ₹1,000 into the account of every woman in Punjab, he said, “If a government will give ₹1,000 to all women, there is no need for registration, but they will cheat. The Delhi CM should tell people if he gave even ₹100 to a single woman in his ruling state. He promises regularisation of all contractual employees in Punjab, but employees have been staging protests for regularisation for the past 10 years in Delhi,” Badal said.The SAD president said they will focus on education and health facilities if they came to power. He also promised that his government will give tubewell connections in the first month to farmers with no connection.Attacking chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Badal said, “He is trying to depict himself as an ‘aam aadmi’, whereas the truth is that he has amassed huge wealth by delineating illegal colonies in the Kharar-Ropar belt, besides engaging in sand mining and various other forms of corruption.”

The competition between the AAP, Congress and SAD has reached a crescendo where honestly one regrets to admit that the level of politics has stooped to a new low,” rued Sharma.Attacking Kejriwal for trying to mislead the public, Sharma said, “The so-called ‘model school’ model touted by Kejriwal is a farce, as one needs to ask him how many schools in Delhi are without principals, teachers and requisite infrastructure.”“The BJP will not merely come out with a manifesto, it will have a commitment plan, where progress and equal opportunity for every citizen will be primary duty of the government. Politics of announcements needs to stop. Statesmanship to bring Punjab back to its glory is needed,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-will-give-punjab-a-road-map-of-progress-says-party-s-punjab-chief-101638905895427.html

It is a right time if both the children meet with each other in a positive environment as the parents are finally independent. The element of silence between the parties will result into mental cruelty to the children, as both the siblings cannot meet with each other. Mental cruelty will blend with irretrievable and dead marriage is a good ground to grant divorce to the parties,” the bench of justice Ritu Bahri and justice Archana Puri observed. In the case in hand, the husband had sought quashing of January 2019 judgment passed by a Sangrur court seeking dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and desertion. The couple got married in April 2005. Their elder son, who is suffering with blood cancer, is living with the husband and minor son with the wife. Both of them are government schoolteachers and developed differences sometime in 2007, which resulted in the wife opting to live separately with younger son in 2011. The husband had termed the wife short-tempered, habitual of leaving her matrimonial home, quarrelling with him and his parents and even the ill child. While the wife had claimed that she was turned away by the husband. The lower court had dismissed his plea holding that grounds of cruelty and desertion do not stand proved on record. In high court, the wife had deposed that she was not ready for divorce with mutual consent. The high court sent matter for mediation, but no positive outcome was coming. The court had to decide whether the husband can get divorce when wife who is staying away for the last 10 years and is still not ready to give mutual divorce and whether, this behaviour in dead marriage or irretrievable broken down the marriage, can be considered as act of mental cruelty towards the husband. The court found that despite illness, the child living with his father has done academically well, which showed father’s dedication. But he did not make any effort to meet his second child all the while. However, after hearings, the court found that the husband and wife cannot stay together. The court observed that if the appeal filed by the husband is dismissed, he will face mental agony with his son, who is ill and requires repeated checkups and treatments from various hospitals, expenses of which are also being borne by the father. “If the parents are not granted divorce, then both the children will not be able to meet each other in a positive environment. This will further result in cruelty because of the rigid attitude in giving divorce,” the court said, adding that now, the parents can plan shared parenting so both the children can meet with each other being real brothers and interact with each other. The court allowed the plea, directing the husband that he would make a fixed deposit of ₹5lakh in the name of the minor son living with his wife.

Additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi has issued a notice to the state to file a reply and the case was adjourned to December 17. Sharma asked the court to give directions to the SIT to file a status report with regard to the investigation carried out in FIR 129 (registered against protestors) and FIR 130 (registered against cops) to date in view of the statement made by sub-inspector Amarjit Singh. Last week, SIT members, replying to another application, told the court that further investigation in both the FIRs registered in connection with the Behbal Kalan firing is underway. Last month, Sharma had filed an application seeking direction to police to conduct a further investigation with regard to injuries suffered by cops as well as damage to public property at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015. Sharma said during the proceedings on December 3, SI Amarjit Singh, who has come from the SIT, got recorded his statement in the court. “From the said statement, it was revealed that the investigation of the FIR 129 and FIR 130 is still going on even after six years. As per the provisions of the CrPC, the investigation agency is to conduct the probe in a fair manner promptly and expeditiously by adopting a sensitive approach and thereafter to submit a report under Section 173 of the CrPC or cancellation report as the case may be within a reasonable,” he said. “In the reply to application, SIT member SSP Satinder Singh admitted that he received the MLRs of some police officials and recorded their statements. However, as per the SIT’s statement, investigation is still going on, meaning there is an unnecessary delay in completing investigation reasons best known to the probe team. The facts clearly show that the SIT is sitting over the investigation and has not been conducting the probe in a proper and fair manner,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-ex-ssp-files-petition-seeking-status-report-on-sit-probe-101638905652918.html
08-12-2021||Chandigarh||Capt, SAD target Cong for naming Maken as screening panel head||Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday lashed out at the Congress high command for appointing Ajay Maken as the chairman of the screening committee for shortlisting candidates for the next Vidhan Sabha elections in Punjab.In a statement, Capt Amarinder said that Maken is the nephew of Lalit Maken, whose name figured in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. He also said that Maken was not qualified enough to head the screening committee with veteran leaders like Ambika Soni and Sunil Jakhar being kept under him. He said Maken had presided over the two successive defeats of the party in Delhi assembly elections. “With someone who has presided over virtual wiping out of the party in Delhi, now being handed over the job in Punjab, the fate of the party can be anybody’s guess,” he said.This clearly indicates that the party has admitted to defeat before the elections by appointing a failed politician, who lost 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, losing even his deposit in the Vidhan Sabha, said Amarinder.‘Gandhi family bent on rehabilitating kin of leaders responsible for 1984 riots’ The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said the Gandhi family was bent upon rehabilitating kin of party leaders responsible for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. “With appointment Ajay Maken as the party’s screening committee chairman for allotment of tickets to party candidates for the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab, the Congress high command has again sent a signal to the Sikh community that it would continue to patronise such elements,” said SAD’s former minister Bikram Singh Majithia. Majithia said the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties had nominated 227 persons responsible for leading the rampage against the Sikhs out of which Maken’s name was prominent. The move proves that it was the policy of the Gandhi family to reward leaders who had massacred Sikhs at its command in 1984 to top posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-sad-target-cong-for-naming-maken-as-screening-panel-head-101638905472909.html

08-12-2021||Pune||Demand for booster Covid vax doses on the rise with Omicron variant lurking||PUNE Even as the state government is pushing the centre to provide booster Covid vaccine doses for the vulnerable population, the city’s major private hospitals are getting requests for the same from their own staff, as well as people who want to travel abroad for various reasons; or from people who believe that a booster dose would give them extra protection. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) and several senior ministers in state government have also written to the centre to allow a booster dose for healthcare workers and the frontline population. Several studies have shown that the antibodies wane after a few months. With the new Omicron variant, the demand for a booster dose has risen. Dr Sanjay Patil, IMA, Pune chapter, and hospital board chairperson said, “Back in November the IMA had written to the central government to give booster or third doses to the healthcare and frontline workers who received their second shot of the vaccine months ago. Several studies have shown that the antibodies wane after a period of time and with the new variant coming in, it is important that those who are in direct contact with the patient are given extra protection. Along with this, the vulnerable population must also be given a third dose of the vaccine.” Major city hospitals are now getting queries for booster shots. Dr Avdhut Bodhamwad, medical superintendent at Ruby Hall clinic said, “Most people who took the vaccine at private hospitals at the time took it for safety purposes unlike now when people are taking if to get access to the malls or for transportation. We have a lot of stock pending with us as no more takers are there for paid vaccinations and on the other hand we also have people who want to take a third shot as an extra layer of protection, but we cannot give it to them until the government approves it.” On Tuesday state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted that he has written to the central health minister Mansukh Mandaviya. In the letter he requested the central government allow those frontline workers and healthcare workers who have received both the doses early in the year, a third shot at their studied desire. Also, to reduce the vaccination age from the current 18 years to 15 years of age as this will give secondary and junior colleges vaccine protection, as doctors have approved the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/demand-for-booster-covid-vax-doses-on-the-rise-with-omicron-variant-lurking-101638903078580.html

The latest order by the commission is likely to affect over 900 industries in the 14 NCR districts of Haryana which are using unapproved fuels, according to the Haryana government data.The commission said that violating industries or industrial units will not be permitted to operate till December 12. “The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas has issued directions for immediate closure of all such industries located in industrial areas where PNG infrastructure and supply are available but have still not switched over to the cleaner fuel. As per the directions of the commission, these violating industries or industrial units will not be permitted to schedule their operations till December 12, and the position will be reviewed for further decisions,” the CAQM said in a statement. According to the statement, the flying squads of CAQM will also launch special drives and inspect sites to ensure compliance of the directions. Till Sunday, a total of 576 sites were visited by the flying squads, of which 111 units were identified for immediate closure, which include 23 sites in the NCR districts of Haryana. Meanwhile, the Gurugram Industrial Association has written to the CAQM seeking representation from the industry in the commission before issuing directions and relief for industries not running on PNG/cleaner fuels. JN Mangla, president of the Gurugram Industrial Association who sent the letter on Monday, said, “The directions are issued without any consultations with the industry. In many places, there is no infrastructure for supply of PNG or other cleaner fuels. New directions every week impact our work and deliveries get affected. Food processing industries and those who process raw material for wine get affected. The work of the garment industry also gets affected as there are specific timelines for delivery of orders.” The association wrote the letter after the CAQM on December 2 directed that industrial units in NCR, not running on PNG or cleaner fuels, shall be allowed to operate only up to eight hours a day from Monday to Friday and shall not be allowed to operate on Saturdays and Sundays. At present, this remains applicable to those industrial units, where there is no supply of PNG. The letter by the Gurugram association also mentions that the National Green Tribunal had earlier approved agro-based fuels due to the reduced ill effect on the environment, therefore, requesting CAQM to allow industries running on such fuel to operate. “We humbly request you to consider the option of industries running on agro-based fuel like mustard husk, rice husk, saw dust and who have simultaneously implemented pollution control and monitoring mechanisms to be granted relief...” states the letter. “We are only requesting the CAQM to discuss issues with the industrial association also once to get our perspective before directions are issued. Most of the industries follow all the norms, but they have to use DG sets at times, when power supply gets disconnected. Same is with using non-cleaner fuels, as it is mostly because of lack of infrastructure available to us. If we are allowed to operate for only eight hours, then our work gets affected as in some industries, the heating up and starting of the machine itself takes up to eight hours and that is why the machines are on continuously,” said Mangla. Parveen Yadav, president of Gurgaon Udyog Association, said, “As the Covid-19 situation improved this year, the garment industry has started showing signs of revival. But with such norms and fixed working hours, it will be very difficult to deliver the orders on time. The delay will further affect our payments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/caqm-order-shutting-unclean-fuel-units-affects-900-in-haryana-101638902894340.html

Several families, of both brides and bridegrooms, who have weddings planned are now worried about inviting people, as they fear restrictions on the number of people being allowed to attend wedding. The scheduled weddings are in December, January and February. Another citizen Ramesh Pandhare said, “Our daughter’s wedding was scheduled on January 5 and it was going to happen in Bengalure, Karnataka. As Covid cases and specially the Omicron variant cases are coming up, both families have decided to postpone the wedding for few months. We want to have a grand wedding for our daughter, but if Covid restrictions are there, many celebrations cannot be done.”While marriage hall owners are also getting postponements and cancellations, Kiran Sakpal owner of Shantai wedding hall and lawns in Hadapsar said, “There were seven wedding bookings for this month and January 2021, of which already two weddings are postponed. Families are worried about the new Covid Omicron variant. Crowding would lead to the spread of virus and so to avoid it these weddings have been either been postponed or canceled.

08-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram namaz row: Muslim groups reject new proposed sites||A day after a Hindu and a Muslim group recommended to the district administration that the Friday namaz could be held at 12 mosques and six rented sites in the city to resolve the standoff, at least two Muslim groups on Tuesday said they did not agree with the proposal.The members of the Gurgaon Muslim Council said they were instead planning to offer namaz at all the 37 sites designated by the administration for namaz in 2018.On Monday, the district administration said it would examine the proposal received from the members of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti and the Muslim Rashtriya Manch to resolve the long-pending row over Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram.Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson, Gurgaon Muslim Council, which has been representing the Muslim groups, however, alleged that their consent was not taken before submitting the proposal.“We have requested the deputy commissioner to not consider their proposal as we do not agree with the terms offered by them. We will offer namaz at the 37 sites identified by the administration,” he said. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform Friday namaz. However, in November first week, the number of sites was brought down to 20 after right-wing organisations protested against the prayers.Ahmad said a press conference will be organised on the issue in Delhi on Wednesday.“Despite repeated assurance from district administration that ‘Juma namaz’ in open public spaces will continue till the Muslim community gets a practical and viable alternative, there have been open threats by members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti that they will disrupt all Juma namaaz in open spaces from December 10, onwards. No police or legal action has been taken against three people for their open and blatant threats and hate-mongering against the Muslim community,” said Ahmad.The group last week filed police complaints against three right-wing activists for hurting the sentiments of the community.Mufti Mohd Saleem, president of Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind, Gurgaon division, said their repeated submissions to administration that the Muslim Rashtriya Manch did not represent the Muslim citizens of Gurugram, have been ignored. “How can a handful of maulvis claim to represent the 150-plus Maulvis who had been organizing peaceful and orderly Juma namaaz for years. There are approximately four lakh Muslims in Gurugram, and who has given the right to take a decision on their behalf that to reduce namaaz sites from 37 to zero. Why we were not informed regarding the meeting, it was an absolutely fraudulent and illegal meeting, held secretly and in a suspicious manner,” he said.Haji Shehzad Khan, the chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, another Muslim group, said the proposal is impractical and likely to create severe problems for the citizens. “We reject any and all such agreements done behind closed doors. We have requested Haryana chief minister and the district administration to constitute a representative ‘Aman Committee’, and resolve this matter in a mutually consultative way. We will continue to offer Juma namaaz at all the 37 sites agreed upon in 2018, and demand that the district administration ensures that law and order is maintained,” he said.Khurshid Rajaka, coordinator of Gurugram Imam Sanghathan, and also the national convener of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said he has been raising the issue since 2013, but this is the first time that people were trying to give it a “communal colour”. “I have been regularly raising the issues of Muslims in Gurugram. I had taken permission to offer Eid namaz in 2014, and since then I have been resolving related issues,” he said.“For maintaining communal harmony, we have reduced the sites so that the present issue can be resolved. No one can use a public place for puja or namaz without the consent of locals or the authorities. Some Muslims are trying to give it a political angle . We have identified nine sites, and we are ready to pay the rent,” he said.Members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti and Gurugram Imam Sanghathan organised a press conference on Tuesday at PWD rest house and said that namaz in open spaces was not legally permissible, and that people should not be allowed to offer prayers in public places.Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor of Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, a Hindu umbrella body leading protests against namaz in open spaces, said, “We have even offered to pay rent for the sites which the administration will identify for Muslims to offer their prayers on Fridays. We are looking for a solution so that the issue can be resolved,” he said.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said some members of the Muslim groups met him on Tuesday and handed over a letter. “We will review the proposals and will try to resolve this issue at the earliest. We will ensure that sentiments and interests of every community are safeguarded,” he said.The Gurugram Police said they have not received any application or request that Muslims will offer namaz at 37 sites this Friday. “We will deploy the force according to the plan sent by the district administration,” said a senior police officer, asking not to be named.Over the past three months, right-wing groups have tried to disrupt namaz being performed in open spaces in sectors 47, 12, 37 and Sirhaul Village. On November 5, Hindu groups organised a Govardhan Puja at the site in Sector 12A, where namaz used to be offered on Fridays. The protesters also performed a havan at a site designated for holding the Friday prayers in Sector 37, and also disrupted the namaz in Sirhaul Village, Sector 18.
08-12-2021||Other||Gurugram: Red light violation detection cameras operational only at five locations||More than three months after the installation of red light violation detection (RLVD) cameras at 25 locations across the city, these devices are currently operational at only five spots. Many of these cameras have not been put to use yet for reasons such as lack of road markings and delay in linking them to the control centre, said traffic police officials on Tuesday.“Currently, the RLVD cameras are functional at only five locations. At some points, we want to complete road markings such as zebra crossings and speed limit signages before making them operational, while at other places trees and poles obstruct the view. We are aiming to make the rest of the cameras functional by early next year,” said Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gurugram.The cameras are currently operational at Galleria market, Huda City Centre, Kanhai Chowk, Jharsa Chowk, and Rajesh Pilot Marg.On December 22 last year, the Gurugram traffic police and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) announced that they started installing RLVD cameras across the city. Overall, 315 such cameras had to be installed at 30 key locations in the city such as Iffco Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, and Subhash Chowk. By June, RLVD cameras were installed at 13 locations, and by August at 25 locations across the city, the officials said, adding that about 10 such cameras were installed at each location.Tomar said that at the five operational spots, the number of daily fines has witnessed a 10-fold increase. “Through the RLVD cameras, there is a 24x7 monitoring of the five crossings by officials deputed at the traffic tower in Sushant Lok 1 and GMDA’s integrated command and control centre (ICCC). As soon as a violation is observed, an e-challan is issued against the owner of the vehicle,” said Tomar.Jumping traffic signals attracts a fine of ₹5,000, the officials said.According to GMDA officials, besides the 25 points, the installation of RLVD cameras at Khushboo Chowk, Ambedkar Chowk, Pataudi Chowk, Basai flyover, and Sitaram Singla Chowk is still in process.“At some points such as Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk, traffic signals have been removed altogether. However, by then work on installing the cameras at these points had already commenced. We are now using RLVD cameras at these points for security surveillance instead,” said a GMDA official overseeing the project, seeking anonymity.The traffic signals at Iffco Chowk have been removed after two U-turn flyovers came up there, while at Rajiv Chowk, jersey barriers are being used to divert the traffic, the traffic police officials said.The GMDA official quoted above said that at 13 more points, besides the five functional points, all requisite measures are completed barring the laying of optical lines. “Work on laying of optical lines at 13 locations is remaining which would directly link them to the ICCC and traffic tower. Work on this is likely to be completed by March next year,” said the official.Residents said that in the absence of RLVD cameras, the jumping of traffic signals continues to remain a constant violation. “There are several intersections across the city such as Genpact Chowk, Bristol Chowk, Vatika Chowk, and Gurjar Rajesh Pilot Chowk where the violation is rampant. Even after the signals turn green at one side, one has to wait for five to 10 seconds before proceeding as commuters from the opposite direction continue to drive through,” said Harshit Pandit, a resident of Sector 70.
08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi-NCR opens hearts and hearths for strays in winter||New Delhi The season of chills is a challenge for many humans, and even for the furry beings. In such a scenario, imagine the plight of strays on the streets, who often have to battle bone-chilling temperature including unexpected winter showers. Cooped up in corners sans warmth, they often call out for help. And a few good Samaritans in Delhi-NCR have heard their pleas, and taken it upon themselves to provide some warmth to these pawfect beings! “Dogs make our lives whole. In fact every animal out there gives meaning to the word ‘love’ for me,” says Sanchita Vohra, an animal lover based in Rajouri Garden, who takes care of food and warm bedding for a bunch of stray dogs in the lane where she lives. “These doggos aren’t as privileged as us and need just a little more than love to survive the cold. A simple jute bori (gunny bag) or any old sweater of yours could be a new lease of life for them. I’m also inviting them inside my home. Since it’s not easy to stay warm when hungry, I’m making sure their bellies are full. We need to allow them in our buildings, if possible, and give them lot’s of love to make them survive the winter.” Also providing jute bags to stray animals, alongside warm milk, is North Delhi-based Shivam Khatri, from the NGO Animal Lovers Foundation. “We focus on animal rescue, awareness campaigns, free sterilisation drives, and free anti-rabies vaccination drives. But for winter, we are specifically providing the stray with jute bags as they are cost effective and keep them warm. Stray animals need more than just leftover rotis when it’s the winter season. So, we provide warm food including rice, chicken, rotis, milk, paneer, eggs, and even dog biscuits. Regular health check ups are also done to ensure they are fit and fine. And in case of any injury, we try to provide them the required treatment, and look after them to the best of our ability.” Lighting up bonfire every evening, near his home in New Friends Colony, so that the strays can sit along and get warm, is Vikas Gautam from Love For Animals Lord Buddha Foundation. He runs an animal shelter in Noida, works for animal welfare in Delhi as well, and has distributed around 2,000 waterproof bora beds and 2,500 dog coats since this winter started setting in. Gautam says, “Every year, many strays die due to cold. On an average, almost 40% old animals which include not just dogs but even cows and other animals, and half of new-born animals such as puppies and calves die. Disabled and old animals also get very slim chances of surviving winters since they can’t move to warmer spots so easily. Recently, I took an old female visually-impaired indie dog from Palam Colony in south west Delhi to my home; she was shivering badly and had visibly not eaten anything since days.We are trying to save her.” Likewise, many of us can do just a little bit to save strays from the winter wrath. Here’s how you can help strays in chilly weather:- If you have the facility, provide them with shelter, which is the most important on cold nights and mornings.- Gunny bags, jute sacks, and thick bedsheets for good bedding for strays, so spread them out.- Be aware and proactive about injuries and frost bites in winters. Contact your local NGO or a caretaker, if they are not being already taken care of.- Cats often take refuge in car hoods, so before starting your car in the morning, give the hood a knock so they can come out.- Leave food and water out if you can. Roti and bread become hard in winters, so keep kibbles or dal-rice (without chilli powder and salt). If you are going on a feeding round, warm up some milk and give them before it gets cold.(Inputs by Pooja Advani, animal expert and canine behaviouralist)Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-opens-hearts-and-hearths-for-strays-in-winter-101638902356286.html

Keeping in view the need to enforce strict actions against the deteriorating air quality of the region, the commission believes that there is an urgent need to take further preventive measures, as a matter of extreme emergency and abundant caution.”In a set of directions issued on November 16, CAQM ordered all industries in the NCR having access to gas infrastructure to not run on any other fuel, failing which they will be shut down. It was also directed that all industries in NCR where gas connectivity is available will immediately be shifted to gas and state governments were asked to provide details of their switch to the cleaner fuel.In December last year, the commission directed all industrial units in Delhi to switch over to piped natural gas by January 31, 2021. About 1,600 of the industrial units spread across 50 industrial areas in Delhi were then identified for the switch over to PNG. The commission stressed the need to switch over by all identified industries in Delhi, saying use of other fuels is one of the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi and the NCR.Enforcement reviewMore than 1,800 old vehicles were impounded and over 25,000 polluting vehicles were fined in Delhi between November 17 and December 6, the latest action taken report assessing the pollution control measures by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has shown.“The pollution control drive was carried out in two stages. The report of the action taken between November 17 and November 25 has already been submitted before the Supreme Court and the CAQM. The second phase, carried out between November 26 and December 6, will be submitted on December 8 (Wednesday),” a senior official of the DPCC said on Tuesday.As Delhi witnessed its most polluted November since 2015, when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started recording the air quality index for the Capital, the Supreme Court the CAQM issued detailed measures for Delhi and NCR states to curb the rising pollution levels. These steps included a ban on the construction activities, closure of all schools, colleges and educational institutions, ban on the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items into Delhi and scheduled operations for thermal power plants operating in the NCR.According to the DPCC assessment, 1,882 aged vehicles (diesel vehicles older than 15 years and petrol vehicles older than 10 years) were impounded in the city since November 17, when CAQM issued a set of restrictions for Delhi and NCR states to control the rising air pollution levels in the region.Besides this, 25, 616 polluting vehicles or those vehicles that did not have the Pollution Under Control certificates were also fined.The review showed that at least 15,324 trucks carrying non-essential items were stopped at various Delhi borders.

08-12-2021||Mumbai||Mayor objects to BJP MLA’s comment, women’s commission takes suo moto cognisance||The Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) has asked the Mumbai police commissioner to submit a factual report about an alleged objectionable remark passed by BJP leader Ashish Shelar about Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar in connection with the November 30 cylinder blast in Worli. Meanwhile, Pednekar has also written to Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil that she is filing a police complaint in the matter.On November 30, a fire broke out after a gas cylinder exploded at around 7.10am at BDD chawl number 03, Kamgar Vasahat, on Ganpatrao Jadhav Marg in Worli. Four persons were admitted, of which three died including a four-month-old boy, and Vishnu Puri, 5, remains the sole survivor after reporting 15 to 20% burn injuries. Post the tragedy, Shelar, while addressing a press conference on December 4, slammed the mayor for visiting the site nearly 72 hours after the incident. Shelar allegedly remarked, “Where were you (the mayor) sleeping for these many hours?” Pednekar took exception to his mention of the word ‘sleeping’. In her letter to Dilip Walse Patil, she wrote, “The mayor of Mumbai is the first citizen and it is a very important post. The term used to describe me as a woman mayor is objectionable.” The letter stated that Shelar’s remark insulted not only Pednekar but other women as well and hence, she planned to file a police complaint.Responding in the matter, the BJP issued a statement that the party has filed a complaint with the Mumbai police as a few people having links with the Shiv Sena morphed Shelar’s video and deliberately insulted Pednekar in the process.Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and BJP spokesperson in the BMC, said, “We have filed a police complaint in the matter considering what Shelar has said is there on YouTube. He has used the term ‘sleeping’ for the system and not for the mayor. But a few people have morphed the video, thereby insulting the mayor. On Wednesday, we are also going to visit the state women’s commission office to complain regarding the same.”In a separate development, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday ordered a probe into the allegations made by the BJP against mayor Kishori Pednekar.Earlier on November 30, the BJP claimed that the mayor’s office delayed the procurement of emergency medicines required for the treatment of mosquito-borne diseases.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health, BMC, on Tuesday said that two officials of the rank of deputy municipal commissioner (DMC) will carry out the investigation and a report will be submitted within two weeks. “The investigation will be conducted to find out who is the actual culprit behind the delay in procuring the medicines,” Kakani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mayor-objects-to-bjp-mla-s-comment-women-s-commission-takes-suo-moto-cognisance-101638902172707.html

08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi hospitals feel the squeeze as resident doctors’ strike enters 11th day||With the strike by resident doctors entering its 11th day on Tuesday, both Delhi residents and those arriving from neighbouring states and are in need of urgent medical care are facing difficulties as the emergency wings of several big Delhi hospitals are barely functional. The resident doctors have been striking work since last Saturday over delays in NEET-2021 PG counselling, which is now pending the outcome of a batch of petitions being heard by the Supreme Court over economic reservations. The strike started last Saturday with doctors boycotting work in out-patient clinics, but it later escalated to boycott of all routine work such as care of admitted patients and routine surgeries as they received no written assurance from the Union health minister, who said the matter is now sub judice. Doctors from Central government-run hospitals such as Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and Safdarjung withdrew from emergency services from Monday, leaving the emergency wing of the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences flooded with patients. Seventy-five-year-old Geeta Colony resident Sudhir, who goes by one name, was brought to the emergency department of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on Tuesday morning with fits. After waiting for hours, he was given a medicine and asked to go to either AIIMS or Lok Nayak Hospital. “The doctors said he needed admission, but because of a strike they cannot take him in. They asked us to go to AIIMS but all ambulances were either refusing to take us or charging over ₹1,000. I don’t know what to do,” said his daughter Preeti. An ambulance driver from Delhi government’s Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) blamed long queues at the AIIMS emergency for their reluctance. “Last night, I took a patient to AIIMS and had to wait at the hospital for over 1.5 hours because there were no trolleys to carry the patient in. Many family members were laying patients on the floor outside. All big hospitals are now referring emergency patients to AIIMS because of the strike,” said the driver, on condition of anonymity. A guard on duty near the hospital’s emergency department said no patient was being treated in the outpatient clinics— they are all being sent to the emergency department if urgent care was needed. “The senior doctors are giving some first aid and care, sometimes on the trolley outside, and then referring patients to other hospitals,” the guard said. A guard on duty at Safdarjung Hospital’s emergency department said all patients were being turned away. “We have been asked to turn away patients; even the serious ones. We ask them to go to either AIIMS or Pt Madan Mohan Malviya hospital. What can we do, there are very few doctors left to take care of the already admitted patients,” the guard said. Outside the emergency department of the hospital, Yogesh Kumar was sitting on a parapet with his cousin Shyam Vir on a stretcher nearby. Shyam Vir met with an accident in end-November and has a shattered tibia and fibula (leg bones), along with infection. “We took him to the government hospital in Jaipur where his CT scan and X-rays were done, the pus drained, and the wound dressed. He needed a surgery, but the doctors went on a strike the next day onwards. So we decided to come to Delhi. But, now we hear that doctors here are also on strike. We were asked to come to the hospital on Tuesday for the surgery, but now they have asked us to come back on Friday,” said Kumar. The NEET-2021 PG examinations that usually happen in May were delayed this year because of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country. While the exams were finally conducted in September, the counselling was postponed because of a batch of petitions in the Supreme Court on the economic reservation for candidates. The health minister and other ministry officials have said they cannot provide any written assurances as the matter is sub judice. On Tuesday, as the boycott of hospital emergencies continued, hospitals have started warning that all resident doctors hired on ad hoc basis will face disciplinary action, including termination from service. “All resident doctors who are appointed on ad hoc basis are informed that they cannot indulge themselves nor participate in any strike activity. Non-observance of rules attracts disciplinary action as deemed fit, including termination,” read a circular from the RML hospital. But resident doctors said they will continue with the strike. “The delays in NEET PG counselling has not only left 42,000 MBBS doctor awaiting admissions but has resulted in a shortfall of one-third of resident doctors in medical college hospitals. The resident doctors are the backbone of the services provided at these hospitals and the ones on calla re overburdened,” said a doctor on strike, requesting anonymity.

Due to the ongoing strike of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), students from rural areas are not able to travel to cities and colleges for admission. The state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said, “As per the demand by the students and their parents to give an extension for engineering admissions, and after discussion with state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, it has been decided to give an extension for engineering admissions.” Currently, the admission process for various engineering courses for the academic year 2021-22 is going on and the deadline was December 16. It was demanded to extend the date till December 20 or 25. The detailed schedule of the new admission extension has not yet declared by the department. “This decision has given a relief to lakhs of students across the state, as there are several issues students are facing this time in getting admission. Right from getting all the necessary documents to reaching college has become difficult for students due to the MSRTC strike and closed ST bus services,” said Raju Kshirsagar a student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/last-date-for-engineering-admissions-extended-due-to-msrtc-strike-101638902007267.html
08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Presence in mob enough to prove guilt, says court||The first accused in the cases pertaining to the north-east Delhi riots was found guilty by the court due to his sheer presence in the mob despite there being no direct evidence against him, according to the order in the case that was uploaded on the district court’s website on Tuesday.On Monday, additional sessions judge Virendra Bhatt held a 25-year old man guilty of setting on fire a 73-year old woman’s house in Gokalpuri during the communal violence that erupted in several localities of north-east Delhi in February last year.The court convicted Dinesh Yadav alias Michael, for being a member of an unlawful assembly, rioting, rioting armed with deadly weapon, house trespass, robbery and mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house. The maximum punishment under these sections entails a jail term of up to ten years.Holding Yadav guilty, additional sessions judge Virendra Bhatt has said that his presence with a wooden rod in the mob indicated that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly, i.e to attack the other community.The court said the fact that the accused also belongs to Hindu community and was present with a wooden rod, in the mob that resorted to violence against the Muslims, indicates that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly.“The circumstances in which the members of Muslim community were identified and beaten, their vehicles damaged and their houses broken, robbed and set ablaze by the rioters comprising the members of the other community coupled with the object of the unlawful assembly i.e to assault the Muslims and damage their properties and the fact that the accused was seen among the rioters armed with a wooden rod, are sufficient to indicate beyond any doubt that he too shared the common object..,” the court said while convicting Yadav on Monday.The judge said even though the testimony of police officers and the two eyewitnesses to the incident revealed that Yadav did not take any active part in vandalising, looting or putting on fire the house of the complainant, however, it cannot be said that he was only a bystander or a passive spectator at the spot of incident.The judge said that even though there is no evidence on record to indicate the direct commission of offence, yet Yadav is guilty of all those crimes which have been committed by the members of the mob for the reason that he shared the common object of other members of the assembly.“There is nothing on record to show that the accused had disassociated himself from the unlawful assembly and he did not share the common object of the assembly. It does not appear that his presence at the incident spot was only because he is a resident of that very area..,” the court said in a 13-page order.Yadav was arrested in June 2020, and the charges in the case were framed on August 1, 2021. There were 12 prosecution witnesses who were examined during the trial.According to the prosecution, Yadav was an “active member of the riotous mob” and took active participation in vandalising and setting on fire the house of a 73-year-old woman named Manori on the night of February 25.The woman, who was the complainant in the matter, alleged that a mob of around 150-200 rioters attacked her house when her family was not present, and looted all the articles including a buffalo.Earlier, in July, a city court passed its first judgment in the riots cases, and acquitted a man accused of rioting, unlawful assembly, and dacoity. Accused in two cases, that were being probed by the local police, were given clean chit by the court even before the trial started.Communal clashes broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020, after a standoff between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and opposers got out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-presence-in-mob-enough-to-prove-guilt-says-court-101638901514285.html
08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: City breathes easy as fast winds, rain clean air||Delhi’s air quality improved to the “poor” category on Tuesday due to faster wind speeds, a good “mixing height” of pollutants, and the impact of light showers in the early hours of Monday, according to scientists across agencies monitoring the city’s weather and pollution levels.The average air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday was 255 – the lowest since October 27, when the AQI was 232 -- according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily 4pm bulletin.AQI is not expected to worsen over the next three days due to moderate winds even as the temperature will continue to dip. Delhi’s AQI was 322 (very poor) on Monday and 305 on Sunday, CPCB data showed.Also Read| Delhi govt approves formation of task force to enforce steps to curb pollutionGufran Beig, founder and project director at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said wind speeds remained fairly good over Delhi, with the mixing height touching 1.5km on Tuesday.Mixing height is an invisible boundary layer of the atmosphere within which movement of air and particles can take place, including dispersion of pollutants. The lower the mixing height, the lesser the room for pollutants to disperse.“A high mixing height allows greater room for pollutants to move and disperse freely. The lower it is, the closer pollutants get trapped to the surface. Wind speed will remain similar for the next three days,” says Beig, adding that while the temperature was beginning to dip again, it was still above normal. “Once temperature falls below the normal mark, pollution levels may rise again. The drizzle on Sunday and Monday may have also helped,” he said.Safar, in its daily forecast, said winds are expected to remain moderate until December 11, increasing ventilation, with the mixing height likely to be between 1km and 1.5km.“The net effect is that air quality for the next four days likely to improve gradually but will stay within the ‘poor’ category,” said Safar.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 25.1 degrees Celsius on Monday – one degree above normal, while the minimum was 11.4 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal for this time of the season. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed touched 15 km/hr during the day, with clear skies allowing greater visibility.“Visibility was over 3,000 metres, which was only seen in November on one day. Wind speed was 15 km/hr, which is expected to have helped bring down pollution to an extent. Colder northwesterly winds are blowing at the moment and this will lead to a drop in temperature in the coming days,” said R.K Jenamani, scientist at the India Meteorological Department.IMD forecast minimum temperature to drop down to around 9 degrees Celsius by Saturday, with the maximum touching 23 degrees Celsius by the weekend.The ministry of earth sciences Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, meanwhile, has forecast that AQI may even improve to “moderate” by Wednesday before rising back to the “poor” category on Thursday.Also Read| Air quality panel orders closure of all NCR industries not using clean fuelAn AQI between 101 and 200 is classified as “moderate”, between 201 and 300 “poor”, between 301 and 400 “very poor” and over 400 “severe” on CPCB’s air quality index.Delhi has so far recorded 12 ‘severe’ air days since November 1 -- 11 in November, and one in December.Meanwhile, Santosh Harish, Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, noted that emergency responses, such as shutting down schools and stopping construction activities, continue to remaining in place, despite air quality improving to the ‘poor’ category. “The whole idea of Grap (Graded Response Action Plan) was to take these emergency measures based on the PM 2.5 and PM 10 readings. Even when there has been improvement, these measures have not been lifted, whereas they should have. There seems to be no trigger on when to escalate and de-escalate measures based on Grap and we need to look into this,” said Harish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-city-breathes-easy-as-fast-winds-rain-clean-air-101638901274938.html
08-12-2021||Delhi||DU panel points to over-admissions as major drawback of cutoff based system||To bolster its argument for a common entrance test to admit students to undergraduate courses of Delhi University, the committee deliberating on admissions reforms has highlighted the issue of over-admissions plaguing colleges year after year, under the current cut-off based admissions process. College heads said while any alternative to the present admission mechanism would require detailed discussions and deliberations, there was no doubt that a solution was needed for over-admissions. While outlining the issues pertaining to cutoffs and the variation in marks allocated by different boards, the report prepared by the nine-member committee said, “Since admissions at the undergraduate level are cut-off based, it is difficult to control over-admissions beyond the sanctioned strength as applicants who are eligible within that cut off are all entitled for admission to a particular course of study.” It further said dissuading prospective applicants from their right to be admitted to a course of their choice, upon meeting the cutoff, would not be appropriate. The report also shared this year’s admission numbers for popular courses across colleges. Many of these courses ended up over-admitting students, the data showed. Colleges that saw over-admission included those with popular courses as well as those that had reduced cutoffs in subsequent lists after seats remained vacant in the first and second lists. North Campus’s Hindu College saw over-admissions in multiple courses such as history and physics. The college has 49 sanctioned seats in BA (Honours) Political Science but recorded 146 admissions. In BSc (Honours) Physics, the college admitted 210 seats against 79 sanctioned seats. For BA (Honours) Mathematics, the college admitted 185 students against 49 sanctioned seats. College principal Anju Srivastava said while she was yet to go through the panel’s interim report, over-admission needed to be looked into for better utilization of resources. “We build structures on the basis of a certain sanctioned strength. When the strength goes overboard, accommodating more number of students in the same class puts a lot of pressure on resources, especially lab facilities,” said Srivastava. She further said that admitting a higher number of students also affected the teacher-student ratio adversely, and in consequence, the learning mechanism. “The teacher-student ratio is affected because we get teachers on the basis of the sanctioned strength, not the actual strength. This can affect the quality of learning,” said Srivastava. Other colleges such as Miranda House and College of Vocational studies, among others, also recorded over-admissions. College of Vocational Studies ended up admitting 263 students against 96 sanctioned seats. Whereas Miranda House admitted 232 students in BSc (Honours) Physics against 86 seats. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said the college ended up over admitting nearly 250 students for BCom. “We have around 140 seats across all categories for the course but ended up admitting around 250 students after reducing the cutoff by 1%. When the cutoff was high, the seats were vacant and when we reduced it by a percentage point, we ended up over admitting students,” said Khanna. He said it was difficult to estimate admission intake since a high number of students could get admitted even with a minor change in the cutoff. “Right now, over-admissions continue to be a concern. An alternative is certainly needed,” he said. At Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the Bcom (Honours) saw 216 admissions against a sanctioned seat strength of 154. Hem Chand Jain, principal of the college, said they have recorded over-admissions in nearly all categories. “In some of the reserved categories, we admitted nearly 2.5 times more students than the sanctioned strength. In a system based on percentages, we have to admit all students meeting the cutoff criteria. We are not left with a choice and there is no way out of over-admissions,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-panel-points-to-over-admissions-as-major-drawback-of-cutoff-based-system-101638900673640.html
08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board to set up 70 more modern water extraction wells near Sonia Vihar||Delhi water minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday inspected multiple “modern extraction wells” installed near the Sonia Vihar water treatment plant , and said that the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) will install 70 more such structures to augment the water supply in the city.Jain said that the government has already constructed 30 “modern extraction wells” which can provide 6-8 times more water than ordinary wells. “The modern wells are designed in such a way that water gets purified within the premises and does not require any additional water treatment... The capacity of each well is to supply 1.2-1.6 million gallons of water per day (MGD). This will help resolve the problem of drinking water in east Delhi areas,” said Jain.A DJB official said that the new wells were constructed as part of a pilot project. “Ordinary wells have a diameter of 0.3 metre while these new wells have a diameter of 1-1.5 metres and a depth of 30 metres. The groundwater will be automatically replenished during the rainy season, so the extraction of water from the well will not have much effect on groundwater levels,” the official said. The official said that the wells were built by DJB in collaboration with Public Works Department, and the Flood and Irrigation Department.DJB operates nine water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Haiderpur, Sonia Vihar, Bhagirathi WTP, Okhla, Nangloi, Dwarka and Bawana to supply 935 MGD potable water every day. Delhi currently faces a shortfall of over 300MGD in estimated daily demand and supply even as the government plans to initiate 24x7 water supply.At the same time, large parts of the Delhi have seen a drop in the groundwater levels by four metres or more, a decadal analysis carried out by Central Ground Water Board between 2005 and 2014 has shown. Recent analyses have shown that Delhi is losing groundwater level at an average of 0.2 metres every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-to-set-up-70-more-modern-water-extraction-wells-near-sonia-vihar-101638900372633.html
08-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: East civic body to make health trade licence must for street food vendors||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) will soon roll out a policy, making it mandatory for street food vendors to obtain health trade licences, failing which they will not be allowed operate within the corporation’s jurisdiction. Granting anticipatory approval to the policy on Tuesday, mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal said the zonal town vending committees have surveyed and selected street vendors — in Shahdara north and south — who will be allotted sites by the civic body, but only on completion of all due processes needed to obtain the health trade licence. The process, civic officials said, has been made more stringent by the public health department. “Street food vending will be allowed through hand-driven carts or other means as approved by the zone vending committee. The vending operations should not be restricting the right of way of pedestrians or motorists and it should not cause nuisance, littering, noise pollution or any obstruction to the traffic flow,” Aggarwal said, adding that the operational hours will be restricted of such vendors will be from 8am to 10pm. Neither the south nor the north corporation has a separate health trade policy for street food vendors. Aggrawal said the licensee will mandatorily undergo training under the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) or an equivalent skill development programmme. Last week, the EDMC launched a skill development programme for 2,500 street vendors, in association with the Union skill development and entrepreneurship ministry. The new health licence will cost ₹3,750 a year and the vendor will be able to take a licence for up to three years.Commissioner Vikas Anand said under the new licence regime, a vendor will not be allowed to have single use plastic and thermocol items. “If the licensee or other food handlers are suffering from any infectious disease, they shall not be permitted to work until they recover. Proper arrangements for collection of waste will be made by the licensee, as per the waste management rules and the people handling food should be appropriately vaccinated against Covid-19,” he said. Anand said with this initiative, street vendors will be brought under the licence ambit and the corporation will be able to earn some revenue as well. Under phase one of the street vendors survey, EDMC has identified 10,039 vendors in Shahdara South zone and 9,604 in Shahdara North zone. A public health department official said street food vendors will be a subset of people identified in this survey. “We will allocate space to these street food vendors and then the new licence policy will be rolled out,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Arvind Singh, national convener of NASVI (National Association of Street Vendors) said street vendors are governed by the Food Safety Act and the Street Vending Act; the corporation should not make another health trade licence mandatory for them. “It is illegal to demand a new licence from street food vendors. This will lead to more harassment. When the certificate of vending is already being issued by the corporation and the food safety officials are issuing the FSSAI licences, why does the civic body want to establish a parallel process,” Singh asked. He said NASVI is also encouraging vendors to get vaccinated but the corporation should not interfere by linking it with their livelihood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-east-civic-body-to-make-health-trade-licence-must-for-street-food-vendors-101638899953500.html

To do this, the committee has installed sensors every 100 metres from the smog tower. DPCC officials say the data collected will be able to give a better idea on the smog tower’s effectiveness.Experts have long argued that smog towers are not a long-term solution to Delhi’s air pollution problem, and that not only would people have to remain extremely close to the smog tower to breathe clean air, but thousands of such smog towers would have to be installed all across the city to bring about a change in air quality.“Like any purifier or smog tower in this case, there will be some reduction in the air quality readings at the outlet, but we are now looking to identify the exact impact and how big the radius of the relatively cleaner air is,” said a DPCC official involved in the project who asked not to be named.“After three months since testing first began, a detailed quarterly report will be generated,” the official added.After the smog tower became operational in October, DPCC has been receiving daily air pollution reports from IIT Bombay. The tower is located next to the Shivaji Stadium metro station. Real-time readings are being displayed on a giant screen installed outside the smog tower.One such a daily report, reviewed by HT for November 21, showed the inlet PM 2.5 concentration at 9 am to be 383 micrograms per cubic metre. The concentration at the outlet was found to be 223 micrograms per cubic metre.When HT visited the smog tower the following day, when Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was 311 (very poor), the giant screen outside the tower displayed the outside PM 2.5 concentration to be 140 micrograms per cubic metre, with the treated air having a concentration of 73 micrograms per cubic metre.Similarly, on HT’s visit on December 2, when AQI was 429 (severe), the smog tower displayed a PM 2.5 concentration of 460 micrograms per cubic metre outside the tower, while the controlled air was said to have a PM 2.5 concentration of 324 micrograms per cubic metre.To assess the possible impact an anti-smog tower may have on the ambient air quality in its surroundings, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) last year carried out an experiment with an air purifer outside, using it as a smaller scale model of the actual smog tower.The experiment, which was carried out at a balcony, measured readings within 12 feet of the device and found that while ambient air quality improved by 20-25 micrograms per cubic metre within the flow of the air, the impact was reduced when measured away from the flow of the air. Ambient air quality also rose as soon as the device was turned off. It concluded that people would have to be around the tower to feel any impact at all.While there was a 30% reduction in the PM 2.5 concentration just outside the boundary of the smog tower, even moving 15 feet away from it towards the metro station reduced this to practically nothing, said Karthik Ganesan, fellow and director at CEEW, who had carried out the experiment.“This was an amateur experiment but I don’t see how any formal exercise is going to reveal a different finding. Taxpayers’ money will be better spent on scaling up air pollution monitoring, building a better understanding of air pollution data and sources, improving the capacity of agencies responsible for managing air quality, educating common citizens, and strengthening our regulatory regime,” said Ganesan.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at Centre for Science and Environment, said that around the world , smog towers haven’t emerged as a solution to the air pollution problem, with long-term solutions instead requiring money to be spent to strengthen public transport and control local sources of pollution. “There is no scientific study at the moment to back the need for smog towers.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the anti-smog tower in August of this year; it was built at a cost of ₹20 crore. At the time, he mentioned that a two-year long study will be carried out by IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay on its effectiveness.“This tower has been established as a pilot project and detailed studies will be conducted on its performance. Once satisfactory results are received, then the model can be replicated and more such towers can be established in other parts of Delhi,” he said.The first smog tower was installed in Delhi in the busy Lajpat Nagar market by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Gautam Gambhir in January 2020. Two more were installed by Gambhir in the Gandhi Nagar and Krishna Nagar markets later that year. Delhi also has a smog-tower at Anand Vihar, built on the same size and technology as the Connaught Place tower, but set up by the Centre, following Supreme Court orders. That tower was inaugurated in September. No formal study has been launched for the tower yet to study its efficacy.The Delhi government did not comment on IIT Bombay’s findings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-smog-tower-cleans-air-but-test-continue-on-efficacy-and-range-101638898271615.html
08-12-2021||Lucknow||UP govt starts withdrawing stubble burning cases against farmers||LUCKNOW Ahead of the assembly elections in UP, the Yogi Adityanath government has started withdrawing cases registered against farmers for burning crop residue even as no fresh FIRs were being registered against them this year, said officials dealing with the issue. During last two years, the government had already dropped, at one go, around three lakh cases registered against people for violation of Covid-19 lockdown in the state. The move to withdraw cases against farmers came after chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced in August that his government would drop old cases against farmers booked for stubble burning. He made this announcement when a group of progressive farmers met him at his residence here when the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws (now repealed) was at its peak. “The government has not only taken a decision to withdraw crop stubble burning cases against farmers, but the quashing of FIRs against them has also already begun in keeping with the CM’s announcement,” said Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, chief secretary. According to a home department official, the government identified around 865 cases (against farmers) for withdrawal and referred the same to the committee headed by the LR (legal remembrancer)/principal secretary, law, taking a call on them on the basis of merit. “Most of these cases belong to 2019 and 2020, when the police in various districts lodged FIRs against farmers who were causing air pollution by burning crop residue in violation of National Green Tribunal’s directions, “ he said. “This year, no FIRs were registered in such cases,” he added. special secretary (law) Rakesh Kumar Singh, who deals with the issue related to withdrawal of cases, said cases against farmers were yet to be withdrawn in bunches though they might have been withdrawn in some individual cases. “We will issue an order for withdrawal of cases in a bunch once the cases are identified for the purpose on the basis of reports being sent by the district magistrates concerned,” he said. “We recently issued an order for a bunch withdrawal of some three lakh cases filed against people for Covid-19 lockdown violations in the state,” he added. The government’s decision to drop old cases against farmers and not to lodge any FIR against them this year was being seen as a conscious move to appease them before the assembly elections — more so when the opposition was trying to corner the government on issues related to farmers. 
08-12-2021||World||Covid-19 cases in US spiral up even as vaccinations reach 200 million milestone||Even as the US reaches a milestone of roughly 200 million people fully vaccinated against COVID-19, cases and hospitalizations are spiking again, even in highly inoculated corners of the country like New England.New cases in the US climbed from an average of nearly 95,000 a day on November 22 to almost 119,000 a day this week, and hospitalizations are up 25% from a month ago. The increases are due almost entirely to the delta variant, though the omicron mutation has been detected in about 20 states and is sure to spread even more.Deaths are running close to 1,600 a day on average, back up to where they were in October. And the overall U.S. death toll less than two years into the crisis could hit another heartbreaking milestone, 800,000, in a matter of days.The situation is not as dire as last year's surge, before the public had any access to COVID-19 vaccines, but the roughly 60% of the U.S. population that is fully vaccinated is not enough to prevent hot spots.The cold weather, Thanksgiving gatherings and a big rebound in holiday travel are all believed to be playing a role, along with public weariness with pandemic restrictions.Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, likened the virus to a wildfire.“You can clear a forest of the shrubbery. But if you leave some shrubs and trees standing, the fire will find them,” Gostin said. “The virus will find you. It is searching for hosts that are not immune. The fact that you live in New England or New York doesn't insulate you.”Demand for the vaccine — with recent approval of boosters for all adults and shots for elementary school children — has been high amid the surge and the emergence of the omicron variant, whose dangers are still not fully understood. On Wednesday, Pfizer said that the initial two shots of its vaccine appear significantly less effective against omicron but that a booster dose may offer important protection.Nearly 48 million people have received a booster, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. White House officials noted the U.S. administered 12.5 million shots last week, the highest weekly total since May.“And that's critical progress as we head into the winter and confront the new omicron variant,” White House coronavirus adviser Jeffrey Zients said.At the same time, some states, notably in highly vaccinated New England, but also in the Midwest, are grappling with some of the worst surges since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals are filling up and some are reacting by canceling non-urgent surgeries and taking other crisis measures, while states are trying to get ahead of the spike by promoting boosters.Despite one of the highest vaccination levels in the country — over 74% of the population fully vaccinated — Vermont is coping with its biggest surge yet. In the last week, new cases per day are up 54%, and the number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 has climbed 18%.The virus is preying on those who haven't gotten their shots: As of Tuesday, 90% of the COVID-19 patients in intensive care were unvaccinated.“Obviously, it's not where we want to be,” Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday, calling the situation “extremely frustrating.”More than 400 people were in the hospital with COVID-19 in New Hampshire at the start of the week, breaking the record set last winter.New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu directed hospitals to set up COVID-19 “surge centers” using space normally reserved for such things as outpatient care.“Every day for the next several weeks, we're likely to see a new high in COVID hospitalizations in New Hampshire,” said Steve Ahnen, president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association. “With over 1,000 new cases a day, that number's not going to do anything but continue to go up.”Maine likewise is struggling with record-breaking COVID-19 hospitalizations.“The vast majority of patients in our hospitals are unvaccinated. That's especially true of critical care patients,” said Andy Mueller, CEO of MainHealth, the state's biggest health network. “It requires a tremendous amount of our resources to provide care.”Rhode Island's largest hospital system, Lifespan, said staffing shortages are at never-before-seen crisis levels, while Kent Hospital said it is near capacity and is considering delaying non-urgent procedures.Dr. Paari Gopalakrishnan, Kent's interim president and chief operating officer, said the spike is probably due to “people letting their guards down” during the holidays, and flu season could complicate things further.New Hampshire plans to hold a “booster blitz” on Saturday at 15 locations. Most appointments were booked.In Berlin, Vermont, Mike Labounty got his booster Tuesday."I have friends that are in their 20s that are getting sick and friends that are 60 that are getting sick,” he said. “The thing you see on Facebook and stuff like that is, I just want this to be over.

08-12-2021||World||UK PM Johnson orders Christmas party probe as aide Allegra Stratton quits||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised and his adviser resigned on Wednesday after a video emerged of senior aides joking about a Christmas party at Downing Street last year when social events were banned under Covid-19 rules.The leaked footage appears to contradict more than a week of denials by Johnson and his ministers that a party took place, following newspaper reports that dozens of staff had attended an evening-long gathering on December 18, 2020.The embattled leader, facing calls for his resignation from some opposition politicians during a raucous parliamentary questions session, vowed "disciplinary action" would be taken if the investigation found rules had been broken."I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures," he said."I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused... and I apologise for the impression that it gives."Johnson added he had been "repeatedly assured" that there was no party inside his Number 10 Downing Street office and that no rules were broken.Johnson's adviser Allegra Stratton, a former political journalist who was serving as his press secretary at the time the footage was recorded, swiftly tendered her resignation.The footage showed her referring jokingly to a "fictional party" while preparing for a press conference.In a tearful statement, Stratton acknowledged her comments "seemed to make light of the rules" and said she would "regret those remarks for the rest of my days"."I understand the anger and frustration that people feel", she said, while not specifying whether a party took place.Labour party leader Keir Starmer told the prime minister that his account strained credulity."They knew there was a party, they knew it was against the rules, they knew they couldn't admit it, and they thought it was funny," he told MPs."Does the prime minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules?" he asked.The country's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, will lead the newly announced probe.Case "has been asked to establish the facts on any events on (December) 18, and that's what he will start work on," Johnson's spokesman told reporters. The team will "rightly" set its timeframe, "but obviously we want it (a report) as soon as possible."'Total incredulity'The alleged party is the latest instance of apparent government hypocrisy over restrictions after several previous scandals, including health secretary Matt Hancock resigning in June for breaking coronavirus curbs during an affair with an aide.The incendiary footage shows Stratton fielding questions from advisor Ed Oldfied and other staff during a rehearsal press conference on December 22 with no media present.The group laugh and trade jokes over a "fictional party" four days earlier, which reportedly involved food, drink, games and "secret Santa" gift-giving."This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced," Stratton laughs over joking exchanges about "cheese and wine" and whether the prime minister would "condone" such an event.At the time, London was under strict restrictions and indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned, while office parties were specifically outlawed.The video, which was leaked to broadcaster ITV News late Tuesday, has led main news bulletins, drawn millions of views online and sparked condemnation from across the political spectrum."The prime minister is responsible for losing the trust of the people. He can no longer lead on the most pressing issue facing these islands," leader of the Scottish National Party Ian Blackford said.Conservative lawmakers have also been among those demanding answers."This isn't a laughing matter," Tory MP Roger Gale told the BBC after he watched the footage with "total incredulity".The scandal has echoes of an infamous incident earlier in the pandemic involving Johnson's then-chief aide Dominic Cummings, who drove hundreds of kilometres to stay away from his London home during a lockdown.It triggered outrage over perceived double standards by the government, and is widely seen as leading to a drop in compliance with restrictions in its aftermath.With the Omicron variant spreading fast in Britain, some Conservative lawmakers said the latest scandal would make reintroducing curbs "much more difficult"."The events of the last 24 hours make it probably almost impossible now," influential backbench MP Charles Walker told Times Radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-orders-christmas-party-probe-as-aide-allegra-stratton-quits-101638983791360.html
08-12-2021||World||France says mistaken identity, man arrested not suspect in Khashoggi's murder||French authorities announced Wednesday that a man arrested at Paris-Charles De Gaulle Airport for allegedly being linked to the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was misidentified.The Paris General Prosecutor's office issued a short statement Wednesday after over 24 hours of checks, saying that the man arrested Tuesday was not the Khalid Aedh al-Otaibi who is wanted under a 2019 Turkish arrest warrant.“The (arrest) warrant does not apply to him,” the statement said, without elaborating.French media reported that the mix-up was related to the fact that the detained man had an identical name to al-Otaibi.A judicial official told The Associated Press that the suspect can be held until Thursday morning at the latest, but he will likely be released before.The Saudi Embassy in Paris always maintained that it was a case of mistaken identity, saying the arrested man “had nothing to do with the case in question.”A person named Khalid Aedh Al-Otaibi was one of over a dozen Saudi officials sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2018 over Khashoggi’s killing. He was also mentioned in the declassified U.S. intelligence report that said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had “approved” the operation that killed Khashoggi. The report used an alternate English transliteration of his last name.Khashoggi was killed after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee, who was waiting outside. Turkish officials allege Khashoggi, who had written critically about Saudi Arabia’s crown prince for The Washington Post, was killed by a team of Saudi agents and then dismembered with a bone saw.The Saudi government admitted to the murder under intense international pressure, and held a closed-door trial, though never released the names of the accused.The short-lived arrest came at a particularly sensitive political moment for all involved.French President Emmanuel Macron had just made a point to visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his recent tour through the Middle East.For Prince Mohammed, he’s still on his first major tour of all the Gulf Arab states since Khashoggi’s slaying, heading later Wednesday to Qatar.And for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who just left Qatar, he hopes to bury a long-running feud with the kingdom and the United Arab Emirates over his country offering a haven for Islamists in the Mideast. Erdogan hopes that will encourage Arab investment into Turkey as its lira currency craters amid an economic crisis there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-mistaken-identity-man-arrested-not-suspect-in-khashoggi-s-murder-101638982989363.html

Germany exports over $100 billion worth of products - from vehicles to machinery to pharmaceutical products - to China each year,” the Global Times reported recently.More than 7,000 German enterprises in China and more than 2,000 Chinese companies in Germany currently operate.Interestingly, Xi Jinping had met Olaf Scholz in 2017 when the latter was the mayor of Hamburg during that year’s G20 summit in the German city.During their interaction, Xi had praised Hamburg as “one of the cities with the most Chinese-funded enterprises in Germany and even in Europe. The city enjoys the unique geographical advantage in promoting connectivity between Asia and Europe and participating in the “Belt and Road” construction.”“It is not only an important port linking the China-EU Maritime Silk Road, but also becomes an important terminal for China-EU freight trains,” Xi had then told Scholz, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.“Hamburg supports the ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, and is willing to actively participate in relevant cooperation and believes that the connectivity construction will build a brighter world,” Olaf Scholz had told Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-calls-for-new-level-of-ties-with-germany-under-olaf-scholz-101638974241516.html
08-12-2021||World||Taliban deploy dozens of officials at Afghan embassy, consulates in Pakistan||The Taliban have posted four senior officials and dozens of junior operatives at the Afghan embassy and consulates in Pakistan in recent weeks, reflecting Islamabad’s close ties with the setup in Kabul.One of the senior Taliban officials was deployed at Afghanistan’s embassy in Islamabad and the others at consulates in Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta, people familiar with the matter said.“This has happened even though there is no formal recognition of the Taliban’s interim government in Kabul by any country, not even Pakistan. It is a de facto recognition of the Taliban administration,” said one of the people cited above.Dozens of junior Taliban operatives have been sent to the four missions to take over operations and to keep an eye on diplomats posted during the term of the former Ashraf Ghani government, which collapsed when the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15.An Afghan diplomat appointed by the Ghani government in Bangladesh switched over to the Taliban side and was also sent to Pakistan recently, the people said.The Taliban have sought to play down the posting of officials to Pakistan, with spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid contending that they are not official envoys. The Taliban have said these officials were meant to help Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and to facilitate the travel of people who wish to visit Afghanistan.Muhammad Shokaib, who has used the aliases Mosa Farhad and Qari Yousaf Ahmadi and served as a Taliban spokesman, is the de facto ambassador in Islamabad. The Taliban’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, known to be close to the Pakistani establishment, issued official letters regarding the appointment of the officials in Pakistan.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad had been without a head since July, when the Ghani government recalled ambassador Najibullah Alikhil and other staff to protest the kidnapping and assault of the envoy’s daughter by unidentified men. She was abducted from a commercial district in the heart of Islamabad and held for several hours. Pakistan denied she was kidnapped, taking ties to a low at the time.The Taliban have also been making efforts for several months to woo diplomats appointed by the Ghani government in key countries, including West Asian states and India, to work for the setup in Kabul but have been unable to make much headway. In some cases, Muttaqi himself has been involved in these efforts, the people said.Some 70 Afghan missions around the world are still using Afghanistan’s tricolour flag and issuing a limited number of visas, mainly for humanitarian workers. However, they are grappling with a funds crunch that has resulted in cutting down the number of local staff and some functions.Diplomats appointed by the former government have also been enthused by the UN General Assembly’s move on Monday to defer a decision on who will represent Afghanistan at the world body. This effectively allows the Ghani government’s representative, Ghulam Mohammad Ishaqzai, to remain as the envoy.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said that in the absence of recognition from the world community, the Taliban is trying “out of the box solutions to gain some sort of de facto legitimacy”.He added, “Obviously, the fact that Pakistan has allowed the mission in Islamabad to be run by the Taliban has given them the confidence that they can try something similar in other countries. There will be some push back from the previous regime’s diplomats but this opposition will be difficult in the absence of financial support.”

08-12-2021||World||9 Indo-Canadian gangsters held as major drug trafficking ring busted in Canada||Nine alleged gangsters of Indian origin were among those arrested and charged by law enforcement in two Western provinces in Canada, in coordination with federal agencies, as they busted a major drug trafficking ring.The investigations that were part of the joint operation lasted 18 months and targeted a “violent drug trafficking network operating in Calgary and throughout Western Canada”, according to a statement issued by the Calgary Police Service (CPS).The CPS operation in Alberta resulted in the arrest of nine individuals while that undertaken by police in the province of Saskatchewan led to the apprehension of six more persons.Multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the operations including CPS units, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Saskatoon Police Service, Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, Canada Border Services Agency, and Alberta Sheriffs.Investigators in Calgary alleged that the network “had been engaged in conflict with a rival drug trafficking network in the city, and that combined, the two groups were responsible for more than 20 violent events in Calgary that spanned just over a year, including a double homicide that occurred in April 2019”.The alleged gang members are mainly Indo-Canadians. Those arrested in Calgary were identified as Amandeep Saggu, 31, Ravneet Gill, 25, Prabhjyot Bhatti, 22, Jarmanjit Datewas, 23, Jaskaran Sidhu, 22, and Jasman Dhaliwal, 19. Also arrested in Calgary were Steven Whyte, 27, Safwan Riaz, 22 and Irkham Farooq, 23.Those arrested in Saskatoon included 26-year-old Japjee Minhas, 28-year-old Rajandeep Singh and 21-year-old Gurkeert Hehar. Also arrested were Ali Sarfraz, 26, Andrew Karamat, 23, and Rachel Kidd, 28.“From start to finish, this investigation required an incredible amount of coordination and patience from our investigators, who worked tirelessly to hold these individuals accountable. Though our work is not over, these charges are significant, and a major step towards protecting Calgarians put at risk by drug trafficking and the related violence that follows,” Staff Sergeant Greg Cooper of the CPS Guns & Gangs Unit, said.Among the material recovered by CPS were six firearms, over 55,000 Canadian dollars worth of drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl pills and patches, crack cocaine, marijuana, phenacetin, benzodiazepine, and prescription pills, and over 300,000 in Canadian currency.Seizures in Saskatoon included 226,600 Canadian dollars, 4177.96 grams of cocaine, 166.99 grams of fentanyl, 67.06 grams of methamphetamine, 568.92 grams of marijuana and six vehicles.While Indo-Canadian gangs have a history going back decades of operating in the province of British Columbia, the results of the operation announced on Tuesday are the latest evidence of their area extending further into other provinces of Canada. Multiple arrests linked to drugs and violent gang activity were also reported in Ontario this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-indo-canadian-gangsters-held-as-major-drug-trafficking-ring-busted-in-canada-101638969321464.html
08-12-2021||World||Australia joins US in ‘diplomatic boycott’ of Winter Olympics, angers China||China on Wednesday strongly responded to Australia’s announcement of a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, saying that it never planned to invite Australian officials and “nobody cares” whether they come or not.China, however, has lodged stern representations with Australia over the decision, announced a day after a similar decision taken by the US, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday.Australian Prime Minister Scott announced the “diplomatic boycott” in Canberra on Wednesday.It was in response to “human rights abuses” carried out in China’s Xinjiang autonomous region and “many other issues that Australia has consistently raised”.Australian athletes would however attend the Games to be held in February, he said.In Beijing foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin reacted sharply. “China has reiterated many times that the winter Olympics is not a stage for political posturing and manipulation,” Wang said in Beijing.“China never planned to invite any Australian officials to the games. Whether they come or not nobody cares,” he said. “It exposes fully that the Australian government has been so blindly following certain country’s steps that it doesn’t tell right from wrong, and has no bottom line,” Wang said without directly referring to the US decision on diplomatic boycott.“China deplores and rejects this and has lodged stern representations with Australia,” he said.A Chinese official media report quoted Wang as saying that China had “lodged strong representations” to Australia on the decision. “Australia’s move to connect the Winter Olympics with the so-called human rights issue in Xinjiang is a serious violation of the principle of political neutrality of sports enshrined in the Olympic Charter and also against the Olympic Motto of ‘together’,” Wang was quoted as saying.China on Tuesday accused the US of violating the Olympic spirit by announcing a diplomatic boycott of February’s Beijing Winter Games, warning Washington that it will “pay for its practices”, in a new diplomatic feud that’s certain to further strain ties already at the lowest point in decades.On Monday, the White House said government officials would boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of China’s human rights “atrocities”, although American athletes are free to compete at the Games, scheduled to begin on February 4.The White House had called China’s human rights record “egregious”.“US diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC’s egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang, and we simply can’t do that,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a daily press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-joins-us-in-diplomatic-boycott-of-winter-olympics-angers-china-101638963740554.html
08-12-2021||World||China is world's largest prison for journalists: RSF report||At least 127 journalists are currently detained in China, the “world’s biggest captor of journalists”, where President Xi Jinping has created a “nightmare” of media oppression worthy of the Mao Zedong-era, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a leading journalism advocacy group, has said in a report.The report quoted RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire as saying that China was a country in the midst of a “frantic race backwards” as Chinese citizens continue to lose press freedom.Titled “The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China,”, the Paris-based RSF said the report reveals the “…extent of the regime’s campaign of repression against the right to information”.The report indicates how Beijing views journalism - not as a tool to provide information to the public to make informed decisions but as an instrument of state propaganda. It also focuses on the deterioration of press freedom in Hong Kong, which was once a model of press freedom but now has an increasing number of journalists arrested in the name of national security.The 42-page report listed how Chinese authorities used the fight against terrorism as a pretext to detain Uighur journalists reporting on Xinjiang where at least million from minority communities have been detained in high-security camps, said to be “vocational training institutes” by the government.The RSF report says at least 71 Uighur journalists - more than half of those detained in China - are currently in detention.“The number of taboo topics keeps rising. Not only those typically deemed “sensitive” - such as Tibet, Taiwan or corruption - are subject to censorship, but also natural disasters, the #MeToo movement or even recognition of health professionals during the Covid-19 crisis,” the report said.At least ten journalists and online commentators were arrested in 2020 for their reporting on the Covid-19 crisis in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged in late 2019.“To this date, two of them, Zhang Zhan and Fang Bin, are still detained”.For Chinese journalists, the situation is worse.The report also described a ruling introduced in October 2019 that all Chinese journalists must use a smartphone app called “Study Xi, Strengthen the Country”, which could enable collection of personal data.“To receive and renew their press cards, journalists will soon have to undergo a 90-hour annual training partly focusing on Xi Jinping’s ‘Thought’. Journalists are already required to download the ‘Study Xi, Strengthen the Country’ propaganda application that can collect their personal data,” the report said.Foreign journalists too are facing trouble.“China’s intimidation of foreign reporters, based on surveillance and visa blackmail, forced 18 of them to leave the country in 2020. Gui Minhai, Yang Hengjun and Cheng Lei, three foreign journalists of Chinese descent, are now being detained on espionage charges,” RSF said.Chinese diplomatic missions are also a source of pressure against information freedom in democracies, the RSF said.Referring to the partial opening up under the previous government, Deloire writes: “President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has put a brutal end to this partial opening and restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime”.Democracies, he said, should identify all “…appropriate strategies to dissuade the Beijing regime from pursuing its repressive policies and to support all Chinese citizens who love their country and want to defend the right to information”.RSF ranks China 177th out of 180 in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index, just two places above North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-largest-prison-for-journalists-rsf-report-101638961160212.html

According to reports from Australia's Queensland, this new lineage has been found in a traveller who arrived from South Africa. This lineage has about half the gene variations of the original Omicron.Here is what we know about this new lineage and what does this mean1. The two lineages are now known as BA. 1 and BA. 2, the original Omicron known as BA.1.2. Some mutations are common for both variants. Based on the mutations present in these two lineages, some reports claimed the new lineage is difficult to be detected in a typical screening. Scientists allayed fears by saying that this does not mean that if a person gets infected by this lineage of Omicron, they will not test positive. In RT-PCR tests, they will test positive in both lineages. 🦠The B.1.1.529 #Omicron lineage is now split to BA.1 and BA.2 . BA.1 will now have the original lineage and BA.2 will encomapss the new outlier with around 24 mutations. 🔴 PS: This is for better epidemiological surveillance & nothing to be scared yet. https://t.co/4y1RVf5Ej83. Senior scientist at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Vinod Scaria, said there is nothing to be scared of about the new lineage. This is for better epidemiological surveillance.4. A new lineage is not a new variant, scientists have clarified. It is a subset5. A new lineage may or may not have any impact on the spread of the infection. Delta too had many lineages, including Delta Plus, which did not have more transmissibility than Delta.Omicron, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, has triggered fresh apprehension across the world as the variant is believed to be spreading faster than Delta. However, the variant has not led to severe illness and scientists are of the view that Omicron might indicate that the pandemic is now gradually moving to the endemic stage where the infection will come every year. Omicron has not caused shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell in any of the cases across the world. Omicron patients, with mild symptoms like tiredness, sore throat, are mostly recovering from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-lineage-of-omicron-variant-found-what-does-this-mean-101638949817178.html
08-12-2021||World||New video embarrasses Boris Johnson on alleged illegal party||Pressure mounted on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson after a video emerged showing key aides joking about a party in Downing Street last Christmas at a time when such gatherings were banned.The video, obtained by ITV News and which ITV said was recorded four days after the alleged event, shows Johnson’s then press secretary, Allegra Stratton, rehearsing for a TV media briefing and saying there was “definitely no social distancing” when asked about a party. A backlash has been growing over whether Johnson’s own officials held a party in Downing Street last year in breach of the government’s own coronavirus rules, and the episode has cast further doubt over the integrity of Johnson’s administration after a rocky period.The saga has echoes of the Barnard Castle controversy of 2020, when Johnson’s then chief aide, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules and triggered weeks of negative media coverage and cries of hypocrisy, fueling the perception that it was one rule for the government and another for the governed.“There was no Christmas party,” 10 Downing Street said in a statement late Tuesday. “Covid rules have been followed at all times.”This latest furore over the Christmas party, following soon after Johnson’s botched handling of an ethics probe into a Conservative MP and a chaotic business conference speech, threatens to further damage his standing in the polls. Johnson’s popularity has steadily declined through 2021, hitting its lowest level during his premiership in November, according to a survey by Savanta ComRes.The incident may also undermine the UK’s response to the pandemic: Though Johnson’s administration has resisted introducing stricter social restrictions to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, it may wish to do so in the coming weeks. Public compliance with rules may deteriorate amid another uproar over the government not following the rules.Johnson refused to deny a party took place, while maintaining that the rules in place at the time were obeyed.“I have satisfied myself that the guidelines were followed at all times,” Johnson told broadcasters earlier Tuesday when asked about the alleged party.Pandemic rules in place at the time stated: “Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity.”The Daily Mirror newspaper reported last month that Johnson’s team held a party Dec. 18 with about 40 to 50 people “cheek by jowl,” citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t identify.It wasn’t clear from the footage whether the aides were discussing an actual party, or a fictional one for the purposes of the rehearsal.‘Cheese and Wine’In the video obtained by ITV, Downing Street aide Ed Oldfield is heard to ask: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognize those reports?”Stratton visibly struggles to respond, before saying: “What’s the answer?”One aide is heard to say: “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine.” Stratton says: “Is cheese and wine alright?”Through laughter, she finally says: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.”10 Downing Street, Stratton and Oldfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Bloomberg News.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said the government’s actions were “shameful” at a time when the rules separated people from their families.“The Prime Minister now needs to come clean, and apologize,” he said. “It cannot be one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone else.”Johnson is also already facing criticism from his own backbenches about the affair. Conservative MP Roger Gale said the incident “has all the hallmarks of another ‘Barnard Castle’ moment.”“No. 10 clearly has some serious questions to answer,” Gale said on Twitter. “Fast.”Separately, the Daily Mirror reported late Tuesday that former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson also held an illegal Christmas party last year in his government ministry, another blow for Johnson’s administration.The new footage about the Downing Street Christmas party coincided with a separate row about whether Johnson and his team had told the truth over a controversy during the Afghanistan evacuation. Evidence from a Foreign Office whistleblower published Tuesday said Johnson personally intervened to save staff and animals at a rescue charity, a decision which came at the expense of helping Afghans who had assisted British forces. Johnson’s office strongly denied the claim, yet LBC News later obtained a letter from Johnson’s parliamentary aide to the head of the charity, which showed the aide giving the authorization for the evacuation, heavily suggesting Johnson’s involvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-video-embarrasses-boris-johnson-on-alleged-illegal-party-101638942815037.html

Over half of those polled, 53%, also supported the Justin Trudeau government emulating the Joe Biden administration in “taking the same measure as the US, denying any diplomatic presence in Beijing,” according to a release from ARI.Of the respondents, 40% were for Canadian athletes to remain away from the Olympics, while a similar number, 37%, favoured a boycott by Canadian fans.Meanwhile, ARI also found that “the vast majority continue to view the country unfavourably”. That translates to 84% of those surveyed.The decision in these regard from Ottawa is still pending and could have an adverse impact on ties with China if it is along the lines of that announced by Washington. Ottawa is also expected to soon announce its decision on keeping the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei away from Canada’s 5G infrastructure.China has also issued warnings to Canada over taking such action, which has already been taken by countries like the United States and Australia. Speaking to the Waterloo, the Ontario-based Centre for International Governance Innovation on Tuesday, China’s Ambassador to Ottawa Cong Peiwu said in the context of a potential denial of access, “That will be sending out a very wrong signal to the Chinese companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/78-of-canadians-favour-diplomatic-boycott-of-winter-olympics-in-beijing-poll-101638942738376.html

Canberra's decision comes amid "disagreement" with China over a slew of issues that have plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), however, has clarified that their government's decision to join the US diplomatic boycott of next year's Beijing Olympics will have no impact on athletes' preparations for the Winter Games.Acknowledging the AOC president's remarks on the participation of Australian athletes, the Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “We wish the Australian athletes excellent performance at the Winter Olympics and believe they will also witness a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympics in China.”Taking quick note of the bilateral ties between the two nations, the Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “As we all know, the blame for the current predicament of China-Australia relations lies squarely on the Australian side.”“According to Olympic rules, dignitaries are invited by their respective National Olympic Committee (NOC) to attend the Olympic Games,” the embassy statement said. “It is up to the NOC to decide whether to extend invitations or not. Mountains can not stop the river from flowing into the sea. Australia’s success at the Beijing Winter Olympics depends on the performance of Australian athletes, not on the attendance of Australian officials, and the political posturing by some Australian politicians.”Urging the Australian side to take practical measures to create favorable conditions for improving bilateral relations, the Chinese official said, “The Australian side's statement that it will not send officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics runs counter to its publicly pronounced expectation to improve China-Australia relations.”Also Read | US will ‘pay’ for diplomatic boycott of Olympics: ChinaThe AOC had earlier said in a statement that it respected how “diplomatic options” were a matter for governments and maintained that politics and sport should be separated.Meanwhile, Australian PM Scott Morrison insists that the strained relations with Beijing had left Australia unable to discuss China's moves to slow and block imports of Australian goods as well as alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the reason behind the US boycott.“Australia will not step back from the strong position we've had standing up for Australia's interests and obviously it is of no surprise that we wouldn't be sending Australian officials to those Games,” Morrison said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mountains-can-t-stop-the-river-china-responds-to-australia-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics-101638931916334.html

Between January and October this year, sales totaled $6.78 billion, up 5.5%, as logistics problems subsided, Chamber data showed.China's push to boost its own food inventories during the pandemic also diverted some of Brazil's trade with the Arabs, leading countries such as Saudi Arabia to step up the promotion of domestic food production while seeking alternative suppliers."It's a turning point. The Saudis are still big buyers, but they are also net re-exporters of food," the Chamber said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-unseats-brazil-to-become-top-food-supplier-to-arab-nations-after-15-years-101638933783320.html

The Danish health ministry said Magnus Heunicke had taken a test early in the day, before his planned meeting with his 26 European Union counterparts.Omicron cases in nine African countriesOmicron cases have now been confirmed in at least nine African countries, with some officials reporting that initial cases appear to be mild. These include Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe.South Africa remains the epicentre of the outbreak, with experts saying that the overwhelming majority of its thousands of new cases per day are of the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jab-mandates-absolute-last-resort-who-101638925644609.html

In lab experiments conducted at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, it was observed that Omicron resulted in about a 40-fold reduction in levels of neutralising antibodies produced by people who had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech SE shot, compared with the strain detected in China almost two years ago.Also Read | Omicron versus Delta: Fauci breaks down what is known and what's unknownAlex Sigal, the head of research at the laboratory, said that the loss of immune protection is “robust, but not complete” and that further efficacy studies are needed to appropriately take on board the exact extent of the vaccine's impact in mitigating the disease caused by this new strain.Speaking at an online presentation of the first reported experiments gauging the efficacy of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine against Omicron, Sigal said there will be “more breakthrough” of vaccine-induced immunity as he pushed the idea of getting booster shots to protect oneself against the new variant.“A good booster probably would decrease your chance of infection, especially severe infection leading to more severe disease,” the Bloomberg news agency quoted the researcher as saying. “People who haven’t had a booster should get one, and people who have been previously infected should be vaccinated.”Although these are early studies into the efficacy of existing vaccines against Omicron, the preliminary results have raised concerns that immune protection from vaccination or a previous bout of Covid-19 may be insufficient to stop reinfections or stem a fresh wave of cases and hospitalisations.Also Read | Omicron variant: What we know so far on cases in India and vaccine efficacyA top WHO official, however, said on Tuesday that there is no reason to assume that Omicron is more severe than the variants which came before, or that existing vaccines will fail against it. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation's emergencies director, told AFP in an interview that there currently is no indication to suggest existing vaccines would fail to protect people who contract Omicron against the worst outcomes of the disease.A similar assurance was echoed on Tuesday by US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, who said that Omicron is certainly not worse than the previous strains, including Delta.However, both the experts agreed that more epidemiological data from around the world is needed to affirm scientific consensus on this. Since South Africa announced the discovery of Omicron on November 25, about 450 researchers globally have been working to isolate the variant from patient specimens, grow it in labs, verify its genomic sequence, and establish methods to test it in blood plasma samples, according to WHO.Sigal’s laboratory was the first to isolate the Beta variant, a strain of the coronavirus that was identified in South Africa late last year. The latest research in his lab involved testing 14 blood plasma samples collected from a dozen people who had been given a second Pfizer-BioNTech shot about a month earlier to gauge the concentration of antibodies needed to neutralise or block the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-provides-less-immunity-to-omicron-than-to-other-strains-early-study-101638923992898.html
08-12-2021||World||Biden, Putin hold key summit on Ukraine||US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin held two hours of virtual talks on Ukraine and other disputes on Tuesday, Russian state TV reported, amid Western fears that Moscow is poised to invade its southern neighbour.Russian TV footage showed Biden and Putin greeting each other in a friendly manner at the start of what was expected to be a tense exchange. Biden told Putin he hoped their next meeting would be in person.The Kremlin has said it hopes the two leaders can hold an in-person summit to discuss what it has described as the lamentable state of US-Russia relations, which have sunk to their lowest since the end of the Cold War.US officials said before the video conference that Biden would tell Putin that Russia and its banks could be hit with the toughest economic sanctions yet if it attacks Ukraine.They said the sanctions, which one source said could target Russia’s biggest banks and Moscow’s ability to convert roubles into dollars and other currencies, were designed to dissuade Putin from using tens of thousands of troops massed near the Ukrainian border to attack its southern neighbour.The Kremlin, which said before Tuesday’s meeting it did not expect any breakthroughs, has denied harbouring any intention to attack Ukraine and has said its troop posture is defensive.But Moscow has voiced rising vexation over Western military aid to Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic that has tilted towards the West since a popular revolt toppled a pro-Russian president in 2014, and what it calls creeping Nato expansion.Moscow has likewise questioned Ukrainian intentions and said it wants guarantees that Kiev will not use force to try to retake territory lost in 2014 to Russia-backed separatists, a scenario Ukraine has ruled out.“We’re looking for good, predictable relations with the US. Russia has never intended to attack anyone, but we have our concerns and we have our red lines,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.The United States has shared intelligence about Russian military movements along the border with allies, a senior Biden administration official confirmed to reporters while previewing the call.The official did not go into details but said “we have seen the movement of additional capabilities and forces to the vicinity of Ukraine in multiple different areas. And these movements are consistent with the planning that we see underway for a military escalation in Ukraine”.The United States and allies have discussed crippling financial sanctions as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We have had intensive discussions with our European partners about what we would do collectively in the event of a major Russian military escalation in Ukraine. And we believe that we have a path forward that would involve substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the US that would impose significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed”.Asked if the US could consider deploying troops to defend Ukraine, the official refused to discuss “the particular sensitive challenges” that Biden will lay out for Putin but said, “the US not seeking to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force, as opposed to a combination of support for the Ukrainian military, strong economic countermeasures, and the substantial increase in support and capability to our Nato allies to ensure that they remain safe”.(With inputs from Yashwant Raj)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-hold-key-summit-on-ukraine-101638925018646.html

Robert E Lee that drew violent protests to Charlottesville, Virginia, will be melted down and turned into a new piece of public art by an African American heritage center.The city council decided how to dispose of the now-removed statue at the center of the Unite the Right rally in 2017 during a meeting that stretched into Tuesday morning, The Daily Progress reported.The Lee statue and another of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson were removed on the same day in July. The city received six proposals from entities interested in taking one of both of them, according to the newspaper.Council members voted to donate the Lee statue to the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center, whose “Swords Into Plowshares” proposal received almost 30 letters of support from organizations and individuals, including the Descendants of Enslaved Communities at the University of Virginia and descendants of Monticello's enslaved community.“Our hope with Swords into Plowshares' is to create something that transforms what was once toxic in our public space into something beautiful that can be more reflective of our entire community's social values,” said the center's executive director, Andrea Douglas.“We're giving people opportunities to engage with our own narratives and our own histories. This project offers a road map for other communities to do the same.”The Black-led heritage center's news release also said that a “community engagement process” will inform the public art project, for which $590,000 has already been raised.The council voted only on the disposition of the Lee statue Tuesday morning, the newspaper reported. Its removal this summer came more than five years after racial justice activists renewed a push to take down it down, drawing opposition from racist groups that culminated in the deadly 2017 rally.Virginia's highest court ruled the city could remove the Lee and Jackson statues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lee-statue-in-charlottesville-to-be-melted-down-for-new-art-101638922034856.html

If convicted, he could face life imprisonment.Two of the 26 being tried in absentia in Turkey are former aides to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. No Saudi official has ever faced justice in person in Turkey for the killing.Alotaibi is also one of 17 people that the US Treasury designated for sanctions in 2018 over their role in the murder.Identity being confirmedA source close to the case said that the Interpol Red Notice issued at Turkey's request came up as the traveller was passing through passport control.Checks were still underway on Tuesday evening to ensure his identity is correct and that the arrest warrant applies to him, another source close to the case added, noting that his detention can last up to 48 hours.If confirmed as the suspected assassination team member, he will appear before French prosecutors.He would have the right to challenge extradition to Turkey. If he does, the French judiciary must decide whether to keep him in detention pending a formal Turkish extradition request, or to free him on condition that he does not leave France.It can typically take several weeks for a court to rule on whether to hand him over to Turkey against his will.In September 2020, a Saudi court overturned five death sentences issued after a closed-door trial in Saudi Arabia, sentencing the accused to 20 years in prison instead.Khashoggi -- a prominent Saudi who lived in self-exile in the United States and wrote for The Washington Post -- entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 to file paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee.According to US and Turkish officials, a waiting Saudi hit squad strangled him and dismembered his body, which has never been retrieved.The gruesome murder sparked international outrage that continues to reverberate, with Western intelligence agencies accusing Prince Mohammed bin Salman of authorising the killing.Not 'forgotten'Tuesday's arrest comes only days after French President Emmanuel Macron defended his decision to include Saudi Arabia in a tour of Gulf states, saying the visit did not mean that he had "forgotten" about the Khashoggi case.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the order to murder Khashoggi came from "the highest levels" of the Saudi government.But Erdogan has never directly blamed Prince Mohammed and there have in recent months been signs of the thaw between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.Crucially there have also been signs after many years of tensions in the wake of the 2016 failed coup bid of a thaw between Turkey and Saudi Arabia's top ally the United Arab Emirates, with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed visiting Turkey last month.On the third anniversary of the killing, Khashoggi's widow Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate while the murder took place, accused the US of failing to hold Saudi Arabia accountable.Media rights body Reporters Without Borders called Tuesday's arrest "excellent news" and said it had filed a legal complaint against Alotaibi for murder, torture and enforced disappearance in October 2019.RSF said it had maintained "complete confidentiality" about the complaint in order to improve the chances of his arrest during a visit to France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-arrested-wrong-man-over-khashoggi-murder-saudi-arabia-101638922936883.html

A top WHO official told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that there is no reason to assume that Omicron is more severe than the variants which came before, or that existing vaccines will fail against it.Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation's emergencies director, told AFP in an interview that there currently is no indication to suggest that Omicron, although highly infectious, causes a more severe disease than previous Covid-19 variants such as Delta. The existing vaccines should protect people who contract Omicron against the worst outcomes of the disease, he said.Also Read | Omicron can lead to stagflation in US, says top economist“We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation, and there's no reason to expect that it wouldn't be so [for Omicron],” the WHO official was quoted as saying.Ryan, however, said that more research was needed into studying the Omicron variant to appropriately take on board exactly how threatening it is poised to be. A similar assurance was echoed on Tuesday by US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, who said that Omicron is certainly not worse than the previous strains, including Delta.According to the chief medical advisor to the US president, Omicron is “clearly highly transmissible” but might actually be less severe than Delta, as indicated by the ratio between the number of infections and the number of hospitalisations in South Africa.Also Read | What we know about OmicronFauci, too, said that more epidemiological data from around the world is needed to affirm scientific consensus on this. The results from lab experiments that tested the potency of antibodies from current vaccines against Omicron should come in the next few days to a week, he added.Meanwhile, researchers in South Africa have found that Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine actually provides less immunity to the Omicron variant than to other major versions of the virus. The loss of immune protection is “robust, but not complete,” Alex Sigal, head of research at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, said in an online presentation of the first reported experiments gauging the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-not-more-severe-than-delta-existing-vaccines-will-work-who-101638921979376.html
08-12-2021||World||Omicron versus Delta: Fauci breaks down what is known and what's unknown||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday said the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which has again shut the borders of many countries in fresh apprehension, is certainly not worse than the previous variants, including Delta. Speaking to AFP, Fauci reiterated that a complete picture of the new variant might take some time. However, some areas have become quite clear.Here is what Fauci said:Transmissibility: Omicron is "clearly highly transmissible", and very likely more than Delta, Fauci said.Immune evasion: Is Omicron better at evading immunity from vaccination or previous infection? According to Fauci, the answer is yes. Evidence is epidemiological data from around the world, he said. Results from lab experiments that tested the potency of antibodies from current vaccines against Omicron should come in the next few days to a week, Dr Fauci said.On the question of severity, he said Omicron is certainly not more severe than Delta.Pfizer shot gives less immunity to Omicron than to other strains: Early study"There is some suggestion that it might even be less severe because when you look at some of the cohorts that are being followed in South Africa, the ratio between the number of infections and the number of hospitalizations seems to be less than with Delta," he said.A more transmissible virus that doesn't cause more severe illness and doesn't lead to a surge of hospitalisations and deaths is the "best-case scenario", while the worst would be if the highly transmissible variant also causes severe disease. "I don't think that worst-case scenario is going to come about, but you never know," Fauci said.First reported from South Africa, the variant has now been detected in at least 38 countries with the potent of the existing vaccines being questioned against this new variant. The variant, however, has not been linked to any deaths. The variant has over 50 mutations and does not trigger the usual symptoms like loss of taste or smell, breathing difficulties etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-versus-delta-fauci-breaks-down-what-is-known-and-what-s-unknown-101638921832741.html

08-12-2021||World||Ahead of nuclear talks, US hits Iran with new sanctions for human rights abuses||The United States slapped fresh sanctions on a dozen Iranian officials and entities for "serious" human rights abuses Tuesday, ahead of the expected resumption of nuclear talks with Tehran after they halted last week without any concrete progress.The sanctions announced by the Treasury and State Department targeted government officials and organizations involved in the repression of protesters and political activists and prisons where activists have been held in brutal conditions.The Treasury also placed several Syrian officials on its sanctions blacklist for their roles in political repression and chemical gas attacks, and Uganda's military intelligence chief was hit with sanctions for extreme abuse of people arrested for their nationality or political beliefs.The announcement came ahead of the Washington-hosted Summit for Democracy later this week, billed as a push to promote more free and open societies."The United States is committed to promoting democracy and accountability for those who abuse human rights around the world," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement."The United States will utilize its full range of tools to highlight and disrupt these abuses of human rights," he said.The Iranian sanctions singled out officials and entities involved in brutal crackdowns on protests in 2009 and 2019, including Hassan Karami, the commander of the LEF Special Units, which are focused on crowd control and protest suppression, the Treasury said.Also named was Gholamreza Soleimani, who commands the Basij, the country's Islamic militia also involved in the deadly 2009 and 2019 crackdowns.The Syrians blacklisted included two air force major generals, Tawfiq Muhammad Khadour and Muhammad Youssef Al-Hasouri, who the Treasury said was responsible for chemical gas attacks that killed numerous civilians in 2017 and 2018.Security officials considered responsible for other harsh attacks on opponents of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were also named."These senior officials and the organizations they are associated with have imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Syrians who peacefully called for change. Moreover, at least 14,000 prisoners in Syria have allegedly died as a result of torture," the Treasury said.The Ugandan hit with sanctions was the commander of the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence, Major General Abel Kandiho.People arrested by Kandiho's bureau "were subjected to horrific beatings and other egregious acts by (military intelligence) officials, including sexual abuse and electrocutions, often resulting in significant long-term injury and even death," the Treasury said.The US Treasury "will continue to defend against authoritarianism, promoting accountability for the violent repression of people seeking to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms," said Andrea Gacki, head of the Treasury's sanctions office.The expansion of the broad US sanctions on Tehran came after the first direct negotiations on limiting Iran's nuclear program in five months failed to make headway, with both sides blaming the other for unwillingness to give ground.But talks are to resume on Thursday, Tehran's main negotiator said during a visit to Moscow."I deemed it necessary at this stage to consult the Russian authorities in order to continue the talks in a constructive atmosphere," Ali Bagheri, Tehran's chief nuclear negotiator, said on Tuesday according to Iranian state television's Iribnews website.A US official was cautious about the next round.“We are much less concerned about the when, and much more concerned about... whether Iran comes back to Vienna prepared to engage in good faith, prepared to engage sincerely, and steadfastly as we are,” the official told reporters on grounds of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-nuclear-talks-us-hits-iran-with-new-sanctions-for-human-rights-abuses-101638920441022.html
08-12-2021||World||Don’t invade Ukraine, Joe Biden warns Vladimir Putin||President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned President Vladimir Putin that the United States and its allies will respond with “strong economic and other measures” if he invaded neighbouring Ukraine, which has seemed imminent because of the amassing of Russian troops along the border.In a video call with the Russian leader, Biden also reiterated US support of his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy, according to a readout issued by the White House.The two leaders also discussed the US-Russia dialogue on Strategic Stability, a separate dialogue on ransomware, as well as joint work on regional issues such as Iran.The United States and allies have watched with concern as Russia has deployed close to 100,000 troops to the border with Ukraine and fear a repeat of 2014 when Russia had snatched Crimea from Ukraine after a similar military build-up.A senior Biden administration official told reporters on Monday that the US president will “raise these concerns” and he will also make clear that there “will be very real costs should Russia choose to proceed”.The United States and allies have discussed crippling financial sanctions as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We have had intensive discussions with our European partners about what we would do collectively in the event of a major Russian military escalation in Ukraine. And we believe that we have a path forward that would involve substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the United States that would impose significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed”.Joe Biden held discussions with counterparts from France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom ahead of the call with Vladimir Putin to present a joint front. The leaders underscored their support for the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine and called upon Putin to de-escalate tensions and pursue diplomacy, according to a White House readout of the discussions.The United States has shared intelligence about Russian military movements along the border with allies, a senior Biden administration official confirmed to reporters while previewing the call.The official did not go into details but said “we have seen the movement of additional capabilities and forces to the vicinity of Ukraine in multiple different areas. And these movements are consistent with the planning that we see underway for a military escalation in Ukraine”.Asked if the US could consider deploying troops to defend Ukraine, the official refused to discuss “the particular sensitive challenges” that Joe Biden will lay out for Vladimir Putin but said, “the United States is not seeking to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force, as opposed to a combination of support for the Ukrainian military, strong economic countermeasures, and the substantial increase in support and capability to our Nato allies to ensure that they remain safe”.But in the event of an invasion, the US respond positively to request for additional forces from NATO’s Eastern Flank countries - Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria - who will be worried about Russian intentions, as in 2014.“In the event of an invasion, the need to reinforce the confidence and reassurance of our Nato allies and our Eastern Flank allies would be real, and the United States would be prepared to provide that kind of reassurance,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-invade-ukraine-joe-biden-warns-vladimir-putin-101638902713250.html

The conviction drew global condemnation. State-run TV reported she will serve two years in detention after the sentence was reduced from four years because of a partial pardon from Myanmar’s military chief.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi referred to the proceedings against 76-year-old Suu Kyi and others in Myanmar and said, “We are disturbed at the recent verdicts. As a neighbouring democracy, India has been consistently supportive of the democratic transition in Myanmar.”India believes that “the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld”, he said.“Any development that undermines these processes and accentuates differences is a matter of deep concern. It is our sincere hope that keeping their nation’s future in mind, efforts would be made by all sides to advance the path of dialogue,” Bagchi said.Also Read: Myanmar junta halves Aung San Suu Kyi’s jail termIndia has attempted to maintain a delicate balance between Myanmar’s military junta and democratic forces since the February 1 coup in the Southeast Asian country, mainly because of security concerns associated with the northeastern states.It has called for the restoration of the democratic process, but stopped short of strongly criticising Myanmar’s military rulers due to fears that it could push the country closer to China.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup against the democratically elected government led to protests and sparked global concern about the end of political reforms following decades of military rule.Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi has been detained since the coup along with most leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. She faces a dozen cases, including corruption charges and violations of a state secrets act, a telecommunications law and Covid-19 regulations, and has denied the charges.Suu Kyi’s supporters say the cases are baseless and designed to end her political career.The trial in the capital Naypyitaw was closed to the media and Suu Kyi’s lawyers were barred from communicating with the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expresses-concern-over-aung-san-suu-kyi-s-conviction-101638873068289.html
08-12-2021||India||Rawat never cared for his popularity, dog-loving general took hard decisions||India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, 63, was an outspoken military leader who took pride in his convictions, took hard decisions at the cost of becoming unpopular in certain circles, thought outside the box and was known to challenge status quo, people who have known him for decades said.He was also a dog lover and a rare general who didn’t play golf. Rawat had survived a chopper crash in February 2015 in India’s North-east.His leadership and courage were acknowledged on foreign soil too.General Rawat epitomised military professionalism like no one else, said a retired three-star general who was among Rawat’s best friends. “He was driven by his own convictions. He took strong decisions even if they were not popular. The organisation’s interests were always topmost for him and he didn’t really care about his own popularity,” said Lieutenant General BS Sandhu (retd), who knew Rawat for more than 45 years and was his course mate at the Khadakwasla-based National Defence Academy.Sandhu’s wife Kuka and Madhulika attended Daulat Ram College in Delhi together, and like their husbands they too were best friends.Rawat’s previous appointments included those of the army chief, army vice chief, Southern Army commander, corps commander in the North-east and division commander in Kashmir.But the assignment he really loved talking about most was his tenure as the commander of United Nations’ North Kivu Brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the late 2000s. “It was one of my most memorable assignments. I am glad I could make a difference there,” Rawat told this correspondent a few years ago.When Rawat took charge of the brigade, things weren’t going too well for the world’s costliest peacekeeping mission, known by its French acronym MONUC. The locals were contemptuous of UN peacekeepers, questioning what difference they had made and accusing the mission of doing little to protect them. Angry crowds would often hurl stones at UN vehicles on the streets of Goma, the capital of North Kivu and where the Indian brigade is based.“We were not fighting with our equipment, despite Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorising the use of force in some scenarios. We have decided to fight with our equipment,” Rawat told this correspondent who was covering the conflict in eastern Congo in 2008.Rawat reworked the velvet-glove strategy to an iron fist within a month of his arrival, frequently authorising the use of attack helicopters to strafe positions held by rebel groups responsible for civilian deaths, recruiting child soldiers and displacing millions of people. He was able to control the situation quickly.Under Rawat’s leadership, the Indian brigade saved a key Congolese province from being overrun by rebels. Lieutenant General Babacar Gaye, then Force Commander of the UN mission in the Congo, wrote in the commendation awarded to Rawat that it was due to his “leadership, courage and experience” that North Kivu’s capital Goma never fell, the country’s eastern region was stabilised and the main rebel group was forced to come to the negotiating table.General Rawat was a man with tremendous moral courage, said Lieutenant General Ajai Singh, who heads the Andaman and Nicobar Command and reported directly to CDS. “He was an exceptional military leader, with a rare, larger vision for integrated war fighting,” Singh said.From changing the face of UN peacekeeping to closely supervising India’s two publicly acknowledged surgical strikes on foreign soil, Rawat brought enormous experience to the table as India’s first CDS, something acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.Son of a three-star general, Rawat was commissioned into the army in December 1978 after graduating from the Dehradun-based Indian Military Academy where he was awarded the coveted Sword of Honour for exceptional performance. He was commissioned into the 5/11 Gorkha Rifles.The National Democratic Alliance government superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz — to appoint him army chief in 2016. Rawat’s experience in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast tipped the scales in his favour.In a statement, the Indian Army said Rawat was a visionary who initiated far reaching reforms in the military’s higher defence organisation, and was instrumental in creating the foundation of India’s joint theatre commands and giving impetus to the increased indigenisation of military equipment, a legacy which will be carried on and strengthened by successive generations.

We received a 60% vote share in the civic polls and we will score 70% votes in the 2023 Assembly polls, “ Biplab Kumar Deb said at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly-elected councillors of the Agartala Municipal Corporation in the Tripura capital. The BJP won all 51 seats in the Agartala Municipal Corporation.The BJP ended up with 329 seats of a total of 334 in the civic body elections, including 112 seats which the party won without contest. On the seats that people voted, BJP received 59% of the total votes cast by people. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) was a distant second with 18.1% and three seats while the Trinamool Congress won just one seat and 16.4% of the votes polled.Biplab Kumar Deb advised municipal councillors to dedicate themselves in the service of people by following what he called the three ‘S’ formula and triple ‘N’ formula and also stressed to review their work periodically and expand their future path. By triple ‘ S’ formula, Deb meant Sambad (communication), Swabhab (behaviour) and Sadachar (good conduct) and by triple ‘N’, he meant Niyat (intention), Niti (policy) and Niyam (rules).According to news agency ANI, he continued: “There is no shortcut. Do good work and you will see the future doors full of opportunities open for you. Agartala smart city must emerge as the smartest city in the country.

08-12-2021||India||Need to expand fleet, improve manufacturing to counter Pakistan, China: IAF chief||China poses a significant challenge to the realisation of India’s strategic goals, while Pakistan has upgraded its combat aircraft fleet and forward airbases, the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief said on Wednesday, outlining key threats facing the country. To counter these challenges, the IAF needs to rapidly modernise, expand its fleet and improve indigenous manufacturing capability, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said while addressing an event organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies. “In my assessment, China possesses a more significant and long-term challenge to the realisation of India’s strategic goals,” he said. China continues to display its economic and military might and its assertiveness is bound to grow, he said, adding this will increase “contestation and competition” in the economic domain. China will also try to tie India down by keeping the country engaged on the unsettled border, he said. Beijing’s aggressive intent is most visible in the rapid enhancement of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s operational infrastructure, such as additional airfields in the Tibet Autonomous Region. China has also deployed air defence units, advanced aircraft and drones at these facilities, he said.Force multipliers such as rocket and strategic forces are “redefining the contours of future warfare”, Chaudhari noted.At the same time, India continues to be in a “no war no peace” situation on the border with Pakistan, which is unlikely to ditch its Kashmir-oriented strategy for the foreseeable future, the IAF chief said.The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is equipping itself with advanced aircraft and upgrading air defence capabilities. It has also built up 24 main and forward operating bases and six satellite bases, and this provides it with greater flexibility to “influence battles across a large spectrum and larger volume of areas”, he said. The Pakistani military has formulated a new concept of war fighting called “triple R” or rearticulate, reorganise and relocate. “Strategically, they are making a transition from fighting a predominantly defensive war to adapting a more aggressive approach for an offensive defence under the nuclear umbrella,” Chaudhari said.For the IAF, all of this translates into a need for a higher counter-air effort to ensure minimum interference from the Pakistani side and to gain requisite control of the airspace, he contended. The IAF needs to rapidly modernise, expand its fleet of combat aircraft and improve indigenous manufacturing capability, Chaudhari said. While budget will remain a constraint, the prioritisation of procurements for key combat elements becomes very critical. Training and equipment is needed to fight and win tomorrow’s war and India must not lose focus in attempt to distribute finances for the defence sector evenly, he said.“There is a need to brainstorm and find solutions to further our national interests in this constantly evolving regional and global security environment,” Chaudhari said.“In an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous geo-political environment, there is a strong linkage between security and development and this is where the armed forces come in,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-expand-fleet-improve-manufacturing-to-counter-pakistan-china-iaf-chief-101638983782771.html
08-12-2021||India||Meat-climate debate is a red herring in India||There is increasing realization that meat-based diets lead to harmful emissions. Many scientific studies show the world stands to gain if people either give up or even reduce eating meat. For example, a 2019 article in the Nature journal, citing a report by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that if the world were to shift to a completely plant-based diet, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be equivalent to what could be achieved by replacing all fossil fuel-based power plants with nuclear power plants in 2018. To be sure, such estimates have been questioned and doubts remain whether private choices such as food habits can be changed by government policies, especially in the first world. However, the meat-climate debate is pretty much a red herring for a country like India, which faces a different challenge when it comes to protein consumption. Here are four charts to explain this.Meat has a minuscule presence in Indian dietsA 2018 HT analysis used data from the 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) to show that less than 2% of Indians consumed chicken or meat as part of their daily diet. This is different from the prevalence of meat in diets in the advanced capitalist countries, or even countries such as China. Data from the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organisation shows this clearly. Per capita protein intake from meat in India is a small fraction of what it is in countries such as the US and China. A Carbon Brief interactive shows that South Asia ranks lowest in the world in terms of red meat consumption and could sustainably have a diet made up of almost twice as much red meat, according to EAT-Lancet. South Asians also eat the least amount of poultry out of any of the world’s regions, the brief said. The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health brought together 37 scientists from across the globe to look at the question of feeding a future population of 10 billion people a healthy diet within planetary boundaries.Lack of meat in diets is not just a reflection of low-income levels in IndiaOne of the major reasons why Indians do not consume a lot of meat is that they cannot afford it. Food consumption accounts for almost 40% of the average household spending in India. As much as 40% of the food budget in Indian households goes towards buying cereals and vegetables. The share of egg, fish and meat is just above 10%.That meat consumption increases as incomes rise is a well-established fact. This is best seen in China, which has seen a massive spike in per capita intake of meat in its high-growth period (see Chart 1). The India story, however, might not be the same, given the cultural and religious factors that encourage vegetarianism. To be sure, such preferences influencing meat consumption is a vexed issue in India. For example, a 2015 Mint story showed that an estimated 12.5 million Hindus also consumed beef or buffalo meat, dispelling a widely held notion that only Muslims ate this meat.On the other hand, the 2015-16 NFHS data does offer some evidence to suggest that for a section of the population, meat consumption declines as incomes increase. It suggests some sort of a Sanskritisation effect, and calls for more research. However, what can also be said on the basis of this data is that India’s future meat consumption need not increase at a pace as fast as China as per capita incomes rise.India’s problem is too little protein, not too much of meat-based proteinWhile advanced countries debate the merits and feasibility of reducing meat consumption and shifting to plant-based protein diets, India has a more pressing problem at hand. Indians do not get enough protein in their diets. The Indian Council of Medical Research has a prescribed 60 grams of protein per day for men. For women, this number varies from 78 grams per day during pregnancy to 55 grams for non-pregnant women. According to the 2011-12 Consumption Expenditure Survey of the National Sample Survey – these are the latest available numbers – per capita protein intake was lower than 60 grams per day prescribed for more than half of the population. Indians also get a majority of their protein from cereals, rather than lentils or meat.Making pulses more affordable will be good for both nutrition and the climateEven though India does not need to cut down on its emissions due to meat consumption, it can still contribute to the cause if pulses become more affordable. A 2018 article by Priya Rampal published in the Food and Nutrition Bulletin, a peer-reviewed international journal, says that daily pulse consumption in India was lower than the prescribed norm of 40 grams per capita per day for 90% of the rural population. The article also says, “The consumption of protein from animal foods and milk and milk products is positively related to the price of pulses,” which means that “as price of pulses increases, the sample shifts to consumption of protein from animal sources and milk and milk products.” “it becomes important to contain volatility in pulse prices given that it is a major source of plant protein,” the article says, and points to higher consumption of protein in states that distribute lentils in the public distribution system.These findings, when read with the fact that India imports a large quantity of pulses, and pulse prices show a far greater price volatility than meat and milk products (the other major sources of protein), underline one of the low-hanging fruits in the pursuit of nutrition and climate goals in India. However, it needs to be emphasized that a mindless pursuit or forcing of vegetarianism without supporting pulse consumption will only make India’s protein deficiency crisis worse as well as hurting the incomes of mostly poor farmers and small businessmen (unlike the big businesses running the meat-industrial complex in the West) involved in India’s livestock and poultry economy.

Notably, advocate Gayathri is his granddaughter.The memorial lecture saw advocate Gayathri along with advocate Prasanth VG – both practising in Bengaluru, talk about “Contract Labour and Law – Indian Experiments.” The event was organised by Kerala Club president Omchery NN Pillai and other members, and saw the attendance of Armed Forces Tribunal chairperson Justice Rajendra Menon as the chief guest.During the memorial lecture, advocate Gayathri shed light on the gig economy of India, which is driven by the digital advancement of the modern times. Explaining who gig workers are, she gave reference of gig workers in popular platforms such as Uber, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy and Big Basket delivery firms, among others.How gig workers face exploitation?Advocate Gayathri highlighted how people were heavily dependent on workers of Uber, Zomato and Swiggy, among others, during the lockdown induced by the first and the second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India. “You would assume that these workers had some sort of protection or some benefit accruing out of their employment apart from their salaries but unfortunately that is not the case,” advocate Gayathri said, adding that the workers were termed as ‘independent contractors’.Explaining the problem behind such a term, she noted that such classification as opposed to a regular employee, refrains the gig workers from availing of regular protection that employers are obligated to offer under the labour enactments.“So, a gig worker does not have the right to any kind of insurance including health insurance, sick leaves, paid holidays, pension and gratuity or provident fund benefits,” she said, stressing on the fact that several of these workers hail from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of the society.Why does exploitation happen among gig workers?Advocate Gayathri said that on a superficial level, it may appear as if the relationship between gig workers and their employers is not traditional since one can choose when to login to the app and when to start working, among others.“This is precisely what is said by a lot of these companies – they say that their liability is very limited and that they are not responsible for the welfare of these workers because the company connects the gig worker with the customer by providing them with the technology aspect and hence, these gig-workers aren’t employed by these platforms,” she added during the event.She said that even the contracts of the gig workers are penned in a way that would show as if the employer doesn’t have any role to the play, and the final agreement is between the worker and the customer.The lawyer mentioned that digital platforms have adequate large resources at their disposal and hence, their contracts for the gig workers are drafted in such a manner that it protects the firm from the chance of any employment liability.“This is a modern issue of exploitation and the question is whether there’s a planned subversion by the employers to avoid having to provide employment benefits under various enactments,” advocate Gayathri noted.Is there a solution to eradicate exploitation of gig workers?Speaking about how gig workers can be classified by their employers, advocate Gayathri referred to two cases handled by her grandfather Justice Poti. While one case throws light on a ruling by Justice Poti 35 years ago wherein the court noted that there was a “planned subversion of the laws” on part of the employer and also a “deliberate attempt to avoid falling under [labour] laws.” The case was betwee Lokh Adhikar Singh versus the State of Gujrat and others in which Singh – a society focussed on the upgradation of social and democratic rights, approached the court claiming that Surat’s textile workers were being made to work in horrible conditions and their poverty was being exploited.Meanwhile, the other case was Rohit Vasavacia versus Indian Farmers Fertilizers Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) in which two of the firm’s labourers approached the court alleging that the contract labourers hired by contractors to work in the factory were deplorable. A probe by a court-appointed panel found that labourers were “overworked, wages weren’t paid on time and even if they were, it was a lot less than the minimum wage.”In the second matter, Justice Poti ordered the production of several of the workers to take their statements directly, and also asked the court-appointed committee to make arrangements to pay wages to all those who wanted to leave the IFFCO factory in the meantime.“As a consequence, during the pendency of the proceedings itself, the workers witnessed a drastic improvement in regard to their work conditions as the contractors did not want implicate themselves any further,” advocate Gayathri mentioned, saying that the contractors obtained licenses under the contract labour law, and the workers’ food quality improved too, among others.She said that in both the cases, the contractors argued that they had no real obligation towards the workers and that the latter have been working “voluntarily” and could depart anytime they wanted. “Justice Poti said that forced labour was not restricted to the traditional understanding where workers were physically restrained from leaving the work, it would have to include those instances where persons were financially/economically compelled to perform work in inhuman conditions without the safeguards and amenities available to them under the law,” advocate Gayathri pointed out.She explained that in case of gig workers too, the voluntary work is a point often raised by digital app-based platforms. “In India, under the new proposed Labour Code, the central government, unlike earlier, is empowered to frame welfare scheme for such unorganised worker, including gig workers that [consists of] insurance coverage, maternity and health benefits, retirement benefits, etc but of course but unfortunately, the enactment and the welfare schemes have not come into force as of yet,” advocate Gayathri highlighted.What teachings did advocate Gayathri imbibe from her grandfather?Lovingly known as ‘ajju’ to her, advocate Gayathri said that the last one moth proved to be fruitful in rendering her a new insight into her grandfather – Justice Poti. “I was 5 when he passed away and while I had learnt about his landmark judgments and his general achievements, it’s only after the last month’s research that I truly realized how passionate he was in his relentless pursuit of justice for the most underprivileged in society,” she said during the memorial at Kerala Club.She said that her ajju often said that his experiences as the lawyer showed that there is “always a society behind each client.” “Whenever a client approached him with a problem, Justice Poti would go beyond just the problem at hand and evaluate the background from which the client came because he knew that a lot of these issues were not just an issue faced by that individual litigant but rather an issue faced by society at large,” advocate Gayathri added about her grandfather.Advocate Gayathri said that she hopes to contribute “at least a fraction” of what Justice Poti did for the legal profession in India and to the society at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/where-does-exploitation-in-the-age-of-gig-economy-stand-lawyer-answers-101638980608295.html

08-12-2021||India||CDS General Rawat’s shocking demise throws up questions on succession||The shocking demise of India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash on Wednesday will have direct implications for the country’s top military hierarchy and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan at a time India is locked in a border standoff with China, top officials said.“The situation is unprecedented as General Rawat was the country’s first CDS. The government will have to select a top officer and appoint him as CDS. The succession line-up in the three services is broadly known but not so in the case of CDS as it’s a new appointment,” said one of the officials cited above.Watch: IAF chopper crash: Who is Grp Capt Varun Singh, sole survivor of crash which killed Gen Bipin Rawat?Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane has become the senior-most military officer in the country after Rawat’s demise. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him.There is a strong possibility of Naravane being named as the next CDS if the government follows the seniority principle, said a second official. “If Naravane is named the next CDS, the post of army chief will fall vacant. The government will have to appoint a new army chief. Rawat’s death will have a cascading effect on the succession line-up of the armed forces,” he added.Army vice chief Lieutenant General CP Mohanty and Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi, who are both course-mates, are the senior-most officers in the army after General Naravane.According to a key recommendation made by the Shekatkar Committee on enhancing the military’s combat potential, the government should choose the CDS from among the three service chiefs. Naravane will be the frontrunner for the top job if the government goes by that recommendation made by an 11-member expert panel, headed by Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd).“The government will have to appoint the new CDS as soon as possible keeping in mind the security challenges India faces from China and Pakistan,” Shekatkar said.Naravane is due for retirement next April but that may not happen in the changed circumstances. Many in the security establishment believe that the first two or three CDS appointments should be from the army as the security challenges the country faces are along the borders with the two adversaries.However, making top appointments is the government’s prerogative. The possibility of deep selection cannot be ruled out as was done when Rawat was appointed army chief almost five years back, said a third official.The National Democratic Alliance government superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz — to appoint him army chief on December 31, 2016. Rawat’s experience in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast tipped the scales in his favour.Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years, making him the longest serving four-star general in India.As CDS, Rawat wore multiple hats --- he was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), headed the department of military affairs (DMA), and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar last week said the creation of DMA and the post of CDS two years ago was “the single most important” higher defence organisation reform since Independence.The appointment of a CDS was backed by a group of ministers after recommendations made by the K Subrahmanyam-led Kargil Review Committee (KRC) that was constituted in the immediate aftermath of the 1999 Kargil war to examine lapses that allowed Pakistani soldiers to occupy strategic heights, the initial sluggish Indian response, and suggest measures to strengthen national security.

The match turned into one of the roughest of the tournament with players often nearly coming to blows. Russia, hot favourites for the title from the start of the Games, only just clinched the match after a goalless first half. The only goal came in the ninth minute of the second half when outside-left Anatolii Iliine headed into the net. Eighteen minutes later, Yugoslavia’s inside-left Todor Veselinovic, netted, but he was ruled offside. Yugoslavia, who win the soccer Silver Medal for the third time running, dominated the first half. Their team played better, individually moved the ball faster and generally dictated terms. But they were unable to press home their advantage and the Russians started to press hard from the first minute of the second half. WINNING GOAL Russian forwards crowded the Yugoslav goalmouth and Iliine snatched the winning goal when, he got his boot to a headed pass from Anatolii Issaev, the inside-right. The Yugoslavs lost a lot of their earlier sparkle when their goal in the 18th minute was disallowed. The game then degenerated into little better than a brawl with the crowd continuing to catcall and boo until the final whistle. - Reuters||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-december-9-1956-russia-win-soccer-gold-medal-101638975681822.html

Gogoi is accompanied by Congress leaders Jitendra Singh Alwar and Ajoy Kumar, all of whom were seen sitting outside the departure gates of the airport in Assam.“Protesting against the illegal detention of Congress delegation at Jorhat and preventing us from traveling to Mon district in Nagaland to meet the families of the victims,” Gogoi wrote on Twitter.“Detained at Jorhat along with the AICC delegation , Assam Police has orders to hold us in Jorhat, Assam and prevent us from traveling to Mon district, Nagaland. Why are we not being allowed to meet the families of the victims,” Gogoi further wrote and tagged Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Union home minister Amit Shah in the tweet.The counter-insurgency operation gone awry in Mon district’s Oting has brought widespread criticism to the security forces as well as the government.The deaths of the civilians have also ignited the debate surrounding the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act that allows the forces to function with impunity.The forces had initially fired at a vehicle mistakenly assuming it to be belonging to militants leading to the death of seven coal miners. Soon after, angry villagers reached the spot and set ablaze two vehicles of the security personnel following which the forces fired a few more rounds killing more civilians. The home minister has informed the Lok Sabha that it was a case of mistaken identity and said that the army personnel were carrying out the operation on the basis of inputs which indicated movement of extremists in the Oting area of Mon.“On that basis, 21 commandos laid an ambush in the suspected area. As a vehicle reached there, it was signalled to stop but it started speeding away. On suspicion the vehicle was carrying extremists, the personnel fired at it killing 6 of 8 people,” Shah said. "It was later found to be a case of mistaken identity," Shah added.Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio said that the incidents highlighted the need for removal of AFSPA and said that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation. The army has set up a court of inquiry into the killings of the civilians and said the probe will be headed by a major general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-deaths-gaurav-gogoi-led-cong-team-stopped-from-meeting-victims-kin-101638973001197.html

The chopper was on its way from the Sulur airbase to DSSC at Wellington. The CDS and his wife had flown to Sulur from New Delhi in an Embraer jet of the IAF’s VVIP communication squadron.Rawat took over as India’s first CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. He was the longest-serving four-star general in the country’s military history. Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations.From changing the face of United Nations peacekeeping in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to initiating the biggest exercise to restructure the army to closely supervising India’s two publicly acknowledged surgical strikes on foreign soil, Rawat, a rare general who did not play golf, brought enormous experience to the table as India’s first CDS.Those who have known the general for several decades say Rawat always thought outside the box, took hard decisions and was not afraid of challenging the status quo.Son of a three-star general, Rawat was commissioned into the army in December 1978 after graduating from the Dehradun-based Indian Military Academy where he was awarded the coveted Sword of Honour for exceptional performance. He was commissioned into the 5/11 Gorkha Rifles.The National Democratic Alliance government superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz — to appoint him army chief. Rawat’s experience in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast tipped the scales in his favour.

Devendra Fadnavis floated the possibility of Pratapsingh Rane, one of the three remaining Congress legislators in the Goa assembly, crossing sides and “blessing” the BJP at a party event to induct Ravi Naik, a turncoat from the Congress. Fadnavis said when Pratapsingh Rane makes the switch, the Congress, which has been reduced from a Nano (a small car with four wheels) to an autorickshaw or a three wheeler, the Congress could become a cycle, or a two MLA party.Pratapsingh Rane delivered his rejoinder to Fadnavis in a 34-second video that was circulated by the Goa Congress.Also Read: IAF chopper with CDS Bipin Rawat on board crashes in Tamil Nadu“The news that is being spread that I am quitting my party is a figment of imagination.

He was the assembly speaker between 2007 and 2012. He has been continuously elected since 1972 when he was first elected to the then legislative assembly of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. “I belong to the Congress party for over 45 years. and I do not think that I would ever at this juncture of leaving the Congress party. I belong to the Indian National Congress and that’s it,” the former Chief Minister also said.Rane’s son Vishwajit quit the Congress in 2017 after the party couldn’t form the government despite emerging as the largest party in the 40-member assembly with 17 legislators. He resigned as a Congress MLA, won the bye-election on a BJP ticket and was appointed a minister, first in the Manohar Parrikar cabinet and later, in Pramod Sawant’s team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-shifting-to-bjp-10-time-goa-mla-pratapsingh-rane-rebuts-devendra-fadnavis-101638964401453.html

According to people aware of the development, the state election body will be sending a recommendation to conduct the polls to the Election Commission of India (ECI) after December 15, by which time details of the newly elected panchayat representatives from all districts will be collated.As per the norms, the elected panchayat representatives like ward members of gram panchayats, mukhiyas, Panchayat Samiti members, and district board members as well as ward members of the urban local bodies are members of the Electoral College that elects the MLCs from local authorities’ constituencies across the state. “We will be seeking details of all newly elected panchayat representatives from the DMs soon; once the last phase of panchayat polls scheduled to be held on December 11, is over. A formal letter to the ECI will be sent,” said a senior official in the state election department. The election for the 24 seats could be held in February next year, people aware of the development said.At present, the strength in the state legislative council is 51 as against the total strength of 75 in the Upper House. The 24 MLC seats, which fell vacant in June this year, have not been filled due to the delay in conducting the panchayat polls.The MLC polls are poised to be a keen contest between the ruling NDA and opposition RJD with both sides already gearing up to win more seats by rallying support from the panchayat members. There are also speculations that the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas faction) led by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan could enter into an understanding with the RJD to contest the MLC polls though there has been no formal announcement in this matter.

This is against the law and secondly, we don’t want any such camp in our area,” said Gajju Ram, president of Chhotebethiya block of Sarv Aadivasi Samaj.The protest is taking place in the jungles of Bethiya village on the banks of the Kotri river.“We don’t want any camp or a tourism centre in this area. We request the government to retract these proposals otherwise the protest will continue until our demands are fulfilled” said Ram, adding that around 500 villagers have joined the protest till now.Senior police officers however said there was no official confirmation that a security camp may be setup in the area.“They are anticipating that a camp will be established to build the bridge on Kotri river which passes through the area, but till now, no official communication in this regard has been done,” said Shalabh Sinha, Kanker’s police chief.Inspector general of police, Bastar range , Sunderaj P said that villagers were misguided by the Maoists and hence they were protesting.Also Read: Mayor objects to BJP MLA’s comment, women’s commission takes suo moto cognisance“In the recent years we have made decisive inroads into erstwhile Maoist stronghold areas in Bastar Region. This could be achieved mainly because of the security camps, which have been established to facilitate development works and connectivity projects. Last year Kamdeta and Katgaon camps were established along Koylibeda-Pratapur road in Kanker. Both these camps were instrumental in fulfilling dreams of hundreds of villages to construct bridges across Medki and Waler river,” he saidHe said all the positive developments were irritating the Maoist formations.“Drastically their area of influence is getting diminished. This situation is making them misguide the villagers to protest against development works. But we are hopeful of convincing the villagers,” said the IG.It is worth mentioning that in May 2021, three people were killed when security personnel opened fire on thousands of protestors including suspected Maoists on the fifth day of protests against the setting up of a CRPF camp in Bastar’s Silger village- a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh.Villagers said they feared the presence of CRPF personnel in the camp would lead to harassment of innocent tribals.

Promises made by the BJP are mere ‘jumla,’ they have been lying continuously. They have misled people. Did they fulfil their promises? Did the farmers’ income double? Did the youth get jobs?” he questioned. Those who sell public property are perturbed with the colour red. This is a govt that sells.

He also sought a timeline for withdrawal of cases.“Farmers' protests will continue until after government accepts all of our demands... It would be problematic for us if we withdraw our protest, but they don't take back the cases. The government should announce a timeline for the withdrawal of cases,” Charuni was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Charuni said the Centre should follow the Punjab model while giving compensation to the kin of over 700 deceased farmers."For compensation to over 700 deceased farmers' kin, we want the Centre to follow Punjab model; ₹5 lakh compensation and a job as announced by Punjab government should be implemented by Government of India as well," Charuni said.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella of farmer unions, had formed a five-member committee and is awaiting the government's response on the matter.A member of SKM's panel Ashok Dhawale said, "We appreciate that the government is ready for talks and is giving something in writing. But the proposal had a few flaws, so last night, we sent it back with some amendments and are awaiting their response.""The formation of a Minimum Support Price (MSP)-focused committee is needed, including members from the farmers' union. The government also said that the cases registered against us will be taken back after we finish the movement, which is wrong. We don't like sitting here in the cold," he said.Further pointing out the "flaws" in the proposal, Dhawale said, "The compensation has been approved theoretically. We need something concrete like the Punjab model. They also promised to take back the electricity bill, but now they want to discuss it with the stakeholders and then put it up in Parliament. It is contradictory."Samyukt Kisan Morcha's five-member committee held an urgent meeting in the national capital on Wednesday. They are likely to take a decision on the future course of action on farmers' protest.On Tuesday, Samyukta Kisan Morcha held a meeting to discuss the Centre's response and said that some pending issues still remain.The farmers' body informed that the government, in its proposal, has asked them to first end the protest and only then cases against them will be taken back.Addressing the press conference after the meeting on Tuesday, SKM's Balbir Singh Rajewal said that they will not accept the government's condition that cases against farmers will be withdrawn after agitation is called off."Government's proposal says after we end the movement, then only will they withdraw cases. We are apprehensive about it. Government should immediately begin with the (cases' withdrawal) procedure. Final decision to be taken at tomorrow's meeting," said Balbir Singh Rajewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-will-continue-till-what-farmer-leader-charuni-said-after-key-meeting-101638948660571.html

Stating that the launch was a ‘copy book flight,’ the release further said that the missile followed the pre-planned trajectory, meeting all of its mission objectives.“During the test, the structural integrity and functional performance have been proven. It clears the system for the serial production of air version BrahMos missiles within the country,” the defence ministry said, adding that the previous flight test of the air version took place last July.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has praised the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), BrahMos Aerospace, IAF and the industry on successful test-firing, the release also said.BrahMos is a joint India-Russia venture, between the DRDO and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which, together, formed the Brahmos Aerospace. The missile derives its name from two rivers: the Brahmaputra in India and the Moskva of Russia. A day ago, on Tuesday, India successfully test-fired the Vertically Launched Short Range Surface to Air Missile (VL-SRSAM) from the Chandipur-based ITR.

A Reuters report from Sao Paulo on Tuesday said India accounted for 8.25% of the total agribusiness products imported by the 22 Arab League members last year, higher than Brazil’s 8.15%, ending a 15-year advantage for Brazil, according to data provided by the Arab-Brazil Chamber of Commerce to Reuters on Tuesday. “The Arab world is among Brazil’s most important trade partners, but its distance from those markets took its toll as the [Covid-19] pandemic rattled global logistics,” the report said. According to the chamber, India’s edge lay in quickly shipping food products to the Arab states beating pandemic-related disruptions to global supply chains. India is now capable of shipping fruits, vegetables, sugar, grains and meat to the Arab nations in about a week’s time whereas Brazil’s shipments to Saudi Arabia now takes up to 60 days, according to the Arab-Brazil Chamber of Commerce. According to official data from the ministry of commerce, agriculture exports from India registered a sharp increase of nearly 25% in 2020-21 over the previous year. The increase came even as India’s total exports had dropped by over 7%. Agricultural exports expanded to $32.5 billion in 2020-21, nearly close to the record level of $32.7 billion seen in 2012-13. The share of agriculture in the total exports exceeded 11%, the highest on record.

The court allowed Bharadwaj to submit the cash surety, which would enable her to walk out of the jail either on Wednesday itself or Thursday.Bharadwaj, who is currently lodged at Byculla jail in the city, will also be required to reside in the jurisdiction of the court after her release and cannot leave Mumbai without its permission, the order stated. While granting the lawyer-activist default bail last week, the Bombay high court had also directed her to be produced before the special NIA court in the city on December 8 to decide upon the conditions of her bail and the date of release.The case against Bharadwaj relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial located on the city's outskirts. The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists. The probe in the case was later transferred to the NIA.Sudha Bharadwaj was arrested in August 2018 under the provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case.After the Bombay high court granted her default bail on December 1, the NIA had moved the Supreme Court against her bail order. However, the top court junked the agency's plea yesterday and upheld the Bombay high court's bail order. A bench of justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat, and Bela M Trivedi also asked the NIA why it made this application for an extension before a magisterial court when there is a separate special court at Pune, manned by special judges who ought to be hearing the NIA case.Although Bharadwaj is the first among 16 activists and academicians arrested in the case to have been granted default bail, the pleas of others, including poet-activist Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, and Arun Ferreira, were rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhimakoregaon-activist-sudha-bharadwaj-to-be-released-from-jail-on-rs-50k-bail-bond-101638945499630.html

However, Sasikala’s office described the meeting as a “courtesy call”. “She met Rajinikanth to congratulate him on winning the Dadasaheb Palke award and to enquire about his health,” the statement said. The meeting took place on Monday evening and pictures released show Rajinikanth’s wife Latha also in conversation with Sasikala. Both Sasikala and Rajinikanth are non-starters in Tamil Nadu’s political arena for widely different reasons. They have also been erstwhile neighbours in Chennai’s plush Poes Garden where Rajinikanth resides and late former chief minister J Jayalalithaa lived with Sasikala for at least three decades. The 70-year-old actor with a cult following across the globe announced his entry into politics in December 2017 and launched the Rajini Makkal Mandram. But after several fits and starts, he backtracked in December 2020 citing health reasons and the Covid-19 pandemic. Rajinikanth’s role was expected to shake up the state’s politics and he was being courted by the BJP which is trying to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu where the electorate has only favoured either the DMK or the AIADMK since 1967 when Congress lost power.Also Read: 3rd year in a row, Sitharaman features on Forbes’ 100 most powerful women listMeanwhile Sasikala is going all out to make a political comeback which has been thwarted repeatedly by the AIADMK’s current dual leadership of Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam --both her loyalists turned foes. Following Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016, the AIADMK unanimously declared Sasikala as the interim general secretary and she was set to take over as chief minister when the Supreme Court convicted her to a four-year jail term in Bengaluru in February 2017 in the disproportionate assets case.Later that year, she was expelled from the party and has been refused re-entry with her family members. The party changed vastly while she was imprisoned and since her release in February this year, Sasikala has tried to make a comeback but has mostly received a lukewarm response.To prevent her from finding a way into the AIADMK, the party last week amended its bylaws to re-elect Panneerselvam and Palaniswami as coordinator and joint coordinator--the top posts in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expelled-aiadmk-leader-sasikala-meets-rajinikanth-101638948139583.html

What's her link with conman Sukesh?||Bollywood actor Jacqueline Fernandez appeared before the Enforcement Directorate at its office in Delhi as the actor was summoned by the agency in connection with ₹200 crore extortion case involving alleged conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar. Jacqueline has been summoned after the ED in its chargesheet against alleged conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar and his wife actor Leena Maria Paul in the ₹200 crore mone laundering case mentioned Jacqueline's name.According to the chargesheet, the Sri Lankan actor received several expensive gifts from Sukesh, funded allegedly by the ill-gotten money. Chandrashekhar revealed during the interrogation that he had gifted Jacqueline a horse worth ₹52 lakh and a Persian cat worth ₹9 lakh.The case:The Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing in August registered an FIR against Chandrashekhar for allegedly duping the spouses of former promoters of Ranbaxy, Shivinder Singh, and Malvinder Singh, of ₹200 crore. In the FIR, it was alleged that a man posed as a home ministry official promised to help them with the case of their husbands, arrested in 2019 for allegedly causing losses to the tune of over ₹2,000 crore to Religare Finvest Ltd. Investigations so far revealed that Chandrashekhar operated the plan sitting from Tihar jail with the aid of the jail officials, who were later suspended. The Controversy:Amid the peak of the controversy, some cosy selfies of Jacqueline and SAukesh went viral on social media. Those photos were believed to be clicked between April-June this year when Chandrasekhar got interim bail. It has also been reported that when Sukesh was on interim bail, he booked a chartered flight for Jacqueline from Mumbai to Chennai.What Jacqueline said:The actor has been summoned by the ED in the past too. Till now, she has maintained that she has been a victim in the case. However, she has not issued any public statement regarding her ties with Sukesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jacqueline-fernandez-appears-before-ed-what-s-her-link-with-conman-sukesh-101638943917429.html

It seems impervious to the suffering of the people,” she said.Gandhi said the economy had lost momentum well before the Covid-19 pandemic hit India. “The pandemic accelerated this loss. But thanks to the government’s half-hearted and ill-advised responses, the situation has become even more serious,” she said.To provide relief to the public, the government recently lowered excise rates on petrol and diesel, while some state governments also announced additional price cuts.Gandhi, however, called the Centre’s excise rate cut on fuel “totally insufficient and inadequate”. She said, “As usual, the government has passed the responsibility for duty cuts to financially strapped state governments, when it itself has far greater room for action.”“And all this while, the Centre persists with huge public expenditure on vain, glorious projects,” said Gandhi, seemingly referring to the ongoing Central Vista project. The Opposition had earlier demanded that the Central Vista redevelopment must stop and the funds should to diverted for health infrastructure and other social welfare expenses.Demanding a debate in Parliament over price rise, Gandhi said, “The prices of edible oils, pulses and vegetables are burning a hole in the monthly budget of every household. The rising prices of cement, steel and other basic industrial commodities also do not bode well for economic recovery.”She questioned the government’s claims of economic recovery, saying, “But recovery for whom is the real question?”Alleging that the government is working only for a chosen few, Gandhi said, “It means nothing to those millions who have lost their livelihoods, and to those MSMEs whose businesses have been crippled - not just by the Covid-19 pandemic, but also by the combined effects of note bandi (demonetisation) and the hasty implementation of a flawed GST.”

The eastern state shares international borders with Nepal, Bhutan and China.

The panel members include farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ashok Dhawle, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Yudhvir Singh.On Saturday, the SKM formed a five-member panel, which will hold talks with the government on the pending demands of the protesting farmers, including a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, compensation to the kin of the farmers who died during the agitation against three agriculture laws and the withdrawal of cases against the protesters.On Tuesday, the SKM said there was no consensus yet on ending the protests as the government has now repealed the three contentious legislations.The government has sent a proposal to farmers, in which the government asked farmers to end protests and assured them that it would look into the pending demands. The government’s proposal also said that it will form a committee to look into the demand for a legal guarantee on MSP. The panel will include farmers' organisations outside the SKM, government officials and representatives of states, it stated in the proposal.However, the farmers have sought clarifications on certain points, including on the precondition set for the withdrawal of "fake" cases against farmers, their leaders said on Tuesday."We do not want other committees who have been against our demands since the start to be part of the panel on MSP. We have demanded the government give a clarification in this regard," PTI quoted farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, as saying."We are also against the condition set by the government that farm unions should lift the protest for the withdrawal of fake cases against farmers," he added.Farmers have been agitating at Delhi borders since November last year after the government enacted three legislations on agriculture. The laws have been now revoked, and the farmers have asserted that the protests will continue until the government agrees on their other demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skms-5-member-panel-to-meet-today-for-urgent-meeting-in-delhi-101638935628315.html
08-12-2021||India||Mehbooba seeks removal of AFSPA from J&K, NE areas where militancy has reduced||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday said the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) should be removed in areas in the Northeast, where militancy-related violence has reduced, and also from J&K. Speaking on Jammu and Kashmir politics, she said she was firm on her decision to not fight assembly elections herself till the Centre restored Article 370, but added that her party will contest polls so as to not cede democratic space to political adversaries in the region. “AFSPA should be removed area wise where militancy has reduced. This can be a good start in northeast states and J&K. After all we live in a democracy and you can’t keep people together by using force,” said Mufti during a media interaction in Delhi on Tuesday.Referring to the killing of at least 14 civilians in Nagaland by the Indian Army in a botched counter-insurgency operation, she tweeted on Monday, “Welcome the move to initiate action against armed forces responsible for gunning down 15 innocent civilians in Nagaland. In J&K such incidents are brushed under the carpet & families have to beg for the bodies of loved ones killed in fake encounters.”Referring to the Centre’s decision to enhance the jurisdiction of Border Security Force (BSF) along international borders in four states including Punjab and West Bengal, Mufti said, “As they can’t fight in these areas politically so they are using the forces for that.”Mufti accused the government of working with a colonial mindset. “J&K has become a laboratory. They started the testing for destroying the constitution with J&K by removing Article 370, then [through] NRC (National Register of Citizens) and CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act).”She said that unlike the present NDA government, the one led by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee believed in dialogue and it was because of him that Pakistan agreed to find a solution through discussion after Kargil. “Unfortunately, Vajpayee ji ne Balakot nahi kiya. Nahi toh shayad ek term mil jata aur Jammu and Kashmir ki samasya ka samadhan bhi ho gaya hota. (Unfortunately, Vajpayee ji didn’t order for Balakot (air strike) else he would have won a second term and resolved the Kashmir issue),” she said.Also Read: Top leaders get into campaign mode as political temperature soars in J&KWith the delimitation exercise going on in J&K, Mufti said that it is being carried out with an agenda to benefit the BJP. “In certain regions, seats are being organised in a way so that there is a division of votes…it is going to benefit them.”PDP chief said she won’t contest the elections but the party will definitely fight the assembly elections. “We want to occupy the democratic space in the state so that we will not allow them to have a free run. As far as I’m concerned, I won’t be fighting any elections till 370 and 35A are restored. I have made that very clear,” she said.Mufti, who staged a protest at Jantar Mantar on Monday, said that the situation in J&K has deteriorated and people feel suffocated. She claimed that the Central government is propagating a false narrative that the situation in the region has improved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mufti-seeks-removal-of-afspa-from-j-k-ne-areas-where-militancy-has-reduced-101638934877609.html

The meeting was significant as it was being held days after Pawar met West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee. Following that meeting, Banerjee questioned UPA's existence and said there is no UPA. She had also made an assertion to form "a strong alternative force" to oust the BJP from the Centre. "No one can do it alone. We all need a strong alternative and if someone is not ready to fight, then what can be done," she said on December 1.The comment drew major criticism from Congress, with senior leaders slamming Mamata and accusing her of "posturing for personal ambition". While the NCP is in alliance with Congress in Maharashtra, it has distanced itself from Banerjee's statements."Sharad Pawar has such a power that if he can form the government in Maharashtra by bringing Shiv Sena and Congress on one platform. Then Sharad Pawar can also bring non-BJP parties across the country on one platform and a strong Opposition to defeat BJP," Malik said on Tuesday.Speaking on whether Banerjee will be part of UPA in the future, the NCP leader said talks will be held with the Bengal leader to bring her into the UPA fold. "If Shiv Sena and Congress can sit together in Maharashtra, NCP can play a part in it, then talks can also be held with Mamata Banerjee," he also said."There will be no front except the ruling party and the Opposition," Malik said. "There is an ideological fight in the country. There is a fascist ideology, which is the ideology of the BJP," he added"NCP will try to bring together all those who want to fight against this ideology," he said.According to a PTI report by, TMC's national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee has conveyed to all its MPs that the party will not play second fiddle to anyone, including the Congress.Trinamool Congress was once part of the UPA, an alliance of several parties including Congress that remained in power at the Center for 10 years from 2004 to 2014.After the TMC's landslide victory in West Bengal Assembly polls held earlier this year, Banerjee is continuously pitching for a strong alternative at the national level, in a seeming attempt to go pan-national.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-talks-on-third-front-says-ncp-s-nawab-malik-amid-banerjee-s-upa-jibe-101638928198328.html

It has the capacity to track 50 targets in the sky at a range in excess of 100km and engage four of them simultaneously.In the next five years, all 83 of IAF’s Tejas Mark I A fighters will have this radar, as will the future twin-engine AMCA fighter developed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA).The AESA radar will be mounted on the radar cone of Su-30 MKI aircraft as well as carrier-based MiG-29 K fighters of the Indian military, according to Seshagiri. “Already, the LRDE has signed an MoU with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for being the lead integrator of the radar on the Tejas Mk I A with four identified vendors including BEL being the suppliers of key sub-systems.”The first 16 Tejas MK 1A aircraft will be fitted with Israeli ELM 2052 AESA radars and the remaining will be fitted with the indigenous Uttam AESA radar, HT has learnt. “The radar has already been tested on two Tejas fighters as well as Hawker Siddeley 800 executive jet for over 250 hours. The radar will be finally demonstrated in a flight this month with the force multiplier ready for production. Only the US, the EU, Israel, and China have AESA radar capability,” Seshagiri said.The National Flight Testing Centre, which is manned by IAF, has already greenlighted the radar after successful performance tests. Earlier, India was using primary radars on its fighters as well as indigenous airborne warning and control systems planes. The Pakistani Air Force’s retaliation for the Balakot strike in February 2019 would have turned costly for Islamabad if Indian fighters had AESA radars mounted on intercepting fighters.The AESA radar is also the key to the DRDO-developed Astra air-to-air missile, which has a range well over 120km, and will deliver guided ammunition over long distances. This radar will nullify the air superiority China had gained with its J20 multi-role fighters, as the Indian-developed AESA radar compares well with that developed by Beijing.

According to her spokesperson, she is testifying before the agency as a witness.On Sunday, the actor was briefly detained at the Mumbai airport, minutes before she was scheduled to fly abroad. Some agency officials reached the airport and disallowed the actor from travelling; Fernandez was then asked to remain in the country as she might be required to join the investigation.She was reportedly flying to Dubai. After a brief detention, the actor left the airport at around 6pm.In the past, Jaqueline had been questioned by the agency multiple times.The federal agency is investigating a ₹200 crore money laundering case against Chandrashekhar and his actor wife Leena Maria Paul. He is accused of cheating some high-profile individuals, including former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh's wife Aditi Singh.According to the charge sheet filed before the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, Chandrashekhar gave expensive gifts to Fernandez, including a Persian cat worth ₹9 lakh and a horse.Another famous Bollywood actor and dancer Nora Fatehi has also been questioned by ED in the case.As per the investigation, Chandrashekhar was lodged in the Rohini jail in Delhi, when he allegedly ran an extortion racket using phone spoofing technology. In August this year, the ED raided some of Chandrashekhar's premises and seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai, ₹82.5 lakh in cash and over a dozen luxury cars.It had claimed in a statement that Chandrashekhar is a "known conman" and is being probed by the Delhi Police in a case of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion to the tune of about ₹200 crore.The Delhi Police has also alleged that Paul and Chandrashekhar, along with others, used Hawala routes, created shell companies to park the money earned from proceeds of crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-to-question-jacqueline-fernandez-over-extortion-case-today-101638922649024.html
08-12-2021||India||Supreme Court tells Centre to decide on Rajiv Gandhi killer’s mercy plea||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday told the Centre to decide soon on the mercy petition filed by former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi murder convict AG Perarivalan and posted his petition seeking premature release on ground of delay in deciding his clemency to January.Perarivalan filed his mercy plea before the Tamil Nadu governor in December 2015 under Article 161 of the Constitution which deals with remission powers of the Governor. After a delay of over five years, the governor decided in January this year to send the matter to the President. Since then, the matter was adjourned on two occasions and came up for hearing only on Tuesday.A bench headed by justice L Nageswara Rao said, “This matter has been pending for a long time. Decide it. We will post it in January next year.”Senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan appearing for Perarivalan said the petitioner has been in jail for three decades and urged the court to bring the governor’s decision on record. “The governor is not a party to the proceedings filed by Perarivalan. However, on January 21, the governor intervened in the proceedings through solicitor general Tushar Mehta and informed that the mercy plea will be decided within a week,” he said.The governor took a decision on January 25 which was conveyed to the court that the competent authority to decide on Perarivalan’s remission was the President. Without specifying any time-frame, the Centre informed the top court that the proposal received from the governor will be processed in accordance with the law. No time frame was proposed for taking a decision.Perarivalan moved the Supreme Court in 2016 for an early decision on his pending remission plea. He was among the seven people convicted by a special TADA court for being part of the conspiracy to assassinate former PM Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991. He is currently serving life sentence for having supplied the battery used in the bomb that resulted in the death of the former prime minister.Perarivalan said in his petition that the investigating officer in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case later made a disclosure that he made a mistake by excluding the exculpatory parts of the statement given by him during the recording of his evidence where he categorically denied having any knowledge of the assassination plot while supplying the battery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-tells-centre-to-decide-on-rajiv-gandhi-killer-s-mercy-plea-101638906312962.html

In response to questions by Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member Girish Chandra and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) lawmaker Kesineni Srinivas, the government told Lok Sabha that there were no reports of manual scavengers being engaged in India at present. “Government has been able to achieve the target of abolition of manual scavenging. All identified and eligible manual scavengers have been provided assistance for their rehabilitation,” social justice minister Virendra Kumar said in a written response. As per the 2013 Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, manual scavenging referred to manually cleaning, carrying, disposing of, or handling in any manner, human excreta in an insanitary latrine, he said. A mobile application launched on December 24, 2020, to identify unsanitary latrines and manual scavengers found no such existence, the minister said. “Therefore, there is no report of practice of manual scavenging currently in the country,” he added. However, in response to another question by Congress parliamentarian B Manickam Tagore, junior social justice minister Ramdas Athawale said 321 people died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the past five years. There was no report of people dying while cleaning human excreta and the government was not considering making laws stricter, he added.“The fatal accidents in sewers and septic tanks are due to non-compliance of the prescribed safety measures and standard operating procedure,” he said in his written response. The highest number of people, 119, died in 2019, while the lowest, 19, died in 2020 – though experts attributed the latter number to the three-month lockdown and underreporting of incidents. Manual scavenging is banned in India. The caste-based practice was proscribed in 1993, but activists allege it continues clandestinely and overtly.The government distinguishes between manual scavenging – a caste-based practice of people cleaning human excreta by hand – and the practice of cleaning sewers and septic tanks, though experts point out that the latter is a mere extension of the now-banned practice.In response to another question by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member Jagdambika Pal, Athawale said implementation of the 2013 law was being monitored at the district, state and national levels. “No such casualties have been reported due to manual scavenging,” the junior minister said.

Police said another case has been registered against 250 BJP activists for organising another rally in Thalassery on Friday, violating the prohibitory orders.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had criticised the RSS and the BJP for raising the slogans targeting a minority community.“What is their agenda by raising such slogans? They very well know that their agenda will not work in Kerala. But they want to spread such propaganda into the minds of people,” Vijayan had said while addressing a function organised by the CPI(M) on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-bjp-men-held-in-kerala-for-provocative-slogans-101638904274951.html

Though the department did not name the store, earlier I-T officials had told HT that their officials on December 1 were raiding Saravana Selvarathinam which has six stores across Tamil Nadu. The department said their searches and seizures of incriminating evidence revealed that the group “systematically” suppressed sales by “manipulating their books of accounts,” the tax department said in a statement. “The extent of suppression of sales is found to be more than ₹1,000 crore over a period of several years,” the statement read. “It was also found that the assessee had made unaccounted cash purchases of about ₹150 crore in textile division and jewellery division, during the past few years.” More than 100 of the I-T officials had conducted searches at more than 30 premises in the districts of Chennai, Tirunelveli, Madurai and Coimbatore on December 1. The search operations included eight places in Chennai. The retail chain of stores primarily cater to the lower and middle income group. According to their website their showrooms sell textiles, jewellery, vessels, home appliances, water, sweets and a host of other products, at affordable prices. It is a major shopping hub in Chennai with four out of the six stores present in the city such as in T Nagar and Purasawalkam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/popular-store-chain-in-tamil-nadu-under-reported-1-000-crore-sales-it-101638904273433.html

The heritage structure, Tipu Khan Sarai, popularly known as Nampally Sarai, located right in front of Nampally railway station closer to the state assembly building, is now being converted into a transit dorm, exclusively for women travellers coming to city from various parts of the state. A senior official of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) familiar with the development said Nampally Sarai, which was completely in a dilapidated condition, would be demolished. “The GHMC, in coordination with the Hyderabad police department, has proposed to construct of a five-storeyed 400-room rest house for women under the Safe City project sanctioned by the Central government,” he said. The plan is expected to be finalized at the GHMC standing council meeting to be held on December 18. Hyderabad was among the eight cities in the country chosen by the Centre in 2018 for taking up various initiatives for the safety and security of women in public places, the other cities being Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai. An amount of ₹282 crore had been sanctioned for the construction of two transit dorms in the city, one at Nampally Sarai and other at Secunderabad, to provide women travellers a safe place to stay when in Hyderabad, the official said. Heritage conservationists, however, are crying foul over the proposed demolition of Nampally Sarai, which was given the heritage structure status in 2012. “It is very unfortunate that such a wonderful structure, is being razed after being neglected for decades by the successive governments. The present Telangana government, too, is showing more interest in demolishing the heritage structures rather than preserving the same,” said Hyderabad heritage activist Sajjad Shahid. Convenor of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) Hyderabad chapter Anuradha Reddy said before taking up any such demolition of the heritage structure, the authorities have to consult the INTACH. “But the government has not taken any suggestions from us,” she said. She said there had been no maintenance of the building and nobody cared when a part of the building collapsed due to heavy rains in October 2019. In fact, the building was handed over to the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited authorities for construction of an overhead station, linking it with Nampally railway station, but later, the proposal was dropped due to protests. Built in a sprawling area of more than an acre of land in 1910 by Nawab Tipu Khan, a high ranking official working for Mir Mahabub Ali Khan, the sixth Nizam, the Nampally Sarai, originally called Sulah Sarai (a peaceful resting place) was used as a rest house for travellers to Hyderabad. “It was providing free stay and sumptuous food for all the guests for three days. It used to cater to people of all walks of life, irrespective of caste or creed. Even those travelling to Haj, Nampalli Sarai used to provide accommodation,” Anuradha Reddy said. In 1948, after the Nizams merged Hyderabad with Indian Union, the Nampally Sarai was used as a state guest house by the Andhra Pradesh government. But subsequently, it was abandoned and since then, has been in a state of neglect, she said. Principal secretary (urban development) Arvind Kumar, who has been showing keen interest in restoring the heritage structures in the city, could not be reached for a comment.

She had secured 1,063 marks in the higher secondary public examination conducted in March 2014 and applied for MBBS/BDS course. She was selected and offered admission in BDS and allotted to the KSR Dental College in Tiruchengodu. The order of allotment was issued by the Selection Committee at 4 PM on September 30, 2014. On account of the late issuance of admission card, the petitioner was unable to reach the college the same, which happened to be the last date for admission.However, the next morning she, along with her grandfather, reported to the institution but instead of verifying the certificates and admitting her in the course, the college Administrative Officer refused admission. The petitioner showed the allotment order issued by the Selection Committee and in spite of that, they refused to admit her. Thus, the petitioner is constrained to move the present writ petition for a direction to the college and other authorities to admit her in BDS Course.The judge noted the result of the Selection Committee was communicated to the dental college through fax message. However, the college denied admission to the petitioner on the very next day. In such circumstances, when the college failed to act upon the allotment order issued by the Selection Committee, the selection panel ought to have initiated action against it by making a complaint to the competent authority. However, no such action was taken against the college knowingly and therefore, this Court would be able to form an opinion that all the three respondents -- health secretary, selection committee and the college -- have jointly contributed for the denial of right of admission to the petitioner to undergo BDS course.A perusal of the records reveals the Selection Committee itself has conducted the counselling on the very last day i.e., on September 30 and issued an allotment order at 4 p.m. Thus, the petitioner reported on October 1 at 9 AM. Therefore, the petitioner has not committed any fault or delay in reporting before the college. It was the mistake committed by the Selection Committee in not conducting the counselling in advance or providing information to the college on the same day to admit the petitioner. It ought to have informed the college not to admit any other students on September 30 in view of the fact that an allotment order was issued in favour of the petitioner, the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-awards-5-lakhto-bds-aspirant-over-denial-of-admission-in-tamil-nadu-101638904212783.html

The results of the remaining two tests are awaited.“It is a great relief for us. But time is not ripe to lower our guard. We have to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. We have to maintain high vigil,” she said. On Tuesday, one more person, who arrived from a European country, tested positive for Covid-19 and was rushed to a hospital in Kozhikode. His sample has been sent for genome sequencing in the state capital, a health ministry official said. Two samples each from Kozhikode, Malappuram, Ernakulam, and one each from Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthitta districts tested negative. All samples were tested at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the state capital, George said in a statement. Kerala has been reporting the maximum number of Covid cases in the country, and only behind Maharashtra in Covid-related death rate. Last week, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan sent a letter to the state health department, insisting it to increase testing and streamline containment measures.In the last two months, at least 5000 backlog cases of unreported deaths between March 2020 and June 2021 were added to the fatality list. Many public health experts and opposition parties alleged that the government was not transparent with its data, but the latter said technical reasons led to the omission. A total of 17,000 applications are pending in various state departments to covert deaths as Covid deaths, said a senior health official.On Tuesday, the state reported 4,656 cases after 67,437 cases. It also reported 28 deaths, but 106 backlog deaths were added as per the new directive of the Union government, said the state health ministry. Active caseload is 40,072.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-8-covid-samples-test-negative-for-omicron-101638904154406.html

All of them were dressed in black.“This is an anti-farmer government, insensitive to the demands of the farmers,” said Keshav Rao, TRS leader in the Upper House. “Today, piles of grains are rotting on the roads in Telangana for the simple reason that the FCI (Food Corporation of India) is not lifting (buying) the produce.”No elected representative likes to boycott Parliament, but the TRS is being forced to do so by the Centre, he said.“Please be clear that we are against this government. We are an opposition party, not a fence sitter, and we want this BJP-led government to go,” Rao said while interacting with reporters after announcing that the party will boycott the remainder of the winter session.The ruling party in Telangana has nine Lok Sabha MPs and seven Rajya Sabha members.

08-12-2021||India||Andhra police destroys cannabis worth ₹4,000 crore in special operation||A special drive launched by Andhra Pradesh police in the name of “Operation Parivarthan” on cultivation and smuggling of ganja (cannabis) in forest areas of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram bordering Odisha has been yielding good results, officers said. According to Vineet Brijlal, commissioner of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) of the state police, a huge quantity of cannabis, being grown in 6,416.10 acres, was destroyed in a span of 36 days. “The total value of the narcotic substance, as per the present market value, is estimated to be around ₹4,000 crore. This is quite a major achievement,” the official said. The Operation Parivarthan was launched on October 30, after a series of reports of smuggling of ganja from the Visakhapatnam forest areas into the neighbouring Telangana and Chhattisgarh, rocked the state. These areas abutting Odisha had been known for large scale ganja cultivation – according to official estimates, the narcotic weed is cultivated in more than 10,000 acres, spreading across 250 tribal villages. At a high-level meeting held in Visakhapatnam in October to take stock of the situation in cannabis cultivation and smuggling, Director General of Police Gautam Sawang expressed suspicion that the tribals in the forest areas were cultivating ganja had the support of the Maoists. “It has become a main source of revenue for the banned extremist outfit. The Maoists are collecting money from the ganja smugglers to sustain their activity,” Sawang told the reporters after the meeting. Following the meeting, the SEB has launched the Operation Parivarthan. “We carried a series of raids on the villages in the forest areas of Viskahapatnam, where this cannabis is grown and destroyed the crop,” Brijlal said. The police took the help of drone technology and satellite mapping to identify the ganja plantations, apart from the field reports from enforcement and intelligence wings. Special Enforcement Bureau commissioner Vineet Brijlal said the Operation Parivarthan had three main goals: destruction of ganja crops, creating awareness among the tribals on narcotics and crackdown on smugglers and drug peddlers. “Around 300 teams of 50 personnel each apart from security personnel have been deployed. In its drive against smugglers and peddlers, in the last one month, the police and SEB have booked 214 cases and detained 546 people in Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) cases. More than 100 vehicles have been seized for being involved in smuggling of drugs,” Brijlal said. The police have also been posting videos of the operation on social media so as to bring awareness among the people. “We shall not stop until every ganja crop is destroyed in the forest region,” the commissioner said. The SEB authorities are also finding ways to provide alternative livelihood for the tribal people hitherto involved in ganja cultivation. “We are persuading them to given up the illegal cultivation and trade by educating them and counselling them periodically. It has had huge impact on them, as they have voluntarily started destruction of ganja crops,” he said. Activist M Malini of Chaitanya Sravanthi, working in the tribal areas of Viskahapatnam, said the ganja cultivation in these areas was much more than what police were saying. “The cultivation has been going on rampantly in the interior tribal areas, which the police authorities do not venture into. The smugglers lure the tribal youth with money and vehicles and involve them in transportation of ganja. Unfortunately, the youth are also habituated to consumption of narcotics. We are contemplating counselling sessions to change them,” Malini said.

The court ordered video recording of the procedure after a plea was moved by his mother, stating that her 21-year-old son was tortured in police custody. Police have refuted the allegations and released CCTV footage from the station which shows that he was standing and was questioned by an officer who is also standing but there was no physical interaction. The student from Tamil Nadu’s Ramanathapuram district was stopped on his two-wheeler by police on Saturday during a routine vehicle check along the Paramakudi-Keezhathooval road. He was being questioned at the Keezhathooval police station and he was released a few hours later, police said. He was then found lying unconscious in his home in the wee hours of Sunday and he was rushed to the Mudukulathur General Hospital where he was declared brought dead. The family refused to accept his body on Monday claiming that it was a case of custodial torture and demanded action against the Keezhathooval inspector and other officials. Ramanathapuram district police, in a statement, said they stopped him because his number plate was different and that he didn’t cooperate during the vehicle check so they had to chase him. While questioning they had not found him guilty of any crime and the station informed his mother to pick him up and warned that his activities seemed suspicious. Police said CCTV footage shows Manikandan leaving with his family from the police station at 8pm on Saturday. “Police did not assault him. It was a casual inquiry,” said Ramanathapuram district’s superintendent of police, E Karthik. “Between the place of his arrest and the station it is barely a kilometre. He was taken on his bike in front of the public. What happened in both these places is clear. He died in his home. Between the time after he was let off from the station and the time of his death, six hours had passed. What happened in those six hours is a question we have to ask.” The official said the interim report of the post-mortem that was released on Tuesday says that there have been no internal injuries and no lacerations on his body. The final report will take a week’s time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-orders-tamil-nadu-student-s-re-postmortem-as-kin-allege-custodial-torture-101638904032919.html
08-12-2021||India||Sasikala, Rajinikanth meet in Tamil Nadu raises eyebrows||Expelled AIADMK leader VK Sasikala, who identifies herself as the general secretary with an aim to reclaim the party, has met Tamil superstar Rajinikanth at his residence, raising eyebrows in the state’s political circle.A statement from Sasikala’s office, which also released pictures on Tuesday, described it as a courtesy call. “She met Rajinikanth to congratulate him on winning the Dadasaheb Palke award and to enquire about his health,” the statement said. The meeting took place on Monday evening and pictures released show Rajinikanth’s wife Latha also in conversation with Sasikala. Both Sasikala and Rajinikanth are non-starters in Tamil Nadu’s political arena for widely different reasons. They have also been erstwhile neighbours in Chennai’s plush Poes Garden where Rajinikanth resides and late former chief minister J Jayalalithaa lived in her bungalow named ‘Veda Nilayam’, a property which is now mired in legalities. Sasikala, lived here with Jayalalithaa for at least three decades. 70-year-old Rajinkanth received the Dadasaheb Palke award from Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu at the 67th National Film Awards held in New Delhi in October and a week later he underwent a carotoid revascularisation procedure. The actor with a cult following across the globe announced his entry into politics in December 2017 and launched the Rajini Makkal Mandram. But after several fits and starts, in December 2020, Rajinikanth backtracked citing health reasons and the Covid-19 pandemic. Rajinikanth’s role was expected to shake up the state’s politics and he was being courted by the BJP which is trying to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu where the electorate has only favoured either the DMK or the AIADMK since 1967 when the Congress lost power. But the actor has now gone back to focussing on films with his latest Diwali release ‘Annathe’ which was produced by DMK’s late patriarch leader M Karunanidhi’s grand-nephew Kalanidhi Maran’s Sun Pictures. Meanwhile, Sasikala has been making all efforts for a political comeback but in vain as the AIADMK’s current dual leadership of Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam -- both her loyalists turned foes -- expelled her in 2017 and have refused to let her and her family members back in. Following Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016, the AIADMK unanimously declared Sasikala as the interim general secretary and she was set to take over as chief minister when the Supreme Court convicted her to a four-year jail term in Bengaluru in February 2017 in the disproportionate assets case. The party changed vastly while she was imprisoned and since her release in February this year, Sasikala has tried to make a comeback. With a lukewarm response she announced that she was stepping away from politics ahead of the assembly elections held this April. With AIADMK’s loss, Sasikala re-started her political ambitions by speaking to cadre of the AIADMK and the breakaway faction AMMK-led by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. Sasikala is now driving everywhere with the AIADMK flag on her car bonner, releasing statements on all issues as AIADMK’s general secretary and meeting people. To prevent her from finding a way into the AIADMK, the party last week amended its bylaws to re-elect Panneerselvam and Palaniswami as coordinator and joint coordinators -- the tops posts of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-rajinikanth-meet-in-tamil-nadu-raises-eyebrows-101638903973078.html
08-12-2021||India||AAP meets Karnataka governor seeking probe into ‘commission’ scandal||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday met Karnataka Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot, seeking a probe into the alleged “commission” scandal that has engulfed the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state recently. AAP demanded a judicial probe into the allegations levelled by the Karnataka State Contractors Association against the overt demand for commissions, ranging from 25%-35%, by elected representatives and officials for awarding tenders. D Kempanna, President of Karnataka State Contractors’ Association, in a letter to the Prime Minister written on July 6, 2021, had fully exposed the corruption and illegalities involved in the Tender Works. He had revealed the percentage details of illegalities in Government departments such as the Public Works Department, Minor Irrigation and Water Resources Department, Major Irrigation Department, Panchayat Raj Department, Health Department, BBMP etc. This is a serious allegation, hence it is necessary to conduct a proper investigation on it and punish the guilty,” Prithvi Reddy, the state convener of AAP said. The statements come even as Congress and other political oppositions have used the alleged scandal to corner Bommai who appears to be buried in one crisis after another. Several senior BJP leaders and ministers in the Bommai government are also accused of being involved in the Bitcoin scandal in which a serial hacker (Srikrishna or Sriki) was allegedly used to launder ill-gotten money using the cryptocurrency. The letter by the Contractors association added to the charges against the four-month-old Bommai government and his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa. “Regarding the illegalities, we had made an appeal to the Chief Minister demanding a probe under the leadership of a High Court judge. But the Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had ordered the Chief Secretary to the Government to investigate tenders of only the last three months’ period. It’s inappropriate to investigate only three months’ Tenders of their tenure even though the illegalities have been going on for many previous years. Besides that, we also object to the probe under the Chief Secretary to the Government as there are allegations of Government officers and MLAs being involved in the corruption”, Reddy said. He added that corruption in tender works is hampering the development works of the state and it is unfair to the taxpayers. The party also demanded that tenders from the previous decade be scrutinized. The letter, the association stated, was to highlight the “miserable plight” of working contractors in the state as well as remedial measures to be taken. “The contractor’s face (an) unhealthy atmosphere and is discouraged to taking up the works of Roads & Buildings. They are facing an untoward and ugly situation in getting the tender works in various department like Public Works Department, Minor & Major Irrigation, Panchayat Raj Engineering, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Health Departments, etc,” In the letter, they allege that the concerned minister “insist and harass’ payment of 5% on the amount put to tender before approval while few elected representatives demand 3% before starting of works. In district and taluks, the association said, there are demands to the extent of 5% on buildings and 10% on road works. “The injustice in tender conditions through e-procurement portal in various local contractor’s by departments is injurious to the registered local contractors,” they add. “Thus, the local registered contractor’s of our state have (to) pay to the extent of 25% to 30% (for elected representatives & others) of the tender amount before starting the works. Such being the position how (will) the contractor undertakes good work,” the letter adds. Bommai had earlier said that though the association had not mentioned any specifics, he had ordered a probe by senior officials to look into any irregularities under the present government as well as works awarded during the Congress rule between 2013-18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-meets-karnataka-governor-seeking-probe-into-commission-scandal-101638903852965.html
08-12-2021||India||Nine students test Covid positive in Mangaluru, quarantined at hostel||A college in Mangaluru was declared a containment zone on Tuesday after nine students of a college tested positive for Covid-19, forming a fresh cluster in Karnataka, the state health department said in a statement on Tuesday. A total of 173 samples were tested in the college, the statement added.“We have sent samples for genomic sequencing to detect the variant. We have effectively isolated the hostel. Those students who have tested positive for novel coronavirus have been quarantined at the hostel. All those who are infected are aged above 18,” said Rajendra KV, deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada district. In Chikkamagaluru district, a total of 457 samples have been tested of both students and staff members at the Jawahar Navodaya School in Seegodu, and the infection tally now stands at 103, including 90students, health officials said. Similar clusters were reported in educational institutions in Dharwad, Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Hassan and Mysuru districts, health department officials said. There has been a consistent uptick of Covid-19 clusters in the southern state, which led the state government to issue guidelines to combat the situation. According to the new norms, any area reporting three Covid-19 cases will be declared a cluster, as opposed to the earlier 10. Furthermore, both doses of Covid-19 vaccine shots have been made mandatory for people to visit apartment complexes. If one has been marked a cluster, no one will be permitted to enter the building, the health department said in a statement. Meanwhile, the government has initiated action to establish a genome sequencing lab in the state. The health secretary Anil Kumar has been instructed to look into the needs of procuring the necessary equipment and experts for the purpose, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said while speaking to media persons at his residence in Hubli on Tuesday. “All the districts have Covid testing labs. Genome sequencing needs expert systems and modern equipment. The spread of the new variant, Omicron, has necessitated sending test samples in suspect cases for Omicron, to Genome Sequence testing in NCBS. Arrangements would be made to get the test reports quickly,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-students-test-covid-positive-in-mangaluru-quarantined-at-hostel-101638903795712.html

Students spent the entire night protesting against the varsity’s decision to hold offline exams. The protests began in the main campus of KSLU in the Hubballi district, about 450 kms from Bengaluru.“First thing is the delay in the promotion. We want a 50:50 mode of evaluation,” Varun Gowda, a student who is part of the protests, told Hindustan Times.He added that the university is trying to hold offline examinations for the previous semesters despite promoting the students and the results of previous semesters have been delayed, and officials continue to cite a shortage of human resources for the same.“A student of the final year will have one or two backlogs, so if they keep postponing exams like this, delaying it for one or two months, it will be a problem for them to enter the Bar council or take up masters,” Gowda said.The protests come even as the threat of Covid pandemic resurfaces in the southern state with the detection of at least two cases of the new variant, Omicron. Students said that the university is hiring senior lawyers and has been misleading the court, whose orders it repeatedly cites to conduct the exams. Hiring senior lawyers for what?Gowda said that there should be at least 21 days prior notice for exams, but there is uncertainty on the dates as there are students who have to travel from other parts and make arrangements.Ishwar Bhat, the vice-chancellor could not be reached for comment despite calls and texts seeking a statement from the university.The Law School of Karnataka State Law University was established as a constituent college through a statute in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-varsity-students-stage-protest-against-offline-examinations-in-karnataka-101638903794265.html

The former chief minister and senior BJP leader BS Yediyurappa has maintained that he has sought support from the JD(S) for the MLC polls.“We have to see what decision JD(S) takes, but they are likely to give us support,” Yediyurappa said on Tuesday, counting on the backing of the regional outfit to help keep the upper house of the state legislature under its control.The JD(S) is the only major political party in Karnataka that has allied with both the BJP and the Congress at the state level.JD(S) and the BJP consider Congress as the common enemy. The JD(S) has received the backing of BJP in the old Mysuru region in past elections while the reverse has been seen in the northern districts where the regional outfit has used its votes to help the saffron party. (This para needs attribution and facts when JDS got support and since when do they consider Congress the enemy)“This is not a question of Congress winning or the BJP. Wherever we (JD(S))are not contesting, our leaders have to cast their ballot and not casting it is wrong under democracy. So whichever side they vote for, it should not be detrimental to us,” Kumaraswamy said.The Congress has chided the JD(S) for its decision calling it an understanding between the regional outfit and the BJP.“What does that statement mean that he (Kumaraswamy) has told local leaders? Does it mean they will come with us? They have decided to go with the BJP. They are only saying it indirectly,” Siddaramaiah, senior Congress leader and the former chief minister said in Mandya on Tuesday.State Congress president DK Shivakumar on Tuesday said that Yediyurappa seeking out support shows that the BJP is weak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-free-to-pick-alliance-in-mlc-polls-jd-s-leader-kumaraswamy-101638903792986.html
08-12-2021||India||Rahul seeks compensation, jobs for kin of farmers who died during agitation||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday demanded compensation and employment for the kin of farmers who died during the course of their year-long agitation against the now-repealed three agricultural laws. He also moved an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on the issue.His demand came on the same day the government and farm groups seemed to be nearing a deal to end year-long protests. The government has indicated that the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are amenable to paying compensation to the kin of farmers who died during the protest. Punjab already provides compensation.Gandhi, the Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad in Kerala, presented before the House a list of 400 farmers from Punjab and 70 from neighbouring Haryana, who, he claimed, died during the protests on various farm issues.“The entire country knows that nearly 700 farmers lost their lives during the farm protests. The prime minister apologised to farmers, and he accepted he committed a mistake,” Gandhi told the House.The former Congress presidento referred to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s written reply in Parliament on November 30 that the central government had no record of farmers who died during the protests and therefore there was no question of compensation.“On November 30, the agriculture minister was asked how many farmers were martyred during the protests and the agriculture minister said he had no data on this. We found out that the Punjab government has given ₹5 lakh compensation each to (kin of) about 400 farmers and jobs to (kin of) 152 farmers,” he said.“I have the list which I am laying in the House. We have another list of 70 farmers who are from Haryana, I am laying this list too in the House,” the Congress leader said.In a question to the agriculture minister, Gandhi also sought to know whether the government had assessed the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on agriculture. The minister, in a written reply, said that during the lockdown, the farm sector functioned smoothly as it was exempted from any restrictions.Gandhi also asked whether average debt of agricultural households had increased during the pandemic.In his reply, the agriculture minister said during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Union government extended the date of renewal of short-term farm loans that had become due between March and August 2020 as a relief measure. A similar extension was made in 2021 during the second wave, the agriculture minister stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-seeks-compensation-jobs-for-kin-of-farmers-who-died-during-year-long-protests-101638903734269.html
08-12-2021||India||December first week logs 27.45% rise in Covid cases across Karnataka||Karnataka has witnessed a rise of 27.45% in the seven-day moving average of new Covid-19 cases in the first week of December, according to the state government data. The data released by the department of health and family welfare shows that in the first week of November, the moving average of daily cases was 231, which rose to 390 in the first week of December. A moving average takes the number of Covid-19 cases in seven days and takes the average of those days. “After falling for six straight months, Covid numbers are seeing an uptick over the last two weeks in Karnataka. Caution is the word! Mask up Karnataka,” tweeted Karnataka tweeted Sudhakar on Monday night. The Covid-19 bulletins released by the Karnataka government shows that on the last Monday of November (November 29), Karnataka had 6,878 active cases. Seven days later, on December 6, the number increased to 7,067 as of Monday (December 6). The increase in cases came after Karnataka reported two cases of Omicron variant of the virus in the last week of November. However, senior health department officials attributed the increase to the number of clusters reported in Karnataka in the past week. “The number of clusters reported in Karnataka , especially in educational institutes, are a matter of concern. We are following the situation closely and all DCs (Deputy Commissioners). These clusters have been reported only in residential schools,” said Karnataka education minister BC Nagesh. All these cases were of Delta variant of the virus, according to the data.The new cases detected in districts other than Bengaluru Urban are also on the rise. While 77 per cent of the active caseload on November 29 was from Bengaluru Urban, the same dipped to 73 per cent on Monday. The highest number of cluster cases have been reported from Bengaluru Urban, BBMP?, Hassan, Dharwad, Mysuru, and Tumakuru districts. A total of 40 clusters were reported in the last month, accounting for over 800 cases. According to data from the health department, over 20,500 samples from the 40 clusters reported till December 5 have been tested. The Union health ministry has identified Tumakuru, Dharwad, Bengaluru Urban, and Mysuru as districts of concern and directed the state to contain the spread on a war-footing. As per a letter sent by health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Tumakuru district witnessed a rise of 152.17% in the number of new cases between November 19 and December 2, followed by Dharwad (20.92%), Bengaluru Urban (19.16%), and Mysuru (16.49%). Further, the Centre has advised the state to implement the “ongoing strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate-Covid appropriate behaviour to keep the situation under control.” According to data collated from the airport by the government, as many as 4,225 passengers (including children) landed at the airport from December 1-6 in 17 flights from at-risk countries. While 4,021 of them were subjected to Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT), 309 samples were collected for RT-PCR testing, with all results returning negative. 9,889 passengers arrived from other countries during the same timeframe after which tests on arrival indicated all were negative for Covid-19. Earlier, as per guidelines issued by the Centre, the Karnataka government had made testing on arrival mandatory for all passengers arriving from at-risk countries, with 2 per cent random testing stipulated for those arriving from other countries. Meanwhile, the 46-year-old Bengaluru doctor, who was among the first cases of Omicron in India, has again tested positive for Covid, a senior official said on Tuesday. The RT-PCR test was conducted seven days after his last test, as per the mandate issued by the health ministry. According to officials, he will be kept under observation for another seven days and be discharged only after a negative RT-PCR test.

On Monday last week, they were suspended for the remainder of the winter session after the House passed a motion moved by the government seeking their suspension under Rule 256 for their “unruly and violent behaviour” in the Upper House during the monsoon session.A senior Congress strategist met CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Tuesday to discuss the Opposition’s future course of action in the Rajya Sabha, according a person aware of the matter.The Trinamool Congress’s national general secretary and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee held a meeting with his party MPs and told them: “Our two MPs have been suspended but all of us are affected. Every day till December 23, all our MPs will join them at the protest site.”According to a leader of the party, when a senior TMC MP told Banerjee he didn’t get a chance to speak in the House, he said “there is no grey area in protest and the party’s interest has to come first”. Banerjee was clear that the protest must continue, the leader added.Amid consultations within the Opposition on the protest, Congress president Sonia Gandhi will address the Congress parliamentary party meeting in the Central Hall of Parliament at 9.30am on Wednesday. It will be attended by Rahul Gandhi and other members of the party.In the Upper House, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the government doesn’t want to pass bills amid a din. “I still request through you, let them be ready to apologise. The whole country has seen it. They were dancing on the table, they went to hit the marshal and tried to throw away the TV screen,” he said, referring to the incidents of the last day of the monsoon session earlier this year.On the last day of the monsoon session on August 11, some opposition MPs climbed on Rajya Sabha officials’ table, raised slogans, and threw files when the House began a discussion on the farmers’ protest against three laws that now stand scrapped. Opposition parties termed the suspension as “undemocratic”.Earlier in the day, Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge reiterated that the government was “responsible for the obstructions” in the Upper House, arguing that the suspension of the 12 Opposition MPs was “wrong”.“We tried a lot to facilitate the functioning of the House, we met Leader of the House and Chairman repeatedly to put forth our views that MPs can be suspended only as per Rule 256,” Kharge said, ruling out any apology as the government “ignored the rules and wrongfully brought the events of the monsoon session to winter session” to suspend 12 MPs.The Leader of Opposition added that “we also wanted to raise a number of things such as inflation, the issue of Nagaland”. “So, it seems that the government does not intend to run the House, they do not intend to discuss. And those who are vocal people, if we run the House by keeping them out, then our people will raise questions.”The Opposition alleged that the government had the Rajya Sabha adjourned early in the day to stop Nagaland MP KG Kenye from speaking on the killing of 14 civilians by the Indian Army in the state.Abhishek Banerjee and Yechury also said an apology was “out of the question”. Apparently referring to the Congress, TMC leader Derek O’Brien said: “We would have full coordination with all parties. But we are not going to play second fiddle to anyone.”
08-12-2021||India||Act against encroachments: SC to Railways||The Supreme Court on Tuesday came down heavily on the Railways for not acting against encroachers and directed the Centre to chalk out a solution to deal with the problem by next week.The court was hearing separate pleas on issues related to removal of encroachment from Railways land in Gujarat and Haryana, when it observed that public projects were getting delayed in such matters.“When the Railways Act was enacted, it was unthinkable that railway land could be encroached. But of late, it appears that your (Railway) estate officers are not taking care. You have a Railway Protection Force (RPF)... close it down as they cannot protect your land. Their functioning itself is under question. If this is happening across the country, there is no need to have a Railway Protection Force,” a bench of justice AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar said.Encroachment on railway land is a crime under Section 147 of the Railways Act.Noting that encroachment delayed public projects, the bench said that authorities may have “political compulsions” but it is the taxpayers’ money which goes “down the drain”.“You may have political compulsions but it is taxpayers’ money that goes down the drain. You take a position that no unauthorized presence on your land will be tolerated. We cannot have a situation where public projects are kept on hold for over five years and the effect is that due to delay, cost of the project gets escalated. Ultimately it affects the state exchequer,” the court said.The bench also said that the municipal corporation, the states as well as the Railways are “not seeing eye to eye” in these cases and since these are “matters of public interest, the project has to go forward”.Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta assured to take up the matter with the railway minister. “It is not in anybody’s interest that public projects be delayed. We will sort it out and come with a joint solution,” he told the court.“Whatever is necessary, you do on war footing. In 15 days the project must begin,” the bench said, as it gave the Centre time till December 14 to decide on the solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/act-against-encroachments-sc-to-railways-101638903374471.html
08-12-2021||India||'Regularly attend House proceedings or face consequences': Modi cautions BJP MPs||Parliamentarians of the Bharatiya Janata Party must regularly attend House proceedings or face the consequences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned colleagues at the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday.“Apne aap mein parivartan laiye, warna parivartan apne aap aajata hai (change yourselves, or changes will happen on their own),” the Prime Minister said, according to several lawmakers present at the meeting.Modi’s statement is seen as a warning to the party’s MPs that their performance in Parliament would be a determinant while deciding tickets ahead of the next election.The Prime Minister is learnt to have expressed concern over the attendance of lawmakers and underscored that people had elected MPs to represent them in Parliament and, therefore, their first priority should be attending the proceedings.“The Prime Minister reiterated the necessity to adhere to party discipline – be punctual, come prepared and not speak out of turn,” a party functionary said on condition of anonymity.The government has been facing a combative opposition in both Houses of Parliament. Opposition parties have closed ranks over the suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha MPs for the duration of the winter session and have sought to pin the treasury benches on a host of issues, including price rise and the killing of civilians in Nagaland by security forces.This is not the first time that Modi has pulled up his party colleagues for being absent during the proceedings in Parliament. It was also underlined during the monsoon session in August.He had then asked Prahlad Joshi, the parliamentary affairs minister, to prepare a list of absent MPs as the party in Rajya Sabha faced embarrassment when it had to struggle to ensure their presence during the passage of the Tribunal Amendment Bill.Modi also instructed the MPs to focus on health and wellness at the Tuesday meeting, urging them to co-opt people to join the Poshan Abhiyan, a campaign against malnutrition, and organise sports events and competitions to drive home the message of fitness.He urged party MPs to organise programmes to felicitate the Padma award winners. “The Prime Minister instructed the MPs to hold Sansad Khel Sparda and Sansad Tandurust Bal Sparda (sports competitions) to encourage the youth to take up sports,” Joshi said.BJP MPs must meet the presidents of all mandals and districts in their respective constituencies to keep “live contact” with party workers, the party’s national president J P Nadda said. Supporting his suggestion, Modi is learnt to have said that he will meet the zila and mandal presidents when he visits his parliamentary constituency Varanasi on December 14.Nadda also said that the party should host farmers’ conferences (kisan sammelan) and felicitate those who have improvied farming practices.The meeting, in Ambedkar International Centre outside the precincts of Parliament for the first time, was attended by senior ministers, including home minister Amit Shah, commerce minister Piyush Goyal, foreign minister S Jaishankar and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.
08-12-2021||India||New controversy raises old legal questions around AFSPA||The killings of 14 civilians by defence forces in a botched operation in Nagaland’s Mon district on Saturday and Sunday has drawn focus, once again, on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) and the immunity from criminal prosecution that the special law entails. The incident has renewed an old demand for the repeal of the law, and the sweeping powers and protections it offers.It is pertinent, therefore, to get a conspectus of the legislation.Origin, ambit and special features of AFSPA:On August 15, 1942, the British administration enacted the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Ordinance to suppress the Quit India Movement launched by Mahatama Gandhi a week earlier. The ordinance enlisted the armed forces “in the aid of civil power” to put down the Indian independence movement during the Second World War.Modelled on the colonial-era ordinance, AFSPA was promulgated in Parliament in September 1958. Simply put, the legislation allows armed forces to control and maintain public order in areas designated as “disturbed”.Also Read| ‘I am broken inside’: Grief sweeps Nagaland village of 14 killedAccording to Section 3 of the Act, an entire state or a part of the state area can be designated as “disturbed” by the governor of the state, the administrator of a Union Territory, or the Centre if they are of the opinion that the “whole or any part of such state or Union territory” is in “such a disturbed or dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary”.Section 4 of AFSPA accords special powers to armed forces, authorising security personnel to open fire, arrest people without warrants, enter and search without warrant -- all while having immunity from being prosecuted. Section 6 of the Act lays down that no prosecution, suit or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against any person in respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by AFSPA in absence of a previous sanction of the central government.“Armed forces” has been defined under AFSPA as military forces and the air forces operating as land forces, and includes all other central armed forces deployed in a state or UT.Currently, the Act is in force in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur – excluding Imphal Municipal Council Area – Changlang, Longding and Tirap districts of Arunachal Pradesh, and areas falling under the jurisdiction of eight police stations of districts in Arunachal Pradesh bordering Assam. A similar Act – Armed Forces (Jammu & Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990 – is operational in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir.Parliamentary history of AFSPA:AFSPA was first enforced in the North-East as a measure to battle the Naga insurgency in the then undivided state of Assam.The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha without any amendment but there was severe criticism of the proposed law by several leaders. MP Surendra Mohanty of Ganatantra Parishad raised the point that the bill invoked a state of emergency while suspending the constitutional rights to approach courts or file suits. “We want a free India. But we do not want a free India with barbed wires and concentration camps, where havaldars can shoot at sight any man. If that is the concept of free India, I think I may as well be a traitor,” he told the House.A Krishnaswami also made the argument that AFSPA was outside the powers granted in the Constitution since it was declaring a state of emergency without following the Constitutional provisions for such a declaration. He argued that this Bill would take away the State’s power by bringing in the military.A discussion on the proposed law ensued in Rajya Sabha in the last week of August 1958. Then Union home minister Govind Ballabh Pant called the proposed law “a very simple measure” to control the “misguided Nagas indulging in mischievous activities”. Pant pointed out that the law was needed since it was not feasible to depute civil magistrates to accompany the armed forces over such a vast area wherever there may be trouble, because it happens unexpectedly.Also Read| Nagaland cabinet to recommend immediate repeal of AFSPA after 14 die in botched opPrime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru defended the proposed law, stressing: “No infirm government can function anywhere. Where there is violence, it has to be dealt with by government, whatever the reason for it may be; because otherwise you drift; the country drifts into, if I may use the word, Fascist methods, all groups, private groups and others, indulging in violence and trying to coerce the governmental authority by organised violence.”The Bill was passed, and AFSPA has not been lifted in Nagaland since. After the North-East states were reorganized in 1971, the creation of new states (some of them were Union territories originally) such as Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh paved the way for the AFSPA Act to be amended, so that it could be applied to each of them.AFSPA was imposed in Punjab and Chandigarh in 1983 due to secessionist movements in the state and lasted for 14 years. The similar legislation in Jammu & Kashmir was enacted in 1992.Criticism and legal appraisal of the Act:The controversy surrounding the Act has to do with the powers it grants armed forces. The law empowers security personnel, down to non-commissioned officers, to use force and shoot “even to the causing of death” if they are convinced that it is necessary to do so for the “maintenance of public order”. It also grants soldiers executive powers to enter premises, search, and arrest without a warrant.The exercise of these extraordinary powers by armed forces has often led to allegations of fake encounters and other human rights violations by security forces in disturbed areas while questioning the indefinite imposition of AFSPA in certain states, such as Nagaland and J&K. Various human rights activists and groups have said that the AFSPA has led to human rights violations, while allowing members of the armed forces to operate with impunity.Manipur’s Irom Sharmila has been one if its staunchest opponents, going on a hunger strike in November 2000 and continuing her vigil till August 2016. Her trigger was an incident in the town of Malom in Manipur, where 10 civilians waiting at a bus stop were allegedly gunned down by the 8th Assam Rifles.In 2004, following the alleged custodial death of a woman arrested by the armed Forces and ensuing protests, the Union government constituted a committee headed by a former Supreme Court judge, justice BP Jeevan Reddy, to review AFSPA. In 2005, this committee recommended that AFSPA be repealed, highlighting that the Act has become “a symbol of hate and an instrument of discrimination and high handedness”.The committee said: “It is highly desirable and advisable to repeal this Act altogether, without, of course, losing sight of the overwhelming desire of an overwhelming majority of the region that the Army should remain (though the Act should go). For that purpose, an appropriate legal mechanism has to be devised.” It suggested the amendment of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act by inserting new provisions in respect of north-eastern states so as to provide for specific powers of the armed forces in the region. The report, clearly, has not been accepted by the Centre.In 2007, the fifth report on public order of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission also recommended that AFPSA be repealed. “Repeal of AFPSA would remove the feeling of discrimination and alienation among the people of the North-Eastern states,” stated the Commission, adding it would be more appropriate to recommend insertion of appropriate provisions in the UAPA.In 2013, the justice JS Verma Committee, constituted to recommend amendments to Criminal Law, also recommended that the continuance of AFSPA in conflict areas needs to be revisited in order to extend legal protection to women in conflict areas. The committee emphasised that women in conflict areas were entitled to all the security and dignity that was afforded to citizens in any other part of the country. It recommended bringing sexual violence against women by members of the armed forces or uniformed personnel under the purview of ordinary criminal law; taking special care to ensure the safety of women who are complainants and witnesses in cases of sexual assault by the armed forced; and setting up special commissioners for women’s safety and security in all areas of conflict in the country.Constitutional courts and AFSPA:Validity of AFSPA as well as some specific provisions of the legislation have come under the judicial scrutiny of the Supreme Court over concerns of human rights violations and the federal structure.The Delhi high court, in Inderjit Barua Vs State of Assam (1983) held that the governor is empowered to declare any area of the state as “disturbed area” and that this power could not be termed arbitrary on ground of absence of legislative guidelines. The high court also affirmed the authority given to non-commissioned officers of the armed forces to open fire.In Luithukia Vs Rishang Keishing, (1988), Gauhati high court had the occasion to examine the scope of Section 4 of AFSPA in authorising the armed forces with powers to shoot and to make arrests without a warrant. The armed forces must act in cooperation with the district administration and not as an independent body, ruled the HC as it also laid down guidelines that operations conducted by the armed forces should be in tandem with the local administration.The Gauhati HC, in Horendi Gogoi Vs Union of India, (1991), held that in case of arrest of any person, army authority is duty bound to hand them over to the officer-in-charge of the nearest police station with least possible delay.In 1998, a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of AFSPA in Naga People’s Movement of Human Rights Vs Union of India. The five-judge bench maintained that Parliament had the authority to pass AFSPA, adding the Union government was obligated under Article 355 of the Constitution to defend each state against external aggression and internal strife, as well as to ensure that each state’s government operates in compliance with the Constitution’s provisions.At the same time, the Constitution bench held that a grave situation of law and order must occur for a region to be declared a “disturbed area” and that no arbitrary and unguided power has been conferred in the matter of declaring a region as a disturbed area. The top court further ruled that Section 3 of AFSPA cannot be construed as conferring a power to issue a declaration without any time limit, adding there should be periodic review of the declaration before the expiry of six months. Also Read| Nagaland killings: Home minister Amit Shah expresses regretThe Constitution bench also ordered that the Army Headquarters’ instructions in the form of “Dos and Don’ts” be followed by members of the armed forces when deployed in “disturbed areas”. These instructions, among other things, stated that a person should not be kept in custody for a period longer than required and should be handed over to the nearest police station; no force should be used on a person arrested, except in case of an attempted escape; and that third-degree methods should not be used to extract confessions.Deciding to order a probe into 1,528 cases of alleged fake encounters in Manipur in the last 20 years, the Supreme Court in 2016 said that indefinite deployment of armed forces in the name of restoring normalcy under AFSPA “would mock at our democratic process”, apart from symbolising a failure of the civil administration and the armed forces.The court further held that “ordinarily our armed forces should not be used against our countrymen and women” and that “every person carrying a weapon in a disturbed area cannot be labelled a militant or terrorist or insurgent” and be killed without any inquiry.Critical of the continuation of AFSPA in Manipur even after almost 60 years of its imposition, the court said that “normalcy not being restored cannot be a fig leaf for prolonged, permanent or indefinite deployment of the armed forces…as it would mock at our democratic process.”The top court ordered probe by a special investigation team of the Central Bureau of Investigation as it acted on a report by a court-mandated commission headed by former judge N Santosh Hegde, which examined six cases involving seven killings, and held that all these encounters were fake. While the last status report was submitted by CBI in 2018, the matter is still pending before the Supreme Court, and has not been effectively heard on the status of investigation in the last three years.
08-12-2021||India||No Opposition front without Congress, says Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut||There cannot be an opposition front without the Congress party, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday after meeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Tuesday. The two parties, and the Nationalist Congress Party are part of Maharashtra’s ruling MVA coalition.“We had a long conversation about political developments,” Raut said at a media briefing. “Discussions about keeping the opposition together also happened in the meeting. We (Shiv Sena) have always maintained that if there is an opposition front, then it is not possible without Congress.”A joint meeting of opposition parties should be convened to discuss the way forward for the 2024 general election, Raut said. “I have told Rahul ji to take a lead in this, and work openly towards it (bringing the opposition together),” he said.The meeting at 12 Tughlak Lane lasted about 50 minutes. The two leaders discussed upcoming assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Goa, where the Shiv Sena intends to field candidates. Raut is expected to meet Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday in New Delhi. Gandhi Vadra is Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh.Multiple opposition fronts will not be an alternative for the people in 2024, Raut said. Therefore, a front with Congress will ensure unity. “There cannot be unity without Congress,” he said.The statement from Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP came a few days after West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee met Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray and Raut in Mumbai to rally regional parties to form an opposition front. Banerjee, in her interaction with media last week, had said: “Where is UPA?” She was referring to the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress.The Shiv Sena leader added that the issue about leadership of the opposition front can be discussed after the parties come together. “Who leads the front is something all parties have to sit and decide together.”On whether the Shiv Sena is attempting to broker peace between the Congress and Banerjee, he remarked: “We have NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) leader Sharad Pawar Sahab for that. He is a tall leader.”Rahul Gandhi could visit Mumbai soon , Raut said. A meeting between the Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Gandhi may happen during the visit if Thackeray, who is recovering from a spine surgery, has recovered by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-opposition-front-without-congress-says-shiv-sena-s-sanjay-raut-101638903132790.html
08-12-2021||India||Nagaland resolution seeks repeal of AFSPA||The Nagaland government on Tuesday decided to write to the Union government to repeal a controversial law that gives security forces sweeping powers in disturbed areas, amid outrage in the region over the killing of 14 civilians in a botched Indian Army operation.“We have decided to write to the government of India for the immediate repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958, from the state,” Neiba Kronu, spokesperson of the state government, said after a state cabinet meeting.The state cabinet also decided to call off the remaining three days of the annual Hornbill Festival – a 10-day cultural event in which different Naga tribes showcase their traditions – in solidarity with the Konyak community to which a majority of the victims belonged.The decision came a day after chief minister Neiphiu Rio demanded the repeal of AFSPA from the state on Monday, calling it “draconian”, and stressing that the people of Nagaland had never accepted it. Its implementation had brought a bad name to the country across the world, Rio had said.State higher education minister Temjen Imna Along said the state government will appeal to the Union home ministry to remove AFSPA from Nagaland.“The state government can only appeal, and it is up to the central government to understand the feelings of the people of the state today,” the minister said. “As elected representatives of the people, irrespective of party lines, we have chosen to appeal to the government of India through the right process to bring reassurance to the people of the state that AFSPA should be repealed in our state.”Along, who is also Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s unit president in Nagaland, said that from a party perspective, the state BJP will put up the views and sentiments of the Naga people on AFSPA to its central leadership immediately.An elite military commando unit shot dead six coal miners returning home in Mon district on Saturday, believing they were targeting insurgents.Another eight people were killed by troops when they were confronted by a furious crowd in two separate incidents, with a soldier also being killed and army vehicles set ablaze.On Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah expressed regret over the killings and informed Parliament that a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the “unfortunate incident” will complete investigation within a month. He also said the firing was a consequence of “mistaken identity”.Tension continues to run high in the northeastern state where AFSPA was first clamped in 1958 at the height of the Naga insurgency that demanded a separate homeland. That demand has since been pared down by rebels, who are also in peace talks with the government, though a final agreement is yet to be reached.The Isak-Muivah-led National Socialist Council of Nagalim, the largest Naga rebel group that signed a ceasefire pact in 1997, and a “framework agreement” in 2015, has condemned the killings.Asked if the recent incident in Mon could impact the ongoing peace talks, government spokesperson Kronu said that the core committee on the Naga Political Issue (NPI) is scheduled to meet on December 9 to discuss the matter.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is convener of the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) – a group of parties allied with the National Democratic Alliance in the Centre – and has had parleys with the Naga peace process negotiating parties along with Rio, is expected to attend the meeting in Kohima on Thursday.AFSPA, which grants special powers to the forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas”, has been a contentious issue in the state for decades, with civil society members saying it gives security personnel impunity to carry out excesses, and defence forces saying that it helps them maintain order in restive areas. On Monday, Rio was joined by his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma in demanding the withdrawal of the law in the northeast.Kronu said the cabinet was briefed about action taken by the government after the killing of the 14 civilians, and the investigation by a SIT headed by the inspector general of police. The cabinet was also informed about the ground report submitted by the director general of police, which said army personnel tried to take away bodies of six killed people who were mistaken to be insurgents.The cabinet asked the SIT to complete its investigation and submit a report within a month, Kronu said.Among the injured in the December 4 incident, two were still under critical care in a hospital at Dibrugarh, six were undergoing treatment in Dimapur, and 22 were discharged from hospital, the government spokesperson said.“Situation (in Mon district) is now under control,” Kronu said. “The state cabinet has decided that all activities of the ongoing Hornbill Festival should be ceased in view of the demand of the mourning announced for the deceased in the firing incidents in Mon district and the demand of various civil society not to hold the activities.”The Hornbill Festival began on December 1. Six tribes from Eastern Nagaland – Konyak, Khiamniungan, Phom, Sangtam, Yimkhiung and Chang – withdrew from festival on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-resolution-seeks-repeal-of-afspa-101638903080062.html
08-12-2021||India||Farm unions discuss key proposals from Centre, likely to call off stir||The Union government and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions, appeared to be moving closer to an agreement to end a yearlong protest by cultivators, as the farm body on Tuesday discussed a set of draft proposals sent by the Centre but deferred a decision on calling off the agitation to Wednesday.In the letter sent through the Union home ministry, the Centre said it was willing to accept the major demands of the unions provided the farmers end their protests and return home. Though SKM responded that it would not accept any conditions from the Centre to end its agitation, the two sides appeared close to clinching a deal.Farm leaders who took part in the meeting on Tuesday said SKM “appreciated” the Centre’s move, but that there were still some sticking points, and discussions will resume on Wednesday.After nearly 14 months of protests on highways by farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 announced that his government would withdraw three agricultural reform laws farmers say were disastrous for their livelihoods. The laws were repealed by Parliament on November 29.The laws sought to open up agricultural markets to greater corporate participation. Farmers argued the changes would pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at assured prices.Also Read| Farmers protest: SC adjourns plea seeking removal of protesters to Jan 2022Among the key demands of the farm unions is a legislation guaranteeing minimum prices for farm produce. The Centre’s letter proposed a committee on minimum support prices, or MSP, comprising central and state government officials, farmers’ representatives including members of SKM, and agricultural scientists.SKM on December 4 named five members to negotiate with the Centre to resolve pending demands by farmers. They panel consists of farm leaders Ashok Dhawale, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, Shiv Kumar Kakkaji, and Yudhvir Singh.One of the other principal demands of the agitating farmers is that all cases registered against protesters in various states be withdrawn unconditionally. In its proposal sent to SKM, the Centre said the BJP-ruled governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have agreed that all cases against farmers would be withdrawn as soon as farmers announced an end to their movement.“The draft proposals linked the withdrawal of cases against farmers, which is a major demand by us, to an end to the ongoing protests. The SKM doesn’t agree to this condition. The government should first withdraw all cases,” Inderjit Singh, an SKM leader from Haryana who was part of the meeting, said.SKM leaders, however, added that they welcomed the government’s offer and were hopeful that further negotiations would help bride the chasm.The Centre also said that the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh agreed in principle to compensate the families of farmers who died during the protests -- another major demand of the farmers, who sought monetary compensation for nearly 700 farmers who have died from heat, cold, and exhaustion in the yearlong agitation. The Union government also referred to the Punjab government’s public announcement to compensate the kin of dead farmers.The Centre further said that it would discuss all stakeholders before moving the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 in Parliament. The government has listed the bill to be taken up in the current session of Parliament. Farmers want the bill withdrawn, as they think it contains provisions that will increase costs of agricultural power supply.The Union government also agreed to end all criminal liability of farmers for burning crop residue contained in a law to curb pollution in the National Capital Region.“While the central government’s proposals seemed to agree to these demands of farmers, there is some lack of clarity. Further discussions are needed. So we will again meet tomorrow,” said Rajewal, a farm leader and one of the members nominated by SKM to join the government panel.Also Read| Rahul seeks compensation, jobs for kin of farmers who died during agitationSKM also said on Tuesday it wanted more information the terms of reference of the committee proposed by the Centre on the issue of MSP. “We don’t know whether the committee’s mandate is to enable a legislation on MSP, which is what we have demanded. We will seek a clarification from the Centre on this,” Inderjit Singh, a farm leader from Haryana, said.On the issue of penalties on farmers burning paddy remnants, a major cause of air pollution in the region, SKM leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said all existing cases must be withdrawn. “The law should be clear that farmers will not face any criminal and civil liabilities for burning parali (paddy stubble),” Charuni said. The Centre’s letter assured the farmers that there would be criminal charges for stubble burning but did not specify its position on penalties.The Modi government’s decision to rescind the contentious farm laws and urgency to resolve pending demands of cultivators come as the BJP prepares to fight upcoming state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand. In Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, protesting farmers are an influential voting bloc. In the prosperous sugarcane belt of western UP, farmers had put up a stiff resistance to the now-repealed farm laws, led by Rakesh Tikait of the influential Bharatiya Kisan Union.Hundreds of farmers are still entrenched in at least five protest camps on the borders of the national Capital, choking key highways. The protests have kept police and civil officials on their toes for over 14 months.“Farmers now have organised themselves into a political force and forced the government to repeal the laws. If the issue of MSP is not amicably resolved, there is a potential for renewed agitation and if farmers feel cheated after withdrawing their agitation, it could influence their political preferences in upcoming state elections,” said Sudhir Panwar of University of Lucknow.

As he took a sharp turn, his vehicle collided with other vehicles,” Gowda said. The collision led to a massive traffic in the area, he added. Police said that a Maruti Alto, Maruti Suzuki Dzire, a tempo belonging to a movers and packers company and two auto rickshaws were among the vehicles damaged. The driver of the Maruti Alto, who was identified as Hari Mahant and was a resident of Assam, died on the spot, police said. The injured were identified as biker Anand Kumar (36), driver of the Dzire vehicle Mahesh (27), passengers Vidyashree (22) and Ninganabada Srinivas (22), and auto drivers Najeeb (38) and Krishna (30). All the injured were taken to CMH hospital, police said.Officials at Ulsoor traffic police said a case under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt due to negligence) and 304 (A) (Causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code was registered and that the accused driver was taken into custody.“We have conducted a blood test on the suspect and reports are awaited,” an official at the state said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-killed-as-speeding-mercedes-hits-vehicles-in-bengaluru-accused-held-101638903013508.html
08-12-2021||India||December 7: What we know about Omicron so far||Global stock markets, including India’s bourses, rallied on Tuesday, as did oil prices and the US dollar, as some signs trickled in of the Omicron variant possibly not being as worrisome as previously thought.These signs suggest the variant may be causing a milder version of the disease, and they originate from data by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa. A key endorsement of this early trend was made by White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci late on Monday, although he stressed that it was still early days.Reading ground dataAccording to NICD data analysed by the Financial Times newspaper, there are two clear trends that can be read from Omicron hotspot Gauteng province: First, the share of Covid-positive hospital patients requiring intensive care and ventilators is markedly lower when compared to the beginning of the Delta variant wave; and second, the overall number of people testing positive for Covid-19 is now close to levels seen during the Delta wave at the same phase of the wave, but intensive care unit admissions have not risen in lockstep.This mirrors a recent assessment by the NICD that found that this time, most of the hospitalised people are being treated on “room air” instead of needing oxygen support.If these trends hold up for another week or two, Omicron may indeed be considered a milder variant. At present, the conclusion may be tenuous since there seems to be a larger share of younger people infected in Gauteng.New scientific evidenceTwo scientific studies reinforce what is being observed.The first, one of the earliest neutralisation tests from which results seem to be available, was by GlaxoSmithKline’s biotech arm Vir Biotechnology, which found the company’s antibody treatment is still effective against the full combination of mutations in Omicron.The study, data for which was not yet out as on Tuesday, found there was a less than threefold drop in neutralisation by the company’s product sotrovimab of an engineered virus with the same configuration as Omicron.The second is new protein modelling by researchers from University of North Carolina, who used the AlphaFold2 deep learning model to create a simulation of the variant. Using what they found, and additional simulations of how known antibodies interact with the virus, the researchers predicted that there are “some structural changes in the receptor-binding domain that may reduce antibody interaction, but no drastic changes that would completely evade existing neutralizing antibodies (and therefore current vaccines)”.The findings are significant since AlphaFold2, a machine learning protein modelling programme created by Google’s DeepMind, has previously shown unprecedented accuracy in determining how proteins fold, a visualisation that is a challenge to estimate from merely reading genomic data.Omicron’s sequence was shared on November 22, South African authorities reported its spread on November 25, and it was designated a variant of concern on November 26. It is still early days for conclusive signs, but the early hopeful clues may not be entirely misleading.
08-12-2021||India||SP’s Lal Topi in PM Modi’s crosshairs at East UP rally||“The red caps are red alerts for Uttar Pradesh,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday at an event in Gorakhpur, referring to the Samajwadi Party (SP), whose members wear red caps.The comment, which came at an event to mark the reopening of a fertiliser plant and an AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in the city, evoked an immediate response from SP leader Akhilesh Yadav (who too wears the characteristic red cap) who said the real “red alert for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to which the PM belongs is “rising prices, unemployment”, the condition of “farmers”, and the “Hathras” and “Lakhimpur” incidents. He was referring to the gangrape and murder of a Dalit woman in 2020 in Hathras and the deaths of eight people in violence in 2021 in Lakhimpur Kheri, respectively.Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous and politically most important state, goes to the polls early next year and the BJP and the SP, the two main contenders in a four-cornered fight, have started their campaign. This is the PM’s fifth visit to the state since November 1.The PM said previous governments did nothing to revive fertiliser plants, nor allotted land for AIIMS, and added that the launch of both was a fitting reply to “those who talk of timing”, a reference to Yadav and his SP claiming that work on the Purvanchal Expressway, inaugurated with much fanfare on November 16, was actually started during the SP government’s tenure (2012-17). Even during the pandemic, the government continued its focus on development, Modi said.He also accused the SP of forgetting the path of Lohia (Ram Manohar Lohia) and Jai Prakash Narayan – socialist leaders on whose ideals the party was formed, “The people wearing red caps are more interested in red lights (beacons on VIP cars) and do not bother about your pain and sorrow. They are interested in filling their coffers, getting terrorists released from jail, and providing patronage to goons. These are like red alerts or warning bells for Uttar Pradesh,” Modi said.The PM inaugurated a fertiliser factory worth ₹8,600 crore and an AIIMS that has been built at a cost of ₹1,010 crore. The PM also opened three high-tech laboratories set up by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at the BRD Medical College to test samples for the encephalitis virus (earlier, samples were sent to labs in Pune).The newly built fertiliser plant will be operated by the Hindustan Urvarak Rasayan Limited (HURL).“When there is a government of double engines, then work with double the speed is done. When work is done with a good intention, even disasters do not become a hindrance. When there is a government that cares about the poor, exploited and disadvantaged, it also works hard, also shows results by bringing them,” he said.Modi said he would keep fighting for the rights of the poor, farmers, Dalits, and the deprived sections of society. “Reopening of five big fertiliser factories in the country is on the cards and the start has been made from Gorakhpur,” he emphasised.Lauding chief minister Yogi Adityanath for effectively handling crime in UP, the PM said all goons were in jail, and because of this, investors were investing in UP with an open heart, pushing the state on the path of growth and development.“By setting up the fertiliser factory, we have moved in the direction of self reliance in manufacturing urea. Earlier thousands of crores of rupees would go abroad to import urea and fertilisers, and we understood this better in the time of pandemic when due to travel restrictions, the price of urea went up significantly. But our government didn’t let this burden of rising prices come on to the farmers and ensured supply of cheap urea by providing subsidy of ₹35,000 crore on it,” said Modi, adding that his government took steps to check black marketing of urea, introduced 100% neem-coated urea and provided soil health cards to farmers so that they could choose fertilisers best suited for their land.The PM said that efforts were on to substitute diesel with biofuels like ethanol, a by-product of sugarcane.Speaking about deaths due to encephalitis in east UP, Modi said that with the UP government’s efforts, the mortality rate due to the disease had reduced by 95%.UP chief minister Adityanath cited the slogan “Modi hai to mumkin hai (Modi makes things possible)” to credit the PM with establishment of fertiliser factory and AIIMS. “The people of east UP are happy and overwhelmed... On June 10, 1990, Gorakhpur’s fertiliser factory was shut down and even after 24 years nobody bothered to restart it... But Modi ji understood the pain of people and gave the region a new fertiliser factory which has four times the capacity of the older one,” Adtiyanath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sps-lal-topi-in-pm-modi-s-crosshairs-at-east-up-rally-101638902952067.html

The complaint against him was filed on the same day.The single bench of justice Sujoy Paul granted him bail on Tuesday after he furnished a bond of ₹50,000.“Ali got bail after 10 hearings. However, four people, who were arrested for allegedly thrashing him were granted bail in 30 days only,” advocate Ehtesham Hashmi said.“The applicant has not committed any crime and has been implicated by the complainant so that they could save themselves from the clutches of law. He was harassed after knowing his religion, targeted, and bashed up mercilessly,” the lawyer had said in the bail application.The court granted him bail after seeing his past record,” said Aditya Garg, the government’s lawyer. “He has been asked to appear before the court during the hearing of the case.”Earlier, the hearing of the bail petition at the high court was deferred at least nine times due to different reasons after the sessions court rejected the bail plea on September 4.

Calling it a “mockery of the whole thing”, Justice Rekha Palli said no justification has been given by the Centre for not utilising the unspent budget allocated from the last three years to the rare diseases fund. “What is this? Children are dying because of lack of funds... What about the corpus which is available with the government here. I will not permit these children to die despite funds being available. When there are funds, why should the children suffering from rare diseases not get it?” the judge said. The court was hearing a bunch of petitions filed on behalf of children suffering from rare diseases like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Hunter’s syndrome, seeking direction to the Centre to provide them uninterrupted and free of cost treatment as the therapy is very expensive. DMD, one of the various forms of muscular dystrophy, is a rare genetic disease that affects boys almost exclusively and causes progressive weakness. Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II (Hunter Syndrome) is a rare disease that is passed on in families and mainly affects boys and their bodies cannot break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin, tendons and other tissues. In September, the court had asked the Union government to take steps for transferring ₹63 crore from the crowd funding account, lying with the Kerala high court, to that of the rare diseases account. On Tuesday, additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma told the court that it has filed an impleadment application before the Kerala high court. He said even though the application has been allowed, not much progress has been made in using the funds. This did not go well with the court, which said the Centre’s affidavit did not give any justification for not mentioning the names of the patients on the online portal. While directing the Centre to come back with a concrete answer, Justice Palli said, “On the next date, the ASG will also obtain instructions whether it is possible to provide treatment to petitioners and thereafter adjust the amount which may be received in the portal set up for the set purpose”. The court listed the matter for further hearing on December 15. The court also asked the ASG to take instructions as to whether it is possible to provide treatment to the petitioners and adjust the amount which may be received in the portal set up for the set purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-let-kids-with-rare-diseases-die-delhi-high-court-raps-centre-101638902654593.html
08-12-2021||India||UP elections: SP, RLD announce alliance, vow ‘sunset’ for BJP||The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RLD) on Tuesday announced an alliance for assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh early next year, holding a big rally in the politically crucial western region of India’s most populous state.The two parties vowed to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is hoping to secure a second straight term, and courted farmers who spent a year protesting three central laws that have now been repealed.“This time there would be sunset of the BJP forever in western Uttar Pradesh,” SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said in Dabathua village of Meerut district. “Kisanon ka inquilab hoga, 2022 me badlav hoga (There will be revolution by farmers and change in 2022),” he added.RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary said if the alliance came to power, it will build a memorial for “martyrs” of the year-long farm protest. He also attacked the BJP government for the recent leak of a government competitive examination question paper and subsequent cancellation of the test.“The BJP will get a befitting reply from the people in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls next year as they have understood its politics of hatred. The BJP talks of hatred and our babaji (a reference to chief minister Yogi Adityanath) starts with Aurangzeb and ends with the Kairana exodus,” he said.During the previous assembly polls in 2017, some BJP leaders said Hindu families fled Kairana town in Shamli district after intimidation by Muslim criminals, a claim that was later challenged by the local administration and other residents.This is the second major alliance forged by the SP, which is looking to reverse defeats in the 2017 state polls and 2019 general elections at the hands of the BJP. Last month, Yadav joined hands with the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, which has influence among sections of the other backward classes (OBCs) in eastern Uttar Pradesh.The RLD, which has a base among the Jat and Muslim communities in 14 districts of Saharanpur, Meerut and Moradabad divisions with 71 Assembly seats, in western Uttar Pradesh, suffered reverses in the 2014, 2017 and 2019 polls, but is looking to revive itself on the back of the farm stir.In his speech Chaudhary hailed the agitation. “I appreciate farmers for winning a big battle and forcing (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji, probably for the first time, to bow before them,” he said, referring to the repeal of three central farm laws on November 29.“Our party had announced the construction of a memorial in Meerut, but now Akhilesh ji and I are together. The first work our double-engine government will do is to construct a memorial for martyr farmers, who died during farmers’ protest,” Chaudhary said. He accused BJP leaders of insulting cultivators.“In Lakhimpur Kheri, farmers were crushed. Over 700 of them died during the agitation,” he said. During violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 this year, eight people died, including four farmers and two BJP workers.Yadav remembered Charan Singh, former Prime Minister and Chaudhary’s grandfather, BR Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia and farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait. “Farmers were fighting for their rights and they wanted that government should listen to them, but they were crushed under the jeep by BJP’s minister and his supporters,” he said, referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.He said farmers should be given their rights and a decision should be taken for providing them crop support prices.Chaudhary also attacked chief minister Adityanath. “Babaji becomes angry very fast. You have never seen him smiling. He smiles only when he is with bacchde (calves). I ask you people to free him so that he can play with his calves for 24 hours. He cannot handle government files.”Yadav said RLD and SP workers will help in strengthening harmony among the people and said the SP- RLD government will give relief in electricity bills to the poor if they formed the government.“The joint rally of the SP-RLD was a super flop show. It is clear that the SP chief’s Jinnah talk has alienated his supporters. Nobody would want to associate with a leader who equates one who was responsible for country’s partition with someone like Sardar Patel, a great leader and a patriot who united the country. Our respected Prime Minister rightly said that ‘Lal Topis’ mean red alert,” state BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-elections-sp-rld-announce-alliance-vow-sunset-for-bjp-101638902534879.html

Have put an action plan with 8 compliances on immigration queues, expanding RT-PCR service providers,” Scindia tweeted on Tuesday.“...Ramping up help desks & forex counters, along with seamless floor management. Rest assured, @MoCA_GoI is monitoring the situation on a daily basis & passengers shall not face any inconvenience at airports,” he added.Instructions were given to keep an eye on social media platforms for better passenger care, officials said. “The aim is to reach out for help in case someone highlights an issue,” said one ministry official who asked not to be named.To ensure smooth passage of international travellers arriving in India, the aviation and health ministries on Tuesday mandated contactless self-declaration on the Air Suvidha portal.“To ensure the necessary prevention of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus, the exemption forms from the Air Suvidha portal have been discontinued, and filling of the details have been made compulsory for all international passengers arriving in India,” said a statement from the aviation ministry.“All international passengers arriving in India are mandated to declare their current health status prior to boarding on the Air Suvidha portal, along with the required documents: copy of passport, PCR negative certificate from a test conducted within 72 hours of departure, and the vaccination certificate. For immigration, the copy received in e-mail is essential on arrival in India and has to be verified at the APHO (airport health office) counter,” the statement added.The government issued an updated list of “at-risk” countries, adding Ghana and Tanzania to the list of 14 regions from where travellers have to go through mandatory testing on arrival, and home quarantine for seven days. The list incudes all of Europe including the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.Bangladesh, which was a part of the original list, was removed from it.In order to avoid crowding at Delhi airport, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) has set up 20 dedicated counters to deal with passengers from these at-risk countries who have pre-booked their test, and increased seating and waiting space.DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar on Monday said the airport was making continuous enhancements in terms of the infrastructure and processes required to comply with the new screening norms.Chetan Kohli, chief operating officer at Genestrings Diagnostics, the lab carrying out testing of fliers at the Delhi airport, said that out of 120 rapid testing machines, 50 will be placed inside the terminal, which will save an additional 30 minutes spent on moving samples to the main lab, which is located at the multilevel car parking at Terminal 3.“We’re also hiring additional staff to have 60 registration desks, as against 40 right now, to speed up the process and cater to additional countries, if any are added to the at-risk category,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scindia-issues-action-plan-for-airports-amid-omicron-threat-101638902292830.html
08-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: December 8, 1970 — Absolute majority for Awami League in East Pak elections||Dacca- The right-wing Awami League, headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, scored an absolute majority in the eastern wing in today’s general elections in Pakistan, according to unofficial results reported here tonight.Sheikh Rahman himself won two seats in the Dacca City National Assembly constituency. Polling began at 8-30 a.m. today and was held smoothly until 4-30 p.m. throughout Pakistan, apart from a few isolated incidents. The percentage of votes cast ranged from 90 to 95 per cent in towns and five to 80 per cent in rural areas. A high percentage of women voted.The lone rival of Sheikh Rahman in East Pakistan, Khawaja Khairuddin, president of the East Pakistan Council Muslim League, complained that 30 per cent of the votes were fake.There were sporadic reports of minor clashes. In Chittagong, voters were prevented from casting their ballots at daggers point, women voters were manhandled and molested and two voting booths were suspended.Complete election returns had been received from several tribal constituencies, in at least three of which the winning candidates were Independents.Today’s election was to fill 290 seats in the 313-member National Assembly, which is to frame a Constitution within 120 days.Polling has been postponed in nine constituencies, one candidate has already been returned uncontested and 13 women are to be chosen by the Assembly later to fill the seats reserved for them.Key seatsAccording to latest trends in counting in key constituencies, the former Foreign Minister, Mr Z. A. Bhutto, Pakistan’s Muslim League leader, Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan, the National Awami Party jeacer, Khan Wali Khan and Pakistan’s Democratic Party leader, Mr Nurul Amin, were leading in their constituencies.A key election issue for East Pakistan’s 30 million voters is greater control over their own affairs and resentment over alleged neglect and exploitation by the West Pakistan-dominated Central Government.The Awami League programme calls for maximum provincial autonomy, leaving only defence and foreign affairs with the Central Government in Islamabad. According to AP, police used batons to disperse fighting mobs outside a women’s booth in Karachi.President Yabya Khan cast his vote at a Rawalpindi booth. Talking to newsmen later, he said he had fulfilled his promise to hold elections on the basis of adult franchise in preparation for transfer of power to civilian hands. He said the Constitution to be framed by the new National Assembly, whose members are being chosen today, would have to be approved by him as the President. Twenty-four parties were fielding more than 1,600 candidates for 290 of 313 seats in the National Assembly. More than 50 million voters constituting roughly half of Pakistan’s population form the electorate. All precautionary measures had been taken by the army to maintain law and order. There was intensive polling in Sindh, Baluchistan and West Punjab. Radio Pakistan, in its commentary, kept telling the voters that Islam and God were supreme and that the defence and security of the nation were matters of vital importance. The commentary was frequently interrupted to warn the public that those who broke the law during the poll would be severely dealt with. Gen. Yahya Khan’s recent statement that law and order would be maintained at all costs was incorporated in the commentary. Also included in it was a message on the need for unity, given more than two decades ago by the late M. A. Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-december-8-1970-absolute-majority-for-awami-league-in-east-pak-elections-101638902236212.html
08-12-2021||India||‘I am broken inside’: Grief sweeps Nagaland village of 14 killed||Darkness had started to fall on Saturday afternoon when Monglong heard the faint boom of gunshots. The 35-year-old pastor had just seen off her husband, Hokup, who worked at a coal mine in Nagaland’s far-flung Mon district, and didn’t think too much of it.Hokup had just left their home in Oting village for the mine nearby with some friends. The couple had wed nine days before and she was eager to see him back home later that night. Deep in thought, she drifted off to sleep.She remembered being jolted out of sleep some hours later by relatives and neighbours, who told her that she had to lead prayers for some “brothers” who died in a firing. Dread rising in her, she started to call her husband frantically -- it was night but he was still to return.“I called so many times but he didn’t answer…. Then I called one of his friends who answered and told me that Hokup had an injury on his hand,” Monglong said.“When I insisted to speak to him, I heard him saying that he was in a lot of pain that he would talk to me later and hung up,” she added.Also Read| Nagaland killings: Home minister Amit Shah expresses regretThe man she spoke to was wrong. Hokup was not injured in the hand, but shot in the chest, fatally. A few hours later, he died. “I couldn’t breathe when they told me that Hokup was dead,” she said.In the small village of Oting, roughly 300km from the state capital of Kohima, there are many like her who are mourning the loss of their brothers, sons, fathers and husbands. Many of the residents -- a father battling cancer, a mother with twin sons -- are yet to come to terms with the grief that has swept the region since an elite military commando unit gunned down 14 civilians in a botched operation on Saturday.“I cannot comprehend fully what is going on, I don’t know what will happen to me,” Monglong said.Their stories of pain and anguish reverberate in the empty homes that dot the mountains in the region, and echo far away in Delhi where Parliament has been roiled by the killings. Thousands of people from across the state have poured into their humble village, where the men, most of whom worked at a local coal mine, were laid to rest on Monday.But for the kin of the victims,it means little.Ngamlem, whose husband Langtun fell to the army bullets, is left to tend to her two-month-old child. Married a little over a year ago, she is inconsolable. “Brother I can’t talk...” she wailed, surrounded by mourners in Mon town.Chemwang, a cancer patient, couldn’t believe that his son and sole caregiver, Shomwang, is gone. Shomwang had bought a pick-up truck and used to drive it for a living, ferrying villagers from a coal mine in Tiru area.“They killed my innocent son...I am broken inside. I have been unwell, he used to take care of me...I will go mad, what will I do,” said Chemwang. To bystanders and mourners, his only question was, “Why did they do this?”Awan Konyak was in shock. Her twin sons, Langwang and Thapwang, worked at the mine and died in the ambush. “They should have known innocents are travelling the truck. The government should ensure my sons get justice,” said Awan, 66. “Both were our only hope. Now, who will take care of us?” she asked.The army’s 21 Para special force unit was conducting an operation in the area after receiving inputs on the possible movement of militants of Yung Aung faction of the proscribed outfit National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K).Based on intelligence inputs that have since been disputed, the commandos laid an ambush on Saturday evening and killed six men who were in a pick-up truck. Another eight people were killed by troops when they were confronted by a furious crowd in two separate incidents, with a soldier also being killed and army vehicles set ablaze.Also Read| Nagaland lawmaker KG Kenye slams Afspa, compares it with ‘licence to kill’Nagaland Police’s FIR named the army’s elite special unit behind the killings and claimed that the security forces had intention to murder and injure civilians. The security forces personnel tried to hide the dead bodies by wrapping and loading them in a pickup truck, according to the report by the state director general of police and commissioner.In Oting, the grief of the residents is laced with anger. Many families say those responsible for the killing should be arrested and punished for the crime. “They cannot bring him back but I want justice. That whoever is guilty is punished,” Monglong said.The memories of Saturday continue to sear her. Hokup had returned the day before to attend the funeral of a friend. The couple later shared a simple meal of rice and mustard leaves before he rushed back -- so that he could back early that night. “How was I to know that it was the last time we were meeting?” she asked?(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-broken-inside-grief-sweeps-nagaland-village-101638902232926.html

On Tuesday, Uttarakhand tourism minister Satpal Maharaj dedicated the restored iconic heritage house of George Everest, a cartographic museum and an observatory at Park Estate in Mussoorie to the public.Gopal Bhardwaj, a local historian who received a plaque from the tourism minister for his research work on the area, said, “The George Everest House was built in 1832 but later became dilapidated. When tourism minister Satpal Maharaj was requested in 2017 to restore the house, he readily agreed , and today we see it in a new avatar”.The location of the house is strategic and it was used as an observatory to view mountains that demarcated the boundaries of British India.It does not provide a view of Mount Everest though. Mount Everest was mapped by the British only in the 1850s and named after George Everest in 1856 -- in honour of the fact that he completed what is called the Great Trigonometric Survey of the Subcontinent. He was succeeded by Andrew Waugh; Radhanath Sikdar a so-called “computer” for the Geological Survey of India, was the first person to measure Mount Everest’s height, and many people believe the world’s highest peak should have been named after him.It is reported that George Everest himself protested when it was suggested that the newly discovered mountain the world’s tallest, be named after him, but that he was overruled.Satpal Maharaj said, “Our vision to restore the iconic House of the Sir George Everest House and the surroundings has finally been fulfilled. The project has been completed with an estimated cost of around ₹ 23 crores with an objective to attract tourists not only from India but abroad too. Once the cartography museum is fully equipped, the descendants of Sir George Everest will be invited to see the restored George Everest House”.Maharaj said the house has been restored using the same technology that was used for the construction of the original structure.The project was taken up with financial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The minister also flagged off a shuttle service from George Everest House that will bring tourists to the spot from Mussoorie.The tourism minister also released the book “The Great Ark” on the occasion and planted a tree in the George Everest House premises.Sandeep Sahni, president Uttarakhand Hotel and Restaurant Association said, “It is indeed a boon for the tourist town of Mussoorie that the iconic George Everest House along with cartographic museum and observatory have been restored so that tourists can learn about the survey completed by Sir George Everest”.Sir George Everest (July 4, 1790 –December 1, 1866) was a British surveyor and geographer who served as Surveyor General of India from 1830 to 1843. For his contributions, Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth which was earlier called Peak XV, was named in his honour. He worked on Great Trigonometric Survey, and was largely responsible for surveying the meridian arc from the southernmost point of India north to Nepal, a distance of about 2,400 kilometres . George Everest House and laboratory, where he lived for 11 years, is located at Park Easte near Hathipaon, about 8 kms from Gandhi Chowk in Mussoorie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18th-century-george-everest-house-gets-facelift-thrown-open-to-public-101638901633012.html
08-12-2021||India||PM Modi may visit UAE, Kuwait in January to strengthen ties||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to open his foreign visit calendar in 2022 with trips to the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, both trusted allies, early in January. While Modi will visit Expo 2020 in Dubai, the real purpose of the visit, HT learns, is to thank both allies for standing with India during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic as well as taking care of the huge Indian diaspora in these two emirates. The UAE has no less than four million Indians and Kuwait has nearly one million Indian diaspora, who contribute to Indian economy through remittances as well as in times of need.Even though the government is tight-lipped about the visit, PM Modi may travel to these two countries in the first 10 days of January 2022. Special emphasis is being paid to these two foreign trips as both nations are at the heart of India’s foreign policy in West Asia.Since his first visit to UAE at the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in August 2015, PM Modi has been focused on cementing ties with Abu Dhabi, with foreign minister S Jaishankar returning from the UAE last Sunday. UAE is India’s third largest trade partner after US and China with the trade volumes touching over $60 billion. The January 2022 trip will be Modi’s fourth to the UAE; before him, the last PM to visit the UAE was Indira Gandhi, 32 years before his first visit.India and the UAE have taken their ties to a new level with the latter cleaning up all anti-India criminal and economic activity from the Gulf nation. There has also been significant cooperation in the fields of cyber-security, counter-radicalisation, defence and intelligence sharing. “Just as India is focused on Singapore as a hub of diplomatic activity in the east, it is on Abu Dhabi in West Asia, for getting investments into India,” said a former foreign secretary. India recognises that UAE has, over the years, not only has developed global-quality infrastructure but has also emerged a hub of diplomatic activity in the region. It is also a major regional defence power as was evident when last week UAE decided to purchase 80 Rafale fighters and 13 heavy lift helicopters from France.Like with the UAE, Indian ties with Kuwait are very special with the latter supplying oxygen cylinders and other medical equipment in large numbers during the second wave of pandemic in India. In fact, EAM Jaishankar flew to Kuwait with a personal letter from PM Modi to Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah, thanking Kuwait for its support and with the future objective of deepening ties in energy, trade, information technology and services.

Shringla, who is on a two-day trip to Bangladesh, will review wide-ranging bilateral cooperation and prepare the grounds for President Ram Nath Kovind’s state visit during December 15-17. Kovind will join the 50th Victory Day celebrations on December 16. He held talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart Masud Bin Momen and met foreign minister AK Abdul Momen on Tuesday. Shringla will call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday. Following his meeting with Shringla, the Bangladeshi foreign minister told reporters in Dhaka they had discussed a number of “pending issues” between Bangladesh and India, including water-sharing and deaths in incidents along the border. The foreign minister said Dhaka had urged New Delhi to expedite the process of holding the next meeting of the joint river commission to resolve water-sharing issues. “They gave us a formula to check unwanted incidents on the frontier,” he said. He added India isn’t expected to make any move that could create cracks in the ongoing “golden chapter” of bilateral relations. “They also don’t want to see any incident that could make any kind of (crack) in Bangladesh-India relations,” he told the media. “We have to solidify this relation…it is needed for welfare of the people of both countries,” he added. Talking to the media after his meeting with the Bangladeshi foreign secretary, Shringla said there are “no major difference in opinions” on pending issues between India and Bangladesh. “We discussed the issues but we found no major differences…There are only areas to take forward. We are looking forward how we can work on (resolving the issues),” he was quoted as saying BSS news agency. Masud Bin Momen said he and Shringla had a fruitful discussion on all pending issues during their meeting that lasted almost an hour, but didn’t give any details. “We also discussed how we can make our border peaceful,” he said. Among the issues that figured in the discussions were connectivity, green energy, green technology and e-commerce, Masud Bin Momen said. Cooperation between the two sides for the Covid-19 response will continue as “Bangladesh cannot be safe if India is not safe and India cannot be safe if Bangladesh is not safe”, he added. Shringla said connectivity projects between the two sides are going on well and five out of six historic rail connections have been restored and the sixth one will be completed this year. He said India wants to promote eco-friendly railway and water connectivity with Bangladesh. He added that the Indian prime minister and president had made Bangladesh the destination for their first foreign visit following the pandemic, and this shows the bilateral relationship is passing through a “golden chapter”. Shringla also said New Delhi and Dhaka are working to arrange Prime Minister Hasina’s visit to India at the earliest. The Indian foreign secretary arrived in Dhaka a day after both countries celebrated “Maitri Diwas” or friendship day in 18 cities worldwide, including Dhaka and New Delhi to commemorate their close ties over the past 50 years. The external affairs ministry describes India’s ties with Bangladesh as one of the strongest pillars of its “Neighbourhood First” policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shringla-focusses-on-green-energy-water-sharing-in-bangladesh-visit-101638899773154.html
08-12-2021||India||More probe into Gujarat riots will be travesty of justice, Supreme Court told||Ordering any further probe into an alleged larger conspiracy behind the 2002 Gujarat riots will amount to a travesty of justice, the Gujarat government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday in response to a petition contesting the clean chit given by the special investigation team (SIT) to 63 people. The list includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the Gujarat chief minister at the time.The petition was filed by Zakia Ahsan Jafri, the widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad during the communal riots, in which over 1,000 people lost their lives.“The role of the state government was gone into in detail by a commission of inquiry (CoI) headed by a judge of this court. In the name of the first petitioner (Zakia), the second petitioner (social activist Teesta Setalvad) wants to keep the pot boiling by seeking further investigation which I state will be a travesty of justice that should not be encouraged by this court,” solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, said on Tuesday.Mehta added that the state did everything it could in those circumstances by calling in the army in time and issuing orders to prevent law and order situations. This was noted by the Commission of Inquiry. “Now at the behest of the second petitioner, any further exercise of power by this Court would not be in the public interest.”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Zakia and Setalvad, responded to the argument by saying: “If you stoke the fire, the pot will boil, and if you keep stoking the fire, the pot will continue to boil.” Sibal contended that the SIT did not do a fair job as it shielded some of the accused, and doubted the state’s argument that all steps were taken by the administration to control the riots.Sibal also referred to arguments by the SIT counsel, Mukul Rohatgi who said there was no violence in the state till the afternoon of February 28, 2002, when the riots had begun. “If there was no violence till 1 o’clock, why then did you ask for the army at 2 o’clock? There is evidence that violence commenced on February 27 itself. That is why we argued that SIT should probe the buildup to the riots.”In September 2011, the top court directed the SIT to examine Zakia Jafri’s complaint against the state functionaries alleging conspiracy in the riots. The SIT, headed by former CBI director RK Raghavan, concluded there was no larger conspiracy and filed a closure report before a Gujarat court in 2012. Jafri challenged the closure before a trial court, which dismissed her plea. Later, in October 2017, the Gujarat high court refused to entertain the petition challenging the closure of the SIT. This order was then challenged before the top court by Zakia and Setalvad 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-probe-into-gujarat-riots-will-be-travesty-of-justice-supreme-court-told-101638899652854.html
08-12-2021||India||India’s top 10% reach highest wealth level||The Covid-19 pandemic inflicted unprecedented damage to economies across the globe. While a recovery is underway, it is not necessary that both the rich and the poor will recover equally. The World Inequality Report 2022, released on December 7, shows this is indeed the case. Apart from wealth, it tracks other inequalities that have become important in today’s world, such as that in greenhouse gas emissions.The report, produced by the World Inequality Lab hosted at the Paris School of Economics and the University of Berkeley, California, shows that the richest in India increased their share of wealth in 2021 by a historic degree. It also shows that women in India have a much lower share in labour income compared to their global peers.Share of bottom 50% in India’s wealth is the lowest everIn 2021, the average household wealth in India was ₹983,010 per adult, according to the report. However, this figure is driven by some of the wealthiest people in India. The top 10% owned assets worth ₹6,354,070 on average ( ₹63.5 lakh, and the top 1% own ₹324.5 lakh on average), which is 96 times more than the bottom 50% ( ₹66,280). As these numbers suggest, private wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few in India. In 2021, this concentration became more pronounced. The top 10% had a share of 64.64% in total household wealth, the highest since 1995, the earliest year for which this data is available. The share of the bottom 50% decreased to its lowest levels since 1995 to 5.9%. In 2020, the share of the top 10% was 63.94%, in 2019, 64.05%. And the share of the bottom 50% in 2020 was 6.02%, and in 2019, 6%.To be sure, this trend was not unique to India. Billionaires (individuals owning at least $1b in nominal terms) increased their share in total household wealth of the world from 2.20% in 2020 to 3.34% in 2021. This 52% increase in share is the highest since 1996. The top 0.1% registered an 8.3% growth – 4th highest since 1996 – in their share to amass 11.11% of the world’s household wealth. The entry threshold of top 0.1% was €693,000 (PPP) in 1995 and is €16,666,000 today.Income inequality in India is as high as it was under British colonial ruleWealth represents assets minus debts at a point in time. Income is the money that a person receives in an interval, such as wages. According to the report, income inequality is generally less than wealth inequality. For India, it estimates that the top 10% earners make 20 times ( ₹1,166,520) as much as the bottom 50% ( ₹53,610).In terms of concentration, the top 10% accounts for 57.1% of the income now, while the bottom 50% receive only 13.1%. To be sure, the top earners have not achieved this level of concentration in a linear fashion. In colonial times, their share was around 50%, but started decreasing after independence, reaching a low of 30.9% in 1982, before it started increasing again. “After independence, socialist-inspired five-year plans contributed to reducing this share to 35-40%. Since the mid-1980s, deregulation and liberalisation policies have led to one of the most extreme increases in income and wealth inequality observed in the world,” the report says.To be sure, these figures are not the most recent and have not changed in the dataset since 2014. “Over the past three years, the quality of inequality data released by the government has seriously deteriorated, making it particularly difficult to assess recent inequality changes,” the report adds.Indian women’s share in labour income is much less than their global peersThe World Inequality Report 2022 also estimates gender inequality in global earnings. The earnings estimated for this only take into account labour income, or wages and salaries and labour share of self-employment income. This shows that women received only 18.3% of the labour income in 2020 in India. This is almost half the share that accrued to women in other developing economies such as Brazil (38.5%) and China (33.4%), as well as the global average (34.70%). Among different regions of the world, Indian women’s share in earnings comes close to the proportion in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) . Women’s share in labour earnings in India has also grown at a slower rate between 2010 and 2020 (19% increase) than between 2000 and 2010 (36% increase).Inequalities in GHG emissions are not just a rich and poor country issue The climate crisis caused by global warming is one of the great 21st century challenges. It has also brought forward another dimension of inequality: ecological inequality. One of its forms is the differences in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the globe. In climate negotiations, for example, developing and under-developed countries ask for fewer curbs on their emissions because they have contributed less historically to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. The World Inequality Report, however, shows that emissions are not necessarily a rich and poor country issue.The richest within different countries emit disproportionately more. India’s top 10% emits 9 times as much GHG per capita as the bottom 50%, although it is still less than all major regional averages. On the other hand, even the poor in some country might emit more than the rich in another. The bottom 50% in North America, for instance, emits 9.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita per year. This is similar to the 10.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted by the middle 40% in Europe per capita per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-top-10-reach-highest-wealth-level-101638898391710.html

08-12-2021||India||HTLS 2021 Inside the mind of India’s champs: Grit, guts, glory||Call it the afterglow of success, or firm belief in self, or a bit of both, but four months after India registered its best haul at the Olympics and Paralympics, the country’s medallists already have Paris 2024 in their sights.Bajrang Punia, Avani Lekhara, and Sumit Antil took the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on a journey that was full of revelations, while being both refreshing and reassuring. They were unanimous in their assertion that the Tokyo success was a pit stop, and not the final destination, of their careers.“I am definitely not satisfied with my bronze. As an athlete, I can never let my guard down. I am targeting a gold in Paris, and if you ask any sportsperson irrespective of whether they won a medal in Tokyo or not, they’ll tell you they want to win a gold at the 2024 Games. This is a major shift in attitude,” said Punia, who beat Kazakhstan’s Daulet Niyazbekov to win a bronze in his maiden Games.Punia’s medal was the fourth consecutive Olympics when wrestling fetched a medal for the country, and the 27-year-old credited the consistency to Sushil Kumar, who ended India’s then 56-year wait for a wrestling medal when he claimed bronze at the Beijing Games in 2008.“The credit (for wrestling’s success) certainly goes to Sushil, because he broke the glass ceiling for a lot of us. He gave us the belief that we can emulate him. Now, we hope to do the same for the next generations,” the Sonepat-based wrestler said in a conversation with CNN-News18’s Shivani Gupta.While Punia had a role model in Sushil and a functional system that groomed him into one of the world’s best, the challenges for Lekhara and Antill were manifold and seemingly insurmountable.Lekhara, now 19, was paralysed form the waist down after a road accident in 2012. Bedridden for months, she was home schooled for two years, and it was on the insistence of her father that she tried her hand at shooting and archery.She made her international shooting debut in 2017. Her gold in the 10-metre air rifle standing SH1 event in Tokyo was the first instance of Lekhara topping the podium at an international event. She marked the occasion by equalling the world record (249.6) in the final.What made the success sweeter was that Lekhara had recovered from a bad start in the qualifications, and was seventh among the eight contenders when the final began. What’s more, she was not happy even after shooting gold, thanks to a 9.9 that she hit in her last competition shot.“I was not satisfied because my last shot wasn’t good, but when I saw the faces of my team members and family, it made me happy. This is my last junior year, and I wanted to end it with a Paralympic gold, a Paralympic record, a junior world record, and a world record. Luckily, I achieved all my goals!” Lekhara added.Four days later, she added another first to her kitty, when, by virtue of shooting a bronze in the 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 event, she became the only Indian woman to win multiple medals at the Paralympics.“I compete in four events, out of which 10m and 50m 3P are my favourites. I really wanted to win a medal in both. I knew I couldn’t have sat back after just one gold. And in some ways my bronze was even more satisfying than the gold,” she said.Unlike Lekhara, javelin thrower Antil had tasted international success before his Tokyo campaign. A reigning world record holder and a silver medallist at World Para Athletics Championships in 2019, he broke his own world record three times in a space of six attempts in the F64 category.The gold arrived with a monster throw of 68.55 metres, just hours after Lekhara became the first Indian woman to win a Paralympics gold.The 23-year-old was training to become a wrestler before a road accident turned his life around. Back in 2015, on his way back from his tuition classes, Antil’s motorbike was hit by a tractor from behind. The tractor crushed his left leg, and close to two months after the accident, he got a prosthetic leg.Life on prosthetics was not easy, but Antil, having bumped into Oscar ‘Blade Runner’ Pistorius’ videos, was determined to make a career in sports. The next challenge was to get used to the prosthetics.“As a para athlete, you can’t do certain basic exercises. I can’t do full squats on my artificial leg, so I had to look for alternate exercises to work out those muscles. Even today, I wake up in pain. Till the time the muscles don’t wake up, the amputated leg hurts; it is inevitable. People say, ‘Look, he has won a medal in just four years,’ but they don’t know what goes behind each success.I have been using my current prosthetic leg since March, and am still getting used to it.”Hurling a javelin on a prosthetic leg brought its own challenges. Antil could not use any power from the ground, meaning all his throws needed to be propelled by his sheer upper body strength.“Even in wrestling, our coaches trained us to use ground to our advantage. We learn to draw power from the ground, but I had completely lost that advantage.”However, the upper body strength accrued through rigourous grappling sessions meant he developed into a more-than-competent javelin thrower. He had the world record on his radar since the day he picked up a javelin.“The day I started out in javelin, I asked my coach what the current world record was. People were sceptical initially about my dream to break the then world record, which was around 59 metres, but I was always confident. Now, I have stretched the record by roughly 10 metres.“My goal is to shorten the gap between the able-bodied throwers and para throwers, although there is a world of difference between the two because throwers with leg amputations cannot draw any power from the ground. I’d still like to get close to 80 metres and will do my best to win another gold in Paris 2024,” Antil said.With a 19-medal haul at Para Games, Antil reckons that country’s budding para athletes may not be short of role models anymore.“I am happy that I am part of a change. Our success will hopefully inspire people who unfortunately meet with accidents and had to undergo amputations. Now, such people and young para athletes have heroes right in front of them, and I am happy to have played a part in this change,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2021-inside-the-mind-of-india-s-champs-grit-guts-glory-101638641599002.html
08-12-2021||India||HTLS 2021 Border tension reflects on ties: EAM on China||New Delhi: India and China cannot simultaneously have a “tense, high-friction border” and great relations in all other spheres, especially after Beijing violated clear cut commitments in two agreements on not massing forces on the frontier, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Participating in a virtual conversation at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Jaishankar listed India’s three top foreign policy priorities as focusing on countries in the extended neighbourhood, including Central and West Asia; good relations with big power shaping the world order to advance the country’s interests; and developing a larger footprint for India. Jaishankar, however, listed his number one priority as national security, which he put above all considerations in diplomacy. The challenges related to Afghanistan outlined in UN Security Council resolution 2593, which was passed two weeks after the Taliban takeover in mid-August, continue to be “live concerns” and justify the prudence displayed by India, which has been very careful in its assessments regarding the war-torn country, he said during a wide-ranging discussion. Jaishankar said two agreements with China contained no ambiguity on the issue of bringing forces to the border, as everything was laid down in “cold print”. He added, “There were very, very clear-cut commitments not to mass forces on the border and those commitments stand violated as of 2020 spring.”He was referring to the standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which began in May 2020. Bilateral relations are yet to recover from the fallout of a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June last year that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops. Both sides have deployed some 50,000 troops each in the sector and several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have not led to disengagement at all the friction points. Jaishankar said: “And as we have made clear – the state of the relationship, at the end of the day, will reflect the state of the border. You can’t have a tense, high friction border and have great relations in all other parts of life. It doesn’t work that way.” It was inevitable that the standoff had “already spilt over into other domains and the expectation that somehow we will contain it in a narrow sense and carry on with the rest of life, I think, is not a realistic one”, he added. “We do have a significant issue there for us and also for them because I frankly don’t think it’s in the interest of either country that our relationship goes off in this direction,” Jaishankar said in a session moderated by foreign affairs expert Pramit Pal Chaudhuri. The Chinese side attempted to “unilaterally change the status quo or to violate the LAC”, and troops from both sides were “sometimes uncomfortably closely deployed”. With the standoff in Ladakh continuing for close to two years, there are now question marks against the assumptions, understandings and agreements which guided the management of border areas, he added. Asked about his foreign policy priorities, the foreign secretary-turned-minister said in geographic terms, these are the extended neighbourhood, including the Indian Ocean, South-east Asia, West Asia and Central Asia, having good relations with the big powers which shape the global order “so that we are treated well and our interests are recognised and advanced”, and steadily developing a larger footprint through more relationships in order to have global visibility. NATIONAL SECURITY TRUMPS ALLIn terms of issues, Jaishankar put national security above diplomacy concerns, as the stakes are very high. He contended that the country had “sometimes got confused” on these issues, such as during the 1960s, when the leadership didn’t put the necessary emphasis on security. He listed the two other priorities in terms of issues as economic development and national progress, where India could learn from East and South-east Asia on using foreign policy to acquire capital and technology, and advancing the standing of the country. While speaking about the situation in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said UN Security Council resolution 2593 was an “expression of a widespread concern in the world on a set of issues, the most prominent of which was would Afghan soil be used by terrorists [and] foreign fighters to target other countries”. The resolution also addresses issues such as the nature of the regime in Kabul and whether it would be inclusive, and the nature of governance, including the treatment of women, children and minorities, and freedom of movement for Afghans. “I would say a lot of those concerns...remain live concerns,” Jaishankar said. The situation on the ground is complicated, and justifies the prudence that India has shown. India has not been in a hurry, it has been deliberative about choices and careful about assessments, while at the same time not being led by arguments made by others, he said. There is also consensus on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan about not “staying away or being indifferent or unhelpful”. He said the consensus is that “however difficult the politics of the situation may be...we have to do something [for the Afghan people]”. India has helped previous regimes in Afghanistan, and it has offered to send 50,000 tonnes of wheat for the Afghan people. The country is seeking unhindered access to Afghanistan and trying to find a way the relief supplies are distributed in a responsible and fair manner, he said, without referring to conditions attached by Pakistan for the shipment of the aid. QUAD A SIGN OF CHANGING TIMESJaishankar also indicated that the LAC standoff with China was not a “causal factor” for India’s participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which includes Australia, Japan and the US. He noted the Quad in its current incarnation started in September 2017, where the current difficulties on LAC began in 2020. It is important for India as a Quad participant “to be very clear that the Quad is for something, it is not against somebody”, he pointed out. Quad’s efforts are focused on issues such as Covid-19 vaccines, developing more trusted and secure technologies, promoting reliable and resilient supply chains, connectivity projects, and ensuring maritime security and safety. Since no single country can respond to the contemporary big challenges, groups of countries with similar interests and concerns were coming together, he said. In this context, he referred to India’s four-way cooperation with the United Arab Emirates, Israel and the US. These are “combos of countries” that are not interested in a formal relationship and wanting no “detailed obligations or responsibilities”. Instead, they want a practical arrangement to work together to their mutual advantage through “ad hoc, open minded, open ended and comfortable” mechanisms, Jaishankar said. Asked about India’s participation in The Summit of Democracy to be hosted by the US during December 9-10, Jaishankar said he is “very confident” about the state of Indian democracy since elections and the electoral process are not in doubt, popular participation in elections is rising, and all indexes of “how democratised India has become” are growing. “In a way, in the very success lies a problem because to a large extent it has brought to the political forefront a different set of players, people who are not from big cities or from English medium schools,” he said, adding many of these players are self-made and this has led to a “political argumentation between the old order and emerging order within the country”. “Because the world is globalised, the world is polarised and the world is very ideological, a lot of this translates into people being judgemental [and saying] your democracy is not working well, largely because it’s not about people like us anymore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2021-border-tension-reflects-on-ties-eam-on-china-101638470802986.html

It has now been in power for seven-and-a-half years. Given the PM’s emphasis on reforms, this offers an opportunity to review the NDA’s track record on economic reforms since 2019, and offer a comparative perspective with his first term.

It asserts that the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent constitute a nation, and Islam is antithetical to Hinduism. The creation of Bangladesh established that religion cannot be the principal — leave alone the only — ingredient of nationalism. Yet, 50 years after it lost its eastern part, Pakistan continues to stubbornly adhere to the two-nation theory in all its implications.
