12-12-2021||Mumbai||NCP: Sharad Pawar will unite Opposition; has key role in 2024 elections||Mumbai: On the 81st birthday of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, his party colleagues said that their octogenarian leader will lead from the front to put up a formidable alternative to incumbent dispensation at the Centre and that a “dramatic change” will follow the 2024 general elections. The party celebrated its leader’s birthday by holding a rally at Nehru Centre in Mumbai and party workers from various parts of the state attended the event digitally. Key leaders including Members of Parliament Praful Patel and Supriya Sule, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, and state ministers Bhujbal, Malik among others attended the rally. “Our party may small in size and cadre may be limited but the party workers believe in working for the downtrodden and backward classes. The party worker could not have a sound sleep if people from the unprivileged section of the society are distressed. The socio-political sphere of the society is changing and the party workers need to adapt it by keeping the ideology and philosophies of the reformists in mind,” Pawar said at Sunday’s rally. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said Pawar can repeat 2019’s “Maharashtra miracle” at the Centre, referring to the unlikely coalition that was formed following the assembly elections that year, which saw Shiv Sena part ways from its long-time ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Today, even larger parties and their leaders at the national level are looking at Pawar ‘saheb’ with hope. He has the ability to bring all of them (the Opposition parties) together. He can do a similar miracle at national level in 2024,” he said. “It is time to fight fearlessly against the injustice and oppression. A few parties (BJP) have been trying to bring the communal ideology in the country, but they will not succeed. People keep asking if there is an alternative to prime minister Narendra Modi? Pawar ‘saheb’ will take the lead in putting up the alternative. He will bring the Opposition parties with different mindsets together to take this battle forward. He will play the key role in it,” state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said. Maharashtra NCP chief Jayat Patil said that central agencies were misusing their power to target opponents. “Central agencies target the leaders from non-BJP parties if they deny going along with the ruling party. The leaders from the non-BJP parties are targeted. Anil Deshmukh was raided seven times by Central Bureau of Investigation. Even family members are not spared. Everybody, even the citizens at village level know how the Enforcement Directorate works,” he said. Bhujbal said that the BJP was misleading people saying that NCP and the government are responsible for quashing of OBC reservation. He Pawar had initiated OBC reservation in the 1990s. MP Amol Kolhe said that the people of Maharashtra want Pawar to become the prime minister of the country. “If a leader from Gujarat, which has 26 MPs, can become the PM, why can’t a leader from Maharashtra with 48 Lok Sabha seats occupy the top seat of the country?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-sharad-pawar-will-unite-opposition-has-key-role-in-2024-elections-101639333626522.html
12-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to set up helpline for waste segregation complaints||Mumbai To improve waste management further by addressing the issues related to segregation faced by the societies, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned to launch an official helpline for Mumbaikars. The BMC has been appealing to housing societies and various residential associations to segregate their own waste. Earlier this year, the BMC had also announced various tax rebates for the residential associations that would segregate and compost their own waste. However, the civic officials have said that local residents often complain that even though they segregate their wastes, the garbage collectors appointed by BMC mix them up. Dr Sangeeta Hasnale, deputy municipal commissioner (SWM), has said that in order to tackle the increasing complaints, a toll-free helpline will be started by the civic body. “After a complaint is registered, officials of the SWM department will visit the society or the neighbourhood and investigate the issue. If garbage collection for that particular day is completed, then the officials will visit the spot on the very next day and will monitor the collection for the next seven days at least,” said Hasnale. She said that the helpline will be ready this month and the numbers will be circulated at the ward level. According to the SWM department, Mumbai generates around 6,000 metric tonnes (MT) of waste regularly, out of which around 3,500 MT is wet waste, while the remaining amount comprises solid and hazardous waste. Hasnale said that housing societies that generate more than 100kg of waste per day and spread over an area of 20,000 square metres have to compulsorily segregate the daily generated today, as per the BMC norms. She also maintained that segregating the waste cuts down the overall volume that is being sent to the treatment facilities on a regular basis. “The staffers appointed to collect garbage regularly are experienced and trained. With the help of this hotline, the senior officials will be able to reach out to the garbage collectors and show them the right way,” Hasnale said. Dhaval Shah, Andheri resident and founder of Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizen’s Association (LOCA), said that the idea of starting a hotline is good, however, the BMC should monitor the calls centrally. “We get complaints regularly about garbage not being handled or collected properly by the SWM workers. The issue of garbage is growing with time and the area of treating them has also become less,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-set-up-helpline-for-waste-segregation-complaints-101639333332172.html
12-12-2021||Lucknow||Masses with the BSP, claims SC Mishra||Agra : National general secretary of Bahujan Samaj Party Satish Chandra Mishra said here on Sunday that the BSP represented all sections of society and thus the masses had decided to support it in the forthcoming UP assembly elections . Mishra was addressing division level party workers meet in the rural belt here. He was accompanied by his son Kapil Mishra who also addressed the gathering. BSP leaders welcomed those who joined the party during the meet, including trader leader Murari Lal Goyal who left the Congress. “Agra has its own importance for us and is a sort of capital for the Bahujan Samaj Party with such a large base of party supporters. The scenario is changing in UP and paving the way for a BSP government,” said Mishra who claimed the BSP was a party of all sections of society and thought about the welfare of all. “There is no difference between the SP and the BJP. Farmers are in difficulties and unemployment and crime graph are rising. Dalits and Brahmins are being targeted. Jobs in the government sector are not coming forth, establishments under the government control are being privatized and the government plans to end the reservation allowed for weaker sections of society,” he alleged. “The state government is not allowing the masses to raise their voice and Brahmins are facing encounters under the present rule. The oppressed masses are looking towards the BSP and will vote for the party in the 2022 UP elections,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/masses-with-the-bsp-claims-sc-mishra-101639333325237.html
12-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG to get its new ‘green building’ in two years||The new Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) office in Gurugram Sector 14 is being built with a focus on water and energy conservation and zero wastewater discharge as per the Haryana Building Code of 2017, said officials on Sunday.The “five-star rated green building complex” will regenerate electricity through a grid-connected rooftop solar photovoltaic — converting solar energy into electricity with the help of basic semiconductor materials such as silicon — system to meet its power requirements, they said. A green building means to apply green technologies to a building throughout its life cycle, i.e, from construction to operation to demolition, so that the negative environmental impact of buildings can be minimised as far as possible.Officials said a state-of-the-art building automation system will be installed with energy performance monitoring, measurement and consumption, to ensure that the usage of energy is either rationed or kept at moderate levels through the monitoring data on battery management system (BMS) and smart meters.MCG employees, common people and pedestrians will have separate access points to the building, and a high security and monitoring system will be adopted to ensure a constant supervision on all entry and exit points besides the corridors and rooms inside the building, the officials added.“The 11-storey building is estimated to cost ₹117 crore, and there are provisions for three basement floors with a cumulative parking capacity of 466 vehicles,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO) of MCG.The green building will house offices for the three mayors, and a town hall for MCG house meetings with a seating capacity of 125 people. “This project will set exemplary benchmarks in government buildings across the city, through reducing energy consumption, thereby reducing carbon footprint and saving natural resources. The proposal of the new MCG office was put up in the first in-house meeting after the 2017 MCG elections. Both MCG officials and residents of Gurugram will be benefitted as the office is located in the centre of the city,” said mayor Madhu Azad.The green building will have four other meeting halls, waiting rooms for visitors, citizen facilitation centres (CFCs), a cafeteria, an exhibition space, a lodge for councillors, a library, an ATM and spaces for commercial shops. The new building will also have a dispensary, a crèche and a municipal auditorium with a seating capacity of 600 people. A provision has also been made for guest rooms, a gym and a dormitory for the staff in the building.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar laid the foundation stone for the new MCG office building on Friday, near Vyapar Sadan on the Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road. The construction of the new MCG office will take nearly two years, said the officials.MCG has been operating from its old office in Gurugram Sector 34, located in the outskirts of the city, near Hero Honda Chowk since February 2015. The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) gave the office building to the MCG on rent for ₹20 lakh per month.
12-12-2021||Lucknow||‘18 irrigation projects completed under Yogi’||Lucknow: Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh said here on Sunday that under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the Uttar Pradesh government had completed and operationalized 18 irrigation projects, benefiting more than 50 lakh farmers. Addressing a press conference, Singh said nearly 18 projects, including the Saryu Canal National Project, Arjun Sahayak Canal Project and Bansagar Project that were pending for years had been completed and made operational in the past four and a half years of the BJP government. The projects would facilitate the irrigation of an additional 20 lakh hectares of land, benefiting more than 50 lakh farmers of the state, he said. Singh slammed Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav over his tweet in which Yadav claimed that three-fourth work of the Saryu Canal National Project was completed under the SP rule whereas the BJP government took four and half years to complete the remaining project. Prime Minister, Narendra Modi inaugurated the Saryu Canal National Project in a programme organized at Balrampur on Saturday. Addressing a public meeting, Modi blamed the previous governments for delaying the canal project and wasting public money. Singh said the Saryu Canal Project was envisaged in 1971-72, while the work started on it in 1978. Initially the project was launched in 1978 to expand irrigation capacity in Bahraich and Gonda districts. In 1982-83, the scope of the project was expanded with the inclusion of nine districts of east UP. It was renamed the Saryu Project. The previous governments neglected the irrigation project, which would have solved many problems of farmers decades ago. The governments did not even bother to allocate sufficient funds for the project so that it could be completed on time. After assuming office in 2017, the Yogi government provided sufficient funds and expedited work on the project, he said. “ ₹5,189 crore was spent on this project from 1978 to 2017, whereas from 2017 till now ₹4,613 crore has been spent by the government. Over 14.50 lakh hectares of land can be irrigated by this project, which will benefit about 30 lakh farmers,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/18-irrigation-projects-completed-under-yogi-101639332845254.html
12-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi launches free food distribution campaign for 150 million beneficiaries||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday launched a statewide mega campaign for free food distribution twice a month to 15 crore (150 million) beneficiaries through the public distribution network of 80,000 shops. The launch comes about two months before assembly elections in the state. He also distributed free food packets to some beneficiaries immediately after launching the scheme in the presence of law minister Brajesh Pathak, other party leaders and government officials.The scheme will continue till Holi in March. Under it, the beneficiaries will also get packed one kg of pulses, a litre of edible oil, one kg of salt, all once every month, apart from five kg of wheat/rice per unit (family member) per month.The Antyodaya ration card holders (poorest of the poor families) will also have one kg of sugar, too, in addition to 35 kg of wheat/rice per card/family per month. The CM said the free food distribution scheme was started during the second wave of Covid-19.“This is the success of the double-engine government that the BJP government did not let any poor sleep hungry even during the difficult times of pandemic,” he said.Attacking the previous governments of other parties, he said prior to 2017 food distributed through the PDS network was beyond the reach of the poor because of corruption and the lack of a transparent system.“We decided to make the food distribution system transparent after we came to power in 2017 and today beneficiaries get their due without any difficulty,” he said.The CM further said that UP’s pandemic management had been the best with the result that Covid had disappeared from the state that had a population of 25 crore.“But you must not lower your guard,” the chief minister hastened to caution and exhorted people to get vaccinated without any loss of time.The free food distribution for four months, according to a senior government official, will cost the state government exchequer around ₹4800 crore. Beneficiaries are entitled to wheat/rice for nominal charges ( ₹3 per kg rice and ₹2 per kg wheat) at the beginning of every month under the National Food Security Act. “The government has decided to bear the charges for the normal distribution too for four months till March apart from deciding to make another free distribution of food plus pulses, edible oil, salt and sugar in the middle of every month,” he said. At the end of November, the Central government extended the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY-Phase-V) by another four months from December 2021 to March 2022.The first phase of the scheme was launched from April to June 2020. It ensures 5kg of wheat/rice free of cost per member per priority household per month and 35 kg wheat rice to each Antyoday family per month. Beneficiaries need to be covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Till now, beneficiaries in UP were getting free ration under the PMGKAY in the middle of every month after they received highly subsidized wheat/rice at the beginning of every month under the regular scheme under the NFSA. The state government decided to bear the cost for the regular distribution too making wheat/rice available to beneficiaries free of cost apart from distributing pulses, edible oil, sugar and salt all free once a month from December 2021 to March 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-launches-free-food-distribution-campaign-for-150-million-beneficiaries-101639332843568.html

12-12-2021||Lucknow||Mercury plummets as cold wave grips Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: The minimum temperature in the state capital dropped below the 10-degree Celsius mark for the first time this winter, as cold wave gripped most parts of the state on Sunday. The minimum temperature in Lucknow was recorded at 8.4 degrees Celsius which was one degree below normal. The temperature reflected a drop of 5 degrees this week. “Cold winds moving in the state from west to east are the primary reason for the marked drop in temperatures across UP this week. The minimum temperature is expected to drop further by around three degrees in the coming days,” said JP Gupta, director of Uttar Pradesh Met Department. As per the forecast issued by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature across UP is expected to drop by three degrees by next week. Lucknow, as per the forecast, will experience minimum temperature of 8 degrees Celsius on Monday. The drop in temperature will be accompanied by a cold breeze. “A low-pressure atmospheric zone has developed over central and west UP which is responsible for drop in temperature. The low-pressure zone will subside gradually over the next week,” said Gupta. The MeT department has also warned of heavy fog across the state during morning hours. The state Met department has also alerted district authorities about the adverse weather conditions, suggesting to them to make appropriate arrangements to fight the cold. The minimum temperatures in other important cities across UP also plunged on Sunday. While Meerut recorded a minimum temperature of 5 degrees Celsius, the mercury dropped to 7.9 and 7.4 degrees Celsius in Varanasi and Kanpur respectively. The Taj city recorded a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees Celsius while it was 10.4 degrees Celsius in Gorakhpur. Though the cold wave is expected to affect daily life in the state, according to farm experts it will benefit the farmers by accelerating seed formation in Rabi crops like wheat, mustard and peas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mercury-plummets-as-cold-wave-grips-uttar-pradesh-101639331771136.html
12-12-2021||Pune||Funds allocated, work incomplete: How BJP’s PMC is missing the mark||PUNE In the past five years, the Centre has approved various projects for Pune with money also being allocated. However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has failed to execute some of them, as a result the allocated funds likely to be taken back and released at a later date, as work commences. The civic administration and the local leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), despite a clear mandate in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), has not been able to execute some of the most ambitious projects, cue the river rejuvenation project, Katraj-Kondhwa road widening, Chandni chowk multilevel flyover, and Railway overbridge at Ghorpadi. All these projects were announced by the BJP’s top leadership, while some of them were even funded by the central government. However in most cases, work is moving at a snail’s pace while in some cases, projects are yet to begin. Earlier on Friday, a month’s deadline was set for the civic body to complete all technical formalities and issue a work order for the Mula-Mutha river pollution abetment project. Earlier in 2016, Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) local unit had felicitated former minister Prakash Javadekar at the Balgandharva auditorium for approving funds for river rejuvenation, which is co-funded by the Japan International Co-operation Agency (Jica). As per the project’s timeline, it has to be completed before January 31, 2022. Though just one month remains for the deadline, work on the ground is at tender level only. Under the Jica project, the civic body proposes to construct 11 new STPs across the city to reduce the pollution of Mula-Mutha river. The project will create an additional sewage treatment capacity of 396 million litres per day (MLD) over the existing 477 MLD, laying of 113.6 km of sewer lines and renovation/rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations. Reacting to the month’s deadline, Pune Member of Parliament Girish Bapat, who on Friday attended meeting with Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to discuss various issues, blamed civic administration for delay. “Because PMC administration has not worked actively on river rejuvenation project, there has been delay. Many things were just on paper. We are now reviewing everything,” said Bapat. In the case of the multilevel flyover, work was inaugurated by Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The first two years, work did not start due to land acquisition issues even as Gadkari held many review meetings. Now work is in progress even as it is running late against its timeline. Jagdish Mulik, BJP city unit president, said, “As promised to citizens, we would like to definitely complete all these projects. There are land acquisition issues at Chandani chowk and Katraj-Kondwa road projects. Work at Chandni Chowk is in progress and within a year, it will be complete.” In the case of the Railway overbridges at Ghorpadi and Mundhwa, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar carried out ground breaking. More than six years have completed but the work is still incomplete. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Smart City mission from Pune and many projects were planned, though hardly a few have been completed. The 24x7 equitable water project which was part of the Smart City mission is also going ahead at a very slow pace. In case of the Katraj-Kondhwa road widening, the foundation stone was laid by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Prashant Jagtap, NCP’s city unit president said, “It is an irony that despite having a clear mandate local leadership of BJP has failed to execute the projects which were launched by their own top leaders. Local leadership has embarrassed their top leaders by keeping projects incomplete.” Congress leader Mohan Joshi said, “The BJP has stopped speaking about Smart City and other projects at state and national level as most have not moved further. They need to run to Delhi to save the same projects, which otherwise will be derailed if the money is returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/funds-allocated-work-incomplete-how-bjp-s-pmc-is-missing-the-mark-101639331769794.html
12-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to re-invite fresh tender for Malad STP||Mumbai The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will float fresh tenders for setting up a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Malad in the western suburbs after it failed to attract the response to the tender floated last time. Earlier in 2020, the BMC had floated tenders for awarding contracts to upgrade and construct new STPs at Worli, Dharavi, Bandra, Versova, Malad and Bhandup. However, the contractors submitted their bids for all the STPs other than the one in Malad.The Malad STP will be constructed on 35 hectares of marshy land with mangrove patches. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects), said that the bidders didn’t show interest earlier because carrying out construction on marshy lands is a complicated process and that the contractors may require high-end amphibious machinery for doing the job. He also said that before setting up the plant, a portion of the land needs to be filled and reclaimed.Velrasu said that the new tender will contain fresh clauses. The new clauses state that instead of paying them for the overall project, the payments will be made on the basis of the targets that they have achieved.“We will mention the exact work that needs to be done step-by-step for the construction of the STP. The payments will be made on the basis of the target of the task completed. Like after the bidder completes reclamation, he will get his payment for that, after the area is cleared of mangroves will get paid for clearing the trees,” Velrasu said. He added that the Mangroves cell has already given permission to the BMC for setting up this sewage plant and the trees that will be cut will be replanted at the forest lands in Thane.He added that the proposed STP will be called an Influent Treatment Station (ITS), which will be an upgraded version of the existing STPs in the city. Besides treating sewage water, the STP will have a capacity to recycle 400 MLDs of water every day, which may be used for various non-potable purposes.Velrasu explained that the treated water will be discharged into the sea through an underwater tunnel. The BMC will be constructing two 4.6 km long tunnels that will connect the STP with the adjoining residential and commercial areas.“The overall cost would vary between ₹4,800- ₹5,200 crore and the contractor will be given the responsibility of regular maintenance for 15 years,” Velrasu said.The BMC has set a six-year target for constructing the Malad STP a year more than the other STPs, for which it has already floated tender and appointed contractors earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-re-invite-fresh-tender-for-malad-stp-101639331523640.html
12-12-2021||Pune||Aspirants grade MVA govt an ‘F’ for last minute cancellation of Mhada recruitment exam||PUNE As State housing minister Jitendra Awhad cancelled the scheduled Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) recruitment test exams at the eleventh hour, aspirants have expressed extreme disappointment and anger, as they were to appear for this examination on Sunday, December 12. The opposition too escalated its attack on the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for its overall handling of various exams, be MPSC, health or for MHADA. In all these cases, exams were cancelled with several discrepancies and in some cases papers were allegedly leaked, an embarrassment for the government. This time, the Pune cyber police have arrested three persons while three more suspects have been identified. These suspects, according to Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta, were about to leak the paper before exam started, forcing the government to defer the exam till January. The scheduled MHADA recruitment examination was going to be held at various centres across state with more than 275,000 candidates to appear for it on December 12, 15 19 and 20, for jobs under class A, B and C. There were 565 vacant posts in MHADA under various categories which included administration, accounts and survey departments. The application process for the recruitment had started in September 2021 for posts of executive engineer, architect, sub-engineer, administrative officer, assistant legal advisor, junior engineer, junior architect assistant, assistants, clerks, surveyor and several other posts. Speaking about the government’s “mismanagement” in handling the exam, leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, the health department recruitment scam leads to the state health department directorate office. Now, the same thing is being witnessed for the MHADA recruitment scam as the examination has been cancelled last movement. “This is the height of corruption, apathy and poor management. Despite this, the MVA government is not speaking up. For how long such things will be tolerated as lakhs of students have suffered due to this. If this government is not able to give jobs then at least don’t play with their emotions. Strict action should be taken on the culprits, but from the state government who is going to take responsibility,” Fadnavis said. Many while expressing anger said minister Awhad was enthusing confidence among candidates till the last moment, that there is nothing wrong with the exam process. However, he announced the “deferring” post-midnight, when candidates had reached major cities to appear for exam. Awhad at 1.54 am on Sunday posted a video of himself announcing that the exam has been deferred for some “unavoidable” reasons. “I apologise to all candidates and announce that due to unavoidable circumstances, examinations to be held on December 12 and on later dates have been deferred. These exam will now be held in January. I am posting the video so late in the night to appeal candidates not to step out and head for exam centres in the morning,” Awhad said. Earlier, in a similar way, the state health department recruitment examinations were scheduled on September 25 and 26. 2021. As the company conducting the exam could not make necessary arrangements and preparations in the time, students faced several technical issues with the hall tickets and examination centres. The exam was cancelled a day prior. Later, it was held on October 24 and 31. Santosh Karade an aspirant from Jalgaon who travelled to Pune to appear for the examination said, “It is so frustrating that at the last movement, a few hours before the examination we are told that exam is cancelled. I came to Pune early on Sunday morning by a private tourist bus for which I had to pay Rs1,000 ticket fare. And also I took two days leave from my current job to appear for this exam. In every recruitment examination there is some problem due to which lakhs of aspirants have to suffer mentally, physically and financially.” Another aspirant Mangala Padhye said, “This MVA government has completely failed in conducting the recruitment examinations and has lost trust of students. Due to Covid-19 pandemic already youth are depressed as there are no jobs, many of them were removed from work and now this paper leakage followed by cancellation of exam is adding to the frustration. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should realise the pain and anger of all these students and take strict action against the culprits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/aspirants-grade-mva-govt-an-f-for-last-minute-cancellation-of-mhada-recruitment-exam-101639331223686.html
12-12-2021||Pune||MHADA exam paper leak: Pune police arrest three, government cancels exam||PUNE: The state government on Sunday deferred recruitment exams for the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), following the arrest of three persons from Pune. The director of a software company that conducts examinations for MHADA is among the three arrested, for their alleged role in leaking the question paper for the recruitment examination that was to be held at multiple locations in Maharashtra, starting Sunday. The MHADA recruitment examination was to be held at various centres across state with more than 275,000 candidates were to appear for jobs under classes ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’. The government had outsourced work of conducting examination to a private firm, whose director along with two others have been arrested by the police. Based on information received during the investigation into the recruitment exam question paper leaking out, Pune police formed multiple teams that went to Pune, Thane, Jalna, Beed, and Aurangabad. A team of police officials in Thane and Pune intercepted a Hyundai Creta car in Vishrantwadi and found three people identified as Santosh Harkal, Ankush Harkal, and Dr Pritish Deshmukh in it. The car was registered in the name of Santosh Harkal in Aurangabad. The three were represented by Advocate Vijaysinh Thombre, Digvijay Thombre, and Hitesh Sonar in court, where they were remanded to police custody till December 18. Dr Deshmukh, director of GS Solution Technologies company, was tasked with conducting MHADA exams that were scheduled for December 12, 15, 19, and 20. Police officials said the company was to handle 14 sets of question papers in three groups each. On the laptop and pen-drive seized from the three, exam-related documents were found, according to Amitabh Gupta, Commissioner of Pune police. The police had received information about possible leak of the MHADA paper during the investigation of the health department paper leak case registered at cyber police station in November. Upon receiving information, the Pune police formed multiple teams and started chasing two groups of people for possible MHADA leak. Two clusters of examinations for high-level posts including executive, assistants, deputy, and junior engineers among others were to be held on Sunday - one in the morning and one in the evening - according to the police. Simultaneously, second team intercepted and arrested three people identified as Ajay Chavan of Target Career Point class, Krushna Jadhav and Ankit Chankhore of Saksham Academy. They were found in possession of documents of three aspirants of MHADA examination. However, in addition to those documents, they were also found in possession of documents belonging to 16 aspirants of health department group C and 35 aspirants of group D examinations.

Goyal remarked that ‘the start-up ecosystem in the country will flourish only with the least amount of government interference.’Goyal was speaking at a function organised by the Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Park (STEP) at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). He also interacted with several start-up founders and entrepreneurs during the open showcase by product-based start-ups from Pune. Dr Rajendra Jagdale, director general and CEO of STEP; Dr Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor of SPPU; Shruti Singh, joint secretary, DPIIT were present on the occasion.Addressing the start-up ecosystem stakeholders from Pune, Goyal said, “Nationalisation has stymied the growth of several sectors like banking as seen in the past. If we allow entrepreneurs to flourish, with least amount of government interference, they can scale in their operation and come up with affordable and cost-effective solutions. We are giving several incentives to start-ups and we can keep adding as much as we want. But at the end of the day, I personally feel that the less the government interferes in the start-up ecosystem, the more potential it will have to be successful.”“Clutches will only help in the short term. If we really want this start-up ecosystem to survive and go to great lengths, then we will have to let it work on its own. I think none of the unicorns may have got any reservation in government procurement or none would have taken government support to become unicorns. Government can only play a limited role and work in a partnership model where the government can be a facilitator while the success and architecture of the ecosystem will be defined by entrepreneurs,” Goyal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/less-govt-interference-will-make-start-up-ecosystem-grow-piyush-goyal-101639330204037.html
12-12-2021||Lucknow||End e-KYC provision for PM KISAN beneficiaries: CPI demands Centre||Taking exception to introduction of e-KYC provision for beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM KISAN) scheme, the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Sunday demanded the Centre to immediately withdraw this “diktat” and also pay remaining instalments to the beneficiaries who were yet to get all of them.CPI state secretary Girish (who goes by his first name only) alleged that the central and the state governments often put such conditions as it became very difficult for beneficiaries to avail themselves of welfare schemes and the introduction of the e-KYC provision, he added, was the latest example. He said that though the government had released nine instalments under the scheme so far but a number of farmers had received none or received only one or two instalments. “Now, when the government is going to release the 10th instalment on December 15, a new hurdle has been created by requiring beneficiaries to get e-KYC of their bank accounts done,” he said.Girish said 99% farmers were not tech-savvy and they would find compelled to do rounds of common service centres to get e-KYC done and waste time and money in the process. “The government must withdraw this provision in the interest of farmers,” he demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/end-e-kyc-provision-for-pm-kisan-beneficiaries-cpi-demands-centre-101639329843188.html

The administration has roped in research institutes to study the difference between these two varieties of mangoes and prove the uniqueness of Shivneri Alphonso in order to get the geographical indication (GI) status for the same. Funds of ₹26 lakhs from district planning committee have been allotted for this project.“The Alphonso mango producers in Junnar have claimed that the taste and quality of this mango is different from the ones which come from Konkan. This year funds have been made available through the district planning committee to get the geographical indication. The process is going on. The chemical tests on Konkan Hapus and Shivneri hapus are being conducted. We appointed Krishi Vigyan Kendra Narayangaon as a middle agency to create a proposal for the GI status,” said Dnyaneshwar Bote, district agriculture officer Pune.Mango producers from Junnar and Ambegaon have come together to get the GI tag for this fruit. According to them GI is essential as it creates a brand and ensures quality for the consumers. “Shivneri Alphonso has been going to Washi market. It is very popular there and it has been exported as well. We want a GI tag because it creates a brand,” said Ravindra Kajale, a farmer from Junnar.Alphonso mango from Ratnagiri has already been given the GI status. Now to get the GI tag for Shivneri Alphonso difference between these two mangoes has to be proven. “We have registered farmers producers’ organisations with four groups from Ambegaon and seven groups from Junnar. For GI status, application has to be submitted . It should have information such as what is the difference between Konkan Alphonso and Shivneri Alphonso, what are the feedbacks from consumers and what are the opinions of the traders,” said Bote.Explaining the difference, Nitin Kale who owns a farm of Shivneri Alphonso in Junnar said, “The main difference is that when the season of Konkan Alphonso comes to an end, our fruits come to market. So usually, the rate of Shivneri Alphonso is higher. There is a difference between aroma and the taste. The soil is also different so naturally the two fruits will have different characteristics. Mangoes from my farm have been exported to Japan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/junnars-shivneri-alphonso-in-race-to-get-gi-tag-101639329787273.html
12-12-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh hits back at PM’s ‘red cap’ remark||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent “red cap” remark and said the issue was not the colour of the cap but how the BJP tackled inflation, unemployment and hunger. Addressing a press conference at the SP state headquarters, he said, “The question is not of the colour of the cap but whether the BJP wants to address inflation, unemployment and hunger issues. When will the government with a double engine make the road connecting Uttar Pradesh with Nepal?” In a veiled attack on the SP, PM Modi on Tuesday termed those with “red caps” as red alert for Uttar Pradesh and said that they wanted to form the government in the state to show mercy to terrorists and set them free.“Today, the entire Uttar Pradesh knows well that those with red caps have been concerned with the red beacon not with your miseries. Red cap people need power for scams to fill their coffers, for illegal occupations and to give a free hand to the mafia,” PM Modi had said while addressing an event in Balrampur. Red cap is one of the two colours in the Samajwadi Party flag and the party workers and leaders often wear red caps. Akhilesh addressed the press conference after several leaders from different parties, including BSP leaders and one BJP MLA, joined his party.Slamming the UP government, Akhilesh said, “Today BJP wants to rule by intimidating and killing people like the British did. In the coming times, the public will work to teach a lesson to the BJP. Nowadays, the CM is giving advertisements for distributing tablets, smart phones in newspapers. Which tablet (he meant pills) were you (BJP government) giving to public for four-and-a-half years?” “This is a discriminatory government. When the Ambedkarites and the socialists sit together, the BJP is sure to be eliminated from Uttar Pradesh. There are many such incidents in UP that are questionable,” the SP chief said. Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to go to assembly polls in 2022. In the 2017 UP assembly election, the Bharatiya Janata Party bagged 312 seats in the 403-seat UP Assembly while Samajwadi Party (SP) bagged 47 seats, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 19 and Congress could manage to win only seven seats. The rest of the seats were bagged by other candidates.

The students argue they are not against exam but want university to make it hybrid (both offline and online) so that students may have the choice.“AKTU wants to hold offline exam despite knowing that Omicron is increasing these days. On the other hand, all other universities are holding their exams online. Parents are worried about their children,” reads a tweet sent out by one Ravi with #aktuOnlineExam. Students even cited MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan’s December 6 tweet in which he said exam at the Rajiv Gandhi Technological University be held online for convenience of students.A student asked why AKTU could not provide the option for both online and offline exams: “When other state’s university (MP) can do the same for students residing in villages, the same can be done here too. There is still time. Please think you are playing with mental health!”In another tweet, tagging the university, another student said, “Please help AKTU students. The university is taking exams in offline mode. It is difficult for many students to reach their centres and write exams. We are demanding for blended mode (online & offline) both so students have an option to decide.”When contacted, AKTU vice chancellor prof Vineet Kansal said the university was keeping a watch on the situation. “Given the present situation, exam will be held offline and students must prepare for it. More than two lakh candidates are to appear in December exam,” he said. Technical education secretary Alok Kumar said they were watching the situation and instead of the online campaign, the students must concentrate on studies.

I would also want my properties to be assessed,” he said while talking to a Hindi news channel. The former Gopalganj MP has been seemingly annoyed over his nephew and leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s decision to have an inter-caste marriage. Reacting to the indirect attack against him by Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav and second daughter Rohini Archarya, the former Gopalganj MP also lashed out at the RJD chief, “Laluji should refrain his children from making offensive statements against me. Or else, I will expose them all,” Yadav said. On Saturday, Tej Pratap and Rohini Archarya in Twitter posts took oblique potshots at their maternal uncle. Rohini, in a tweet, indirectly described the former Gopalganj MP as “Kansa” (maternal uncle of Lord Krishna known for his misdeeds in mythology) stating that Kansa are existing even today. Tej Pratap too indirectly attacked Yadav saying he would take him on once he arrives in Patna. The former Gopalganj MP, in his interaction with newsmen, also lashed out at the RJD chief alleging the latter ignored his in-laws and defamed them despite them having supported him. Asked whether his outburst against his sister’s family was because he was not invited to Tejashwi’s wedding, Yadav denied it. “I am hurt because the wedding took place in a hush-hush manner,” he said. Meanwhile, the ruling JD(U) has not reacted to the outbursts of Yadav against Lalu’s family. “We will not comment on it as it is a family matter. We have nothing to say,” said JD(U)’s senior leader Ajay Alok. Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma too said he would not comment on it..

12-12-2021||Patna||Nitish govt writes to NITI Aayog, seeks spl status for Bihar||The Nitish Kumar government in Bihar has made a fresh pitch for grant of special category status to the state, a demand it has been making for the “past 10-12 years”.In a letter to NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar, Bijendra Yadav, the state minister for planning and implementation, asserted that Bihar “fulfilled all the criteria” set for grant of special status.The minister sought to join the issue with NITI Aayog over its recent report on multidimensional poverty index in which Bihar was placed at the bottom in the country.The report was latched on to by the opposition which has been using it to rubbish the claim of “rapid development” of the state since Nitish Kumar’s ascent to power.In his letter, the minister admitted that Bihar stood way below the national average when it came to indicators like per capita income, ease of living and human development.Yadav blamed the state of affairs on “peculiar problems” of “landlocked” Bihar which had a high density of population with scarce natural resources and was plagued by vicissitudes like drought and flood that affected more than half of its districts.The minister also complained of “lack of initiative” on part of the Centre for setting up public sector units in Bihar which could give a fillip to “industrial growth and technical education” in the state.Besides, Bihar “remained deprived of the benefits of the Green Revolution”, the minister said, highlighting the suboptimal agricultural development in the state.Despite these limitations imposed by geography and history, the state had registered a “robust growth rate in the last decade and a half” and achieved “development with justice”, Yadav said. He also claimed that there are improvements in farming, power, roads and overall quality of governance.Pointing out that NITI Aayog has been set up with the aim of economic “transformation” of the country, Yadav stressed that the same cannot be accomplished without transforming Bihar.The grant of special category status will reduce the state’s liabilities with regard to welfare schemes and put the government in a position to dole out “tax rebates” and “financial subsidies” to attract private investment which could accelerate the growth engine further, the minister said. The demand for special category status gained currency after the creation of Jharkhand in 2000 which stripped Bihar of the area rich in mineral reserves.Kumar upped the ante when he famously proclaimed in 2009 that he would support “any government at the Centre” that agreed to the demand.

However, the officers will continue to perform election-related duties assigned to them.

Sidhu, who was interacting with people at a programme here, said that responsibility makes one better or bitter, and his experience after making three governments in the state has been bitter. “In this system, a good man is made a showpiece.

12-12-2021||Mumbai||Amid Omicron concerns, test positivity rate stays below 1% in Mumbai||Mumbai Although Mumbai has recorded five positive Omicron cases in the past week, the overall positivity rate is below 1%, with the daily caseload for the Covid-19 cases steady at less than 300 for the last four weeks. Meanwhile, officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday said that the situation is well under control. Dr Mangla Gomare, the executive health officer in the BMC, said that the daily positivity rate is below 1%, which means that the situation is satisfactory.“Regularly, more than a thousand samples are collected for RT-PCR tests from the Mumbai airport, out of which only five tested positive now. Most of them are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Not a single patient required oxygen support or ventilation, which clearly shows that the effects of this new variant have not been very intense,” Gomare told HT.She also added that the intensity of the spread is also not very high as labelled by international experts. “We were told that the rate of transmission of Omicron is very high compared to earlier variants. However, we have tracked all the close contacts and 99% of them were negative. While during the emergence of the delta variant earlier this year, the rate of transmission was much higher as there would be multiple cases in one family,” Gomare said.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid 19 task force in Maharashtra, said that the clinical outcome of the Omicron is mild. “Currently, Omicron in India including Maharashtra and Mumbai is sporadic and travel-related. There is no community transmission or cluster cases reported till now. Even in countries like South Africa, Denmark and the UK, which showed a spike in cases because of this variant, there has been a decline recently,” said Joshi.“Still, we have a long way to go before coming to any conclusion and keep adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Joshi.On Sunday, 187 fresh cases were reported in Mumbai and a total of 40,031 tests were conducted in the city. A total of two Covid deaths were reported on Sunday and the recovery rate stood at 97%.Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of the Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri East, where the Omicron positive patients are undergoing treatment, said that on Sunday, three out of the five patients were discharged from the hospital.“At present, we have two patients who have tested positive of Omicron variant undergoing treatment. Both of them have travel history from Tanzania and Nairobi. We are conducting RT-PCR tests of the positive patients after every 10 days, and if the report comes negative, we are discharging them with due care,” said Adsul. Furthermore, he added that so far 54 patients including the High-Risk-Contacts of the Omicron positive patients were admitted to Seven Hills for treatment as a precautionary measure.“More than 90 per cent of the close contacts tested negative and those who are positive have very mild symptoms. This is because most of them are vaccinated and younger in age,” Adsul said.Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital said that at present, there are two suspected Omicron patients admitted to his hospital. “One of the patients have no symptoms at all and another person lost the sense of smell. We have sent their samples for genome sequencing and the report for the same is expected to arrive on Monday or Tuesday,” said Bhansali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-omicron-concerns-test-positivity-rate-stays-below-1-in-mumbai-101639322822971.html

Worship and religious practices of people belonging to any religion will not be hindered. The bill is only to prevent religious conversions by inducements. There is no need for people to worry,” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader assured, speaking to media a day before the scheduled commencement of the winter session of the Karnataka legislative assembly.Also Read | Report blames Karnataka ‘government attitude’ for attacks on Christian communityThe legislation is likely to be introduced sometime during the winter session, which will conclude on December 24.Bommai, meanwhile, further said that religious conversion is ‘not good for society.’ He explained, “The poor and vulnerable should not fall for it. Conversions lead to problems within families and hence this bill is being considered.”The chief minister also gave examples of other states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where such laws have already been enacted.

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Dance of gender equality on the beats of Bhangra||I sat there completely mesmerised by what was unfolding in front of my eyes. But for the mask that I was wearing, my jaw would have almost dropped to the ground. The Bhangra performance on stage was simply out of this world. I had never imagined that my dream of cultural hermaphroditism would become a reality in my lifetime. Yet here I was seeing it unfold in front of my eyes, with utmost joy. Not only had the performers, a mixed team of boys and girls, set the stage afire with their scintillating performance, but they had also imparted a powerful message of gender equality. The occasion was the concluding day of the two-day celebration of the 51st Foundation Day of the Church of North India (CNI) in Amritsar, and the venue, the premises of St Paul’s Church. Almost two decades ago, a presentation of this sort would have been frowned upon by people, who deemed Bhangra an exclusive male domain. I very well remember the time when I had expressed a desire to join the Bhangra team of my co-ed college as a dancer, only to be told that girls in Punjab could only perform Giddha. My love for the dance still made me stick to the all-male Bhangra team of my college as a supporter. I contributed to their success by sponsoring their refreshments and suggesting novel dance moves that helped them win a global-level Bhangra competition that year. Yet it could never satiate my wish of showing the world the mettle I was made of as a Bhangra dancer. But I am extremely happy to acknowledge that two decades down the line, things have changed for the better and girls with an aptitude for Bhangra are getting chances to display their dancing abilities as is evident from the welcome development I had the chance of witnessing. Here the girls looked confident and the boys in their team unfazed, while their parents, mentors and the audience cheered them with gusto as they danced to the accompaniment of the pulsating Bhangra beats. The all-girl Bhangra teams that had performed earlier were equally captivating. “Dance is an expression of joy, which transcends every cultural, social and gender bias. I see no reason why women and girls cannot perform Bhangra, the lively dance of our vibrant Punjab, alongside men. Our Diocese is committed to the cause of doing its bit to promote gender parity in all walks of life in the state,” announced Dr PK Samantaroy, the bishop, Diocese of Amritsar, CNI, as he invited men, women and children to join the performers in the dance. Attired in traditional finery, these predominantly rustic youngsters had showed their urban audience that one primarily needs a positive outlook and resolute will to overcome social and gender-based prejudices. shaheen.parshad@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dance-of-gender-equality-on-the-beats-of-bhangra-101639311181356.html

He also gave a PowerPoint presentation on the collection of Asian artworks at the Italian museum.Anjani Kumar Singh, nodal officer and chairman of the advisory committee of the Bihar Museum, said, it would be great to co-host the exhibition with the Museum of Oriental Arts. “They want it in the near future when things would be clearer regarding Omicron, the new variant of Covid-19 and international flights in our country would resume operations,” he said.The Turin-based museum has over 2200 antiquities from countries like India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Tibet, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and China. These are divided into five sections. “The section dedicated to India has the artworks inspired by Hinduism and Buddhism from Kashmir, India and East Pakistan. The stonework, bronzes, pottery and paintings on cotton span a period from 2nd Century BC to 19th Century,” he said. The Indian art section has on display the works of Shunga age, Kushan art, Gupta and medieval Indian art form, he added. Singh said these artworks have been displayed in theme-based sections at the Italian museum. Deepak Anand, additional director, Bihar Museum, said that the exhibition proposed by the Museum of Oriental Arts would provide the people of Patna with an opportunity to witness the artworks of Indian origin being conserved at an Italian museum. “It might not be possible for many art lovers here to visit Italy to see these at the Turin museum but the exhibition will bring those artworks to their doorstep,” he said. Officials said the PowerPoint presentation over those collections at Bihar Museum was quite engrossing and equally impressive would be the exhibition proposed by the Museum of Oriental Arts.

The man, Panna Lal Mahto alias Ganjhu, is alleged to have trafficked more than 5000 people, the central agency said.Detailing the arrest, the ED further stated that Mahto was arrested from state capital Ranchi’s Birsa Munda central jail, adding that after the arrest, a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, on December 10, sent him to its custody for five days.“Mahto is a resident of Khunti district in Jharkhand, and was arrested by the state police in 2006 and 2015 for these alleged crimes. However, he managed to secure bail in all these cases,” the ED profiled him in a statement.“He had multiple cases registered against him in Khunti, Ranchi and Delhi under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for offences such as kidnapping, trafficking etc. He has networks spread across Delhi, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. In the national capital, Mahto had an agency under the name of Panna Lal Placement Agency,” the statement noted.The alleged human trafficker, said the Enforcement Directorate, was found to have amassed ‘huge property’ in Jharkhand, Delhi and other states from activities related to human trafficking. Some immovable properties, in the form of land in Ranchi and Khuntia, were acquired out of the proceeds of the crime, it claimed.The ED also accused Mahto of operating, along with his acquaintances, several bank accounts with a number of ‘high-value’ transactions. These transactions, it said, appear to have been acquired and transacted out of the proceeds of the crime.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ed-arrests-alleged-drug-trafficker-from-ranchi-in-money-laundering-case-101639305530377.html
12-12-2021||Pune||Your Space: Continue to create awareness to boost Covid vaccination coverage in Pune||Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has so far covered 431 villages under both the doses of Covid-19 vaccination and 955 villages are remaining to be inoculated for 100 per cent vaccination. With Omicron spread fear, readers share what steps the administration should take to ensure all take the vax jabMore efforts needed to achieve 100 per cent vaccination targetPune ZP has been taking various initiatives to drive vaccination in villages. ZP chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad and his team has been very proactive in planning and executing various initiatives in this regard. Gram panchayat members are also actively participating and driving vaccination. Maybe more efforts are required to educate and encourage people by fully vaccinating local leaders like sabhapati, sarpanch, ZP members etc in different gram panchayats.Dnyanendra HulsureSpread awareness to speed up vaccination coverageDespite the Pune Zilla Parishad’s effort to cover more than 431 villages under both the doses of Covid vaccination, I think survey and awareness at the doorstep of villages will enable the collection of data and will encourage people to take the vaccine. They should get the NGOs involved in voluntary work to cover more areas and get better reach.Tejaswini SawaiArrange vax camps at residential societiesWe would like to thank the Zilla Parishad for arranging vaccination camps at housing societies. More such camps should be undertaken which will help to fill the gap, additionally, they should also conduct camps near markets, schools and other crowded areas.Anshul Gupta‘Vaccine on wheels’ can boost driveFor mass coverage, ‘vaccine on wheels’ should be introduced in residential areas. Much like a food truck that is equipped to cook and serve, a specially designed vehicle for vaccination purposes should be used. There should be an audio message that should be played in the local language to encourage all villagers. Government can launch additional benefit schemes like distributing blankets or grains or something to encourage villagers further. A target should be given to the local panchayat and should be tracked by the collector every week.Shailendra BirthareRaise awarenessI personally feel that whoever is keen to get vaccinated voluntarily has been vaccinated. However, I have observed that there is still reluctance in the rural areas due to misguided misinformation. There is an urgent need for awareness and counselling to achieve a 100 per cent vaccination target.Kiran VadgamaMake vaccination compulsoryIt is good to know that Pune Zilla Parishad has covered 431 villages under both the doses of Covid-19 vaccination, but like Puducherry the local administration can make vaccination compulsory. The vaccination data can be checked through the database and then the door-to-door campaign should be organised. Local bodies should arrange vaccination drives at school grounds and classrooms on Sundays or weekends and well-managed vaccination drives can be arranged.Sachin KhandelwalConduct door-to-door vax driveThe administration should undertake door-to-door vaccination drives. Aasha workers, school teachers should identify people who are yet to take the jabs on a war footing. Local gram panchayats should get enough jabs according to the requirements.Vaibhav Mane||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-continue-to-create-awareness-to-boost-covid-vaccination-coverage-in-pune-101639305487138.html
12-12-2021||Jaipur||Govt wants to sell everything that Congress built to its friends: Priyanka Gandhi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday hit out at the Centre over growing inflation and said that the BJP-led government wants to sell everything that the Congress built over the last 70 years.Addressing the Mehangai Hatao Rally in Jaipur, the Congress General Secretary said, "When you elected them (BJP), you laid your trust in them that the country will progress. They used to say that Congress did not do anything in the past 70 years. But I want to ask them, what did you do in the last seven years? Show us one institution that you built for education, one AIIMS that you built for the healthcare system. The airport that you use to fly was also built by Congress. Today the government wants to sell everything that Congress made to its friends."Hitting out at the Centre over growing inflation, she said that the prices of eatables and fuel are sky-high but nobody listens to the common man."You are here today because an LPG cylinder costs around ₹1000, mustard oil costs around ₹200 per litre, petrol and diesel prices are sky-high, and no one is listening to the troubles being faced by the common man," she said.The Congress leader further alleged UP's Yogi Adityanath government is spending crores of rupees on advertisements but was not providing fertilizers to the farmers."Today's govt at the Centre is only about lies. This government is working for a few industrialists. The amount of money they spend on advertisements, why don't they give it to the farmers? The government in Uttar Pradesh is spending thousands of crores on advertisements. But the same government is unable to provide fertilizer to the farmers," Vadra said.Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were also present at the rally.Rajasthan Assembly polls are slated to be held in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/govt-wants-to-sell-everything-that-congress-built-to-its-friends-priyanka-gandhi-101639304172052.html

12-12-2021||Delhi||From veggies to compost, a cloth bag for all: Delhi-NCR NGOs chip in to reduce plastic footprint||Several attempts have been made to reduce the plastic pollution in the city. Yet, often shoppers end up demanding bags from the shopkeeper as they miss bringing one from their home. But, recently, when shoppers turned up at Green Park market, they were pleasantly surprised to see the option to rent cloth bags, to carry whatever they buy at the market. This experiment called Project Vikalp, is an initiative by an NGO, Why Waste Wednesdays, and allows people to rent a bag for a small fee. The best part is there’s no deadline to return, and whenever they wish to return, shoppers can give it back at the NGO’s counter at a different market as well. “We will soon start this facility in more markets in the city. People can deposit ₹20 and take the cloth bag to carry whatever they shop. And when they come back, whenever they wish to return the bag, a full refund is given to them,” says Ruby Makhija, founder of the NGO, adding, “We plan to generate a QR code soon, which will contain all the information about Vikalp alongside educating people about the ill-effects of single use plastic on the environment, solutions to curb it as well as the address of existing Vikalp stalls with GPS locations for their ease. To inform the shoppers visiting the market, we have put up a banner on our store and stickers on all the shops in the market, mentioning the address of the store.”This campaign got a structure, early this year, when the NGO started work along with South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), and its volunteers got cloth bags made out of upcycled cloth. Makhija adds: “We were successful to a great extent, but the problem was translating this awareness into practice. As a consumer, I could have three cloth bags at home and wouldn’t want to purchase another one. So we wanted to come up with a solution where it doesn’t pinch people’s pockets and they are also able to use the bag and return whenever they wish so. This is when we thought of the name and concept of Vikalp (which translates to ‘option’).”Also pitching in to save the city from the ill-effects of plastic is Delhi Greens. “We have come up with 100 ways of how Delhi citizens can minimise the use of plastic,” says Konsam Nirmala from the city-based non profit organisation, adding, “What tops in this list is the need to simply stop using plastic bags, and the solution to it is to reuse cloth bags. If you can’t find a cloth bag near you, write to us on our website and we will find one and send it to you! Toothbrush is another major example of plastic pollution, and we are arranging bamboo brushes that can be used as an alternative. We are also encouraging people to use pen refills instead of changing the entire pen since that too adds to plastic usage. Through WhatsApp groups and social media, we are reaching out to the masses and encouraging them to adopt at least five of the simple ways enlisted among the 100, and help bring a change in the environment.” Also creating awareness about the need to reduce plastic usage is Dwarka-based NGO, Rise Foundation. “We are asking people to carry cloth bags with them when they go out. And we are in talks with groups that make these bags, which can be distributed through drives,” says Madhukar Varshney, from the foundation. And a Gurugram-based citizens’ collective, Why Waste Your Waste, has started a similar movement to reduce plastic footprint and aims to soon move beyond it. “The compost produced from the kitchen waste at our compost plant is being sold to residents. This was earlier done in plastic bags but now we have replaced them with cloth ones,” informs Kavita Bansal, a core member of the group, adding, “The beautiful handmade bags were procured from an NGO that supports the underprivileged. When the residents return the cloth bags, after using the compost, they also get their refund. Soon we shall be pushing this initiative further as we have received requests from a lot of other communities, who want to take to the same thing. There are also people in our group who are distributing cloth bags, but the crises is so acute that such methods need to be re thought. There are some residents who are setting examples at individual, and even community level, by upcycling their old clothes into bags that are then used to carry vegetables, etc.”Besides this, Rise Foundation has also found a way to reuse plastic which we find at home. “We ask people to get PET bottles and fill it with MLP waste like chips, chocolate wrappers which they accumulate in their houses. They send it to our foundation then and we make eco bricks with the same. We, then, use these bricks to make benches etc in the park. We have made two of these in the green belt in Dwarka,” says Varshney.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-veggies-to-compost-a-cloth-bag-for-all-delhi-ncr-ngos-chip-in-to-reduce-plastic-footprint-101639302240160.html

12-12-2021||Patna||‘Crime in Bihar below many states’: Police headquarters||Bihar police headquarters has tried to dispel the perception of crime spurt in Bihar with statistics of the national crime record bureau (NCRB), which puts Bihar at the 25th spot in the country. “Statistics speak for themselves. Law and order remain the topmost priority of the state government and that gets reflected through the statistics of the Centre, not the state government. For police, every crime matters and we are trying our level best to ensure rule of law in the state. In case any no debt, there is prompt and decisive action,” said ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar.Against the average national rate of total cognizable crime per lakh, which is 487.8, it is 211.3 in Bihar, with much bigger states ahead of Bihar. The crime rate in Bihar in 2019 was recorded at 164.8 which witnessed a 5.1% decline in 2020 at 159.7. Even in the case of murders, the rate in Bihar was 2.6, slightly higher than the national average of 2.2, but it was still ranked 8th. In dacoity, the state ranks 11th with the rate same as the national average (0.2), while in robbery the national average is 1.8 and the state rate 1.6, placing it at 13th place in the country.According to the data provided by police headquarters on Saturday, in the first 11 months (January to November) of 2019, Bihar witnessed 353 dacoity cases while till November 2021 only 239 cases were registered this year. Similarly, in robbery cases, the state recorded 2399 cases in 2019 while 1694 cases were registered till November 2020. In murder cases, the state witnessed 2910 cases between January and November in 2019 but this year till November, only 2607 FIRs have been registered. Gangwar said that though every incident of crime was a matter of concern for the state, it would be wrong to project it as lawlessness. The murder ratio went down in the state since 2019 as 2.6, 2.6 and 2.3 respectively. In kidnapping for ransom, Bihar’s rate is 12th in the country. In the eleventh month of 2019, Bihar registered 42 cases while in 2021, only 34 cases were registered.Gangwar said that Bihar had a very high population density and as such any comparison with other states would not be appropriate. ”What is important is that police are active to nail the culprits,” he added.Law and order have always been a big issue in Bihar and it was one of the reasons that led to the installation of the Nitish government in 2020 and ‘rule of law’ became the buzzword to give Nitish-led NDA a clean sweep in 2010.Gangwar said that in the most sensitive crime against women, Bihar was ranked 29th in the state, while in heinous rape incidents, Bihar is at the bottom at the 31st place. In cases related to the SC/ST atrocities act, Bihar ranked third across the country with 44.5 ratio while the national ratio is said to be 25.0.“In many cases of kidnapping, police have detected instances of elopement or teenage issues or domestic violence. It is not always for a criminal purpose. Many instances of forcible marriage have also come to light,” he added.In the case of road robbery, as compared to 2005, the state witnessed a 38.8% decline in 2020. Till November 2020, at least 137 cases were registered while in 2005 Bihar police registered 224 cases. In cases of bank dacoity, police registered 12 cases in 2020 while in 2015, a total of 26 cases were lodged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/crime-in-bihar-way-below-many-states-police-headquarters-101639299900408.html
12-12-2021||Patna||ASI, 2 others killed in separate incidents in rural Patna||Two people, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) policeman and newly elected mukhia, were killed on Saturday while another was injured when unidentified criminals allegedly opened fire at them at Dhelwa Gosain locality falling under Barh police station of rural Patna, officials said. The incident occurred at around 11.45 pm when they were coming out from a wedding pandal after attending a function. The deceased was identified as ASI Rajesh Kumar Yadav, a native of Nawada district and currently posted at Pandarak police station of Barh sub-division, while the newly elected mukhia was identified as Priya Ranjan alias Gorelal Yadav, a resident of Gopkita village under Pandarak police station. Station house officer of Barh police station Sanjit Kumar Singh confirming the incident told HT that Gorelal won mukhia election from East Pandarak panchayat on November 26. He defeated a woman mukhia to a margin of 23 votes. She is the wife of a notorious Uday Pahelwan and her son Paplu is also a history-sheeter. According to the senior SP Upendra Kumar Sharma, Gorelal with his supporters reached the venue in his Scorpio from Gopkita village. The ASI is said to be accompanied by mukhia. “As soon as they came out from the Happy Marriage Hall to board their vehicle, two bike-borne assailants opened fire on them. Gorelal received two bullet injuries on his chest while the ASI also received bullet injuries on his left leg and back,” the SSP said, adding that both succumbed to their injuries on their way to Patna Medical College and Hospital. Sharma told that the slain mukhia was also facing criminal cases including the murder of LJP leader Brijnathi Singh. Preliminary investigation suggested that the reason behind the incident is said to be political rivalry. “Efforts to nab assailants who attacked them are on. Police also scanned CCTV footage near the spot to identify the criminals,” the SSP added. The third injured is identified as Lal Bahadur Ram who is undergoing treatment in the hospital. Eyewitnesses of the incident told that the assailants fired more than 15 rounds while fleeing from the spot taking advantage of the darkness. In another incident, armed criminals gunned down a newly elected ward member Sanjay Verma at Lodipur village under Naubatpur police station of rural Patna, officials said. Police said that Verma was elected from ward number 9 of Jamalpura panchayat. The incident took place when he returned home after attending a marriage function. Police said armed criminals shot him on his head from point-blank range and he died on the spot. City SP (West) Ashok Kumar Mishra said the reason behind the crime is yet to be ascertained. Police are investigating the matter.

12-12-2021||Mumbai||Reconsider excise duty reduction on imported products: Domestic liquor makers to Maharashtra||Domestic liquor makers have requested the Maharashtra government to reconsider its decision to reduce excise duty on imported products.The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) in a letter to the Maharashtra government has said reduction on excise duty on imported products has created an "unequal and unfair playing field" against Indian-made foreign liquor.The state government should encourage products made in India, which historically has been the main contributor to its revenues and economic prosperity, said a letter addressed to Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar."Excise duty reduction of such scale on imported products is disastrous for the Indian industry. It so distorts the level-playing field against the Indian industry, that consequences may be far-reaching leading to disinvestment, job losses and farmer discomfort," it said.In November, the Maharashtra government had announced to reduce the excise duty on imported liquors by half, which is from 300 per cent to 150 per cent on imported liquor. The move was done to bring its price at par with that in other states.According to CIABC, this reduction will make premium Indian malt whiskies such as Amrut and Paul John and other niche products unsaleable in Mumbai.The prices of these Indian made super-premium products used to be 80-90 per cent of comparable imported products earlier thus allowing them some competitive space."After this change, the prices of Indian made products will become 30-40 per cent higher than similar imported products," said the letter, written by CIABC Director-General Vinod Giri, adding it is evident that with that kind of price difference, Indian super-premium products will find it difficult to sell.Moreover, it also added the decision would also discourage investment in Maharashtra and lead to job losses."As the price difference with fully Indian made product narrows down significantly, most Indian products are likely to lose competitive ground to imported products. The result may be a widespread loss for the Indian industry.Moreover, the premise that such a duty reduction will prevent the smuggling of imported liquors from other states is "misplaced" as the prices of Maharashtra is actually lower than in Karnataka, the most prominent neighbouring state."With this excise duty reduction, the fear is that stock will be smuggled out of Maharashtra to other states, which may force those states also to reduce duty, thus creating a domino effect which will be disastrous for the Indian industry," CIABC said.The Indian alcoholic beverage industry contributes nearly ₹2.40 lakh crore in taxes to the exchequers of the state governments and an overwhelming 99 per cent of this is contributed by-products produced in India."Considering that we believe that the governments should take proactive measures to support domestic production instead of offering preferential treatment to imported products which do no such service to the society," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reconsider-excise-duty-reduction-on-imported-products-domestic-liquor-makers-to-maharashtra-101639287302202.html

A government spokesperson also said that the outsourcing agency has been issued a show-cause notice, asking why it shouldn’t be blacklisted and adding that a police case will be filed in the matter.The action came days after state water minister and DJB chairperson Satyendar Jain revised the utility’s water billing system, capping new bills at 1.5 times the amount of the previous month’s bill.“The director (revenue) is hereby directed to terminate the services of all such meter readers involved in such illegal activities. Further, a show-cause notice has been issued to the concerned outsourcing agency asking why action has not been taken against such fraudulent cases and why the government should not blacklist the company responsible for it... the revenue director has been directed to get an FIR lodged against such officials/meter readers for cheating and forgery under relevant sections...”According to a government statement, Jain said DJB is committed to working towards transparency.

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | In irises, do roses dwell||‘Goolab chasm’ or rose eyes or the light-eye ones was the vernacular name conferred upon hawks as opposed to ‘Siah chasm’ or the black-eyed ones bestowed upon falcons by the nobility of the sub-continent. The irises of the female northern goshawk, which alone was known as the ‘baaz’ or ‘shahbaaz’, changed from lemon yellow to an orange-red with age while the male goshawk or the ‘zurrah’ would sport blazing ruby eyes upon maturity. The sheer beauty of the shahbaaz’s eyes was deceptive for it was a raptor enjoying a reputation for uncommon strength, tenacity, suicidal courage and viciousness in pursuit of prey. The changing roses in her aging irises were as if these had been sourced directly from the writhing prey’s frothing blood.There are documented cases of large eagles such as the Bonelli’s bringing down fawns or even a large monitor lizard. In the bygone era, three to five Saker falcons would be set in a flying pack upon an Indian gazelle (chinkara) with the winged hunters not too infrequently impaled on the chinkara’s dagger-like horns. But it was upon the shahbaaz upon whom was lent the distinction of flooring an adult Chinkara all by herself; a mighty prowess that rendered her the esteemed bird of Mughal emperors, Sikh Gurus and Rajput rajahs.In his volume published in 1852, ‘Falconry In The Valley Of Indus’, the Victorian explorer, Sir Richard Burton, described the royal shahbaaz as one that could cost as “much as a (sum) fully equal to 200 pounds in England.” On a hunt with the Ameer of Sindh, Burton penned a vivid narrative of the shahbaaz killing a racing gazelle after braving the danger from dagger horns that repeatedly pierced her tail and thigh feathers.“She swooped upon its back, deeply scoring the delicate yellow coat as she passed by. Then she descended upon the gazelle’s head, deafening it with her clashing pinions, and blinding it with her raking talons. As the victim, losing strength and breath by excess of fear, could no longer use its weapons (horns) with the same dexterity, the boldness of the Shahbaaz increased. Then the Ameer’s dogs, who had become ferocious as wolves, gained sensibly upon their victim. But even before the dogs had fastened their fangs upon the gazelle’s quarters, the unhappy gazelle was stretched, panting and struggling with the Shahbaaz straining every nerve to pin its head to the ground,” wrote Burton.Blood eyes, lemon legsHawk-eyed visitors and walkers to the last pond at the Sukhna lake, where the regulator gates are situated, would have noticed blackish-white birds hunched at intervals in the bushes flanking the water. These birds seem virtually frozen in posture, like the nearby Buddha statue in the typically unquiet, Garden of Silence. Known as Black-crowned Night herons, these wetland birds are a resident species and some nest just a few hundred yards away on the tall trees that straddle the boundary of the UT Fish Seed Farm.Adult herons are distinctly coloured with unblinking, dark orange to blood-red irises, dull green legs/feet that morph to lemon, orange-red or pinkish red in the breeding season, a greenish-black back and a handsome black crest sporting a few white plumes. The crest stands momentarily erect when herons express emotions at their nesting or roosting places, such as territorial spats. Immature herons are brown, streaked and speckled with rufous, buff and dark brown. Herons are prone to feeding at night, setting upon flights to and from their feeding grounds with vocalisations of a raucous ‘kwaak’ call. This characteristic call confers upon herons the common vernacular name, Kwaak.The diet of herons comprises fish, frogs, aquatic insects, dragonfly larvae etc.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-in-irises-do-roses-dwell-101639262026250.html
12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | How I chanced upon my green thumb||The bountiful blossoms on our bottle gourd vine were, for us “fair pledges of the fruitful tree,” but to our great dismay this observation of Robert Herrick did not ring true for us as the plant bore no fruits. On consulting a specialist, it emerged that the flowers had failed to fulfil their purpose as they were all of the same sex: female. “Sir, as there are no male flowers, pollination has not taken place,” the expert said, drily. Despite knowing of all about pollination, it had not occurred to us that the heterogeneity of flowers could be responsible for the lack of fruit.The expert suggested sprinkling honey-mixed water on the flowers to attract bees and butterflies to facilitate pollination. We were amazed by the intricate ways of nature, and I silently thanked my better-half’s insistence for giving me front-row seats to the spectacle, and help me grow a new perspective. When and how it all happened, makes the story of the day.First, let me admit that I had never been in favour of growing greens at home. I had only seen vegetables being grown in the fields, and firmly believed it to be a tedious and taxing task to be undertaken by farmers alone. To me, the very idea of tilling and toiling, straining and stressing for brinjals, beans and beetroots was revolting.My wife, however, would always insist upon sparing space and sources to sow salad leaves and some seasonal vegetables. I was convinced that the reward cannot be worth the means. Her assertion that kitchen gardening is a reward in itself, and her argument that it is a purely aesthetic activity, failed to convince me. The long lockdowns, however, mellowed my disapproval as the need of the hour was to secure untouched vegetables. I, then, let my wife’s will prevail and within days the daisies and dahlias, pansies and petunias, which added to the aesthetic of our home were outnumbered by capsicums and cauliflowers, broccoli and beetroot, celery and lettuce.I came to love watching the rolled-up leaves unfurl, flowers forming, and then shaping themselves into a vegetable. My favourite, however, is discovering the cute cucumber concealing behind the leaves or a tiny turnip trying to pop up from the soil. Truly, one can only witness how life comes into being in a garden. To sow a seed, to tend it, to watch it grow, and then harvest it means an active participation in the mysteries of nature.Growing a gourmet of greens is far better than merely getting vegetables. In the garden, things follow their natural course –there are no shortcuts, or pulls or pressures at work. It is, indeed, a lesson in patience and perseverance, trust and positivity. It is like having faith in the future and believing in tomorrow. Let gardening be our teacher as Wordsworth says, “One impulse from a vernal wood may teach more than all the sages can.amritanand810@gmail.com(The writer is a Jagadhri-based retired associate professor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-how-i-chanced-upon-my-green-thumb-101639261843919.html
12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column| Bonds of love may trump those of blood||It was the start of the 2003-2004 academic year when Charu joined as an undergraduate in the arts programme at the Post Graduate Government College For Girls where I was serving as the political science associate professor since 1995. Within no time her caring nature and deeply entrenched family values brought her closer to me and she became an inseparable part of my family. She treated my only son as a younger brother, and my husband was like her father. One day, she said, “Ma’am, if you do not mind, may I address you as ‘mama’ and uncle as ‘papa’. Without a second thought, I hugged her saying, “By God’s grace we have been blessed with a grown-up daughter.” Sometimes strangers bond so intensely that the relationships last a long time, and petty considerations of caste, colour and religion cease to matter. Our relationship with my new daughter was the same, she was closer to us than a blood relation. We had always longed for a loving daughter, and she filled that void in our family. After graduating college, she joined Panjab University to pursue a master’s degree in French and later went to Paris on a year-long teaching assignment on a scholarship. On getting back to India, she served for several multi-national companies in New Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon as a French translator and interpreter on lucrative pay packages. Highly attached to our family, she always made it a point to visit us at our place for an hour or so on weekends. She came from a middle-class family, and her parents were always worried about her marriage. However, despite having a good job, finding a suitable match for her was proving to be a Herculean task. My husband and I would always tell her parents to not lose hope as marriages are predestined and God-willing one day we would find a perfect match for our daughter. Her mother’s sleepless nights and her father’s anxiety increased after proposal were rejected on frivolous grounds, which were beyond our comprehension. “Can your daughter be posted near Balachaur where our son is posted as a school teacher?” or “Can she move to Bhucho mandi, where the boy is working as a panchayat secretary” were the questions posed to us, knowing full well, that it would be next to impossible to get a job fitting her profile in these areas. Other suitors wanted to know her package, and whether her family lived in a rented accommodation or her own house. Finally, our ordeal of looking for a decent match for Charu came to an end in 2018 with a matrimonial proposal from Ludhiana. My husband and I, who had been frantically looking for a good match for her, were delighted and wished in hearts of hearts that this matrimonial alliance be fructified as the boy belonged to a respectable middle-class Punjabi family. Eventually, a meeting was arranged with the boy and his family at Ludhiana. Both boy and girl flew in from their respective working cities -- Bengaluru and New Delhi. The next day, the boy and his family reached the girl’s house at Zirakpur for an engagement ceremony. Suddenly, the boy’s father said they wanted an early and simple marriage and could it be held that very day? Hearing this, Charu’s father and mother were taken aback. Everyone started whispering and none dared to take a final call at the spur of moment. On the other side, the girl was not aware what was happening. Breaking the stoic silence, the suitor straightway asked Charu, “Should we hold the marriage ceremony today?” She immediately saidm “Let me talk to my family first.” We were absolutely perplexed. If we said ‘yes’, who was to say whether the quick marriage will turn out to be a good decision, and if we said ‘no’ would we able to find as good a match again. Happily married now, she has a one-and-half year-old son. The episode has reaffirmed my faith in Tom Mullen’s quote, “Happy marriages begin when we marry the ones we love and they blossom when we love the ones we marry”. jatinderwalia.lamba@gmail.com (The writer is the principal of Government College, Mohali)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-bonds-of-love-may-trump-those-of-blood-101639261663888.html
12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Greatness comes to those who think big||As legend goes, a well-known palm reader once told a young boy that he had missed greatness by a fraction, as if the two lines on his had palm met, he would grow up to be an emperor. Immediately, the young boy pulled out a knife and cut his palm to join the two lines. Seeing his determination, the palm reader said it did not matter what the lines of his palms said, he will accomplish his purpose. The young boy was none other than the great conquerer, Napoleon. We are what we think and our body is an image of the mind. The lines on our palms change as our thinking changes. We all have desires, but willpower is needed to achieve them. Desires operate on the mental level while willpower operates from the intellectual level. The desires are our wish list, which fizzles out gradually. It takes willpower to yield results. When we are intensely passionate, our desire translates into willpower, which is the secret to success. Success in life does not mean making lots of money. The world has seen many billionaires and we do not remember them all. Success does not mean becoming the CEO of a company. The world has seen many CEOs, prime ministers, and presidents. We do not remember them all. Success does not mean having six-pack abs. When Muhammad Ali won the boxing title in 1965, he had claimed that he would conquer the world with his power. But in 2015, he could not climb a dais because of Parkinson’s disease and needed support to even drink a cup of tea. Success does not mean becoming famous. We do not remember all celebrities. Our education system alone does not make us successful in life. Our exam results are not the yardstick for our success in life. Our life is much bigger than our university exams. Follow your passion The environmentalist, Tulsi Gowda, a tribal, who was awarded the Padma Shri, did not have an educational background. All she did was plant trees with all her heart. Right from childhood, she worked in a plant nursery. Over the years, she had planted over 1 lakh trees. She even became an adviser to the forest department. Her passion ensured that she is counted among the greats. The depth in our practice is more important than the breadth of out knowledge. To excel, we should not be a jack of all trades and master of none. We need not have many degrees or connections to succeed. Pandit Bhimsen Joshi knew only music. Sachin Tendulkar focused only on cricket. Tulasi Gowda knows only how to plant trees. Yet, they are all successful in life. A person wanted to get water by digging a well. His friend told him that digging a well at a particular place will get him water. It was hard labour and after digging for a metre or so someone suggested that he should try another place. So, this man started digging in that place. After digging for about 2m, he hit a rock. Then, a third person told him about another place. The man dug many holes over the years, but thirst remained unquenched. Had he continued digging in the same place, he would have quenched his thirst, along with the thirst of many other people. Before understanding the world, understand yourself. We must choose a path which we like and after thorough deliberation, we must stick to that. Do not keep on hopping from one pursuit to another. Sustained practise with intensity is the key to success. Be passionate about what you do. Do not imitate othersThere is no joy in imitating others. Do not aspire to become like someone else. Imitation leads to fear, stress, and anxiety in life. Aspire to become yourself. Every fingerprint is unique and so are you. No two fingerprints are the same. No two leaves in a tree are the same. No two fruits in a tree are the same. There is joy in you becoming yourself. There is freedom in you becoming yourself. Remember, imitation products fetch lower value than the original product. All actions do not give the same results. Actions are of four types – inaction, wrong action, selfish action, and selfless action. Only selfless action uplifts us and liberates us. The other three types of actions bind us and make us helpless. Maslow calls it self-actualisation. Most of the population is struggling to survive in the world. They just live for food and shelter and pass their life. In the Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna says only a few in a million stand out, and the rest get wiped out unnoticed. Only a rare few will leave their footprint in the sands of time and the rest will get flushed out like worms. You can stand out when you become yourself. Make sure that you give the prime time of the day to yourself. You are the most important person in this world. In the case of an airplane emergency, one must put a mask on themselves, before assisting others. Similarly, one must look after oneself before reaching out to others. Stay away from narcotics and alcohol. Always associate with positive people. Do yoga asanas everyday, and do pranayama to keep yourself physically healthy and mentally calm. Meditate to connect within and declutter your mind and enrich your roots. Take pride in your culture Instil qualities such as fearlessness, truth, generosity, compassion, joy, and peace. Be proud of your family tradition, your culture, and your nation. Those who cannot appreciate their own culture, tradition, and nation cannot command respect in life. This is one of the golden rules of management strategy: if you are not successful in your home turf, you cannot have sustained success in other pitches. You must trust yourselves. If you do not have trust in yourself, you cannot expect others to trust you. Always think big, think positive, think great. Have a vision for your life. Have a role model for your life. By trusting yourself and with sustained practise you can convert your vision into reality. A good human being is in great demand across the world. This world is a small stage, and the entire universe is the arena. Play the game of your life with exuberance. This way you can celebrate your life. vasudevakriyayoga@gmail.com(The writer is the Melbourne-based founder of Vasudeva Kriya Yoga)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-greatness-comes-to-those-who-think-big-101639261426257.html
12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Lekhi takes a dig at Channi, calls him nominated not elected||Senior BJP leader and minister of state for external affair Meenakshi Lekhi, who is co-incharge of the party for assembly polls in Punjab, sang praise of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and said that he was elected by the people as CM, whereas the present chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was nominated by the Congress party president Sonia Gandhi.While targeting Channi, Lekhi said Channi was making false claims of subsidies and freebees to lure the innocent public. “The state has not seen development and this is largely the reason why the youth of the state are going abroad in pursuit of better careers and job,” said Lekhi.Lekhi, while addressing the issues being faced by the party workers, said that emphasis on maintaining law and order has always remained priority of the party. “We had done this in Gujarat and now in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Gujarat is already the most progressive state and UP too is also on the path of progress. If we come to power Punjab will also witness development,” said Lekhi.Lekhi said that the funds issued by the central government under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) were not being deposited directly into the account of common man and were being misused by the Congress ruled government. In the name of using the funds under the National Clean Air Programme, interlocking tiles are being used, which is a wastage of money.Lekhi said that if elected the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government will get the matter probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-lekhi-takes-a-dig-at-channi-calls-him-nominated-not-elected-101639260224662.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Civic body, locals spar over encroachment||The anti-encroachment drive carried out by the Municipal Corporation’s Tehbazari wing and the traffic police, from Vishwakarma Chowk to Dholewal Military Complex, led to heated arguments between residents and authorities.The residents alleged that the police began towing vehicles which were parked well inside the permissible white line. The Tehbazari department, however, refuted the allegations, saying that the 22 two-wheelers and seven cars towed during the drive were all parked in the wrong spots. The shopkeepers, meanwhile, were asked to park their vehicles in the right spots.Notably, the Tehbazari wing of the civic body and the traffic police have jointy been conducting anti-encroachment drives in the city for the past five days, during which they have faced strong opposition from the local shopkeepers.The matter later snowballed into a political issue after the Shiromani Akali Dal and other political parties accused the police and civic body of harassing the public.Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, former minister and senior Akali Dal leader, blamed the civic body and police for unnecessarily harassing the local population. He said, “Firstly, the police and civic body encourage encroachments. It is an open secret that a private towing company is harassing people and on many occasions, they have towed the vehicles which were parked correctly.” “Police officials remain silent as they receive cuts. Similarly civic body staff first take cuts from poor rehri-phari vendors and then harass them again on the name of anti- encroachment drive and sadly all this is being encouraged by the present Congress regime,” Grewal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-civic-body-locals-spar-over-encroachment-101639259865875.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | As farmer agitation ends, toll plazas get ready for ops||As farmers start returning from the Singhu and Tikri borders of Delhi, following the withdrawal of the three farm laws, the toll plazas are all set to roll out operations.Workers were seen fixing the toll booths, boom barriers and hoardings, on which the toll rates were mentioned.The security staff deployed at the toll plaza said that they were waiting for the green signal to start operations. “But it is highly unlikely that toll plaza will start anytime soon as farmers sitting at Singhu and Tikri Border will begin returning from today and the process will continue for a few days,” said the security staff.Banks and agents selling Fastags have also installed their kiosks near the toll plaza and the commuters could be seen visiting the toll plaza enquiring about monthly passes.Before operations were stopped a toll plaza, ₹125 was charge from a car or SUV for one-way trip, while ₹185 was charged for a return trip or for multiple journeys within 24 hours (only with Fastag). The rates were revised on September and now ₹135 is charged for a single journey, while ₹200 is charged for return trip or multiple journeys within 24 hours. Charanjit Singh, a resident of Sector- 32 Chandigarh Road, said, “We have learnt that companies are going to revise toll prices so we have decided to take monthly passes. The toll tax at Ladhowal Toll Plaza is by far the most expensive in the state. We have been told that the window for issuing monthly passes will open soon.”Professor Tarun Ghai expressed his concern over the traffic jams at the toll plaza. “If exorbitant tolls burn holes in commuters’ pocket, the long jams at the toll points also add to the problem. Before starting operation, these issues need to be addressed,” said professor Ghai.On the other hand, Virendra Kumar, project director NH-44, said toll operations will start after farmers decide to vacate the place. So far, the rates are not being revised, he said.The toll plazas from across the state were lying non-operational since October last year following the resolution passed by the farmer unions not to let the toll companies collect toll tax from commuters. The move was taken to register their protest against the three farm laws.Pirthipal Singh from Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU Kadian) said a Sukhmani Sahib path will be organised on December 15 to honour the farmers returning from Singhu following which the decision will be taken on vacating temporary establishments from the toll plaza.Activists from NGOs, religious organisations and workers of political parties, especially the Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party made a beeline to welcome the farmers returning from Singhu and Tikri borders. At many places langars (community kitchens) were organised to welcome farmers.On reaching Doraha the activists of BKU Ughrahan showered flower petals to welcome the farmers. Congress leader KK Bawa also offered ladoos to the farmers visiting or crossing the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-as-farmer-agitation-ends-toll-plazas-get-ready-for-ops-101639259144459.html

However, the prime suspect, the hosiery owner’s driver, has been given a clean chit. The driver, Radhey Mohan Thapar, had not alighted from the car or tried to chase the robbers as they fled after executing the crime in 15 seconds, which the police had found suspicious. However, a probe failed to link him to the robbery. On being questioned, Thapar said, “Everything happened so quickly, that I was unable to make sense of it.” Inspector Surinder Chopra, station house officer at the Moti Nagar police station, said, “The modus operandi is different from the robberies reported in the city over the past few months.The accused were armed with sharp-edged weapons and iron rods rather than firearms. We are close to solving the case, and have rounded up a few suspects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-9-5-lakh-robbery-hosiery-owner-s-driver-gets-cleanchit-101639258723774.html

In all, 13 stolen cycles were recovered from him.As per the police, after escaping custody, the accused hitched rides from passersby and managed to reach Mohali. He also went to Panjyali and Kathgarh in Himachal Pradesh, and Solkhian and Amritsar in Punjab. He took shelter in gurdwaras on the way. As he did not have any cash on him, police were sure that he would try to contact his family members. On Saturday, they received a tip-off that the accused was heading to Chandigarh and was spotted on the road dividing Sectors 55 and 56. Police immediately set up a naka and nabbed him. As per the police, Sharma has been debarred by his parents due to his drug addiction. His father works in Solan while his mother is a housewife.

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Congress chief slams BJP for non-payment of ex-gratia to kin of Covid victims||: Chandigarh Congress slammed the BJP-led municipal corporation on Saturday for not disclosing the details of expenditures to the tune of ₹40 crore made out of the collected Covid cess. Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said that as per Disaster Management Act, 2005, every family whose member died due to a disaster is entitled for ex-gratia compensation of ₹4 lakh. “Since Covid-19 has been declared as a disaster, every family who lost a member to the disease is entitled to ex-gratia compensation. During the resumed hearing in the matter before the Supreme Court in June, the BJP-led government had conveyed that pleas seeking directions for compensation are genuine and are being attended to. But, till today, the government has done nothing to grant it,” he said. Chawla said that the actual data of declared Covid deaths is still understated, but in spite of all this, BJP is falsely claiming to have effectively controlled the pandemic in the city. Rajiv Sharma, spokesperson of Chandigarh Congress, stated that instead of patting their own back, BJP should apologise to the people of Chandigarh for failing the city on all fronts. “Not only this, the BJP councillors have indulged in massive corruption during the last six years. This is evident from the fact that despite back breaking increase in taxes, the corporation finds it difficult to pay even the salaries of the employees,” he said. He further stated that when the BJP took over in 2015, the Corporation had a fixed deposit of ₹500 crore. “Today, this whole amount has been squandered by the BJP led MC by indulging in corrupt practices and wasteful expenditure,” he said. ‘BJP false housing scheme shattered employees’ dreams’Chandigarh: For the past eight years, BJP has denied the rights of employees for housing facility, despite the fact that in 2008, as many as 4,000 accommodations were announced and in 2010, a lucky draw was held on the basis of which these residences were to be allotted, but it turned out to be a false promise. This was stated by Rajinder Rana, coordinator MC elections and sitting Congress MLA from Sujanpur, Himachal Pradesh, while addressing an election rally on Saturday in support of Congress candidate Harpreet Kaur Babla from ward no. 10 in Sector 29. Rana said that in 2008, the BJP government promised to provide housing facility to the employees at the rate of ₹34 lakh for three BHK, ₹24 lakh for two BHK of and one BHK for ₹13 lakh. During the time, it was agreed to provide one BHK for ₹5 lakh under EWS scheme, but on the condition that the applicant should not have his residence in the tricity. It was during the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 that the BJP again promised that the accommodations will be allotted soon. But, due to unfulfilled political promises for the last eight years, many of those eligible have lost hope as either many have retired and few are no more alive. Now, when the prices of the property are sky rocketing, these people cannot even imagine of purchasing a new home. The price of 3 BHK has soared to around ₹1.76 crore and that of 2BHK and 1 BHK have also risen, shattering the dream of these employees, said Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-congress-chief-slams-bjp-for-non-payment-of-ex-gratia-to-kin-of-covid-victims-101639256983685.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGI psychiatry department head among two more duped by former Sector-51 RWA chief||Two more persons, including a department head at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), have come forward against former Sector 51 residents’ welfare association (RWA) president Manjit Kaur, who allegedly duped people on the pretext of providing them HIG flats under the UT administrator’s discretionary quota. Dr Debashish Basu, the head of the department of psychiatry, said he was cheated of ₹29.2 lakh, while Vishal Sagar and others from Peer Muchalla, Zirakpur, were cheated of ₹4.35 crore. Kaur is now involved in six such cases and is currently lodged in Burail jail.As per the police, Dr Basu, who is a resident of Sector 24, got to know Kaur as he was treating her son, Vijay Pal Singh, for a mental illness. Kaur earned Dr Basu’s trust over the years by portraying herself as a religious and charitable person. In August 2016, she had approached Dr Basu and said that she was close to the then UT administrator VP Singh Badnore and she is part of a committee constituted by him to re-allot and renovate surrendered properties in Chandigarh under his discretionary quota. She said that she would get them a house allotted in Sector 38 West or Sector 43 which would be legal but it would have to be kept confidential.Dr Basu paid over ₹42 lakh between 2016 and 2018. When she wasn’t able to give any receipts for the money taken from them paid to the authorities they got impatient and she even returned ₹35 lakh only to ask for ₹30 lakh more in January 2020. Later when news about her arrest spread, other victims started to come forward.Using similar means, she had duped various residents of Peer Muchalla in Zirakpur, including Vishal Sagar who she had met in 2018. After taking money from them, she had assured that they would get allotment when the Prime Minister will visit the city under the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana on August 15 2019. While making excuses for the delay, she had asked for more time but later the complainants found out that she had siphoned off the money to offshore accounts and was planning to flee the country. They had paid ₹4,35,66,000 to her for this.Two cases under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) have been registered against Kaur and her family at the Sector 49 police station. She has been lodged in jail for the past month and has three cases lodged against her at the Sector 49 police station and three cases are being investigated by the Economic Offences Wing. Police officials said it is hard to estimate how much money she had gathered through this modus operandi and it is expected that more complainants will come forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pgi-psychiatry-department-head-among-two-more-duped-by-former-sector-51-rwa-chief-101639256567636.html

This also marked the first time since August 15 last year that veteran farmer leader from Ambala, Gulab Singh, 81, changed out of his black attire. He is one of the oldest members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union and joined Gurnam Singh Charuni in 2015 and is currently district vice-president of the Ambala unit. “When the protest in Delhi had not started and we observed a “black day” against the laws for the first time at the district grain market in the city, we were asked to carry a black cloth to the protest site. But, I wore a fully black ensemble. I also announced there that till the laws are repealed, I will wear the same dress and turban as a mark of protest,” he said. An ex-serviceman with the Indian Air Force (IAF), Singh retired as a sergeant after 21 years of service in 1985. He has been booked in over seven cases for protesting in favour of farmers. A progressive farmer from Manakpur village, he campaigned actively for Charuni when he unsuccessfully contested from Kurukshetra’s Ladwa seat as an independent candidate in the 2019 assembly elections. On being asked about his pledge, he said, “Surprising many, I even attended weddings in this attire. I had told my wife that even if the laws are not repealed and I die in between, the family will not replace my clothes and cremate me in it.” SKM leaders including Charuni, Rakesh Tikait, Balbir Rajewal, Dr Darshan Pal and others will be welcomed at the cantonment’s Mohra Mandi on Sunday, from where they had left for the Delhi borders in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-protest-ends-ambala-farmer-changes-his-black-ensemble-after-a-year-101639256328972.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity Buzz: Amid Omicron scare, Chandigarh cops on trail of South Africa returnee||Enforcing quarantine norms is no mean task. Chandigarh Police had a tough time locating a South Africa returnee, who had tested negative for Covid-19 but had to isolate herself amid the Omicron scare. She had broken the mandatory quarantine protocol and checked into a hotel. It was one task for the UT administration to trace the woman and isolate her. Chandigarh Police were prompt in booking her for breaking norms, while she was shifted to Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. At the hospital, four police personnel were deployed outside the isolation ward, just to keep an eye on the woman. Call it a waste of manpower or unethical behaviour of the woman, but the authorities couldn’t possibly afford to let her roam around the town. Chandigarh MC elections: Allegations fly thick and fast With the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections round the corner, allegations by candidates against their rivals are flying thick and fast. In some cases, party colleagues are not missing this opportunity to score brownie points. For instance, a senior Congress leader called up journalists alleging that his party colleague was campaigning for his son even on a day when political parties had decided to suspend their campaigns as a mark of respect to chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash on December 8. When asked for proof, the leader said it’s not his job. United colours of BJP The Chandigarh BJP known for its factionalism is trying hard to present a united front in the run-up to the civic elections. All senior leaders are seen together at important party events these days. But sometimes it gets difficult, and embarrassing. During a recent press conference called to list out the BJP’s achievements in the past six years, Chandigarh unit president Arun Sood, former MP Satya Pal Jain and mayor Ravi Kant Sharma were in attendance. Soon after Sood started addressing the media, both Jain and Sharma left. “One of them had an important call to attend, and the other was to go to another event,” a BJP leader explained, requesting anonymity. AAP knows its chances With only one of the four senior Aam Aadmi Party leaders following AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s direction to contest the municipal corporation elections, both the Congress and the BJP are taking a swipe at the party’s chances. “Kejriwal asked party convener Prem Garg, co-incharge Pardeep Chhabra, election campaign in-charge Chander Mukhi Sharma and a member of the Harmohan Dhawan family to contest the elections. Except Sharma, nobody entered the fray. This indicates that they also know that their party doesn’t stand a chance,” said a Congress leader. Mohali ex-mayor unsure of party but sure of voters! Kulwant Singh, a former mayor of Mohali and real estate baron, is still undecided from which party he will contest the Punjab assembly elections early next year, but he is pulling out all stops to woo voters. Every day, he meets people from different areas and distributes ration, quilts, and sports kits. His son Sarabjeet Singh Samana, who is a Mohali MC councillor, is also assisting him. Kulwant is lobbying hard for the ticket from the Aam Aadmi Party, but he has not joined the party yet. Sign of the times, MC campaigners keep off With the season of the MC elections upon us, many residents complain of how councillors, who remained inaccessible during their tenure, are suddenly reminded of their neighbourhoods while campaigning. In Sector 33-B, the Residents Welfare Association general secretary has put up a board asking campaigners not to bother coming for votes. “Our previous councillor ignored the sector. These people make many promises but stop listening after the elections, hence the board,” said Kuljinder Sra. Employees of the month at GMSH-16 In an initiative to boost the morale of the healthcare staff, the Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, will honour four best employees every month. Based on their performance, the director, health services, will choose the best staff nurse, sanitation worker, class four employee and pharmacist every month. Besides appreciation certificates, their names and pictures will be displayed at a wall, titled Employees of the month just outside the DHS’s office. PU mess rate hike difficult to digest for PU students The revised rates of eatables in Panjab University (PU) hostels has been difficult to digest for students. The revision of the rates came after a representation by mess/canteen contractors. Over the past few days, student bodies submitted several representations to the university authorities, demanding a rollback. A protest was also held at the Students’ Centre but the authorities are yet to decide on their demand. The students argue that the rates are already higher as compared to other educational institutions in the city.

PUTA also informed teachers that they are also planning to approach AICC president Sonia Gandhi, vice-president Rahul Gandhi and PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu and submit a petition about their demands after running a signature campaign within campus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ugc-pay-scales-row-pu-college-teachers-continue-protest-101639254645156.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Amid clamour for action in Punjab drug cases, ADGP Asthana proceeds on leave||In a significant development, Punjab additional director general of police and head of Bureau of Investigation SK Asthana on Saturday proceeded on two-day leave amid reports of pressure on the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government to take action on the politically sensitive drug cases. Asthana was posted as BoI chief a fortnight ago, replacing ADGP Varinder Kumar, apparently to initiate the process to arrest a high-profile Shiromani Akali Dal politician. In his leave application to DGP, seen by HT, Asthana said that he had medical emergency with severe atrial fibrillation of heart leading to abnormal heart rhythm and heart rate. “I have been advised by the doctor to be on complete medical rest for next 48-hours” he said, seeking exemption from his scheduled meeting with chief minister on Saturday morning. A section of the ruling Congress led by state party chief Navjot Sidhu has lately stepped up pressure on Channi to act on the drug and sacrilege cases to fulfil the promises the party had made ahead of 2017 assembly polls. Before Kumar’s short stint, Arpit Shukla was moved out as BOI head. “Both officials replaced before Asthana had expressed their inability to take action against a former Akali minister stating that there was nothing concrete against him on official files,” said a senior official familiar with developments. Asthana, when contacted, attributed his two-day leave to medical emergency. “I don’t know what pressure you are talking about. I have faced many a political pressure in my career but the exact reason behind my application is my serious ailment,” he told HT. Senior officials privy to the developments said the BoI has been under immense pressure from the government to take action against a former Akali minister after officials of special task force (STF) on drugs had expressed their inability to book any high-profile person till its 2018 drug report, lying in sealed cover with the Punjab and Haryana high court, is not opened. 
12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Military Literature Festival 2021: India capable of giving befitting reply to aggressive countries, says Punjab governor||India has never attacked another country but is capable of giving a befitting reply to any country that shows aggression towards it, Punjab Governor and Chandigarh administrator Banwarilal Purohit said on Saturday, on the inaugural day of the fifth edition of the Military Literature Festival (MLF).The festival, which was held virtually due to the pandemic situations, was organised jointly by the government of Punjab, Chandigarh administration and the Western Command of the Indian Army. The festival focused on the golden jubilee of the victory in 1971 India-Pakistan war.Speaking on the occasion, Purohit said, “India has never attacked another country but has sacrificed lives for other nations. But at the same time, it is also crystal clear that we are capable of giving befitting replies to those who show aggression towards us.”“Soon after taking charge of the union ministry of defence, Rajnath Singh constituted a committee to review the progress of the work of writing the border history of the country and publishing periodicals and journals based on the military events. This military festival is providing an opportunity for the people in general, youth in particular, to gain knowledge about the war fought by our armed forces and to get inspired by their experience,” Purohit said.He added, “India’s commitment to abide by ‘Hinsa’ should not be misconstrued as response limitation. Any foreign aggression or misadventure will always create a more befitting response. Every time, even terrorism got good reply from Indian army. The defence of the nation means protecting the national unity and integrity and hence we are making every arrangement to further strengthen India’s defence,” he added.Former J&K governor NN Vohra, who is also chairman of Tribune Trust, said, “I had worked closely with CDS Bipin Rawat in J&K and had discussed situations when our country was facing military tensions. The military festival attracts a large number of serving and retired military officers. The festival is a tribute to the breavehearts who have protected our country.”General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, Lt Gen Nav K Khanduri also sent his message for the inaugural session and expressed his views on the achievements of the Indian Army, not only during the 1971 war but for always protecting the country. Meanwhile, Lt Gen Depinder Singh (retd), who was the military assistant to then Army Chief, Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw, shared his first hand experience and some inside stories on the working of Indian Army and its commanders during the 1971 war. Brig Sukhjit Singh and SS Boparai also joined him to share their experience. Satinder Lambah also shared prelude stories regarding the war.Brig PK Ghosh, Maj Chanderkant Singh, Brig OS Goraya and Mr Sarabjit Singh also talked about the operations in eastern theatre and highlighted its role from April 1971 to November 1971, during the Indo-Pak war.The event also focused on the development of the nation, its geopolitics and emerging threats to the country, through land, air and sea routes.Also present during the session, Gen VP Singh, who served as the 19th Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army, talked about the collapse of the Afghanistan government in August 2021 and how the country could have managed to save itself from the US intrusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/military-literature-festival-2021-india-capable-of-giving-befitting-reply-to-aggressive-countries-says-punjab-governor-101639254465948.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu: Farooq Abdullah for Indo-Pak dialogue; says there is no way out||Amid a spike in killings in Kashmir, former chief minister and Lok Sabha member Dr Farooq Abdullah on Saturday strongly advocated Indo-Pak dialogue and said that “there was no way out”. He also questioned the alleged duplicity of the BJP government, which, he said, “can talk to China, who is usurping Indian territory but not to Pakistan.” Responding to media queries following day-long convention of the NC’s minority cell, the veteran politician lost his temper and called a journalist “communal” when the latter sought his reaction over the killings of two policemen in Kashmir on Friday. Dr Farooq squarely blamed the Centre for the spike in killings in Kashmir. “Why are you asking me this? What do you want me to say? Do you think we are happy that they are killing people? It is a sad story…tell the government, who are saying everything is honky dory. Is it honky dory? Are people safe,” he said angrily. He continued, “When your police personnel are not safe, how is an ordinary man safe?” Two policemen were killed in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district on Friday after terrorists fired at them at the Gulshan Chowk area. The injured policemen were rushed to a nearby hospital where both of them succumbed to injuries. When asked whether talks can be held in such an atmosphere, he retorted, “You have to talk… there is no way out. You can talk to China… what do you say about that? They are occupying our territory… they have made their houses on our territory. Does the government of India allow discussion in the Parliament to understand what Chinese are doing?” When asked to react to Haryana CM ML Khattar, who has said that namaz will not be allowed in open spaces, Farooq said there was a religious tolerance, which has already been there. “And, the Constitution provides religious freedom. If he doesn’t allow it in an open field, then let him create places where they can pray because they have to pray. That’s why they use open place because there is no place”. Earlier, during the interaction with the internally displaced Kashmiri Pandits, Farooq Abdullah said the BJP has used them as a “vote bank” and has done nothing for them. He also apologised to the KP community for not having been able to protect them during the mass exodus in the 1990s. “During the NC government, we tried our best to ensure the return of the Pandit community but some elements sabotaged the whole process by carrying out massacres of Pandits,” he said. He also recalled how the then governor Jagmohan allegedly facilitated the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits with the promise to get them back in two months. He assured that the National Conference will continue to work towards the safe and honourable return of Pandits to the Valley.

But, he added, “unfortunately, first because of COVID and then due to my replacement some demands still remain unfulfilled which the new government must fulfil now”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-hails-successful-completion-of-farmers-stir-welcomes-them-back-101639251703238.html

Farmers had claimed death of more than 700 peasants from Punjab, Haryana and other states during the agitation against the now-repealed farm laws. Channi said farmers’ agitation launched by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has proved a big success and the people of Punjab, farmers and the government all have made contributions in this struggle.

12-12-2021||Lucknow||Stray cattle menace: UP govt steps up efforts, zila panchayats asked to launch cattle-catching drives||The Yogi Adityanath government has stepped up efforts to contain the menace of stray cattle that still exists in many districts. Besides, it has also taken fresh steps to ensure a comfortable stay of the cattle already in cow protection centres, people dealing with the issue said.After a series of meetings held at the level of the chief minister, the chief secretary and the agriculture production commissioner, officials have identified around a dozen districts where stray cattle are creating a lot of problems for farmers and the common man.“The government has decided to rope in zila panchayats (ZPs) to carry out a cattle-catching campaign in the rural areas of the districts identified as was done in the cities,” an animal husbandry department official said. “The same plan may be executed in other districts as well later depending upon the results in the districts identified for the purpose,” he added. The move comes after the government received feedback that abandoned cattle was still a big issue, especially in around a dozen districts, where they were destroying crops and attacking people taking care of crops in the fields. It was also found that there was no system of catching such cattle in villages and neither were there caretakers and watchmen in cow shelters.Expressing concern over the situation, chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, during a meeting last week, directed officials to engage cattle catchers, if needed, and put the cattle safely into cow shelters in districts where the stray cattle problem was a serious issue.“In a follow-up meeting called by APC Alok Sinha it was decided that the responsibility to catch stray cattle should be given to ZPs in around a dozen worst-affected districts such as Gonda, Shrawasti, Lalitpur, Jhansi, Mahoba, Chitrakoot, Banda and Ghazipur,” the official said. The panchayati raj department, he said, might soon be asked to appoint caretakers and watchmen in cow shelters running in the rural areas. On Friday, Sinha issued detailed written instructions to the department of urban development and panchayati raj asking them to take appropriate steps for availability of adequate fodder in cow shelters and ensure proper arrangements for saving cattle there from the cold and fog. Currently, there are around 5,500 cow protection centres or cow shelters housing more than six lakh stray cattle in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/stray-cattle-menace-up-govt-steps-up-efforts-zila-panchayats-asked-to-launch-cattle-catching-drives-101639251224716.html

The Punjab government recently filed the petition that was listed for Friday before the SC registrar who issued a notice through the attorney general and directed the Union government to appear in the court within 28 days of receiving the orders.In October this year, the Narendra Modi-led central government had issued a notification extending the BSF jurisdiction from 15km to 50km from the international border.The SC registrar’s notice read, “You are summoned to appear in the court to answer the plaintiff’s claim and produce your witness and documents on the basis of which you intend to support your case.” The move to extend the BSF’s territorial jurisdiction had evoked a strong reaction from political parties in Punjab following which chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in a all-party meeting on October 25 had decided to challenge the order, citing attack on the country’s “federal structure”. The state’s political parties had termed the decision “an ill-conceived move” of the BJP-led government at the Centre in a bid to “indirectly rule the jurisdiction area”. On November 11, the Punjab Vidhan Sabha had passed a resolution against the move, castigating the Centre for curtailing powers of the Punjab Police.However, the BSF in a press conference on November 13 had said that the paramilitary force was only to “complement, assist and strengthen” the police and other law-enforcement agencies.Appreciating the state government’ move, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday tweeted, “I congratulate Punjab and it’s legal team to be the 1st to approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court by filing an original suit challenging the notification extending the BSF jurisdiction. The fight to retain the principles embodied in the constitution i.e. to retain the federal structure and autonomy of the states has begun … Notice issued to the centre to respond (sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-moves-sc-against-centre-s-bsf-jurisdiction-order-101639250743250.html

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt orders magisterial inquiry into Canecharge on teachers in Mansa||A day after strong criticism of canecharge by Punjab Police on unemployed schoolteachers during Congress rally in Mansa, the state home department on Saturday ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.According to the directions of home secretary Anurah Verma, Sangrur additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Anmol Singh Dhaliwal will investigate the matter. Dhaliwal has been asked to submit the findings within a week.Earlier in the day Mansa MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia urged chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to initiate action against policemen responsible for beating up unemployed protesters on Friday. Manshahia took to Facebook to express his anguish after videos were shared on social media, showing police personnel in plainclothes leading cops in beating trained teachers at the Congress rally in Mansa. The police personnel in question is stated to be a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) in the CM’s security wing. During the rally, a group of unemployed teachers raised slogans, demanding government jobs. Manshahia, who was also present at the rally, said that the videos were disturbing. “It is an inhuman way adopted by the police officer, who deserves punitive action as he was ruthless. It was painful to watch videos where he was seen attacking protesters in a bus when they were being taken out of the venue by the district police,” he said. During the rally, a group of teachers and a section of Youth Congress activists had jeered in the presence of the CM. While the police personnel did not act against those who hooted continuously against Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who joined the Congress recently, but the protesting teachers faced the heat. After the protests, Channi said his government has no sympathy for those create ruckus. The CM suspended his address for 20 minutes. Several political leaders, including state transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, AICC secretary Harshwardhan Sapkal and Moosewala, were present on the dais but no one responded to the police action on the unemployed teachers. Manshahia justified the CM’s statement on not tolerating protests at public programmes. “Channi is in the CM office for less than three months and he has undertaken several people-oriented steps. He has assured sympathetic redressal of long-pending issues of government employees and unemployed teachers. But it is unfair to create ruckus and the CM should be given time to resolve matters,” said the MLA, who had switched to the Congress after quitting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in April 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-orders-magisterial-inquiry-into-canecharge-on-teachers-in-mansa-101639249663362.html

Addressing the booth-level party workers here, Nadda said that the Yogi Adityanath-led state government made a record payment to sugarcane farmers. “Ganna is ours and Jinnah is theirs. We will win by contesting on sugarcane and expose their Jinnah mentality,” he said referring to the Assembly elections early next year. Attacking the Opposition, he claimed that 20 sugar mills were closed during the BSP regime while 11 stopped operations under the previous Samajwadi Party government. The BJP president said the Swaminathan Commission had recommended that farmers should get one-and-a-half times the production cost but previous Congress government did not do it. “Congress did not give adequate benefits to farmers as per recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, but our Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave one and half times more of the expenditure to farmers as MSP (Minimum Support Price),” he said. Reminding people about old Samajwadi Party, he said, “This is not new Samajwadi Party, this is the same old SP, keep this in mind. Under them, there were riots everywhere as people witnessed 700 riots during their rules in which 112 persons were killed.” Nadda also raised the issue of Hindu exodus and said, “The SP leaders want to show their new faces by veiling their old ones.” He praised PM Modi for saving both--- the lives of people and the country’s economy during the crisis of Corona pandemic while countries like USA were unable to decide what to do? He also repealed Article 370 and brought Bill against Triple Talaq to give justice to Muslim women. Party’s state president Swatantra Deo Singh and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma also targeted the Opposition and claimed BJP would win over 300 seats in the Assembly elections and form government again in the state. Praising booth-level workers, Nadda said that it was responsibility of booth presidents to bring the Yogi government again in the state. “Booths play vital role in ensuring victory in elections. Therefore, it is now responsibility of booth presidents to bring the Yogi government again in the state.” Inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganna-is-ours-and-jinnah-is-theirs-says-nadda-in-meerut-101639249544931.html

He was arrested by the Pune police from the Pune international airport after a team of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials caught him at the airport. The accused, an Aundh resident, and his parents have been remanded to police custody for two days by a local court. He has studied and worked in America, according to the police. “The accused said that he was doing this to put up a show for his parents to make them believe that he had found a job in Canada after being jobless since 2019. He is a software engineer who was working in the USA until 2019 when he lost his job. He had been living with his parents since then,” said assistant inspector Milind Pathak of airport police station who is investigating the case. A complaint against the main accused, currently in police custody, was lodged by Arvind Singh (41) an official of CISF deployed at the Pune international airport. According to the complainant, the accused entered the airport by showing a forged ticket from Pune to Delhi and Delhi to Vancouver, Canada by Air India and a forged visa on his passport while his parents watched him. However, once his parents left, he tried to come out of the airport through the departure gates which raised the CISF officials’ suspicion. Upon checking his PNR, they found him to have forged the ticket as the PNR on his ticket did not exist in the system. “He said that after leaving the airport, he would live with his friends in the city to avoid raising his parents; suspicion. We are investigating how he managed to forge the visa and ticket,” said API Pathak. A case under Sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468, 471 (using forged documents as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Vimantal police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/outofwork-software-engineer-from-pune-forges-air-ticket-visa-to-impress-parents-101639248404289.html
12-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi to submit its climate action plan by January 2022||The Capital will be ready with its 10-year action plan to combat the climate crisis by January next year, senior officials of the state environment department said on Saturday. A senior environment department official said that the government has started workshops and department-level consultations to collect the requisite data and assess Delhi’s geographic and climate profile. The State Action Plan for Climate Change (SAPCC) will be submitted to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. “Over the next two months, we will conduct detailed meetings with all stakeholders in Delhi and prepare a detailed assessment of the city’s climate profile. This will essentially be a vulnerability assessment, which will give details on what constitutes Delhi’s climate,” said the official. In 2009, the Centre prepared a National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and asked all states to prepare their own plans. However, Delhi submitted its plan to combat the crisis in 2019, becoming the last state to do so. The delay meant that the action plan could not be implemented, since it was valid only till 2020. States have now been asked to come up with a new climate action plan that will suggest strategies to adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis over the next decade. A senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) official aware of the matter said that the plan will focus on six aspects — water resources, energy and power, transport, forest and biodiversity, urban planning, health and agriculture. Consultations will be held with nearly 40 agencies to draft the plan. “Each aspect of the city’s climate is being studied and these consultations will help us set small and medium-term deadlines with all agencies that will have to take act in order to develop Delhi as a sustainable city for the next 10 years,” the official said. Meteorologists and environmentalists said the larger impact of the climate crisis is visible globally and countries will have to act in order to mitigate its effects in the long run. Delhi’s climate has also witnessed extreme trends over the past decade. India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said that Delhi’s monsoon rains have started becoming more intense and spread over a shorter duration. HT has also earlier reported that over the past year, Delhi has broken at least one weather record every month. One of the reasons for this trend is the larger role of the climate crisis, said experts. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services said, “States will have to be prepared for the climate crisis. In Delhi and neighbouring satellite towns, we have been seeing extreme weather conditions and short and intense spells of rain. Urban infrastructure will have to now be redesigned to accommodate the impacts of climate change.”

The two inspectors -- one deployed as a station house officer and the other in-charge of crime investigation agency -- are under scanner for not taking the case seriously due to which it was registered late, said the officer, seeking anonymity. On Friday, Dheeraj Setia, former DCP of Gurugram police, was suspended by the Haryana government after being asked to join investigation on the basis of a confessional statement made by an accused in the multi-crore theft case. “The role of Gurugram police officials, who initially investigated the case, is now being questioned. The way investigation was carried out by the Gurugram police has raised many questions,” said another senior officer of the Haryana Police associated with the case. The theft was committed at the maintenance office of the residential society in Sector 82 on August 4. On August 20, when an employee of the company looking after the maintenance went to collect the cash to deposit it in the bank, he realised that it was missing. After scanning the CCTV footage, the company discovered that the money had been stolen. On November 11, the special task force (STF) of the Haryana Police arrested two Gurugram doctors -- Dr Sachinder Jain Nawal and Dr Gurpartap Singh -- for their alleged involvement in the multi-crore heist. The Gurugram police had not mentioned the amount of theft in the FIR but said it was ₹4 crore. However, the STF later revealed that it was over ₹25 crore theft and recovered nearly ₹6 crore from the two suspects. According to STF, the two doctors were connected to gangster Vikas Langarpuria who had planned the theft. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Vikas Gulia of the Delhi Police’s special cell was also arrested in connection with the theft on October 9 for allegedly helping the gangster. According to the senior officials, they have arrested 11 people so far, including the two doctors and close aides of the gangster, in the case. STF deputy inspector general Satheesh Balan said on Saturday that they had summoned DCP Setia and jail superintendent Shamsher Dahiya who is posted in Panchkula. “Dahiya joined the investigation whereas Setia still remains incommunicado,” he said. According to the officials, Dahiya was helping his nephew Neetu Dahiya alias Sunariya, a Delhi-based financer, and money was given to him for investment by gangster Langarpuria. Sunariya has been arrested in the case.Balan said that the main players in the case are Dr Nawal and gangster Langarpuria who planned the entire heist and tried to make fortune out of it. “DCP Setia received a small amount,” he said. Balan said they had sought permission to conduct a polygraph test upon Dr Singh and Dr Nawal. “Dr Singh has given his consent voluntarily and without any coercion and pressure to undergo the polygraph test whereas Dr Nawal denied to undergo the test in the first week of December,” he said. While hearing the case, a local court on December 2 had observed that the statement recorded by suspect Dr Nawal makes it clear that “he has given illegal gratification to DCP Setia for hushing up the matter”. According to Balan, in his disclosure statement, Dr Nawal has stated that in July 2021, his friend Dr Singh and an employee of the developer came to his hospital. “They disclosed that around ₹30-40 crore has been kept in a company’s flat and if they succeeded in stealing the said amount, then they would have a stroke of fortune. Thereafter, he contacted DCP Dheeraj Setia and disclosed the whole story,” Dr Nawal said in his disclosure statement. Dr Nawal further stated that DCP Setia refused to help him following which he called gangster Langarpuria and allegedly sought his help. “Dr Nawal planned the theft with Langarpuria, and on August 3 night the amount was stolen and was handed over to ASI Vikash Gulia who belongs to gangster’s village and was in his touch. The money was also given to three more Delhi residents to hide and to invest in the finance business,” stated the disclosure statement. Balan said as per the statement of Dr Nawal, after few days, DCP Setia called him to his office and he gave a site plan pertaining to the same place to commit theft. “Langarpuria called Dr Nawal and asked him to hush up the matter with police as they had arrested his close aides involved in the theft. He sent Gulia with a bag containing 3kg gold and 135,000 US dollars for handing over the amount to the DCP as he was officiating in-charge of DCP (crime),” the statement said. HT is in possession of disclosure statement filed in the Gurugram court. As per the statement of Dr Nawal, the DCP had denied to help as the case had taken shape of a big scandal. DCP kept a few thousand dollars with him for extending help in the matter and returned the remaining amount and gold to the main suspect, stated the statement. Dr Nawal further added that Langarpuria again sent a bag containing ₹2 crore to him for hushing up of the case. He again contacted the DCP but he asked him to return the money to the gangster, the statement said. The Haryana Police officials said till then the case was transferred to STF.Despite repeated attempts, DCP Setia and Shamsher Dahiya, jail superintendent, could not be reached for comments. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said that they will not spare anyone involved in any illegal activity and strict action will be taken against that person if found guilty. “DCP Sethia has been suspended and investigation is still on. STF has arrested over 11 people and ₹6 crore has already been recovered,” he said. Authorities in the Haryana government have also asked the Enforcement Directorate and income tax department to look into the case, said a senior police officer associated with the development.

With the PMC observing Saturday as Pedestrians’ Day, several families made their way to enjoy non-vehicle zone at Laxmi road, where both sides of the street were decorated with flower pots. While shops on the road between Nimbalkar Talim chowk and Umbraya Ganapati chowk reported higher footfall of customers, people were also seen playing games, walking leisurely along the road. Shopkeepers as well as stall owners also seemed happy to see people walking with smile and taking their time buying things. Ajay Agarwal, who owns a stall of gift articles said, “I have been holding a stall on Laxmi road for many years and never have I seen families so happy and tension free as today. With the road shut for traffic, people seemed to have more relaxed time to roam around and window shop without the tension of finding parking spot or being fined for wrong parking.” PMC has announced that no private vehicles are allowed at Laxmi road, one of the busiest streets in the city, between 10 am and 4 pm. The move is intended to celebrate the day, and as a part of this, PMC has organised various programmes at Laxmi road. This day, according to Harshad Abhyangkar, director, Save Pune Traffic Movement (SPTM), “denotes the joy of walking, and since morning, people are making their way with families to enjoy hassle free walk, taking parts in games related to pedestrian safety and eating. I actually saw people sitting on the road, relaxed and enjoying snacks too.” With this initiative, the administration aims to provide hassle-free movement as well as shopping for the citizens at Laxmi road. Mohol said, “This is the first time that a city has given importance to pedestrians by having a day to celebrate being able to walk on the streets without any hassles. This is just the beginning, and we will be celebrating it every year, making sure that zebra crossings are up to date, footpaths are continuous and well maintained and the pedestrian signals are working across the city by next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-celebrates-pedestrians-day-as-laxmi-rd-goes-vehiclefree-101639247685047.html

MCG officials said that barring one banquet hall in Sector 9, all 101 buildings are operating without a licence or certified adherence to building or fire safety norms of any kind.The officials said that in August they were directed by the Haryana Lokayukta to regularise the banquet halls and marriage places across the city as these can potentially be areas where mishaps can occur.“The survey has been completed. The findings were submitted in a detailed compiled report to the MCG commissioner on Thursday. Accordingly, the next course of action will be taken in the matter,” said Madhusmita Moitra, chief town planner, MCG.According to the officials, the report has recommended that the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) reintroduces its 2014 banquet hall policy with amendments.In 2014, for a short period, the ULB had come up with a policy for registering banquet halls and marriage venues, during which an owner of a solitary banquet hall in Sector 9 got his building regularised.“Banquet hall owners informed us that the main issue with the 2014 policy was that it demanded a one-time payment instead of renewing the licence on an annual basis. The one-time payment requires a banquet hall to pay in excess of ₹2 crore while an annual one will cost around ₹3-4 lakh. We have recommended reintroducing the banquet hall policy with an annual renewal system and reducing the minimum size of the service roads near the venues from 12 to nine metres,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.Anil Rao, president of the Haryana Party Lawns Association, said that the association had made similar recommendations to the MCG and the Haryana government as the ones in the civic body’s report. “Nearly 90% of banquet halls and marriage venues in the city operate on a lease basis. The tenants cannot afford the one-time payment. Annual renewal of licence will not only benefit us but also the government in the form of revenue,” Rao said.In November 2018, a banquet hall on Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road caught fire. Although the blaze was minor, it took fire department’s vehicles nearly 20 minutes to reach the site as the path leading to it was narrow.

In the survey, most respondents preferred Jungli Maharaj road followed by streets in Aundh and Bibwewadi where footpath conditions, their design and other aspects were taken into consideration. The survey conducted in mid-November was carried out by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) along with Sustainable Urban Mobility Network (SUM Net) India, Parisar Pune, STPM (Sustainable Transport and Potential Mobility) and transport expert Pranjali Deshpande to gauge walking happiness index to show if pedestrians are indeed happy walking in areas surveyed. “Walking happiness Index is a tool developed by the Pune Municipal Corporation along with experts in the city to quantify the satisfaction level of pedestrians using simple techniques,” said Aditya Chawande, architect urban designer, project associate at Parisar who was mentor for the survey. The walking happiness index was launched by the Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Saturday at Laxmi Road open street mall where he promised to continue with the Pedestrians’ Day and also look at keeping the zebra crossings, subways clean and maintained for pedestrians in future too. “We looked at eight roads selected to represent three categories like streets that have been transformed on the principles of complete street design under the Pune Streets programme (Jungli Maharaj road, Aundh DP road and Bibwewadi road), streets that have been modified with basic footpath improvement interventions (Gulavani Maharaj road, Prabhat road) and streets that will be transformed with better footpaths in coming years by PMC, (Shivarkar garden road, Wanowrie, Loop road, Yerawada and Sinhgad road),” Chawande said. Jungli Maharaj road scored maximum points when it came to parameters like pedestrian refuge areas while crossing the streets, footpath continuity, footpath width, pedestrian safety, light conditions at night, street furniture, encroachment free footpath. The main street in Aundh saw citizens giving positive response to footpath width and safety while crossing. In Bibwewadi, good lighting in the night and encroachment free footpath earned most points. “We took ten simple parameters to define the walking happiness index of the street, whereupon the pedestrians scored on each parameter on the scale of 1 to 4, with 1 for poor and 4 for the best. This is not a technical audit, instead we asked people walking on the streets on how they liked the roads, thus grading the total scores on the points given,” said Pranjali Deshpande, urban planner and mentor for the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jm-road-in-pune-scores-top-in-walking-happiness-index-101639247503126.html
12-12-2021||Delhi||Temperature hits season’s low, air improves to ‘poor’||The minimum temperature in the capital on Saturday fell to the lowest of the season so far, dipping to 8.3 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, even as stronger winds helped air quality to improve somewhat. The day’s minimum (8.3°C) and maximum temperature (26.7°C) were each a degree below the season’s normal levels, according to the India Meteorological Department. Minimum temperatures are likely to hover between 7-8°C for at least the next two days, a government forecaster said. “Delhi on Saturday recorded the lowest minimum temperature for the season, and the temperatures will not fluctuate much in the coming two or three days,” the official said. Stronger winds on Saturday brought down pollution marginally, with the air quality index (AQI) improving from ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’, data from Central Pollution Control Board showed. Poor air quality leads to breathing discomfort to most people. The city’s 24-hour average AQI at 4pm on Saturday was 281, down from 314 on Friday, the pollution watchdog said in its daily bulletin. Winds will stay relatively strong on Sunday as well, helping keep the city’s AQI in the same range, forecasters said. Winds are likely to calm down from November 14, and air pollution may spike once again, they warned. “Air quality is likely to remain in the ‘poor’ range on Sunday as well because of relatively higher wind speeds. The winds on Saturday reached around 10kmph from the northwest direction. On Sunday, the winds are likely to be around 8-10kmph and will be favourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” said VK Soni, head of the weather office’s environment and research centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/temperature-hits-season-s-low-air-improves-to-poor-101639247386791.html
12-12-2021||Lucknow||Air pollution: AQI of UP cities improves to “moderate” from “severe”||The Air Quality Index (AQI) of major Uttar Pradesh cities has shown marked improvement from “severe” and “very poor” to “poor” and “moderate” since November, as per the data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “The AQI numbers of major UP cities have not only improved since last month but are also better than the numbers of previous years. The air quality has improved despite drop in temperatures. This shows that the efforts made by agencies at district level and that of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) have been effective in improving air quality,” said member secretary of UPPCB Ajay Sharma. The pollution control boards along with municipal corporations, traffic and agriculture department have implemented graded response action plan (GRAP) across the state to reduce air pollution as per the directions of chief minster Yogi Adityanath. The GRAP refers to strict curbs on air pollution causing activities like stubble/garbage burning, uncovered construction work, illegal emissions in industries and taking measures to improve air quality. According to experts, recent scattered rains in part of west UP and drop in stubble burning has helped in improving the air quality. The AQI value of state capital Lucknow on Saturday was recorded at 199 that was down from 205 on November 11. An AQI in range of 101 to 200 is considered moderate, between 201 and 300 is considered poor while above 401 is considered severe with known adverse impact on human health on exposure.The change in AQI value of other cities differ more. The AQI of Agra, Baghpat and Bulandshahar on Saturday was 148, 193 and 185, far less than the AQI recorded on November 11 that was 437, 437 and 447 for the cities respectively. The AQI of Ghaziabad and Kanpur on Saturday was recorded at 264 and 186 which was less than 461 and 246 recorded on November 11.Similarly, the AQI in Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur was recorded at 117, 122 and 113 as compared to 247, 293, and 271 recorded respectively on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/air-pollution-aqi-of-up-cities-turn-moderate-from-severe-101639242642659.html
12-12-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi ended neglect of eastern Uttar Pradesh: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday accused previous governments formed by other parties of neglecting eastern Uttar Pradesh and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi with ending this. “Only a few days back, PM inaugurated a fertiliser factory in Gorakhpur that was closed down 31 years ago. The newly inaugurated factory is four times the capacity of the previous one. Along with that, the PM inaugurated AIIMS in Gorakhpur. We all know that in this region, people suffered from brain fever, malaria, kala-azar, chikungunya and dengue, but previously people were left to fend for themselves. Modi ji has given us a viral research centre there now,” Yogi Adityanath said after PM inaugurated the Saryu Nahar National Project in Balrampur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh. “The PM has inaugurated projects worth ₹10000 crore on December 7 in east UP. Before that, he inaugurated nine medical colleges from Siddharthnagar and also gave an international airport in Kushinagar,” Yogi Adityanath said. Yogi Adityanath accused the previous governments of not taking any interest in the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, the irrigation scheme launched by PM Modi in 2016.“On coming to power in 2014, the PM took up 100 irrigation schemes like Saryu Nahar project that were stuck for decades. Of these, 18 projects were identified in UP, out of which 17 are now completed. These projects would help irrigate 22 lakh hectares of land in UP,” Adityanath said. “Work is on in one remaining project, the Madhya Ganga project that would link three districts,” Adityanath said adding that Saryu Nahar project would transform the lives of farmers. The chief minister said the first barrage of the Saryu Nahar project would also usher in prosperity, check migration and also increase tourist footfalls. “Close to the Nepal border, the region around Saryu Ghaghra barrage would attract tourists,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-ended-neglect-of-eastern-up-yogi-adityanath-101639241622819.html

Recent History"."After all, what is the collapse of the Soviet Union? This is the collapse of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union," the Russian leader was cited as saying.A loyal servant of the Soviet Union, Putin was dismayed when it fell apart, once calling the collapse "the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century".Putin is sensitive to the perceived expansion of Western military ambitions into ex-Soviet countries and Russia this week demanded that NATO formally scrap a 2008 decision to open its door to Georgia and Ukraine.The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism.RIA-Novosti, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income."Sometimes I had to earn extra money," Putin said."I mean, earn extra money by car, as a private driver. It's unpleasant to talk about to be honest but, unfortunately, that was the case."Russia was the centre of the Soviet Union that grew to include 15 republics from the Baltics in the West to Central Asia.In 1991, wracked by economic woes the Soviet Union disintegrated and Russia became an independent nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-he-had-to-drive-cab-to-make-ends-meet-after-soviet-fall-101639331545734.html

The UK, South Africa were among the countries where faster transmission of the cases have been noted. The Delta variant, previously, was less prevalent in South Africa while it was the dominant variant in Britain.In India, several states and districts reported cases of Omicron variant on Sunday as the total caseload pertaining to the strain reached 38.The variant was first identified in South Africa and the WHO announced it as a variant of concern back in November.Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer and BioNTech had said last week that three doses of their vaccine appeared effective against the variant, based on initial laboratory tests.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-covid-19-variant-more-transmissible-reduces-vaccine-efficiency-who-101639330799448.html

Speaking at ABC’s ‘This Week With George Stephanopoulos’, Fauci said two doses of mRNA vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, and one shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will remain the official requirement to determine fully vaccinated individuals."For official requirements, it's still two shots of the mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) and one shot of the J&J for the official determination of what's required or not. But I think if you look at the data, the more and more it becomes clear that if you want to be optimally protected you really should get a booster," the top immunologist said.Fauci’s comment on additional dose comes at a time when the rich nations are expanding their booster program for younger people amid fears of Omicron evading vaccine-induced immunity. The United States has cleared Pfizer booster dose for 16-17-year-olds and Britain is set to open the bookings for booster shots for all people aged 30 and above from December 13.Covid-19: UK govt announces new measures, boosters to all above 30 to check Omicron spreadThe World Health Organization (WHO) said in a technical briefing that Omicron is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy.

12-12-2021||World||US tornadoes: At least 94 dead, several towns affected, rescue ops continue||US rescuers desperately searched for survivors Sunday after tornadoes killed at least 94 and left towns in ruin, with emergency crews racing against time to find dozens still missing from a collapsed Kentucky factory.President Joe Biden called the wave of twisters, including one that traveled more than 200 miles (320 kilometers), "one of the largest" storm outbreaks in American history."It's a tragedy," a shaken Biden, who pledged support for the affected states, said in televised comments. "And we still don't know how many lives are lost and the full extent of the damage."With the death toll all but certain to rise, scores of search and rescue officers were helping stunned citizens across the US heartland sift through the rubble of their homes and businesses overnight.More than 80 people are dead in Kentucky alone, many of them workers at a candle factory in Mayfield, the state's Governor Andy Beshear said Sunday as he raised the confirmed toll by 10 fatalities.And the forecast was grim. "That number is going to exceed more than 100," Beshear told CNN.Meanwhile, at least six died in an Amazon warehouse in Illinois where they were on the night shift processing orders ahead of Christmas.Emergency crews worked through the night into Sunday at both locations, but the Kentucky governor's somber remarks suggested his state's residents should brace for the worst.Of the 110 employees working Friday night in the candle factory, "about 40 of them have been rescued and I'm not sure we're going to see another rescue," Beshear said."I pray for it," he said, but "it would be an incredible miracle" if more factory victims were found alive.As Americans grappled with the immensity of the disaster, condolences poured in, with Pope Francis saying he is praying "for the victims of the tornado that hit Kentucky."Biden's Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, in a break from tense bilateral relations, said his country "shares in the grief" of those who lost loved ones and expressed hope that victims quickly overcome the tornadoes' consequences.The catastrophe has shaken many Americans, including officials who have worked in the aftermath of tornadoes and other big storms."This event is the worst, most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky's history," Beshear said Saturday, adding he fears "we will have lost more than 100 people.""The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and I have trouble putting it into words."The head of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, was to arrive in Kentucky Sunday.The largest tornado among the swarm that smashed through the US South and Midwest had rumbled along the ground for over 200 miles (320 kilometers), Beshear said, one of the longest on record.The longest a US tornado has ever tracked along the ground was a 219-mile storm in Missouri in 1925. It claimed 695 lives.'Hope for a miracle'The western Kentucky town of Mayfield was reduced to "matchsticks," its mayor Kathy O'Nan said."There's always hope" for survivors among the missing, O'Nan told NBC Sunday. "We hope for a miracle in the days to come."The town of 10,000 was described as "ground zero" by officials, and appeared post-apocalyptic: city blocks leveled; historic homes and buildings beaten down to their slabs; tree trunks stripped of their branches; cars overturned in fields.Some Christmas decorations could still be seen by the side of the road.David Norseworthy, a 69-year-old builder in Mayfield, said the storm blew off his roof and front porch while the family hid in a shelter."We never had anything like that here," he told AFP.In one demonstration of the storms' power, when winds derailed a 27-car train near Earlington, Kentucky, one car was blown 75 yards up a hill and another landed on a house. No one was hurt.Deaths in multiple statesReports put the total number of tornadoes across the region at around 30.At least 14 people were killed in other storm-hit states, including six at the Amazon facility in Illinois.Four were killed in Tennessee, two died in Arkansas, while Missouri recorded two fatalities. Tornadoes also touched down in Mississippi.Biden said he planned to travel to the affected areas.Amazon workers trappedAt the Amazon warehouse in the southern Illinois city of Edwardsville, around 100 workers are believed to have been trapped inside."We identified 45 personnel who made it out of the building safely... and six fatalities," Edwardsville fire chief James Whiteford told reporters.But he said the operation had turned from rescue to focus "only on recovery," fueling fears the toll will rise.Amazon chief Jeff Bezos said he was "heartbroken" at the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tornadoes-at-least-94-dead-several-towns-affected-rescue-ops-continue-101639327502945.html

The over-30s can get a third dose of a vaccine from next week.The government in London sets policy for England only. Health is a devolved matter for the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The announcement adds to new proposals from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to combat Omicron, including a return to home-working, and the possible introduction of vaccine passports in certain settings.MPs vote on the proposals on Tuesday, with Johnson facing a potentially sizeable rebellion from his own Conservative members. The vote, though is likely to pass with Labour support.Britain -- one of the worst-hit countries by Covid-19 with more than 146,000 deaths -- began its mass vaccination campaign just over a year ago.Infection rates remain stubbornly high at about 50,000 positive tests per day.On Sunday, government minister Nadim Zahawi said the first people with Omicron had been taken to hospital, just over two weeks after the variant was detected in Britain.In London, Omicron is now responsible for about a third of all Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-govt-announces-new-measures-boosters-to-all-above-30-to-check-omicron-spread-101639326348143.html

No details are available regarding the charges on which he was convicted, according to RFA.Speaking to RFA, a Tibetan scholar living in exile described Gyatso - who had written books and articles describing restrictions on freedom of expression under Chinese rule - as an "open-minded individual who advocates the preservation of Tibetan language, religion and culture.""It's sad news to hear about his 10-year sentence on Human Rights Day, and I want to call on the United Nations, governments around the world, and the international community to look into this matter immediately," he added.Earlier, the Chinese government in October responded to a July 16 letter from U.N. human rights experts asking about Gyatso's case, telling them that Gyatso had been placed in criminal detention "in accordance with the law on suspicion of inciting secession."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-tibetan-writer-to-10-year-prison-for-his-loyalty-to-dalai-lama-101639316729639.html
12-12-2021||World||Booking for Covid boosters to open for all over 30s in UK amid Omicron threat||British health officials on Sunday said that people aged 30 and above will be able to book appointments for vaccine booster shots against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from Monday, December 13 amid concerns over the Omicron variant. The NHS said in a statement that the national booking system for Covid vaccines will now be open to people aged 30 to 39 so they can get the booster shot three months after receiving the second dose.The booking can be made two months following their second dose, which means a month in advance of becoming eligible to receive the additional jab. Of 7.5 million people in Britain aged 30 to 29, about 3.5 million people will be eligible for a booster shot from tomorrow. The vaccine policy was revised following updated advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.“The Covid-19 booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than 22 million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas,” UK health secretary Sajid Javid said.The vaccine program of the National Health Service (NHS) was expanded after the UK health security agency (UKHSA) found that the additional dose of the Covid vaccine significantly restores protection against mild disease caused by the new variant of concern. The emergence of Omicron has left researchers scrambling for more data to determine the transmissibility of the new variant of concern and the severity of disease caused by it.Cautioning against the preliminary findings on protection against Omicron, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said the early estimates do indicate that there is a greater risk of contracting the Omicron variant as against the Delhi variant a few months after taking the second dose of the Covid vaccine.“The data suggest this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible,” Ramsay added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/booking-for-covid-boosters-to-open-for-all-over-30s-in-uk-amid-omicron-threat-101639307999517.html
12-12-2021||World||New Caledonia rejects independence from France in third referendum||Residents of the Pacific territory of New Caledonia voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to remain part of France in a third referendum that was boycotted by pro-independence groups, reports say.Police reinforcements have been sent to the territory known as "the pebble", which is of strategic importance to France and is part of a wider tussle for influence in the Pacific between Western countries and China.Local television channel NC la 1ere reported that, with 90.23 percent of ballots counted, 96.32 percent of voters had voted "No" to independence in a result that will raise fears of unrest and questions about the legitimacy of the process.The archipelago of about 185,000 voters, 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) east of Australia, was granted three independence referendums under a 1988 deal aimed at easing tensions on the islands.Turnout on Sunday was only 41.60 percent by 5 pm local time (0600 GMT).Having rejected a breakaway from France in 2018 and then again last year, the inhabitants were asked one last time: "Do you want New Caledonia to accede to full sovereignty and become independent?"Pro-independence campaigners boycotted the vote, saying they wanted it postponed to September because "a fair campaign" was impossible with high coronavirus infection numbers.The result could exacerbate ethnic tensions, with the poorer indigenous Kanak community generally favouring independence over the wealthier white community.The main indigenous pro-independence movement, the FLNKS, had called the government's insistence on going ahead with the referendum "a declaration of war"."This referendum does not make too much sense because half the population has decided not to vote," Cathy, a bookseller who gave only her first name, told AFP at a polling booth in the capital Noumea."I came out of civic-mindedness, what interests me is the society we are going to build afterwards," she told AFP.Turnout was particularly low in Kanak-majority areas, AFP reporters witnessed.- Fears of Chinese influence -At stake in the vote was one of France's biggest overseas territories which is home to about 10 percent of the world's reserves of nickel, which is used to make stainless steel, batteries and mobile phones.The territory is also a key part of France's claim of being a Pacific power, with New Caledonia granting France rights to the surrounding ocean, as well as a military staging post.Experts suspect that an independent New Caledonia would move closer to Beijing, which has built up close economic links and political influence on other Pacific islands."If the French safeguard disappears, all elements would be in place for China to establish itself permanently in New Caledonia," said French international relations analyst Bastien Vandendyck.Other nations in the region, including Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, had already become "Chinese satellites", Vandendyck told AFP."All China needs now to complete its pearl necklace on Australia's doorstep is New Caledonia," he said.China is already the biggest single client for New Caledonia's metal exports.- Fresh vote on future 'project' -French President Emmanuel Macron has avoided taking sides in the referendum debate, saying Thursday that his role was to ensure the vote "takes place in the right way and in the right conditions."He is expected to make a statement on Sunday at 1200 GMT and is desperate to avoid any more overseas unrest following violent protests on the French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique last month.Around 2,000 police and troops were deployed for Sunday's vote, which appeared to have passed off largely without incident except for an attempted roadblock on an outlying island.France has 13 overseas territories, home to 2.7 million people, which are generally poorer and have higher unemployment than the mainland, leading to long-standing accusations of neglect.Some such as French Polynesia have been granted large degrees of autonomy and attention will now turn to the future status of New Caledonia, whose regional council could be granted more powers.Another referendum is expected by June 2023 which will decide on the "project" New Caledonia's people want to pursue.The pro-independence movement has threatened not to recognise Sunday's result and has vowed to appeal to the United Nations to get it cancelled.New Caledonia was largely spared during the pandemic's first phase, but have suffered close to 300 Covid-19 deaths since the Delta variant arrived.Some observers fear the tensions could spark a return of the kind of violence last seen in the 1980s when clashes broke out between the pro-independence Kanaks and white French people who opposed independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-caledonia-rejects-independence-from-france-in-third-referendum-101639308735486.html

The continued military build-up in areas close to Ukraine has raised concern over a Russian invasion, with US intelligence officers determining that the attack can take place as early as January 2022. Taking cognisance of the issue, the G7 delegates condemned Russia’s military build-up and called on Kremlin to de-escalate, reported Reuters."Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, as quoted by Reuters.The escalation prompted US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to hold discussions last Tuesday over a secured telephone call. On Saturday, Biden said he warned Putin of consequences that would be “devastating” for Russia’s economy if Kremlin launches a military offensive against Ukraine."I made it absolutely clear to President Putin...that if he moves on Ukraine, the economic consequences for his economy are going to be devastating, devastating," said Biden, while stressing that sending US ground combat troops in the event of a Russian invasion “was never on the table.”Russia, China top agenda as G7 ministers call for unity against authoritarianismRussia has meanwhile denied planning an attack, saying it is moving the troops to thwart any destabilising behaviour from the United States and Ukraine near border areas. In an interview with Greek TV channel ANT1, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia can move its forces wherever it wants.When asked whether Russia was planning to invade Ukraine, Peksov said, "No, the problem is very simple. Russia is moving its forces within its territory and we can move our forces in any direction we want and closer to the areas that could pose a threat [and currently] we see US warplanes landing in Ukraine and US military equipment approaching our borders.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-warn-russia-of-massive-consequences-if-it-invades-ukraine-101639307125913.html

We still don't know how many lives are lost and the full extent of the damage,” US President Joe Biden said in televised comments.Biden said the tornado is likely to be one of the largest storm outbreaks in the history of America.Andy Beshear, governor of Kentucky, said it was “the worst, most devastating, most deadly tornado event in the state's history." "The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and I have trouble putting it into words," he also told reporters, according to AFP.Here are key points:> Officials carrying rescue and relief operations in the storm-hit states feel the death toll might rise further as they clear the routes and snow.> Briefing the media over the situation, Edwardsville fire chief James Whiteford told reporters the operation turned from rescue to focus "only on recovery," fuelling fears the toll could rise further.> According to an AFP report, at least one person died when a tornado almost destroyed a nursing home in Monette, Arkansas.> Four people died in Tennessee and one in Missouri. Tornadoes also touched down in Mississippi, it also reported.> Recounting the ordeal, 31-year-old Mayfield resident Alex Goodman said, "It looks like a bomb has exploded," as per the AFP report.> Another 69-year-old local builder said the storm blew off his roof and front porch while the family hid in a shelter. "We never had anything like that here," he was quoted as saying by AFP.> More than half a million homes in several states were left without power, according to PowerOutage.com.> Previously, the longest a US tornado has ever tracked along the ground was a 219-mile storm in Missouri in 1925.

12-12-2021||World||Deadly collapse at Amazon warehouse puts spotlight on phone ban||An Amazon.com Inc. warehouse collapse on Friday night that killed at least six people has amplified concerns among its blue collar workforce about the return of the internet retailer’s mobile phone ban in work areas.The warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, near St. Louis, was reduced to rubble when a string of tornadoes ripped through six states, leaving a trail of destruction that stretched more than 200 miles. Emergency responders expect recovery efforts to continue into next week.Amazon had for years prohibited workers from carrying their phones on warehouse floors, requiring them to leave them in vehicles or employee lockers before passing through security checks that include metal detectors. The company backed off during the pandemic, but has been gradually reintroducing it at facilities around the country.Five Amazon employees, including two who work across the street from the building that collapsed, said they want access to information such as updates on potentially deadly weather events through their smartphones -- without interference from Amazon. The phones can also help them communicate with emergency responders or loved ones if they are trapped, they said. “After these deaths, there is no way in hell I am relying on Amazon to keep me safe,” said one worker from a neighboring Amazon facility in Illinois. “If they institute the no cell phone policy, I am resigning.”Biden Approves Help for Kentucky After Tornadoes Kill DozensAnother worker from an Amazon warehouse in Indiana said she is using up her paid time off whenever the company decides to remain open despite warnings of extreme weather events. Having her phone with her is critical to making those decisions, especially about sudden tornado risks, she said.“I don’t trust them with my safety to be quite frank,” she said. “If there’s severe weather on the way, I think I should be able to make my own decision about safety.”Amazon declined to address the concerns raised by workers about its mobile phone policy, saying its focus now is “on assisting the brave first responders on the scene and supporting our affected employees and partners in the area.”The concerns about phone access highlight the deep distrust between executives who make rules focused on productivity and efficiency to gain a competitive advantage, and hourly front-line workers who often fear their safety is secondary to moving packages. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s wealthiest man after Elon Musk, only fueled such feelings by spending the earlier part of Saturday celebrating a celebrity space launch by his company Blue Origin while emergency crews at the warehouse dug through rubble looking for bodies.At around 8 p.m. Central time, Bezos tweeted to offer his well wishes. One person familiar with Amazon’s warehouse construction said the buildings are designed to local standards that account for events such as severe storms and snow loads. Warehouses in tornado-prone areas include space that is more heavily reinforced with extra steel and concrete where workers are instructed to huddle in event of emergencies, he said. Still, extreme weather events can topple buildings. In 2018, two Amazon warehouse workers died in Baltimore when a building partially collapsed in a strong storm. The National Weather Service puts out extreme weather alerts via text messages, letting the public know in advance about dangerous conditions. Tornadoes are trickier to anticipate than hurricanes and snowstorms, but the weather service still issues warnings to those in their path. The weather service sent such a warning at about 8 p.m. local time Friday, about 30 minutes before the storm collapsed the Edwardsville Amazon delivery station, the workers said. Two Amazon employees who work in a facility across the street said workers huddled in bathrooms to protect themselves from the storm, unaware the building across the street had collapsed. Power outages blocked communications. They were sent home from work after 11 p.m. when it was deemed safe to travel.“After this, everyone is definitely afraid of not being able to keep their phones on them,” one of the workers said. “Most employees that I’ve talked to don’t keep their phones on them for personal conversation throughout the day, It’s genuinely for situations like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-collapse-at-amazon-warehouse-puts-spotlight-on-phone-ban-101639279243003.html

The UK recorded 58,194 cases on Friday, the highest number since January, though what portion were the Omicron variant is unclear.Modelling released on Saturday by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested Omicron is likely to cause a large wave of infections by January, and could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England in the next five months if no other measures are taken.The most pessimistic scenario foresees half a million people hospitalised with the virus by the end of April and said daily hospital admissions could be double the previous peak in January 2021. The study by the scientists, who help advise the British government, has not been peer reviewed.French health authorities have approved the use of an anti-body treatment made by AstraZeneca for high-risk people who show resistance to vaccines against coronavirus.The independent public health body HAS on Friday night announced “a greenlight for the preventive use of Evusheld... for patients with a very high-risk of contracting a severe form of Covid-19”.Evusheld, developed by the British-Swedish pharma company, this week received emergency use authorisation in the US for adults and children aged 12 and above.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing analytical models to determine when reopening travel from eight southern African countries would no longer impact the spread of the Omicron variant in the US, with an eye towards lifting restrictions implemented last month, the White House said on Friday.Taiwan has recorded its first case of the Omicron variant in a passenger who recently travelled to the southern African country of Eswatini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-kill-25k-to-75k-in-england-if-measures-not-taken-101639271277919.html

Covid-19 vaccine to Pfizer Inc.’s as a recommended booster shot and reduced the waiting time, responding to concerns about the increased spread caused by the omicron variant.Australia is cutting the standard waiting time for a booster shot to five months from six, following the first two doses. The approval came from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, the health department said Sunday in a statement. “ATAGI has also updated its advice and recommends booster doses be provided from five months after completion of the primary course, given the likelihood of ongoing transmission of both omicron and delta variants,” the department said.Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, saw the pace of new cases decline for the first time in six days. The state said Sunday there were 485 new infections, versus 560 reported Saturday. Victoria state said it recorded 1,069 additional cases, down from 1,193.The health department said more than 670,000 Australians had already received more than two doses of vaccine. The move to reduce waiting times means some 1.5 million people will be eligible for a booster starting Sunday, the Herald Sun newspaper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-adds-moderna-as-vaccine-booster-cuts-wait-time-for-3rd-shot-101639270218453.html

The ministry also claimed the summit was organised by the US to “draw lines of ideological prejudice, instrumentalise and weaponise democracy... (and) incite division and confrontation”.Instead, Beijing vowed to “resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of pseudo-democracies”.Ahead of the summit, China ramped up a propaganda blitz criticising US democracy as corrupt and a failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strengthen-democracy-biden-to-world-leaders-101639270952567.html

12-12-2021||World||Some 400,000 Palestinians vote in rare municipal elections||Palestinians took part in rare municipal elections across the occupied West Bank on Saturday, following months of simmering anger towards their government and the cancellation of promised parliamentary and presidential elections earlier this year.Some 400,000 Palestinians are eligible to vote in the election where they will select representatives for 154 village councils under the jurisdiction of the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority. Municipal elections are typically held every four to five years and last took place in 2017.The increasingly unpopular president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, confined the election to rural municipalities, postponing voting in the West Bank's major cities where anger towards his ruling Fatah party is most acute.Saturday's elections are also being boycotted by the militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. Hamas's spokesman, Abdulatif al-Qanou, told the Associated Press that the group wants parliamentary and presidential elections and considers holding the municipal vote alone a violation of previous agreements.Today's vote does not “satisfy the inspiration and needs of the Palestinian people.“ The popularity of the Palestinian government has plummeted since Abbas canceled long-awaited legislative and parliamentary elections in April.Abbas blamed the cancellation on uncertainty around whether Palestinians from east Jerusalem would be able to vote, although critics accused him of postponing out of fear that his party would lose to Hamas.Popularity for the militant group has surged among Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem since May's 11-day war, with many accusing the Palestinian Authority of doing little to aid their struggle against Israeli occupation.Anger towards the government has been further inflamed by the growing crackdown on political dissent, following the death of Palestinian Authority critic Nizar Banat, who died after being beaten by Palestinian security forces. The event ignited widespread demonstrations calling for Abbas' resignation.The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank through agreements signed with Israel during the height of the peace process in the 1990s. In 2007 Hamas drove Abbas' forces out of Gaza when it seized power after winning parliamentary elections. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Palestinians seek for a future state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-400-000-palestinians-vote-in-rare-municipal-elections-101639247843617.html
12-12-2021||India||India may invite 5 central Asian leaders for Republic Day: Officials||India is looking at the possibility of having the leaders of the five Central Asian states as the chief guests at next year’s Republic Day celebrations against the backdrop of the country’s focus on the strategic region for connectivity, trade and security. The move to send invitations to the heads of state of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan also fits in with the Indian government’s focus on multipolarity and rebalancing, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. However, the matter is yet to be finalised as responses were awaited from all the Central Asian states, said two people, including a diplomat from a Central Asian state. The chief guest for Republic Day celebrations is chosen in keeping with India’s strategic, diplomatic and economic interests, as well as New Delhi’s relations with the concerned country. Ties with the Central Asian states have been on the upswing in recent years following the government’s focus on the region. If the move goes ahead, it will be only the second time that heads of state of a bloc or group of countries have been invited to the Republic Day celebrations. In 2018, the heads of the ten countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) were the chief guests at the annual event. In 2009, the Kazakhstan president was the chief guest at Republic Day. The foreign ministers of the five Central Asian states are set to hold a meeting with their Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in New Delhi between December 18-19, the people cited above said. This will be the third such meeting of the foreign ministers since 2019, and India has offered a $1-billion line of credit to the five Central Asian states for projects in connectivity, energy, IT, agriculture, healthcare and education. The importance of the Central Asian states in the context of regional security has increased following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August. Top security officials of all five Central Asian states, Iran and Russia had attended a regional security dialogue on Afghanistan that was hosted by India on November 10. The Delhi Declaration of Afghanistan, issued after the meeting, said all eight countries were committed to combating terrorism to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a haven for global terrorism. All the countries had also called for the formation of a truly inclusive government in Kabul. Uzbekistan is crucial for India’s plans to boost connectivity with Central Asia as it is part of a trilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port along with Iran. 
12-12-2021||India||Reforms protected 98% bank a/c holders: Modi||Recent changes in law have provided a cumulative insurance cover of ₹76 trillion that protects deposits of 98% of all account holders in India’s banks, boosting confidence in the sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday.“Banks play a big role in the prosperity of the country, and depositors’ protection is equally important for the prosperity of banks,” Modi said at an event organised by the Union ministry of finance on Depositors First: Guaranteed Time-bound Deposit Insurance Payment up to ₹5 lakh. “If we want to save banks, then depositors have to be protected.”The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a specialised arm of the Reserve Bank of India, guarantees each depositor a maximum of ₹5 lakh, including principal and interest, if a bank fails.The government in February last year amended law to raise the insured amount from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh, and in August this year set a 90-day limit to provide the insured amount to account holders. The move was aimed at providing relief to the maximum number of depositors of stressed PMC Bank, Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank in a timebound manner.The system of covering bank depositors was introduced in the 1960s, the Prime Minister said. Earlier, out of the amount deposited in the bank, a sum of ₹50,000 was guaranteed. It was then raised to ₹1 lakh.Understanding the concerns of the poor, understanding the concern of the middle class, we increased this amount to ₹5 lakh,” Modi said. “Earlier, where there was no time limit for refund. Now our government has made it mandatory within 90 days.”In the past few days, more than 100,000 depositors have got back their money worth cumulatively over ₹13 billion that was stuck for years, Modi said. He handed over cheques to some depositors on the spot at Vigyan Bhawan in the Capital.The first portion of interim payments has been released by DICGC against claims received from depositors of 16 urban cooperative banks whose operations have been restricted by the central bank.The government is making efforts for financial inclusion, Modi said. As a result, almost every village has banking facilities, either a branch or a banking correspondent, within a radius of 5km, the Prime Minister said.Recent policy measures have provided facilities such as insurance and bank loans to a large, underserved segment of the poor, women, street vendors and small farmers, Modi said. More than half of Jan Dhan accounts belong to women, he said.It helped in the economic empowerment of women, he said. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the country’s financial inclusion initiative launched six years ago, has more than 403.5 million accounts with total deposits in excess of ₹1.3 trillion.The government has taken several steps to protect depositors’ interest and strengthen banks, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at the event. It has ensured that middle-class households, who have put their hard-earned savings in banks, get some additional protection, she said.She also pointed to getting money back in a timely manner. ”There were cases of people who had waited for their deposits for five years, six years, seven years and couldn’t get the money back because either the bank had to be liquidated, or some kind of amalgamation had to happen (legal processes often take time),” Sitharaman said.This was an “important milestone” in the protection of depositors, Reserve Bank governor Shaktikanta Das said on the occasion. He summed up the guiding principles of the Indian banking sector in four points – depositors first, deposit insurance, supervision for robust banking, and discerning depositors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reforms-protected-98-bank-a-c-holders-modi-101639333624930.html
12-12-2021||India||Kashi Vishwanath Corridor: ‘PM’s pet project rejuvenated the temple complex’||For years, the Kashi Vishwanath temple has been a part of Vijay Yadav’s weekly routine. The 28-year-old, who lives in the Pandeypur neighbourhood of Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi city, walks to offer his prayers to Hindu god Shiva, often braving masses of people, animals and garbage in the cramped lanes that lead to the centuries-old shrine.Now, Yadav feels the new Kashi Vishwanath corridor will transform the area, and the city. “Earlier, there was space crunch in the temple complex. The corridor has created a lot of space…5,000 devotees may remain present in the corridor at any time,” he said. “It is really grand.”Yadav is one of many devotees in Varanasi who are looking forward to the inauguration of the ₹700 crore Kashi Vishwanath Corridor on Monday. Many of them have memories attached to the old cobbled streets and the neighbourhood, but admit that the mega facelift project was necessary.“People want comfort and facilities during their visit. PM Modi knows it well, The corridor has rejuvenated and beautified the Kashi Vishwanath temple complex,” said Ashwini Chaubey, another pilgrim who lives in the Pandeypurneighbourhood.The redevelopment project, comprising 24 buildings constructed over 550,000 sq. ft, comes months ahead of a high-stakes election in Uttar Pradesh, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to return to power for a second consecutive term.Local BJP leaders say that as the project was envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and driven to completion by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, it will be a showpiece of the party’s poll campaign, especially in eastern Uttar Pradesh that sends 120lawmakers to the state’s assembly, out of a total of 403 seats.“This is matter of faith for us. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has added to the glory of sanatan dharma by getting the corridor constructed,” said BJP leader Somnath Vishwakarma.Moreover, as the temple complex attracts seven million tourists and devotees from across the country, the corridor is a key developmental project that is likely to rake up revenues, said officials.It has also fanned the party’s popularity among the Hindu religious communities and holy men. “The corridor has transformed the entire landscape of the area around the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. It is a direct link between the Baba Kashi Vishwanath Temple and River Ganga,” said Pandit Prasad Dikshit, a trustee of the Kashi Vishwanath Mandir Nyas, which oversees the temple’s functioning.Congress leader Shailendra Singh, however, criticised the project and said the Kashi Vishwanath Temple had been commercialised in the name of the corridor.“The corridor will give a political mileage to the BJP in the coming election, as the ruling party has started to showcase it already,” said Kaushal Kishore Mishra, a professor at the Banaras Hindu University.
12-12-2021||India||Beyond the News: Akali Dal turning 100 in lead-up to toughest fight||On December 14, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will join the country’s select club of centenarian political parties, after the Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, and the undivided Communist Party of India (CPI) which, inspired by the 1917 Russian revolution, took shape in Tashkent a couple of months ahead of the SAD in 1920.If the Congress was the product of the freedom struggle, the Akali Dal rose from a parallel movement for the liberation of gurdwaras which, till then, were controlled individually by priests (mahants). The Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925, the British were forced to bring defined the Sikh identity, placing their shrines under the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC).Jawaharlal Nehru was arrested during the Jaito Gurdwara Morcha near Faridkot. Mahatma Gandhi hailed the handing over of the keys to the Golden Temple to the movement’s leader, Baba Kharag Singh, as India’s first victory in the country’s struggle for freedom from the British.A prominent Delhi road is now named after Kharag Singh. He simultaneously served as president of the Akali Dal and leader of the Punjab Congress. In fact, the Congress-SAD dual membership was common practice till the 1942 Quit India Movement, when Kharag Singh’s successor, Master Tara Singh, whose was the last word in Sikh politics from 1930-65, defied the Congress to support recruitment of Sikhs in the British army in World War II.Among the many Akali leaders Tara Singh groomed for national roles represented the Congress-SAD overlap. They included India’s first defence minister, Baldev Singh, former external affairs minister Sardar Swaran Singh, and Sardar Hukam Singh, the third Speaker of the Lok Sabha. As former Rajya Sabha MP Tarlochan Singh told the House in a debate some years ago: “The whole of Punjab would’ve gone to Pakistan had Tara Singh not spurned Jinnah’s quid pro quo of a Sikh state in Pakistan at the time of the partition.” History’s witness also that the first non-Congress government after Independence was of the SAD’s Gian Singh Rarewala, who administered (as designated prime minister) the erstwhile PEPSU (Patiala and East Punjab States Union) from 1948-51, much before the rise of the then CPI leader EMS Namboodiripad as chief minister of Kerala in 1957.Like Namboodiripad, the government of Rarewala too was dismissed by the Centre. That marked the beginning of the SAD-Congress rivalry that continues till date, accentuated along the way by the events of 1980s and the earlier Punjabi Suba movement that led to the linguistic reorganisation (of the Indian east Punjab) into Punjab and Haryana. The CPI’s 1964 split, in the aftermath of the 1962 India-China war and the divisions in the global communist movement, saw Namboodiripad becoming the face of the breakaway CPI (Marxist).By some quirk of fate, these parties with a glorious past seem confronted today by an unexceptional future. There’d be a lot to introspect when the battle bruised Akali leadership assembles for a show of strength at Moga, near Ludhiana, on its founding day.For decades the foremost regional party of Punjab, the SAD is facing a crisis akin to what’s dogging the Congress. If the latter fell short of numbers in two successive general elections to be recognised as the official opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Akali Dal was a poor third in the 2017 assembly polls, trailing the victorious Congress and the fledgling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which became the principal opposition. The SAD’s downfall came after a decade of uninterrupted rule, a la the Congress in Delhi.Like the Congress where the Gandhi family exercises unbridled control, the Akalis were done in by charges of nepotism and perpetration of family rule by Parkash Singh Badal, the state’s tallest leader since the 1970s whom Prime Minister Narendra Modi once called the Nelson Mandela of Punjab. As five-time chief minister and the party numero uno, he favoured his son Sukhbir Badal, who now is the SAD chief, to the annoyance of many old-timers locally called the Taksalis. A few among them like former union minister S S Dhindsa and R S Brahmpura, a former MP, have since formed their own breakaway Akali Dal (Samyukta). Together with Amarinder Singh, the chief minister-turned-Congress rebel, they’re slated to enter the poll fray in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to set up a four-cornered contest in the 2022 assembly elections.To be fair, Sukhbir Badal has worked hard to regain the core Akali constituency on parting company with the BJP over the three farm laws since withdrawn by the Modi regime. To expand his party’s appeal, he has a pre-poll alliance with Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party, whose precursor, DS-4 (Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangarsh Samiti) had its origins in Punjab on Kanshi Ram’s watch in 1971. While the upcoming polls are for the AAP an opportunity, they’re an acid test for Sukhbir Badal and the Congress, now led by the state’s first Dalit chief minister, Charanjit Singh Channi. Much will depend on how the BJP-led formation that’s in-the-making with an eye on the Hindu vote, fares in its first outing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beyond-the-news-akali-dal-turning-100-in-lead-up-to-toughest-fight-101639333326669.html
12-12-2021||India||Kashi Vishwanath Corridor: Sacred site gets a mega facelift||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Monday inaugurate the ₹700 crore Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, which aims to transform the area around the centuries-old temple in Varanasi with state-of-the-art buildings and provide a clear access to the Ganga.The mega facelift project built across 550,000 sq. ft comprises 24 buildings that include an emporium, a museum, a sacred kitchen, a Vedic library, a centre to store ancient scriptures, a city gallery, and a food court – all built around the temple that serves as one of the nerve centres of the Hindu faith, attracting seven million pilgrims annually.The showpiece of the project is restoration of the link between the Ganga and the temple, an ancient connection that had been cut off by years of encroachment, construction and population, said officials responsible for the corridor and its architects. Once open, the corridor will enable a pilgrim to take a boat from any of Varanasi’s numerous ghats to the sprawling new entrance to the temple complex built at the confluence of the Lalita Ghat and Jalasen Ghat.The project’s architect, Bimal Patel, said Modi wanted the corridor to enable devotees to walk directly to the temple after collecting water from the Ganga.“The corridor should be a link between the Ganga and the temple. We worked to restore the grandeur of the temple premises as per the vision of PM Modi,” said Patel.On Monday, Modi is expected to reach the gate of the corridor facing the Ganga by boat, said officials with knowledge of the matter. At the gate, he will collect water from Ganga, and walk to the temple, situated on one end of the 500 metre-long corridor. On his way, he will pass the state-of-the-art facilities, walls with Sanskrit shlokas inscribed on them, overhanging eaves, and a gallery storing scriptures.“The original structure of the Kashi Vishwanath temple has not been tampered with; it has been allowed to remain as it is. The corridor has increased the facilities for the tourists and beautified the temple premises,” said Patel.YEARS IN THE MAKINGWork on the facelift began in December 2019, but the idea germinated shortly after Modi swept to power in 2014, said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and people in the know of developments, requesting anonymity.The next year, authorities ordered a survey to map out how the congested area could be given a facelift, said the people. In 2018, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath constituted the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board (SKVSADB), which purchased around 300 buildings in the vicinity of the temple, and demolished them to create space for the corridor.At the time, some residents protested the construction work in what they thought was a holy space. They said, along with some leaders from opposition parties, that the redevelopment project will erase the area’s antiquity, raze temples and unnecessarily commercialise the area. Some tenants of buildings in the area even approached the Allahabad high court, but in 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed their petition. The SKVSADB later called the allegations baseless and assured that all temples found in the area were preserved.Modi laid the foundation of the corridor on March 8, 2019. In December 2019, Gujarat-based PSP Projectswas awarded the contract. Adityanath monitored the progress of the project, and inspected the corridor around 50 times in the past two years, said an official, who requested anonymity. The pandemic forced the work to halt twice in 2020 and 2021, but a fleet of 1,200 workers, mostly from West Bengal, worked round-the-clock once the second wave of Covid-19 abated.“There are 24 buildings in the corridor. All buildings have been constructed and beautified. These are being decorated with special lights for the programme,” said SKVSADB chief executive officer Sunil Verma. A special sky beam light system has been installed in the corridor, to be visible from around 2km away, SKVSADB public relation officer Piyush Tiwari said.MANY CHALLENGESA particular challenge before the architects and officials was manoeuvring the revamp project in an area where thousands of people lived in cheek-by-jowl homes, often jostling with overflowing drains and cows in cramped, centuries-old lanes. Despite the historical significance of the spot, workers found that many buildings were derelict, civic amenities were inadequate and encroachment rampant.Earlier, the temple complex was surrounded by buildings on three sides and there was only one large gate for visitors on the south side of the complex. Now, the adjoining buildings and encroachments have been removed, and seven gates have been built with chunar stones, including a majestic gate opening up to the ghat.“One of these grand gates is at the ghat in order that the devotees may reach Kashi Vishwanath Dham by boat as well,” said Verma.During the construction, workers often found bits and pieces of faith entwined in homes and commercial establishments – small temples or idols installed by unknown people over the decades. Many of these temples were preserved and will be shown in the main gallery of the complex, said officials.“The corridor will give glimpses of the sculptural art and architectural history of temples over 300 years because the 41 temples, which were found among the buildings purchased and demolished, have been preserved,” said Atul Tripathi, head of the history department at Banaras Hindu University.Conversation on revamping the Kashi Vishwanath temple complex began as early as 1916, when Mahatma Gandhi visited the area and expressed anger over the filth strewn on the streets, he said. “Gandhiji wanted the surroundings clean, and entire surroundings to exude spirituality,” Tripathi said. “In a way, Gandhiji’s vision is being realised now.”

In a Facebook post, the minister said the infected person was a native of the state who had recently returned from the United Kingdom. She said the patient’s condition was stable and there was no need to panic and the government had taken all steps to curb the spread of the new variant. She said the person arrived In Kochi on December 6 via Abu Dhabi and tested positive after two days of his arrival for Covid-19. His samples were rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the state capital. The minister said 149 passengers who travelled in the same flight were alerted about the new development and asked to remain in strict quarantine for two weeks. The minister said his wife and mother also tested positive and results of their samples will be due in a couple of days. “No need for panic but we have to be vigilant and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly,” she said. Struggling with the heavy Covid-19 caseload the state was on high alert after the new variant was detected in the country last month. For more than six months it has been reporting the maximum number of virus cases in the country and as far as death rate is concerned, it is on second spot after Maharashtra. The Union government had sent several letters and reminders to the state to increase tests and streamline containment measures in view of the high number of cases.

The government has officially bought 500 BTC and is distributing them to all residents of the country.” While the tweet was brought down a few minutes later, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said the matter was discussed with the micro-blogging platform.“The Twitter handle of PM @narendramodi was very briefly compromised. The matter was escalated to Twitter and the account has been immediately secured. In the brief period that the account was compromised, any Tweet shared must be ignored,” PMO tweeted. Twitter said its probe revealed that “there are no signs of any other impacted accounts at this time”. “We have 24X7 open lines of communication with the PM’s Office and our teams took necessary steps to secure the compromised account as soon as we became aware of this activity. Our investigation has revealed that there are no signs of any other impacted accounts at this time,” Twitter India spokesperson said.Several Opposition leaders expressed concerns over the breach, saying it exposed chinks in the cyber security.Indian Youth Congress president BV Srinivas made a cheeky comment in response to a tweet on the hacking. “Good Morning Modi ji, Sab Changa Si?” he posted on Twitter, while sharing screenshots of the now deleted tweet from Modi’s account.

12-12-2021||India||In last message, CDS Rawat invoked spirit of 1971 war heroes||In his last message, recorded the evening before his death in a helicopter crash on December 8, late chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat paid tributes to the heroes of the 1971 India-Pakistan war and invited citizens to take part in the golden jubilee celebrations of the decisive victory against the neighbour, and the liberation of Bangladesh. The 70-second video clip was played on Sunday at the inauguration of the Swarnim Vijay Parv at India Gate by defence minister Rajnath Singh. The three-day event, during December 12-14, will mark the culmination of year-long celebrations organised across the country to commemorate the 50th anniversary of victory in the 1971 war.“I extend my best wishes to all soldiers of the Indian armed forces on the occasion of Swarnim Vijay Parv. I remember the brave men of the armed forces and offer tributes to the sacrifices made by them in the war,” Rawat said in his message. “It is a matter of good fortune that the Vijay Parv is being celebrated under the shade of Amar Jawan Jyoti, which was set up in the memory of our brave men killed in action. We invited all citizens to take part in the celebrations,” he concluded. General Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder and his staff officer Lt Colonel Harjinder Singh were among the 13 people killed in the Mi-17V5 helicopter crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu. Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers when the chopper crashed seven minutes from its destination. Inaugurating the Swarnim Vijay Parv, the defence minister said, “In the untimely death of General Rawat, India has lost a brave soldier, an able advisor and a lively person. He was looking forward to taking part in the Swarnim Vijay Parv.” Paying tributes to the soldiers who took part in the war, the minister said the “glorious victory” in 1971 changed the history and geography of South Asia, and the country would remain indebted to the sacrifices made by its warriors. “This festival is a testament to the fact that the memories of 1971 are still fresh in the heart of every Indian. At the same time, it is a symbol of the zeal, passion and valour our forces displayed during the 1971 war. It inspires us to keep moving forward on the path of nation’s progress with the same zeal and passion.” The atrocities committed on the people of then East Pakistan were a threat to entire humanity, and it was India’s responsibility to liberate them, he said, referring to the barbarism carried out by the Pakistan army under Operation Searchlight, a crackdown to crush the voices of self-determination.“Our armed forces supported Mukti Bahini, helped lakhs of refugees and prevented any kind of aggression from western and northern sectors. They ensured that the credibility of India’s commitment towards peace, justice and humanity in the world community is maintained,” the minister said. Singh said the 1971 war as among the most decisive wars in the world after the two World Wars. “This war tells us that the partition of India on the basis of religion was a historic mistake. Pakistan was born in the name of one religion, but it could not remain one. After the defeat in 1971, it is continuously fighting a proxy war…We won in a direct war and the victory will be ours in indirect war as well,” he added. The event came a day after paratroopers of the army carried out a mass jump at a premier base in Agra to mark 50 years of the historic battalion-sized Tangail airdrop north of Dhaka during the 1971 war, a critical operation that set the stage for surrender by the rival army. Central Army commander Lt General Yogendra Dimri led the jump involving 120 elite paratroopers and four veterans who took part in the 1971 war. The army and the air force dedicated the jump to Rawat and the 12 others killed in the helicopter crash.

12-12-2021||India||Row over CBSE exam question on women||The reading comprehension section of the Class X first term English test paper of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) that casts women in a regressive light has come in for heavy criticism from parents and educationists. “What people were slow to observe was that the emancipation of the wife destroyed the parent’s authority over children,” reads part of the passage to test comprehension of students in the examination held on Saturday. “It was only by accepting her husband’s sway that she (wife) could gain obedience from the young,” reads another part of the passage. The passage, divided into three sections, begins by stating, “Some teenagers live in a world of their own,” and goes on to say how they were disciplined a century ago and in the twentieth century. It is followed by eight multiple choice questions. The second question asked if the writer of the passage “seems to be a male chauvinist pig / an arrogant person; takes a light-hearted approach to life; is a disgruntled husband; has his family’s welfare at his heart.” The board is yet to release the answer key. “It is a passage so offensive to women that I really don’t know how any committee could allow this to be published in a CBSE exam paper,” said Chandra Viswanathan of the English Learning Foundation. “But the worst is the way the passage destroys all the small steps that women have made in the last few decades to ensure a more equal place in family, society and workplace.”“It is unthinkable why CBSE, which certifies and runs schools all over the country and publishes textbooks that are in every child’s schoolbag, would publish a passage as derogatory to women as this in a Class X exam paper,” Viswanathan said. What she found most disturbing was that school principals and teachers have not objected to this. “Only a few children and parents found it troubling,” Viswanathan said. A parent of one of the students who appeared for the exam described the passage as “ridiculous and rubbish”. “My daughter and her classmates seemed disturbed. They haven’t got any reaction from teachers but its feel nice to see that some children understand that this is wrong. I was infuriated when I read the passage. They are trying to reinforce rudimentary ideas,” the parent said, seeking anonymity.Everyone must protest against “such nonsense” being thrust into young minds, Balaji Sampath, founder of Chennai-based education NGO Aid India, said in a social media post. “CBSE and education boards are supposed to promote progressive ideals and help children visualise a better world,” he said. “But through this passage CBSE is teaching students that in a perfect world wives must obey their husbands.”K Srinivasan, CBSE’s regional officer in Chennai, did not respond to HT’s phone calls and text messages.A Delhi CBSE spokesperson said the “matter will be referred to subject experts for considered views as per the preset procedures of the board”.“As regards the correct answer option and the answer key released by the board, it is clarified that if the experts opine that the passage elicits multiple interpretations, appropriate action will be taken to protect the interest of the students,” the spokesperson said. The Congress party in Tamil Nadu reacted strongly to the issue. “What are we teaching our children? CBSE has to give an explanation and tender an apology for inflicting our children with this,” Congress spokesperson Lakshmi Ramachandran said.The exam paper was a “misogynistic patriarchal claptrap propagated by this regressive” Bharatiya Janata Party regime, Congress parliamentarian Karti Chidambaram said on Twitter. “Will be raising this in Parliament,” he tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party did not react to the case.

The veteran politician, who spent a brief term of 18 days as Goa’s chief minister back in 1990, and who is the owner of Churchill Brothers Football Club has a chequered political career in which he was one of the founding members of the now nearly defunct United Goans Democratic Party. He joined the Congress, founded the now defunct Save Goa Party, besides also having a stint in the Nationalist Congress Party. Alemao is also a co-accused in the Louis Berger bribery case along with Digambar Kamat of the Congress under whose tenure as chief minister Alemao was the minister of Public Works between 2007 and 2012. He spent a month in jail before he was granted bail. This will be Alemao’s second entry into the TMC having earlier contested the 2014 Parliamentary elections as a TMC candidate from the South Goa parliamentary seat. Alemao had earlier called on Banerjee in Kolkata late last month and upon his return to Goa said that he respected Banerjee for what she was doing and would take a decision on his future plans in two weeks. His two week deadline coincided with Banerjee’s planned visit to the state. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will hold a series of meetings in Goa on Monday and Tuesday including three public meetings over the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-legislator-churchill-alemao-to-join-tmc-during-mamata-s-goa-visit-101639329603764.html
12-12-2021||India||PFI dabbles in real estate in a big way, owns bar in middle-east, says ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) which raided the houses and offices of many Popular Front of India (PFI) leaders in Kerala on December 8 said some of the leaders run a bar cum hotel in Abu Dhabi and they were into the real estate business in a big way in the state and abroad to fund their activities. The ED had raided many premises across the state and claimed that it seized several incriminating documents. In a statement the central agency said seized documents show some of its leaders were into real estate business in Kerala and abroad and they own a bar and hotel in Abu Dhabi. It said it suspected that some of the NGOs controlled by the outfit like ‘Rehab India Foundation’ were used for money-laundering activities. It said at some places PFI workers resisted the raid fiercely and the agency was forced to take the help of the Central Reserve Police Force to complete the raid. The agency said some of the seized documents clearly showed that its leaders were into real estate business to fund their activities. Searches were conducted at the residential premises of PFI leader Shafeeq Payath in Kannur, B P Abdul Razak in Malappuram, M K Ashraf in Muvattupuzha and offices of a villa project Munnar Villa Vista Project in Idukki. The agency said a detailed investigation is underway. The PFI, however, denied all charges raised by the ED and said it was a move aimed at discrediting community members and single them out on the provocation of Sangh Parivar outfits. “With assembly elections round the corner in Uttar Pradesh right-wing outifts are targeting minority organizations and institutions for polarization. In some of the houses only women were there and there was not a single woman in the raiding team. The PFI can’t be browbeaten like this,” said its secretary Anees Ahammad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfi-dabbles-in-real-estate-in-a-big-way-owns-bar-in-middle-east-says-ed-101639326603482.html

The Ram temple in Ayodhya is being developed on the lines of the Vatican City and Mecca so that it could become a symbol of the religion. “It would become a symbol of Hindutva,” he said. The construction of the temple is going on in a full swing as the target is to open the temple for the public by the end of 2023 though the entire complex will be ready only by 2025. By 2023 end, the ground floor of the temple is likely to be completed. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple will be on the ground floor. Patna's Mahavir Mandir has donated ₹2 crore for Ram mandir Trust on Saturday, which was the second instalment of the donation.The first phase of the construction of the foundation of the temple was completed in September. The second later will be made up of Karnataka's granite and Mirzapur's sandstone.In Rajasthan, work is going on to prepare stone slabs from Rajasthan's Bansi Paharpur. One lakh cubic feet of carved slabs are ready for the construction of the Ram temple.Inside the premises, six temples dedicated to Lord Surya, Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva, Lord Durga, Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma will be constructed. From the end of October, construction of the base of the superstructure started and in November, work for the filling of the foundation began.The sanctum sanctorum of the temple will be made in a way so that every Ram Navami, sun rays fall inside. The design will be inspired by Konark's Sun Temple, reports said.The temple will display the bricks which were donated between 1987 and 1989, during the Ram Mandir movement. Bricks will not be used in the construction as they are not durable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-vatican-mecca-vhp-says-ram-temple-would-become-symbol-of-hindutva-101639321737075.html

12-12-2021||India||India may host leaders of 5 Central Asian states as chief guests for Republic Day 2022||India is looking at the possibility of having the leaders of the five Central Asian states as the chief guests at next year’s Republic Day against the backdrop of the country’s focus on the strategic region for connectivity, trade and security. The move to send invitations to the heads of state of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan also fits in with the Indian government’s focus on multipolarity and rebalancing, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. However, the matter is yet to be finalised as responses were awaited from all the Central Asian states, said two people, including a diplomat from a Central Asian state. The chief guest for Republic Day celebrations is chosen in keeping with India’s strategic, diplomatic and economic interests, as well as New Delhi’s relations with the concerned country. Ties with the Central Asian states have been on the upswing in recent years following the government’s focus on the region. If the move goes ahead, it will be only the second time that the heads of state of a bloc or group of countries have been invited to the Republic Day celebrations. In 2018, the heads of the 10 countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) were the chief guests at the annual event. In 2009, the Kazakhstan president was the chief guest at the Republic Day. The foreign ministers of the five Central Asian states are set to hold a meeting with their Indian counterpart S Jaishankar in New Delhi during December 18-19, the people cited above said. This will be the third such meeting of the foreign ministers since 2019 and India has offered a $1-billion line of credit to the five Central Asian states for projects in connectivity, energy, IT, agriculture, healthcare and education. The importance of the Central Asian states in the context of regional security has increased following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August. Top security officials of all five Central Asian states, Iran and Russia had attended a regional security dialogue on Afghanistan that was hosted by India on November 10. The Delhi Declaration of Afghanistan, issued after the meeting, said all eight countries were committed to combat terrorism to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a safe haven for global terrorism. All the countries had also called for the formation of a truly inclusive government in Kabul. Uzbekistan is crucial for India’s plans to boost connectivity with Central Asia as it is part of a trilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port along with Iran.

Rahul Gandhi specifically talked about Amarinder Singh, former Punjab chief minister who has now exited the party and Ghulam Nabi Azad, a rebel Congress leader of the G-23 grouping.Amarinder Singh was asked to perform and was never disrespected, Rahul has purportedly told Sanjay Raut. Congress would have been finished in Punjab, had the party not acted tough. “He was the chief minister of Punjab, and under his leadership, Congress’ graph dropped. We conducted a poll, and only 6% of people were in favour of the chief minister. Those who were not in the race for the chief ministership got more responses than him. He (Singh) was asked to fulfil the promises made to the people ahead of the election, but his response was cold," Rahul Gandhi told Raut, according to the Sena MP.Amarinder Singh has floated his own party, Punjab Lok Congress, which will contest the assembly elections in 2022 against the Congress either alone or in alliance with the BJP. After resigning from the CM's post, Amarinder Singh quit the party as he said he was humiliated by the Congress.On Ghulam Nabi Azad, a G-23 leader, Rahul Gandhi said he never disrespected him. After his Rajya Sabha term ended, the party asked Azad to head the party's J&K unit but he refused that saying that the party is non-existent there. "He can become the chief minister again after elections. But, he refused saying the Congress didn't exist there. Azad ji has been the chief minister there and he thinks the Congress doesn't exist there," Rahul Gandhi told Raut.Raut was in New Delhi recently and met both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.

The former Bihar BJP chief, currently serving as health minister in the state government, said there’s a need to break all organisations related to terrorism for “world peace”.“We've seen proof of Pakistan's involvement in guarding and promoting terrorism. For world peace, we've to break all the organizations related to terrorism. So we'll welcome if any country tries to eliminate it,” news agency ANI quoted Pandey as saying.Saudi Arabia’s minister of Islamic affairs directed mosques to warn Muslims during the next Friday sermon against associating with members of Tablighi Jamaat. The minister has also directed that the mosques should include a declaration of the "misguidance, deviation and danger of this group" and note that it is one of the "gates of terrorism, even if they claim otherwise," reported news agency ANI."His Excellency the Minister of Islamic Affairs, Dr.#Abdullatif Al_Alsheikh directed the mosques' preachers and the mosques that held Friday prayer temporary to allocate the next Friday sermon 5/6/1443 H to warn against (the Tablighi and Da'wah group) which is called (Al Ahbab)," tweeted Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Islamic Affairs.The Saudi government has also directed the mosques to mention the "most prominent mistakes" of the group and highlight that they are a “danger to society”, according to ANI. As per the report, they have also been asked to issue a statement that "affiliation with partisan groups, including (the Tablighi and Da'wah Group) is prohibited in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."Tablighi Jamaat is a transnational Sunni Islamic missionary movement that focuses on encouraging Muslims to follow the pure form of Sunni Islam.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-welcomes-saudi-arabia-s-gates-of-terrorism-order-on-tablighi-jamaat-101639318678335.html
12-12-2021||India||India’s move to send medicines for Afghan kids draws praise from Taliban||India’s move to send 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines to Afghanistan has drawn praise from the Taliban at a time when Pakistan continues to create hurdles in the shipment of wheat offered by the Indian side via the Wagah land border crossing.A special charter flight that brought 104 people, most of them Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Kabul to New Delhi on Friday carried back medicines meant for the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul. The main children’s hospital in the Afghan capital is grappling with a growing number of children affected by malnutrition.“These medicines will be handed over to the representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Kabul and will be administered at the Indira Gandhi Children’s Hospital, Kabul,” the external affairs ministry said.Taliban deputy spokesperson Ahmadullah Wasiq tweeted in Pashto that important medical equipment would also be brought in from India and made available to hospitals. In another tweet, he added: “India is a leading country in the region. Afghanistan-India relations are very vital.”Abdul Kahar Balkhi, the spokesperson of the Taliban’s foreign ministry, said on Twitter: “We appreciate the arrival of...Indian-assisted medicine to Indira Gandhi Children’s Hospital in Kabul.” He added the charter flight operated by Kam Air had brought back 85 Afghan nationals who were stuck in India and this “travel process will continue”.Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay said the “life-saving medicines will help many families in this difficult time”.The consignment of medicines was the first tranche of humanitarian aid provided by India since the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban. The Indian side does not recognise the Taliban regime but has repeatedly said it will provide aid to the Afghan people against the backdrop of a looming humanitarian crisis.India’s offer to provide 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistani land routes, however, has been hamstrung by conditions attached to the move by Islamabad, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. On December 3, Pakistan said it would allow wheat and medicines to be shipped via the Wagah land border crossing in Afghan trucks.However, Pakistan also told the Indian side that the entire consignment of wheat should be transported within December, the people said. The wheat is to be carried from Wagah by trucks that bring Afghan products to the Indian side. The people said only 30 to 40 Afghan trucks made the daily trip to Wagah and it was unlikely that 50,000 tonnes of wheat could be sent via the land route by the end of this month.Pakistan has allowed the wheat to be transported from Wagah to Torkham, a key border crossing between Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province and Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, where the aid would be handed over to the World Food Programme (WFP), the food assistance branch of the UN, since the Indian side doesn’t recognise the Taliban regime.Even the Taliban leadership, facing severe problems due to food shortages, has pushed the Pakistan government for the speedy shipment of the wheat. The Taliban’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, raised the delay in the shipping of the wheat with an intermediary as recently as December 7.India made the proposal for shipping the wheat and medicines via Pakistani soil on October 7, and received a response from the Pakistan government only on November 24.

The arrests were made from a residential building in Gulshan Colony after a team of officers from the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) of the Uttar Pradesh police came from Lucknow to trace Mufizul Rehman, an alleged human trafficker, Kolkata police officers said on condition of anonymity. The ATS officers contacted their counterparts in the city police headquarters at Lalbazar. Although such arrests of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh is not uncommon in Bengal, so many people have not been held in Kolkata during a single raid in recent years, the officers added. “The youths were living in an apartment that was used to run a Madrassa. None of them had valid passports or visas but some fake Indian identity cards were seized during the raid,” an officer said. “Rehman was arrested from the spot and taken into custody by the UP ATS team. He will be taken to Lucknow on a transit remand while the men will be produced before a local court on Monday,” the officer added. Rehman is suspected to have helped them enter India. Other residents of the building told the police that they arrived around 45 days ago but never interacted with the local people. With Kolkata gearing up for the December 19 municipal elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) upped the ante after the arrests. BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, who recently accused the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of turning Kolkata into Bangladesh by changing the city’s demographic character, said, “The arrests have vindicated our stand.” “It is indeed surprising that the city police had no information about these illegal Bangladeshi nationals and the arrests were made only after a team of UP ATS officers came looking for a suspect. Kolkata is becoming a haven for infiltrators from Bangladesh and the TMC is looking the other way,” said Majumdar. No TMC leader commended on the incident till Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-bangladeshi-men-nabbed-in-kolkata-after-up-police-come-looking-for-trafficker-101639316282105.html

12-12-2021||India||In last message, General Rawat paid tribute to 1971 war heroes||In his last message, recorded the evening before his death in a helicopter crash on December 8, late chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat paid tributes to the heroes of the 1971 India-Pakistan war and invited citizens to take part in the golden jubilee celebrations of the decisive victory against the neighbour and the liberation of Bangladesh. The 70-second video clip was played on Sunday at the inauguration of the Swarnim Vijay Parv at India Gate by defence minister Rajnath Singh. The three-day event, from December 12-14, will mark the culmination of year-long celebrations organised across the country to commemorate the 50th anniversary of victory in the 1971 war.“I extend my best wishes to all soldiers of the Indian armed forces on the occasion of Swarnim Vijay Parv. I remember the brave men of the armed forces and offer tributes to the sacrifices made by them in the war,” Rawat said in his message. “It is a matter of good fortune that the Vijay Parv is being celebrated under the shade of Amar Jawan Jyoti, which was set up in the memory of our brave men killed in action. We invited all citizens to take part in the celebrations,” he concluded. General Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder and his staff officer Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh were among the 13 people killed in the Mi-17V5 helicopter crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers there when the chopper crashed seven minutes away from its destination. Inaugurating the Swarnim Vijay Parv, the defence minister said, “In the untimely death of General Rawat, India has lost a brave soldier, an able advisor and a lively person. He was looking forward to taking part in the Swarnim Vijay Parv.” Paying tributes to the soldiers who took part in the war, the minister said the “glorious victory” in 1971 changed the history and geography of South Asia and the country would remain indebted to the sacrifices made by its warriors. “This festival is a testament to the fact that the memories of 1971 are still fresh in the heart of every Indian. At the same time, it is a symbol of the zeal, passion and valour our forces displayed during the 1971 war. It inspires us to keep moving forward on the path of nation’s progress with the same zeal and passion.” Singh said the atrocities committed on the people of then East Pakistan were a threat to entire humanity and it was India’s responsibility to liberate them. He was referring to the barbarism carried out by the Pakistan army under Operation Searchlight, a crackdown to crush the voices of self-determination.“Our armed forces supported Mukti Bahini, helped lakhs of refugees and prevented any kind of aggression from western and northern sectors. They ensured that the credibility of India’s commitment towards peace, justice and humanity in the world community is maintained,” the minister said. Singh said the 1971 war as among the most decisive wars in the world after the two World Wars. “This war tells us that the Partition of India on the basis of religion was a historic mistake. Pakistan was born in the name of one religion but it could not remain one. After the defeat in 1971, it is continuously fighting a proxy war…We won in a direct war and the victory will be ours in indirect war as well,” he added. The event came a day after paratroopers of the army carried out a mass jump at a premier base in Agra to mark 50 years of the historic battalion-sized Tangail airdrop north of Dhaka during the 1971 war, a critical operation that set the stage for surrender by the rival army. Central Army commander Lieutenant General Yogendra Dimri led the mass jump involving 120 elite paratroopers and four veterans who took part in the 1971 war. The army and the air force dedicated the jump to Rawat and the 12 others killed in the helicopter crash.

12-12-2021||India||‘Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi have challenge to save Congress’: Sena MP Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena on Sunday said that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have the task to save the Congress party. Sena leader Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column Rokhthok in party mouthpiece Saamana, said that the only way to save the Congress is through staunch nationalism, which Lokmanya Tilak used to bring the party out of the meeting rooms to people on the streets. Raut while praising Rahul and Priyanka for their efforts to revive the party, said that the ‘seniors’ in Congress have been given their dues, but they are not ready to take the responsibility when the party needs them the most. Raut, who met Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra last week in New Delhi, said that Gandhi faces his biggest challenge to revive the party. He added that a picture has been created that opposition parties are not ready to unite under the leadership of Gandhi, which is not entirely true. “Congress got a life after the rise of Lokmanya Tilak. He brought Congress out of the discussion rooms onto the ground. He created public awareness and the Swadeshi movement through the newspapers like Maratha and Kesari... Tilak’s contribution was unparallel and he completely changed the character of Congress... Lokmanya gave Congress staunch nationalism... The brother-sister duo of Rahul-Priyanka has the challenge to save the Congress. It can be saved through Lokmanya’s way [of] staunch nationalism. The inferiority complex set in the society through the false prosperity and dazzle of BJP-Modi has to be removed,” Raut wrote in his column RokhThok published in Sena mouthpiece Saamana.He said that the drums for the 2024 general election have started beating. “The assembly election in five states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab is like the dress rehearsal for the 2024 election,” he said, adding that Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is “roaming the country” with the intent to form a new Opposition front.Days after Mamata Banerjee, during her Mumbai visit, remarked on the existence of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party took a pro-Congress stand and maintained that there can’t be an Opposition front without the Congress, as it would benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Subsequently, Raut met Gandhi on December 7 and Vadra on December 8 in New Delhi.“Doubts are raised over Rahul Gandhi’s leadership. The opposition parties in the country are not ready to unite under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership. Therefore, Modi and his party have a clear road ahead, such a picture has been created. This is not entirely true,” Raut wrote.Raut mentioned some discussions that were held during his meeting with Gandhi and Vadra, including Banerjee, the use of central agencies against Opposition party leaders, and senior Congress leaders quitting the grand old party. Raut said that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s husband Robert Vadra was served 69 notices from the Income Tax Department right after she went to Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, where eight people, including four farmers, were mowed to death by a car. He wrote that Priyanka said she won’t back down and will continue her fight. The Sena MP added that in his discussion with Rahul Gandhi, the latter asked the question about what Mamata Banerjee wants. “What does she really want? No matter how much she criticises me, I will not speak on her,” Raut quoted Rahul in the column.The Sena leader added that in the past, many people have written the obituary of Congress after its electoral debacle in 1967. Though the party faced defeats in the last decade, the recent bye-poll results showed that Congress can win. “It was said that the future of the party was bleak after the death of Pandit Nehru. After his death, Congress was routed in eight states. The opposition had written an obituary and performed last rites on the Congress, but after every defeat, Congress stood up. In the last 10 years, Congress is facing defeats, but it cannot be said that it is finished. Congress won by-polls in 13 states and after that Prime Minister Narendra Modi repealed the three farm laws,” Raut said in the column.Regarding senior Congress leaders quitting the party, Rahul, according to the column, said, “The party has given these senior leaders a lot, but when the party needs them they are taking a different stand now. What can I do?” About former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh quitting the Congress, Rahul said, “He was the chief minister of Punjab, and under his leadership, Congress’ graph dropped. We conducted a poll, and only 6% of people were in favour of the chief minister. Those who were not in the race for the chief ministership got more responses than him. He (Singh) was asked to fulfil the promises made to the people ahead of the election, but his response was cold. He was asked to perform, or the party would have to take some action. After that, the seniors in the party backed Amarinder and told me not to take tough decisions. Had we not removed him, the Congress would have been finished in Punjab. What should we do with such seniors? I have never disrespected anybody...,” the column quoted Rahul.Rahul Gandhi further said that he never disrespected Ghulam Nabi Azad either. He said that Azad was asked to head the party’s Jammu Kashmir unit after his term in the Rajya Sabha ended. “For several years, he has been in power through the party. He was the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. After his term ended in Rajya Sabha, I had a discussion with him and asked him to head the party in Jammu and Kashmir. And said that he could become the chief minister again...but he declined the offer. He said that the party is nonexistent there,” Gandhi was quoted in the column.

He is stable and is undergoing treatment at the hospital. Other members of the patient's family have been reported negative. Other people who came in contact with the patient concerned are being traced and all of them will be tested by the administration. Samples were taken from the person concerned at Nagpur airport on December 4," said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B.Karnataka on Sunday reported its third case of Omicron after a 34-year-old man, who has returned from South Africa testes positive with this variant.In Chandigarh, a 20-year-old Italian resident tested positive with the variant marking the first case of the city.In Andhra Pradesh, a 34-year-old who came from Ireland was confirmed Covid positive with the Omicron variant.What India's Omicron cases tell about the new variant so farIndia's Omicron cases offer a wide range of ages with even a one-year-old and a three-year-old having tested positive for the new variant.All patients of the Omicron variant are majorly asymptomatic and are not showing signs of any severe illness.A majority of the patients are starting to recover within a week.Light fever and extreme tiredness are some of the common symptoms which all Omicron patients have reported. Excepting a few cases, most of the Omicron patients in India have foreign travel history.On December 2, the first two Omicron cases were confirmed in India, almost a week after South Africa identified the new variant and raised the alarm over its rapid transmission.The one-and-a-half-year-old girl who was detected with the Omicron variant has been discharged while the three-year-old boy with this variant has started recovering, reports said on Saturday.The Omicron variant, which appears to be spreading faster than Delta but causing mild illness, has now spread to around 58 countries, according to the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-chandigarh-andhra-pradesh-omicron-confirmed-in-nagpur-tally-rises-to-37-101639304342053.html

They should be ashamed of themselves; they were dancing in Goa during an election campaign, Dhami said targetting Priyanka Gandhi who recently took part in a fold dance performance of the tribal women of Morpirla village.Without naming the Congress, Dhami said, "We have lost bravehearts of the country. The entire country is mourning. He (Gen Rawat) was very connected to Uttarakhand. He always used to think of Uttarakhand's development. The day his last rites were performed, a political party was celebrating. They should be ashamed. After all, they live in this country. They are in this country only physically, their soul is somewhere else. That's why they don't care," Dhami said.Congress president Sonia Gandhi calls off birthday celebrations over CDS Rawat’s demise #WATCH When CDS Rawat was being cremated, a party was celebrating.

And out of those 60 years, one family rules the country for 55 years. They never got connected with our soldiers.

Everyone must have seen the video on television, Dhami told the gathering. On December 8, an IAF helicopter carrying 14 on board crashed in Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, resulting in the death of 13. IAF Group Captain Varun Singh is the only survivor of the crash. With major burns in the maximum part of his body, he is being treated at Command Hospital in Bengaluru.As the nation bid a tearful adieu to its heroes, several state governments have taken action against offensive messages against General Rawat or any late defence personnel. Gujarat has arrested a 44-year-old man for allegedly making derogatory remarks about the death of Gen Rawat on his Facebook. In Rajasthan, several have been arrested for their social media posts on Gen Rawat. Uttarakhand and Karnataka governments have instructed the police to take immediate action if any such case is reported in the states. When 26/11 happened, Rahul Gandhi was partying till wee hours of morning.Like brother, Priyanka Vadra too is dancing away in Goa while the entire nation is mourning and steeped in sadness as CDS Gen Bipin Rawat is being cremated.Can anything be more shameful than this? pic.twitter.com/hggjarFJdxOver the tragic chopper crash, the BJP has targeted Priyanka Gandhi's dancing video which was shared on Congress's official Twitter on December 10, two days after the crash.

Targets BJP with his answer||India needs to throw ‘Hindutvavadis’ out of power and bring back Hindus, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Sunday while addressing a rally in Rajashthan’s Jaipur. Gandhi compared ‘Hindu’ and 'Hindutvavadi' saying there is a competition between the two words with different meanings in Indian politics. The former Congress president said Mahatma Gandhi was a Hindu but the man who assassinated him, Nathuram Godse, was Hindutvavadi.“In Indian politics today, there is a competition between two worlds -- 'Hindu' and 'Hindutvavadi'. The two words have different meanings. I am Hindu but not Hindutvavadi... Mahatma Gandhi was a Hindu but Godse was Hindutavadi,” Rahul Gandhi said.Attacking the ruling BJP government at the Centre, Gandhi said “Hindutvavadis only want power and they are in power since 2014. We need to throw these Hindutvavadis out of power and bring back Hindus.”'Dancing in Goa': Over Gen Rawat's chopper crash, BJP targets CongressGandhi was in Jaipur for a rally against inflation in the country, which the Congress has termed as a “decisive fight” against the central government. Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot were also present at the ‘Mehengai Hatao Maharally’.The Lok Sabha member from Wayanad said that Hindutvavadis spend their entire life in search of power and can do anything for it, adding that they follow the path of 'Sattagrah', not 'Satyagrah'."Who is a Hindu? The one who embraces everybody. Who is a Hindu? The one who fears nobody? Who is a Hindu? The one who respects every religion," he told the gathering.“You can read any of (Hindu) scriptures. Be it Ramayana, Maharabharata, Geeta, or Upanishads. Tell me where is it written that a poor should be beaten up, where is it written that a marginalised person should be oppressed,” he asked rhetorically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-a-hindu-asks-rahul-gandhi-in-jaipur-targets-bjp-with-his-answer-101639302442258.html
12-12-2021||India||‘ ₹2,100 crore a year’ says Congress on Trinamool’s ‘Griha Laxmi’ scheme in Goa; ‘perfectly doable’ retorts TMC||The Congress on Sunday taunted the Trinamool Congress' pre-poll promise in Goa, under which the Mamata Banerjee-led party promised a direct cash transfer every month to women in the state if elected to power. The scheme was titled ‘Griha Laxmi’ and was announced earlier on Saturday by the TMC in the run-up to the state assembly polls next year.Former Union minister P Chidambaram said that the scheme would cost ₹2,100 crore a year, if ₹5,000 was given to women in 350,000 households in the state.“A monthly grant of ₹5,000 to a woman in 3.5 lakh households in Goa will cost ₹175 crore a month. That is ₹2,100 crore a year,” he tweeted. He also mocked that the idea “deserves a Nobel Prize for Economics.” Further, he said that Goa’s debt stood at ₹23,473 crore in March 2020. “It is a 'small' sum for the State of Goa that had an outstanding debt of Rs. 23,473 crore at the end of March 2020. God bless Goa! Or should it be God save Goa?” he said in a subsequent tweet.It is a “small” sum for the State of Goa that had an outstanding debt of Rs. 23,473 crore at the end of March 2020.God bless Goa!

Goa deserves good & sensible governance, & it’s time someone provided that,” in a tweet.The exchange in Twitter between the two parties comes amidst the growing rift between them in recent days. On December 10, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi visited the state and held several programmes, including a women’s convention.

However, there is no official confirmation regarding Mufti's house arrest.Reacting sharply to incident, Mehbooba Mufti, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, said the youths associated with the PDP were turned away from her door because the administration is petrified of their voice and what it could achieve.She called the administration's action 'sabotage', and said that when she wanted to speak to the youth and know about their well-being, the administration cited Covid-19 as a reason to stop them.“You were prevented from reaching me today but this makes us more determined to remain steadfast on our mission of peace with dignity,” Mufti said in a video message posted on Twitter.She is set to address a press conference at 3pm given the sequence of events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-youth-convention-barred-in-srinagar-citing-covid-mufti-slams-administration-101639293746023.html

Adds a UP angle to it||Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who is a word wizard and known for his choicest of uncommon words, on Sunday taught social media a new word, which he termed as not only the word of the day but also the word of the last seven years. Allodoxaphobia, he explained, is an irrational fear of opinions. Giving an example of how to use the word, Tharoor wrote, "The BJP government in UP slaps sedition and UAPA cases on people because its leadership suffers from allodoxaphobia." The origin of the word id green with 'allo' meaning different, dox meaning opinion and phobos comes from the Greek God of fear. Word of the day, indeed of the last seven years: *Allodoxaphobia*Meaning: an irrational fear of opinions.Usage: “The BJP government in UP slaps sedition& UAPA cases on people because its leadership suffers from allodoxaphobia.”(Greek: Allo=different, doxo=opinion,phobos=fearThe Thiruvananthapuram MP is quite active on Twitter and has recently been trolled for two of his photos. On the first day of the winter session of Parliament, his photo with some of the women MPs invited criticism as he captioned the photo saying, "Who says the Lok Sabha isn't an attractive place to work?" Later, he clarified that both the photo and the caption were done at good humour and at the initiative of the women MPs.In another photo with a newlywed, Shashi Tharoor was mistaken as the groom and as he was being mercilessly trolled on Twitter, he said he was used to such trolling but objected to dragging non-political people (the newlyweds) into it. "Bhakti towards the divine is to be respected. Bhakti towards a political leader or cause, especially in the name of religion, is deplorable. Bhakts in the latter sense refers to the devotees of the Sangh Parivar & Moditva," he had tweeted.Ahead of the UP election, Tharoor chose to explain the meaning of allodoxaphobia using Yogi Adityanath's state while many social media users asked him whether the word can be applicable to the Congress as well, regarding the G-23 situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-teaches-social-media-what-allodoxaphobia-is-adds-a-up-angle-to-it-101639298682080.html

The protests were staged to demand the repeal of the three legislation related to the agriculture sector.After the prolonged agitation, which often saw violent episodes in between and a long impasse with the government, farmers withdrew their protests after the Centre formally withdrew the laws in November.The majority of farmers have already left the Delhi borders, Deepak Lamba, vice president of the Jai Kisan Andolan farmers' group, said on Saturday. Around "80 per cent of farmers have left from the Singhu border, around 50 per cent went home from Ghazipur border while from Tikri border around 60 to 70 per cent farmers have returned back to their home," he said as per ANI.On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Centre will bring necessary bills in the Winter Session of Parliament to repeal the farm laws.Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha passed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill on the first day of the Winter Session on November 29.

The Armed Forces foiled Pakistan's plans in 1971 and now we are working towards eliminating terrorism from the root.”"Sometimes I wonder, what was the fault of our Bengali sisters and brothers? For demanding their rights? Seeking to preserve their art, culture and language? For talking about his proper representation in politics and governance?" Singh was quoted as speaking at the gathering."The injustice and atrocities on our Bengali sisters and brothers were a threat to the entire humanity in one form or the other. In such a situation, it was our Rajdharm, Rashtradharm and military religion that helped in liberating the people of then 'East Pakistan' from that injustice and exploitation," the defence minister outlined.He said the 1971 war is a “classic example” of India's morals, democratic traditions and just treatment. “It will be rarely seen in history that after defeating another country in a war, a country like ours did not express its dominance over it, but handed over the power to its political representative.”Condoling the death of India's Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife, and 11 military personnel in a chopper crash last week, the defence minister said the government has decided to mark the event with simplicity.“It was decided to organise this event in a grand form, but after passing away of Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 other Armed Forces personnel, we've decided to celebrate ‘Swarnim Vijay Parv' with simplicity.

"Small and medium industries collapsed. Neither Naxalism, terrorism ended nor black currency was eliminated, the unemployment rate in the country is 10 per cent. Defeat Modi and BJP to get rid of rising inflation," he added.According to reports, the rally was planned to be held in Delhi but was later moved to Rajasthan after the central government denied permission.Speaking about the health protocol in view of the rising cases of Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Congress’ Rajasthan unit president Govind Singh Dotasra said mandatory precautions will be taken according to the mandate of the health ministry. Chairs have been arranged, masks will be provided and the temperature of those attending will be checked, he also informed.The senior Congress leader also highlighted rising prices of fuel and cooking oil, and said, "petrol and diesel have crossed ₹100 per litre, cooking oil costs ₹200 per litre, tomatoes cost ₹80-100 per kg." "Only 10 people in the country have 57 per cent of the total money. Rich are getting richer and poor are getting poorer," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-priyanka-to-address-decisive-rally-against-inflation-in-jaipur-today-101639270283035.html
12-12-2021||India||Omicron impact to be less severe on India’s economy, says report||The new Omicron variant of Covid-19 may pose “a fresh risk” to the ongoing global recovery, but its impact would be “less severe” for India due to the increasing pace of vaccination in the country, a finance ministry report said on Saturday, expressing confidence in robust recovery of the domestic economy in the third and the fourth quarters of the financial year that ends in March.India’s economic recovery is expected to gain further strength in the remaining two quarters of the current financial year, as evident from 19 among 22 high frequency indicators (HFIs) in September, October and November crossing their pre-pandemic levels in the corresponding months of 2019, the ministry said in its monthly economic review for November.“India’s economic recovery is expected to gain further strength in the remaining quarters of the financial year on the back of upbeat market sentiments, rapid vaccination coverage, strong external demand and continuous policy support by Government and RBI (Reserve Bank of India),” the report said. “However, the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 poses a challenge to the sustained recovery, and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is warranted.”“That said, the economy is better prepared to work with Covid, with rapidly growing vaccination coverage and lessons learnt from second wave in containing the contagion,” it added.The government is cautious about the Omicron variant, but with rapid vaccination and strong Covid-19 protocols, it is confident about sustained growth momentum, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.“I’m still very hopeful that this year’s GDP (gross domestic product) numbers would be very encouraging, and we’d still be the fastest growing economy in the world,” Sitharaman said on November 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-impact-to-be-less-severe-on-india-s-economy-says-report-101639270153752.html

The tweet has since been deleted.The Trinamool Congress (TMC) party took to Twitter accusing the BJP of stealing Bengal’s achievements. “Is BJP Tripura claiming that these are their roads? Are there no well-maintained roads in Tripura? Has (chief minister) Biplab Kumar Deb really neglected development to THIS EXTENT?” TMC Tripura tweeted. “Ridiculous how BJP repeatedly steals from the #BengalModel to showcase Mamata Banerjee’s developmental work as theirs!”In September, a similar controversy erupted on social media after the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh government ran a newspaper advertisement with photographs of a Kolkata flyover.The state government defended the move. The poster used the photograph as it was a nationwide contest, an information technology department official said. “It’s an all-India level contest and not a state-specific one. It was not considered from where the picture was taken while designing the graphics,” the official said.The poster aimed at showing congested roads to specify the need to follow driving regulations, a BJP leader said. “The image used was to show people about the congested roads and necessity of maintaining road safety,” BJP spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-targets-tripura-govt-after-it-tweets-poster-with-kolkata-flyover-101639260971485.html
12-12-2021||India||Uttarakhand assembly passes bill to abolish Char Dham shrine board||The Uttarakhand legislative assembly on Saturday passed a bill to abolish the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board through voice vote.The move comes days after the state government announced the withdrawal of the contentious Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, which brought four Hindu shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri and 49 other temples under the purview of a board, and against which several priests and religious organisations have been protesting since last year.The law, which was introduced by the previous Trivendra Singh Rawat-led government in 2019, allowed the board to act as the highest governing body, to look after the shrines while framing policies and sanctioning expenditure.Priests of the Chardham — Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — opposed the board, calling it an infringement upon their traditional rights over the Himalayan temples.In 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, led by Rawat, passed the Uttarakhand Char Dham Shrine Management Bill, 2019.In July, new chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami formed a five-member committee to look into the matter amid continuous protests by the priests. Based on the recommendations of the panel which submitted its report last week, the state government decided to repeal the Act.“Our government has taken a decision to take back the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act,” Dhami said on November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-assembly-passes-bill-to-abolish-char-dham-shrine-board-101639260432496.html
12-12-2021||India||Now, Manipur CM backs Afspa repeal||Manipur chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader N Biren Singh on Saturday said he favoured the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) from the North-East.The gunning down of 13 civilians in Nagaland by forces on December 4 has renewed the demand for the withdrawal of Afspa from the region. The act, which grants special powers to the forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas”, has been a contentious issue in the North-East with civil society members saying that it gives personnel impunity to carry out excesses and forces saying that it helps them maintain order in restive areas. Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio and Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma have already demanded that the act should be repealed.“Removing Afspa is our stand. But we need to create a better understanding with the Centre. Prior to taking a decision, we need to talk, we need to discuss (with the central leaders) to reach an understanding,” he said.The protests against the civilian killings and Afspa continued in the region on Saturday, with sit-in protests being held at Manipur’s at Chandel, Senapati, Tamenglong and Ukhrul.“We are demanding the withdrawal of this act [Afspa] at the earliest,” Kho John, president of the United Naga Council said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-manipur-cm-backs-afspa-repeal-101639260019046.html
12-12-2021||India||5 drone schools to be set up in MP: Scindia||Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Saturday said five schools will be opened across Madhya Pradesh to train youngsters in drone technology and open new employment opportunities for them.Announcing that the schools will be opened in Gwalior, Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Satna, the minister, while speaking at the Drone Fair in Gwalior, said: “Through these schools, training in drone technology will be given so that the youth get employment.”Scindia called drone tech “revolutionary” and said that it was a means to “convert poverty into prosperity”.“It’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision that the technology should be promoted to bring change in the lives of the people… The drone technology is proving to be revolutionary in every field, including defence, agriculture and health,” he said.In August, the civil aviation ministry notified the national drone policy, making it significantly easier for people and companies to own and operate drones, while also streamlining a labyrinthine certification process for manufacturers, importers and users, in a move that aims to boost future tech.Stating that the Centre was working towards promoting the technology on drones, Scindia said: “The rules have been simplified to promote drone technology. Earlier, where companies had to fill 25 forms, that number has been reduced to five in the process of licensing and registration.”Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who also took part in the fair along with Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, said the state will use drones to spread its welfare programmes.“Madhya Pradesh will emerge as a leading state by using drone technology in the field of development and welfare. Drones are such a revolutionary technology that can be used for public welfare and good governance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-drone-schools-to-be-set-up-in-mp-scindia-101639259670126.html
12-12-2021||India||Modi calls on farmers to adopt, encourage zero-budget farming||Farmers should adopt natural farming to save costs and increase yields, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday and invited farmers to join a mega programme on “natural farming” on December 16.Addressing a rally in Balrampur after inaugurating the ₹9,800-crore project, aimed at providing assured water for irrigation to over 1.4 million hectares and benefit about 2.9 million farmers, the PM said natural farming saves earth and water and the crop produced through it is also better.“I invite farmers across the country for a mega farmers’ programme on natural farming on December 16. Here, you will learn about zero-budget farming, which saves water and gives better yield too,” he added.On November 19, when PM Narendra Modi announced his decision to scrap the three contentious farm laws, he also talked about promoting zero-budget natural farming to boost farm incomes.Zero-budget natural farming is a technique of farming that aims to bring down input costs by making farmers rely on natural inputs, shifting away from agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides and fertilisers.The concept behind the farming technique is that 98% of nutrients required by crops for photosynthesis — carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water, and solar energy — are already available free from nature. The remaining 1.5-2% of nutrients can be derived from the soil.Noting that Padma awardee Subhash Palekar of Maharashtra had initiated the idea of zero-budget natural farming, Modi said it saves earth and water and the crop produced through it is also better.In her 2019-2020 Union Budget speech,  finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, too, emphasised the idea of zero-budget natural farming, and urged the farmers to “go back to basics” and “replicate this innovative model (which) can help in doubling our farmers’ income”.At the Balrampur event, Modi further highlighted his government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers, asserting that the Modi government is the first to take care of small farmers by connecting them with government benefits.The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, alternative income streams in fishery, dairy and bee culture and opportunities in ethanol are some of the steps being taken. In the past four-and-a-half years, ethanol worth ₹12,000 crore has been purchased from Uttar Pradesh itself, the prime minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-calls-on-farmers-to-adopt-encourage-zero-budget-farming-101639259052610.html
12-12-2021||India||Odia IAF officer who died in Coonoor chopper crash cremated with state honours||The mortal remains of junior warrants officer of the Indian Air Force, Rana Pratap Das were consigned to flames with full state honours at his native village in Angul district on Saturday evening.Das was with CDS General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 others in the ill-fated Mi-17V5 chopper that crashed near Coonoor on December 8.In the presence of family members, officials of the IAF and hundreds of people, Das’s body was consigned to flames at a crematorium at his native Krushnachandrapur village.Before the cremation, a gun salute was given by the armed forces to the Tricolour-wrapped body of Das at the crematorium amid chants of ‘Rana Pratap Amar Rahe’.Earlier in the day, the mortal remains of Das were brought to the Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar from New Delhi. The body was then carried in a special vehicle in a procession to the 120 Battalion of Territorial Army premises in Bhubaneswar.A Guard of Honour was given followed by a tribute by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, DGP, senior armed forces personnel and political leaders. The body was then taken in an ambulance escorted by an armed forces vehicle and district police to Krushnachandrapur village.Political leaders cutting across party lines along with the hundreds of people were present at the crematorium.Born in 1987, Das joined IAF in June 2006 and was transferred to Coimbatore three months ago. The 34-year-old was married in 2017 to Shivangi, a dentist by profession. They have a 19-month-old son.A grieving Srivatsa Das, father of the deceased officer, said his son had promised to come home next month. “He was home last Dussehra. I never thought that I would see his body a few months later,” said Srivatsa Das. A special memorial is being built in the village for Das by Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. People of Krushnachandrapur have demanded that the road between Talabeda and Krishnachandrapur be named after him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-iaf-officer-who-died-in-coonoor-chopper-crash-cremated-with-state-honours-101639250383055.html
12-12-2021||India||Bodies of all soldiers killed in Coonoor helicopter crash identified||The bodies of 10 more soldiers, among the 13 people killed in the December 8 Coonoor helicopter crash, were identified on Saturday, officials familiar with the development said.While mortal remains of six of them, identified by Saturday morning, were flown to their hometowns in special flights; the bodies of the remaining four, identified later in the day through DNA testing, will be handed over to their families on Sunday, the officials said.The personnel whose bodies were flown home on Saturday are Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, the pilot of the Mi-17V5 that crashed, Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, the co-pilot, Junior Warrant Officer Rana Pratap Das, Junior Warrant Officer Arakkal Pradeep, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja. Their mortal remains were flown to Agra, Pilani, Bhubaneswar, Sulur, Gaggal and Bengaluru, respectively.The bodies that were identified later in the day were those of Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh and Naik Jitendra Kumar. While Lieutenant Colonel Singh’s funeral is likely to be conducted at Brar Square in Delhi Cantonment on Sunday, the remains of the other three soldiers will be flown to their hometowns.The 13 people killed in the crash included India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat and the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder. Lieutenant Colonel Singh was Rawat’s staff officer.Rawat, his wife and Lidder were on Friday cremated with military honours at Brar Square in two separate solemn ceremonies steeped in military tradition, with top government officials attending the heart-wrenching final send-off and thousands of men, women and children lining the road leading to the crematorium to pay their last respects.While Kritika and Tarini lit the funeral pyre of their parents, Bipin and Madhulika, 16-year-old Aashna performed the last rites of her father Lakhbinder Singh Lidder in ceremonies filled with emotion, honour and pride. In a picture of courage and dignity, Lidder’s wife Geetika was seen comforting Kritika and Tarini at the funeral, even though her own husband was cremated at Brar Square a few hours earlier and his pyre was still burning.The sole survivor of the crash, Group Captain Varun Singh, is still on life support at the IAF Command Hospital in Bengaluru. Defence minister Rajnath Singh is monitoring the group captain’s condition, and is in touch with his family. The minister spoke to Varun’s father, Colonel KP Singh, on Saturday, officials said.Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, who is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, is heading the inquiry into the crash.A helicopter pilot, Manavendra Singh has logged close to 7,000 flying hours in his 39-year career and operated in challenging sectors such as Siachen, the North-east, Uttarakhand, the western sector and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington in Tamil Nadu to address the faculty and student officers there.The Mi-17V5 helicopter took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48 am on Wednesday, and it was scheduled to land at the helipad at the Wellington golf club at 12.15 pm. The air traffic control at Sulur, however, lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08 pm, 20 minutes after it took off. The chopper was seven minutes away from its destination.The Coonoor crash was of one of the worst air accidents involving India’s top military brass and a setback to the ongoing military reforms in the country, the biggest since Independence. Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations.The CDS’s shocking demise will have implications for the military reforms, including theaterisation, and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane is the senior-most military officer in the country after the CDS’s demise. Rawat survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur on February 3, 2015. He was a lieutenant general at that time.
12-12-2021||India||TTD to construct third ghat road for hill temple||Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which manages the temple of Lord Venkateshwara on Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district, has decided to construct a third ghat road from Tirupati to the hill shrine.The decision was taken at the meeting of the TTD trust board held at Annamayya Bhavan in Tirumala on Saturday. At present, there are two ghat roads – the first ghat road is meant for bringing devotees from Tirumala down the hill to Tirupati while the second ghat road is meant for the upward journey.Recently, the second ghat road suffered heavy damages due to landslides triggered by heavy rains at several places, forcing the TTD authorities to close the route for traffic.“It would take at least another three weeks to restore the traffic on this ghat road. Till such time, the traffic is being diverted through a link road. Experts from IIT Delhi and IIT Madras have come up with a series of suggestions to prevent landslides in future,” TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy told reporters after the trust board meeting.He said the TTD approved the restoration of the damaged second ghat road for ₹3.95 crore and Srivarimettu footpath, which was destroyed completely due to heavy rains, for ₹3.60 crore.To overcome such problems in future, the TTD trust board decided to construct a third ghat road that would not only ease the traffic to Tirumala but also avoid accidents.Reddy said the TTD board also decided to restore the centuries-old trekking route for the sake of pilgrims. “It was used by saint-composer Annamacharya for trekking the hill to reach the temple of Lord Venkateshwara. The proposal was mooted during the regime of former chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy in late ‘2000. Now, it is going to be materialised,” he said.The TTD trust board also decided to renovate seven major temples, which were destroyed during the massive floods caused by the breach of the Annnamayya project on the Cheyyeru river at Rajampet in Kadapa district, which witnessed heavy rains on the night of November 18.The board decided to provide “Vaikuntha Dwara Darshanam” for 10 days to all pilgrims similar to Brahmotsava Darshanam, from January 13. Similar arrangements would be made at the temples in SC/ST/BC/fishermen coloniesThe TTD decided to increase the darshan quota and also resume a limited number of Arjita Sevas (paid services to the god) in the New Year due to the decrease in the intensity of Covid-19. “We shall send a proposal on the same seeking permission from State and Central governments,” Reddy said.The TTD approved a proposal to seek donations to construct a full-fledged Paediatric Hospital in Tirupati.

12-12-2021||India||Karnataka police book two for ‘objectionable’ posts on CDS Rawat’s death||Karnataka police on Saturday booked two people for uploading objectionable posts on social media about late Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat. CDS Rawat, along with 12 others, was killed in a fatal helicopter crash at Coonoor, Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.According to Mangaluru police officials, cases have been filed against Vasanth Kumar TK and Shrinivas Karkala after their ‘objectionable’ posts on the Facebook accounts were flagged to the police. According to a complaint filed by Sushanth Poojari, the two users had uploaded posts celebrating the death of late CDS and expecting the death of national security advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval. “We have booked the two men under sections 505(1)(B) (with intent to incite, or which is likely to incite any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community) of the Indian Penal Code. No arrests have been made so far,” Mangaluru city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar told the media. Kumar told the media that the police would investigate whether these accounts were real or they were posted from fake accounts. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday issued a warning against commenting disrespectfully on CDS Rawat.“Offensive Tweets and Social Media posts about the tragic chopper crash in which we lost our #CDSGeneralBipinRawat will not be tolerated. I strongly condemn all such messages and have instructed our Police Officials to take strict disciplinary legal action against the offenders,” the chief minister tweeted.

12-12-2021||India||Karnataka govt shuts down almost 100-year-old Tamil school in Bengaluru citing lack of students||Two weeks ago, the state education department shut down a 91-year-old government Tamil School in Bengaluru, citing a lack of students. Located in the Central Business District (CBD), the Rao Bahadur BV Venakata Naidu School, built in 1930, was one of the few existing Tamil government schools in the state. Despite being a heritage building, the government, instead of restoring it, stopped paying the electricity bill, resulting in the school running without power for seven years. Last week, 10 students were shifted to a different school, leaving the building unattended. The government has also made its intentions clear as a proposal by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to restore the building with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds was turned down by the government in November this year. “We had submitted a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to restore the building. The cost of the proposed project was ₹27 lakh, which the rotary club was ready to fund. However, the department officials turned down the project, saying they didn’t want to restore this building since there were not enough students,” said Meera Iyer, convenor of INTACH, Bengaluru chapter.Iyer further said that department of public instruction (DPI) commissioner R Vishal asked the INTACH team to invest the same funds in some other schools where there are a substantial number of students.Doubts have been raised on why the department does not want to restore the building, which has a 15,514 sq ft area in a prime location in Ashok Nagar. “The building has a history of several years, and it is a heritage building. Understandably, the department doesn’t want to run a school with a handful of students, but we can’t understand the rationale behind shutting the school down and abandoning the property. The building could be developed for another purpose by the department,” said ward committee members, who didn’t want to be named.There is limited literature on the history of the school. It was named after Venkata Naidu, a builder and a part of the Cantonment Municipal Corporation during the British Era. According to officials of the Tamil Sangha in Bengaluru, Naidu was involved in providing education to the Panchama community, which constitutes of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people. HISTORY OF TAMIL SCHOOLSThe Tamil schools in Bengaluru have a history of their own. One of the migrations that changed the linguistic character of the city happened during the British India era. After the military engineers found Bengaluru’s topography and proximity to other cities to be good for developing a cantonment, manpower was required. “When the British started constructing the cantonment area since they had a base in the Madras presidency, they brought in skilled labourers and traders as part of the development of the cantonment. This is one of the reasons why the cantonment area in Bengaluru has a large Tamil speaking population,” said Suresh Moona, a Bengaluru based historian. The Tamil schools that came up in Bengaluru was a result of this cultural change, but over the years, the number of these Tamil schools have come down, resulting in many schools such as the one in Ashok Nagar shutting down due to lack of students.Even though reviving the Tamil school is a herculean task due to demand for English medium schools in the state, questions are being raised on why the heritage structure can’t be saved. “For the past six years, we have been working with the school. We have conducted cycle day and other programmes to spread awareness about this heritage school. But since the lockdown, the government has shut down the school,” said Meenakshi Ravikrishna, a ward committee member and a member of the Bangalore Political Action Committee. Being 91 years old will not help the building’s cause, say activists. In Karnataka, there is no framework at present to apply for the heritage status of a building. According to Moona, Bangalore Urban Art Commission (BUAC) was established in 1976, and it commissioned a survey of the city’s heritage buildings in the mid-1980s. The survey listed over 800 such buildings that were thought to be worthy of protection. “In 2001, the BUAC was suddenly dissolved. There is still no clear idea why it was done, but we believe the opposition to the rapid urbanisation from the commission led to it. The commission had opposed the construction of Vikas Soudha (a building with an identical design as the historical Vidhan Soudha). Then there were restrictions on construction on major roads like MG Road and others. This could be the reason. Since then, there is no talk of restoring the commission and massive developments continue across the city, unchallenged,” Moona said.He said that if the beauty and history of the existing heritage buildings have to be preserved, there is a need for another Bengaluru arts commission. “What is important is to make it independent and to appoint experts on heritage in this committee. Ensuring there is government involvement in the committee is very important. But in our current economic race, I don’t know if that could be a reality,” he said. Adding to the argument, Iyer said that at present a letter can be written to Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), however, it may not result in the building getting heritage status. “In the case of this school, sadly there is no legal framework to ensure a renovation citing its heritage value,” she added.
12-12-2021||India||Kerala governor slams ‘political appointments’ in varsities||Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Saturday continued his attack against the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government over its handling of affairs of universities in the state, saying political interference in higher educational institutions has become “unbearable” for him. Talking to HT from New Delhi days after he wrote a strongly worded letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Khan said he was really “pained” over the dipping standard of higher educational centres and blamed the “brazen political interference” as main reason for this. “I always supported the government and never thought of a confrontationist line. But how long can you be a spectator like this. I told them several times to bring eminent people as the vice chancellors and follow UGC (University Grants Commission) norms, but for the government, political consideration was only criteria,” Khan said, adding that he signed some of the letters, including the Kannur V-C’s appointment, with “pain and anguish”. In a strongly worded letter, dated December 8, the Governor informed Vijayan that he was ready to sign immediately if the latter brings an ordinance to amend the Acts empowering the chief minister to become the Chancellor of universities. Noting that the government of the day should not interfere in the functioning of the varsities, hurting their autonomy, Khan said as the chancellor of the universities he had tried his best to save the autonomy of the higher educational institutions. “In my two-year stint in Kerala, my office got maximum complaints about higher education sector. How can such institutions excel if you make political appointments one after the other brazenly flouting all procedures and norms? When I want to talk to the CM, I am told he is busy with the party conference in Kannur,” he said. Khan added that without autonomy and transparency, higher education cannot excel. “I have no plan to come back as the chancellor if I won’t get total guarantee that varsities will get full autonomy and free from political appointments,” he said. He said two days back, he told Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal and chief secretary VP Joy that he cannot be a party to “such nefarious political interventions”. “Politics is OK but you can’t mix it everywhere. I know many brilliant students are leaving Kerala in large numbers due to dipping standard. I can’t be a party to it anymore,” the Governor said. The ruling CPI(M), however, said the state government always regarded the governor in high esteem and maintained good relations with him. “He is the constitutional head of the state and we have good relations with him. Differences, if any, will be ironed out at the earliest,” said party leader KK Balan. According to party insiders, the chief minister is likely to call on the governor after he returns from the national Capital onMonday. According to political observers, what really irked the governor was the re-appointment of the vice-chancellor of Kannur University, Prof Gopinath Raveendran, and alleged attempts by the state government to appoint another Left-leaning teacher in Kalady Sanskirt University. Raveendran was re-appointed on November 20 for a period of four years after the government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee to select the new V-C. The governor has claimed that he was flooded with too many complaints about recurring political appointments in academic council and faculty. Raveendran’s re-appointment was on November 22challenged in the Kerala high court. The appointment of the wife of CM’s political secretary, KK Ragesh, in a high position at Kannur University in September had also kicked up a row. In April this year, the Kerala high court quashed the appointment of CPI(M) legislator AN Shameer’s wife Shahala as the assistant professor in Kannur University. Meanwhile, Opposition Congress attacked the Vijayan government over the issue, alleging that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government was converting the universities into “party cells”. VD Satheesan, senior Congress leader and leader of Opposition in the Kerala legislative assembly, termed the issues raised by the governor to the CM as “very serious”, adding it was the latest example of the “politicisation of education in the universities” in the state. “Backdoor appointments take place in universities. Universities are being turned into party cells. It is better to have the party secretary as chancellor than the chief minister. The governor has confirmed what the opposition had mentioned earlier,” Satheesan said in a statement. The opposition parties in the state stepped up pressure for the resignation of higher education minister R Bindu. “She has no right to continue in power,” said senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, adding that he will move the Lokayukta against the minister. BJP state president K Surendran also alleged that relatives of ruling politicians were being appointed in key posts in the universities in the state under the LDF rule. Surendran demanded legal action against those, including vice-chancellors, for appointing relatives of ministers and politicians into universities.

12-12-2021||India||93% of trains ran on time between April and November this year: Railways data||Trains in India are now running on time as Indian Railways utilised the 2020 pandemic lockdown to do some serious maintenance of tracks, coaches and engines, officials said.As much as 93.29% of the trains have been punctual between April and November 16, 2021, compared with 75.67% of trains from April to November 2019 running on time, and 68.19% between April and November 2018, railway ministry data show.“Realising that not being able to dedicate required time for maintenance was one of the crucial reasons for poor punctuality rate, we decided to utilise the lockdown days to the fullest,” a ministry official said, requesting anonymity. “Moreover, we also worked on the timetable in a way that the trains are now able to get more time for their maintenance.”Almost all trains have now resumed operations. “Around 1,750 Mail and Express trains are running as of November 16,” the official said. “The average pre-Covid was 1,768 Mail and Express trains.”The national transporter has been able to improve the average maintenance time of a train. “If we had one hour dedicated for a train’s maintenance, then today we have allocated three hours,” the official said. “This has been done the zero-based timetable, with an aim to give more time towards maintenance.”“Improvement in train running status is a result of number of trains on busy routes being lower (than earlier) due to the pandemic that led to restricted train movements,” said a former member of the Railway Board that oversees railways operations. “Due to this, the cascading effect of any failure would have been the minimum, leading to increased punctuality.”Some of the trains that have improved their running status include 20801/02 Magadh Express that runs between Islampur in West Bengal New Delhi and has improved its running statues by 11%; 12393/94 Sampoorn Kranti Express between Rajendra Nagar (Patna) and New Delhi improved by 5%; punctuality of 14005/06 Lichchavi Express that runs between Sitamarhi in Bihar and Anand Vihar (Delhi) improved by about by 7-8%; 12301/02 Kolkata Rajdhani that runs between Howrah and New Delhi improved by around 7%; and 12565/66 Bihar Sampark Kranti that runs between Darbhanga and New Delhi improved running status by around 8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/93-of-trains-ran-on-time-between-april-and-november-this-year-railways-data-101639248343288.html
12-12-2021||India||Punjab government moves Supreme Court against Centre’s move to extend BSF jurisdiction||New Delhi: Punjab has challenged in the Supreme Court the central government’s October 11 decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) from 15km to 50km from the international border. Terming it an “encroachment” on the state’s duty to maintain law and order, the Congress government wants the apex court to stay the October 11 notification issued by the Union home ministry. The decision, taken without consulting the state, could lead to local unrest, particularly among farmers who have to negotiate barbed wires to cultivate their farms near the border, the Punjab government said in its suit filed through lawyer Ashok K Mahajan.“Punjab is a small state and has a very potent history,” the state government said in its suit. “….no reason can justify extension of jurisdiction to the belt of 50 kilometres, which is likely to give rise to unrest among the populace, including the peasantry, which has to cross the barbed wire to cultivate their land along the border.”The extended jurisdiction means that more than 80% area of the border districts and all major towns and cities, including all border district headquarters, fall within the 50km area from the international border with Pakistan, the state government pointed out. Punjab is not the only state to protest the expansion. The West Bengal assembly, ruled by the Trinamool Congress party, on November 16 passed a resolution against the Centre’s decision to extend BSF’s jurisdiction, becoming the second state to oppose the move through its state legislature. On November 12, the Punjab assembly passed a resolution asking the federal government to withdraw its order. The order was issued under Section 139 of the BSF Act, 1968. This provision does not give unilateral power to Centre to extend into areas that do not touch the border, and would not fall in the ambit of “local limit” to which BSF jurisdiction can extend, the Punjab government has contended.The suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution has tried to distinguish the geography and history of Punjab compared with other areas where BSF’s jurisdiction applies, such as Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, where human habitation is sparse near the international border.“In case of Punjab, area is highly fertile, heavily populated and covers most of physical areas forming part of border districts of Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur and Fazilka,” the state government said in its suit. “…..geography of Punjab has permitted a dense populace in the area included in the jurisdiction of BSF. The concerns of Punjab are totally different and distinguishable from the geography and concerns of UTs of J&K, Ladakh and states of Gujarat and Rajasthan.”The suit was filed in the top court on December 1. Prior to hearing the matter, the Supreme Court’s registry has issued summons to the Union of India on Friday through the attorney general for India, asking the Centre to “produce all witnesses and documents” on which they seek to rely upon and appear before the registry within 28 days.The move to expand the territorial jurisdiction of BSF evoked strong political reactions in Punjab, after which the state’s chief minister, while chairing an all-party meet on October 25, had said his government will challenge the move, saying it was an attack on India’s federal structure.Reacting on the development, Punjab Congress party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu wrote on his twitter handle, “I congratulate Punjab and it’s legal team to be the 1st to approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court by filing an original suit challenging the notification extending the BSF jurisdiction. The fight to retain the principles embodied in the constitution i.e. to retain the federal structure and autonomy of the states has begun … Notice issued to the centre to respond.”The paramilitary force was there only to complement, assist and strengthen state police and other law-enforcement agencies, Sonali Mishra, inspector general of police, BSF Punjab frontier, had said on November 13.“We always coordinate with police and other agencies for national security and in the interest of the country,” she had said. “The BSF is not a policing organisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-government-moves-supreme-court-against-centre-s-move-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-101639247922951.html
12-12-2021||India||PM inaugurates Saryu canal project in UP, slams previous govts for ‘delay’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated the Saryu Canal National Project in poll-bound eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur district and invited farmers to a join a mega programme on “natural farming” on December 16.Addressing a rally in Balrampur after inaugurating the ₹9,800-crore project, aimed at providing assured water for irrigation to over 1.4 million hectares and benefit about 2.9 million farmers, Modi hit out at previous governments in the state for “delaying projects” and “wasting public money”.“Most painful is the waste and misuse of the country’s money, time and resources and its humiliation. This thinking is the biggest hurdle in the balanced development of the country and this thinking has also stalled the Saryu Nahar project. All the citizens of the country should understand that when the work on this project was started its cost was under ₹100 crore and now it is about ₹10,000 crore. This money was your hard-earned money,” the prime minister told the gathering.He added: “We never forget anyone who offers water to quench people’s thirst and I am sure that now that your parched fields will get water, your blessings will help us work with greater enthusiasm.”The PM said a big event on natural farming will be organised on December 16, adding that it saves earth and water and the crop produced through it is also better. “I invite farmers across the country for a mega farmers’ programme on natural farming on December 16. Here, you will learn about zero budget farming, which saves water and gives better yield too,” he added.Taking a jibe at Samajwadi Party (SP) president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav — who has often claimed that the development works started by his government were being projected as the achievements of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Uttar Pradesh — Modi said he was waiting if anyone would claim the credit for the Saryu nahar project.“When I started from Delhi, I was waiting for someone to say that he had cut the ribbon of this project and started this scheme. This is the habit of some people, maybe in their childhood they had cut its ribbon,” he said, without taking any names.“For some people cutting ribbon is the priority while for us completing schemes in time is the priority. In 2014 when I came to power, I was amazed to see that 99 irrigation projects were lying (incomplete) for decades in the country,” Modi added.Modi’s remark came hours after Akhilesh Yadav attacked the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state for “taking credit” for other’s work.“Three-fourth of the Saryu canal project was completed during the SP regime and it took the BJP government in the state five years to finish the remainder of work. In 2022, the SP era will return and the state will prosper with canals of development,” Yadav tweeted in Hindi:As part of the Saryu canal irrigation project, five rivers — Ghaghara, Saryu, Rapti, Banganga and Rohini — and 900 tributaries have been interlinked. The project aims at helping farmers in 6,200 villages of nine eastern UP districts, including Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Gonda, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj.Reiterating his party’s ‘soch imaandar, kaam damdaar’ (honest intentions and great work) election pitch in UP, which will go to polls in February-March next year, Modi highlighted the importance of “double engine” government (same party in power at the Centre and in the state). Speaking about the ₹44,605 crore Ken-Betwa river-linking project, Modi said it would help address the water crisis in Bundelkhand.The Union cabinet approved the Ken-Betwa river-linking project on December 8.He also listed some of his government’s achievements, including the PM Kisan Nidhi scheme, under which all farmers get up to ₹6,000 per year as minimum income support. The PM also said that several bio-fuel factories were being set up in Uttar Pradesh.“In Budaun and Gorakhpur, big bio-fuel complexes are being set up. In nearby Gonda, a big plant of ethanol is being set up. UP is becoming a leader in making ethanol from sugarcane and in the past four-and-a-half years, ₹12,500 crore worth of ethanol has been purchased from the state. The Yogi (Adityanath) government has also speeded up clearing sugarcane dues of farmers. Under previous governments, more than 30 sugarcane factories were shut down. But Yogi ji’s government either revived them or started newer ones,” the prime minister said.In the beginning of his speech, Modi referred to Yogi Adityanath as an “energetic, dedicated and popular” chief minister, and said that previous governments used to protect mafia, but now the Yogi government is carrying out a campaign to clear the state of mafia and people are saying “farq saaf hai” (difference is clear).“Daughters of UP used to think twice before moving out of their homes earlier. Now criminals think twice before committing a crime, earlier daughters used to sit in homes but now the criminals are sitting inside jails in fear,” he said.‘Farq saaf hai’ is part of the BJP poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh. The party has prepared a poster series comparing the previous governments in UP with the Yogi Adityanath government.Paying tributes to the country’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu along with his wife and 11 other personnel, Modi said his demise is a great loss to the nation.“The death of India’s first Chief of Defence Staff is a huge loss for every patriot of the country. The entire country witnessed General Rawat’s efforts in making the forces ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant),” he said and prayed for early recovery of the lone survivor of the helicopter crash, IAF Group Captain Varun Singh who was born in Deoria in UP.“Even while bearing this pain, the country will not pause, we will work harder to face the challenges from both inside and outside the country,” Modi added.(WITH AGENCY INPUTS)
12-12-2021||India||TMC promises women ₹5k monthly stipend if voted to power in Goa||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has promised a stipend of ₹5,000 every month to women in Goa if it is voted to power in the assembly polls due in February. Dubbed Griha Laxmi , the scheme will guarantee income support to a woman of every household to fight inflation once the party comes to power, TMC leader Mahua Moitra said on Saturday.The scheme will be given to all the estimated 3.5 lakh households in Goa, she promised in an election speech. “The monthly benefit of ₹5,000 will be made available through direct benefit cash transfer,” Moitra said. “This is going to be universal coverage; you don’t have to belong to any backward caste or community, you don’t have to belong to any economically deprived section. It is going to be for everyone.”The Griha Laxmi initiative has already been implemented in West Bengal, she said. Goa has a welfare scheme begun by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar in 2012 called Griha Aadhar, which provides a family ₹1,500 per month, but is offered only to economically weaker sections where household income does not exceed ₹3 lakh a year. Earlier, the Aam Aadmi Party promised to hike the dole by ₹1,000. Explaining the rationale behind the announcement, Moitra said that the need of the hour was to ensure there was money in people’s hands, especially after the twin disasters of demonetization and the Covid-19 lockdown. “Economists like Abhijit Banerjee have said the best thing is to kick-start the economy is to give people more cash in their hands. If a woman gets ₹5,000 in her hand, she can buy clothes and medicine for the children. That money goes into the economy faster. The multiplier effect is faster,” Moitra said. “This is not the time when governments should look at inflationary pressure. This is the time they should look at liquidity and pump in money.”“The budgetary allocation for this is going to be between ₹1500 to ₹2,000 crore, which is 6-8% of Goa’s budget,” she said. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party called the announcement an election gimmick aimed only at garnering votes. “The original idea belongs to Manohar Parrikar who had brought about the Griha Aadhar scheme, which was basically to empower women and make them independent and that scheme has come a long way,” BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar said. “These are nothing but aims to buy votes and not really empower women. This is an election gimmick.” “Both AAP and TMC are in a competition of who will give more free money to women,” Congress party’s social media coordinator Hasiba Amin said. “Both know they won’t win a single seat, so they can promise whatever they want.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-promises-women-5k-monthly-stipend-if-voted-to-power-in-goa-101639247683537.html
12-12-2021||India||Mass para jump held to mark 50 years of Tangail airdrop||A top general of the Indian Army on Saturday led a mass parachute jump at a premier base in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra to mark 50 years of the historic battalion-sized Tangail airdrop north of Dhaka during the 1971 war with Pakistan, a critical operation that set the stage for surrender by the rival army, officials familiar with the development said.The Tangail airdrop is the biggest airborne operation mounted by Indian paratroopers.The army and the air force dedicated the parachute jump at Agra to India’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the 12 others killed in the horrific Mi-17V5 crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on December 8.Central Army commander Lieutenant General Yogendra Dimri led the mass jump involving 120 elite paratroopers and four veterans, who took part in the 1971 India-Pakistan war.“General Rawat envisioned jointmanship amongst the services to touch the highest standards of integration and execution. The parachute jump was marked by precise coordination between the army and air force in the best spirit of jointmanship,” the Indian Army said in a statement.Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat and the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder were on Friday cremated with military honours at Brar Square in Delhi Cantonment in two separate solemn ceremonies steeped in military tradition, with top government officials attending the heart-wrenching final send-off and thousands of men, women and children lining the road leading to the crematorium to pay their last respects and raising slogans of glory for the departed.The aim of the Tangail operation was to capture the Poongli bridge on Jamalpur-Tangail-Dhaka road and the ferry site on Louhajang river to intercept Pakistani army’s 93 Brigade that was retreating from the north to defend Dhaka, the officials said.Around 750 men of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were involved in the successful mission. The paratroopers defeated a force that was three times numerically superior and shattered the will of the Pakistani army to defend Dhaka.Several veterans who took part in the Tangail airdrop and subsequent operations in Bangladesh witnessed the commemoration of the landmark event at Agra. Lieutenant General Nirbhay Sharma, who was the adjutant of 2 Para during the 1971 war, was among those present.The veterans who took part in the mass jump were Lieutenant General RR Goswami, Major General Shiv Jaswal, Colonel Thomas Kochappan and Colonel Pramod Tembe.The Shatrujeet airborne brigade, consisting of the army’s finest paratroopers and based at Agra, was the centrepiece of high-altitude combat manoeuvres carried out by the army and the air force in the Ladakh sector in early November.The airborne drills in eastern Ladakh aimed to validate and showcase the Indian military’s rapid response capabilities, including inter-theatre movement of troops and equipment, precision stand-off drops, rapid grouping and ability to capture designated targets with speed and surprise at a time when India and China are locked in a standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.Other elements of the exercise include integrated battle drills by airborne forces, mechanised columns and attack helicopters.

The concerned stakeholders have been intimated about the developments and asked to take necessary steps to open the three borders. We are trying to open the borders and resume traffic on the roads as early as possible,” said special commissioner of police (law and order, north zone) Dependra Pathak. Police officers said that National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials have been asked to inspect the roads at the protest sites before they are opened for the public. “At many places roads were dug and filled with concrete materials to install iron spikes. The farmers had built concrete structures on the roads while at several places holes were made in the roads to erect iron pipes to set up tents. All these issues need to be addressed by the concerned agencies,” said an officer.In October, the Delhi Police removed some concrete barriers, concertina wires and spikes from near the farmer agitation spots in Ghazipur (Delhi-Ghaziabad border) and also from Tikri (Delhi-Haryana border) to restore vehicular movement to some extent. The move came after the Supreme Court on October 21 observed that protesters cannot block public roads indefinitely. By Saturday evening, around 70-80% farmers had vacated the Singhu (Delhi-Haryana border) protest site. At Singhu border, several large langar camps and metallic sheds were still intact and it might take more time and heavy machinery for their removal. The main protest stage of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and surrounding enclosures were also intact and the highway remained strewn with concrete slabs, broken embankments and damaged roads. Moreover, the concrete embankment, iron spikes embedded on road and a series of barricades and shipping containers used by the Delhi police to block the road opposite the farmers’ protest camp, also remain intact. A few protesters said they will leave Singhu border by Monday. Kashmir Singh, 39, who hails from Tarn Taran in Punjab, said their convoy will leave the site on Monday as they plan to keep running a langar for the remaining people. “We have been staying here since November 29, last year. We will stay for another couple of days so that no one is left hungry. Some people are still waiting for their trucks to arrive,” Singh said. Avtar Singh, who runs ‘Kisan Mazdoor Ekta hospital’ on the Singhu border, said the hospital will be removed on Monday. “We will provide the medical help till the last remaining farmer on Singhu border. We have treated around 6,000 emergency cases during the protest,” Singh said, adding they are focusing on clearing the rubble around the hospital. “We will clean everything around our hospital and safely dispose of all the junk.” At Tikri, nearly 80-90% of the farmers had vacated the protest site. Only a few tents and skeletal structures remained at the site and were expected to be cleared up in the next few days. Huge concrete boulders that had been placed to prevent the movement of farmers into Delhi were also being dismantled using JCB machines by police officials on Saturday. Sunil Singh, who runs a chemist shop next to the protest stretch, said he had incurred financial losses during the last year due to the blockade. “Huge concrete boulders are placed on the road. Until these are cleared up and the road opened for traffic, the situation will not be restored to normal. We are hoping that authorities clear up the remains soon so that our business gets back on track,” said Singh. 
12-12-2021||India||Monitor 27 districts very closely for Covid: Centre||States must keep a strict watch in 27 districts that have reported Covid-19 test positivity rates of 5% and above, the Union health ministry said on Saturday, even as a 35-year-old man with travel history to Zimbabwe and South Africa became the second patient in Delhi to test positive for the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.There is a high possibility that Omicron will lead to a new wave of cases wherever it takes hold, experts said. Whether the variant leads to milder disease is unclear, but it is established that it is more resistant, and evidence is now mounting that it could surpass the Delta variant’s transmissibility.Eight of the 27 districts have reported at least 10% positivity rate for the past two weeks, the Union health ministry said on Saturday. The test positivity rate is the percentage of people who test positive for the disease out of all samples tested.“With the recent trend of sustained and overall decline in Covid-19 cases in the country, we are critically placed in our fight against the pandemic,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote in a letter to all states and Union territories. “Eight districts in three states have been reporting more than 10% positive rates in the past two weeks. Further, 19 districts in 7 states/UTs (Union territories) have been reporting positivity rates between 5% and 10% in the past two weeks. Thus, these 27 districts need to be monitored very closely.”Delhi reported its second Omicron case on Saturday, with a person having come from Zimbabwe, and who also travelled to South Africa, testing positive for the heavily mutated variant of Sars-CoV-2, according to the Delhi government. The person was fully vaccinated against Covid-19.The patient is undergoing treatment at the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in central Delhi. The Delhi government has designated the hospital for isolation and treatment of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 cases. The patient has shown mild symptoms, a government official said, requesting anonymity.A 37-year-old man who arrived in Delhi from Tanzania earlier was the first case in the national capital who tested positive for the new variant, first identified in South Africa.India has reported 33 cases of Omicron since the first two cases were detected from Karnataka on December 2. Rajasthan has reported nine Omicron cases, three cases have been reported from Gujarat, 17 from Maharashtra, two from Karnataka, and two cases have been reported from the national capital region.India has reported less than 0.04% of Omicron cases so far among total variants detected of Sars-CoV-2 virus, and close to 70 clusters are currently under investigation across the country, according to the Union health ministry.On Saturday, the Centre asked states to maintain a strict watch on the situation, with focused district-level measures for containment of clusters of new cases. Nineteen districts in Kerala, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Manipur, West Bengal and Nagaland have been reporting positivity rates between 5% and 10% in the last two weeks, according to official data.The eight districts that have reported Covid-19 positivity rates of more than 10% in past two weeks belong to the three states of Mizoram, Kerala and Sikkim, according to the health ministry.It was in this context that the states needed to heighten vigil, the health secretary said. “In case of any district reporting a surge in cases, or rise in positivity rates, intensive action and local containment as per the containment framework must be initiated,” said Bhushan.Among strategic containment measures suggested by the Centre in identified areas with test positivity rate of more than 10% are putting night curfew in place, ensuring intermingling of people is restricted, curtailment of attendees in marriages and funerals, etc.The health ministry has emphasised the importance of testing and surveillance measures, including ramping up Covid-19 diagnosis and active case search, testing of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection cases through rapid antigen tests (RAT) and retesting by RT-PCR of symptomatic RAT negative tests.“Rapid antigen test may not be as accurate as RT-PCR tests but it is a beneficial tool where caseload is high as positives shown in the test are true positives because of high specificity,” said Dr Amita Jain, head of the microbiology department at King George’s Medical University, Lucknow.
12-12-2021||India||Border landscape set to change as farmers head home||Scores of farmers from across the three protest sites at Delhi’s borders dismantled their tents, bundled up their belongings and began the journey home while singing, dancing and cheering atop their tractors on Saturday, after a successful culmination of their yearlong sit-in against the three contentious farm laws.Thousands of farmers from UP, Haryana, Punjab and parts of Rajasthan have been camping at national capital’s borders -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- since November 26 last year to protest the three contentious farm laws that have now been scrapped by the Centre.On November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that his government was repealing the contentious laws and Parliament scrapped them on November 29. The compromise between the Centre and protesting farm unions came 11 rounds of tenuous negotiations. The end of the agitation also came as a relief to local residents in the areas where the protests were being carried out. Many locals said they supported the protesters by providing them fresh produce, vegetables and milk, but pointed out that they also bore the brunt of the traffic diversions and blockades.Dr Vijay Arora, who lives near the protest site at Tikri, said that farmers have been cooperative with the local residents and never misbehaved. Arora said that the area reverberated with slogans and music over the last year and it would take some time to get used to seeing the stretch without its brimming crowds. “Initially, we were fearful that the farmers might create a nuisance. However, they were quite cooperative. They have a right to protest and I am happy that they succeeded in getting their demands fulfilled,” said Arora.Many residents in Singhu village, however, expressed relief at the possibility of fewer traffic diversions and called for urgent repair of the damaged roads. Manoj Gupta, a resident of Singhu village, said that while he supported the farmers’ protests, the village roads have crumbled under the influence of heavy traffic. “The entire highway traffic has been passing through the narrow village roads. Our mohallas have been turned into national highways and even kids cannot play safely. We support the farmers and their cause but we hope to now get relief from our situation,” he said.Some of the traders also hoped that their business will be restored after the farmers vacate the road stretch, with some highlighting the loss of at least 50% of their revenue earnings due to the protest over the last year.“So many factories in the Kundli industrial areas have closed down. Even we could not bring cards for pick-up and drops of couriers so we started using motorbikes for transportation. Now that the highway will be reopened, we hope to resume our business operations at full scale,” said Sunil Kumar (27), who runs a courier service near Singhu border, adding that he has witnessed 50% reduction in his business during the protests.Kundli is an industrial area where many factories, vehicle showrooms, warehouses, stores and shops are located.Another trader, Sukhbir Saini, 38, who has been operating a fast food stall at Singhu border for the last six years, stated that his business was suffering. “The farmers were operating free langar sewa. The number of labourers in the area went down drastically due to the pandemic and farmers’ protests and the remaining ones started eating in the langars. The eateries in the area were forced to shut down as there were no customers. We did not even have 10% of the old business level and I was unable to pay the rent. I hope with the reopening of the road, we will be able to reverse our fortunes,” Saini said.The street vendors of the area, meanwhile, said they benefited a lot from the huge gatherings due to the protest. Chandrabhan Singh (42), a  woollen clothes vendor from the Rajasthani colony in Kondli, said that he has been visiting the protest site for the past year. “The number of people living here went down drastically in the last few months. The hustle and bustle have reappeared over the last 15 days. It has been like a workplace for me during the last year. We will start finding some new market from next week,” Singh said. Vindsh Arora (44) a Rajouri Garden resident who has been selling flags, badges and memorabilia related to the farmers’ movement, said that he rented out two rooms to start his business near the protest site in December 2020. “Usually, we focus on election states to sell our materials but the farmers’ protest site has been like a home to me. Barring the 26th January incidents, the protest has remained largely peaceful. We will close down our operations now,” he added.(With inputs from Sadia Akhtar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/border-landscape-set-to-change-as-farmers-head-home-101639247145869.html
