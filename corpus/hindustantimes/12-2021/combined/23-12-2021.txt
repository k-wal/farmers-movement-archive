23-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra assembly clears OBC reservation bill||Mumbai The Maharashtra assembly on Thursday cleared two bills to provide 27% reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community in rural and urban local bodies in Maharashtra. The bills convert the ordinances issued by the state government earlier into legislation and they will now be placed before the legislative council for approval. The legislation may not come into force as the Supreme Court (SC) has stayed the ordinances issued to this effect.The state government had promulgated two ordinances to this effect that were stayed by the SC in the first week of this month but the state government decided to go ahead with the legislative proceedings by moving the bills in the Lower House.“The OBC reservation has become a national issue as after Maharashtra, the SC stayed OBC reservation in local body polls in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. The state government is considering filing a review petition against the decision along with Madhya Pradesh. The central government too is considering a review petition in this case,” said Hasan Mushrif, state rural development minister during the discussion on the bills in the Lower House.On December 6, the SC stayed both ordinances and ordered the state to complete an empirical survey that would accurately identify the extent of the OBC community’s socio-economic backwardness before assigning political reservations to them.Consequently, polls on 1,533 seats of the local bodies in the state were held without OBC reservation in the state on December 21, while polling on the remaining 567 seats that were reserved under the OBC quota will take place on January 18 as open category seats. On September 23, the state promulgated an ordinance to amend two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats — to ensure up to 27% reservation to OBC candidates. This was done after the top court struck down a legal provision that granted exactly 27% political reservation on the grounds that it exceeded the 50% ceiling when taken together with constitutionally guaranteed reservations provided to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (SC, ST) candidates.On October 1, the state promulgated a second ordinance to amend three other laws — the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and the Industrial Townships Act — which govern urban local bodies.Explaining the issue of state government going ahead with the passing of the bills even after the apex court stayed their implementation, Sachin Patil, the standing counsel of the Maharashtra government in the Supreme Court, said the legislative process can be completed as the implementation of the ordinance is stayed. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis pressed for legislative intervention to resolve the matter. He said, “The state government can ask the state backward classes commission to give a report on the empirical inquiry into political backwardness of the OBC community, which will require not more than two months. In the meantime, the state should move for legislation to prevent the state election commission from holding local bodies’ elections otherwise the OBC community will be deprived of the rights in all the local bodies’ polls.”Chhagan Bhujbal, state food and civil supplies minister and an OBC leader, said that the state would not have to face this situation if the central government had provided socio-economic caste census (SECC) sought by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-assembly-clears-obc-reservation-bill-101640282540488.html

Because the girl was minor, he was checked and upon browsing through his phone, the clip was found. It has not been shared with anyone else, we believe,” said senior inspector Sadashiv Shelar of Haveli police station. The police then tracked down the boy and his father. It was then that the child broke down and told his family members what had happened. According to the complaint in the matter, the boy told the police that the child had left his house on Lakshmipujan day to look for cardboard sheets to finish his school homework along with his friends. That is when Bhangre found him and told him that he had some cardboard and took him to one of their houses where the two others were called. The men sodomised him and used his T-shirt to gag him as they forced a 14-year-old boy to do the same to the survivor. The crime was filmed by Shinde on his phone. The men then threatened him as he started raising an alarm and sent him home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-arrest-three-for-sodomising-12-year-old-boy-filming-it-101640282414214.html

Hadapsar elected members asked why PMC is setting up garbage waste projects in their locality and not executing plans like Metro. PMC general body gave its nod to the proposal by calling vote.

It is estimated that around 700 teachers in service across the state have been given TET certificates over the years by corrupt practices. The state government has appointed a committee to investigate the case, departmental inquiry of officials and staffers related to the case. Experts and senior officials from departments are worried that this is not the end, as more and more such recruitment-related scams will be unearthed if properly investigated. Till now, Pune police have recovered cash and gold jewelry worth ₹2 crore and ₹88 lakh in cash. “We are giving complete cooperation to the police investigation and as per the state government instructions, a committee is been formed to investigate the case on departmental level. Still to check and verify about how many such illegal TET certificates are been given to teachers who are in service as all the district’s education officers will be sent a letter soon.

Over 750 prisoners, including hardcore and dreaded criminals lodged here, are being shifted to Bathinda’s newly-built jail at Gobindpura village. The state government is ensuring that the inmates are shifted under high-security arrangements. According to the plan that the prisons department has mooted, the Nabha jail, a British era prison, where freedom fighters, including the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, were locked up in September 1923, will be renovated before September 2023. The project has a budget of ₹25 crore. The jail has 40 cells and barracks and can accommodate 450 inmates. It has been overcrowded for long and has been housing 750 prisoners. Punjab inspector general (IG) prisons Roop Kumar Arora said the shifting process had already begun as the under-trials had been shifted to other district jails. “The dreaded criminals and convicted ones have been transferred to Gobindpura jail in Bathinda district, which is going to start operations from December 27,” he added. “The jail will be equipped with modern and updated security features, post the renovation. The staff has also been shifted to Gobindpura and other jails,” Arora added. The department proposes to construct 60 new cells in place of the old barracks. The department has planned to construct a new prison at a cost of ₹125 crore, but finally the decision to renovate was given the nod. The jail had hogged limelight in November 2016, when armed men attacked it and freed six prisoners, including two terrorists and four gangsters.The newly-constructed Gobindpura jail, primarily for women, adjoining the Bathinda Central Jail has been lying vacant, after its completion five years ago. Spread on 29 acre, this jail for women has 13 blocks and can accommodate 1,500 inmates.

They said four people involved in the murder and disposing of the body in Sharda canal in nearby Sitapur district had been arrested.The officials said the victim’s body had yet not been recovered but efforts were on in this regard. However, the iron rod used in the crime as well as a vehicle used in disposing of the body had been recovered from the arrested people, they added.In a press conference, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Lucknow west, Chiranjeev Nath Sinha said Mohd Shoaib Khan, 42, had gone missing when he left his house in Khandari Bazaar locality under Qaiserbagh police station limits on December 14 morning. He said the Shoaib’s brother Amir Hamza Khan reported his missing at the police station on December 15 after he failed to trace him as his phone number was also switched off.The ADCP said the investigation revealed that Shoaib was into illegal money lending business and had lent money to many people on interest. He said the probe further revealed that Shoaib was last spotted with a Hasanganj resident Naseem Ahmad alias Raja on a tea corner and his mobile’s last location was also traced to the same area.Sinha said Raja confessed to murdering Shoaib by hitting him with an iron road on the head with the help of his three other accomplices namely Shoaib Khan alias Topi, Mohd Aqeel and Shadab and thereafter disposing of the body in Sharda canal from Sariya bridge in Sitapur on December 14 itself.The ADCP said Raja revealed that he had borrowed ₹20 lakh from the victim and the latter had been continuously taking interest at an exorbitant rate from him for the past two years. He said the rate of interest was so high that Raja had to borrow money from other money lenders to pay it. He said another accused Topi had also borrowed ₹9 lakh from the victim. “Raja and Topi together hatched a conspiracy to eliminate the victim and get rid of paying back the borrowed money and its interest. They murdered him when the victim went to collect the interest amount from them at a deserted place in Hasanganj. Later, they took along the body in Shadab’s vehicle with the help of Mohd Aqeel,” Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/missing-up-moneylender-murdered-four-held-police-101640281453884.html

Posts were advertised in December 2018 and the state government could complete the appointment only in December 2020, after a long-drawn legal battle in the high court and the Supreme Court after some candidates filed a lawsuit.The chief minister had distributed appointment letters to select new recruits in October and December and even interacted with them while others received them from local MLAs, MPs and ministers in the Yogi government in their respective districts.Soon after that, hundreds of candidates who could not make into 69,000 teachers recruitment conducted by the state government staged demonstrations in the state capital alleging foul play by basic education department official as they did not adhere to reservation policy, protesters claimed.These candidates claimed the department gave only 3.86% reservations against 27% and in Scheduled Caste category 16.6% reservations were given against 21%. Likewise, in OBC category, against 18,598 candidates only 2,637 were selected. All this amounts to gross violation of reservation policy. They alleged that rules were violated in the teachers’ recruitment.The protesters recently took out a candle light march from 1090 Crossing to the chief minister’s residence. However, the police had resorted to lathicharge. The opposition parties had slammed the police lathicharge on the protesting aspiring teachers in the state capital when they started their candle light march and headed towards chief minister’s office at Kalidas Marg. Condemning the police act, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had tweeted, “Bharatiya Janata party is on the course of becoming ‘Vishwa Guru’ (world leader) by charging cane on aspiring teachers. We are with 69,000 teacher aspirants’ demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/discrepancies-in-teachers-recruitment-up-cm-meets-reserved-category-candidates-101640280973712.html

The weather will remain the same till Christmas, followed by rain showers, as per the latest forecast issued by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday. The minimum temperature in the state capital was recorded at 7.2 degrees Celsius, 1.5 degrees more than Wednesday; however, it was still one degree below normal. “A shift in pressure zone created after the snowfall in the Himalayas and reduction in movement of the cold westerly winds are the primary reason for the slight increase in the minimum temperatures across UP. The minimum temperature is expected to stay constant for a couple of days,” said JP Gupta, Director of Uttar Pradesh Met Department. As per the forecast issued by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature across UP is expected to drop by less than a degree till Monday. “The conditions will lead to the creation of a low-pressure zone that will lead to rains across many parts of Uttar Pradesh. The state is expected to get an average of 10 mm of rainfall during the weekend,” said Gupta. The rain showers will be concentrated mostly in the districts of West and Central Uttar Pradesh with a few of the east UP districts experiencing brief rain showers. “The average temperature will plunge across the state post rain,” added Gupta. The MeT department has also warned of the presence of heavy fog during morning hours across the state. Considering the forecast the state Met department has also alerted district authorities about the adverse weather conditions suggesting them to make appropriate arrangements.

23-12-2021||Lucknow||Alert people against BJP, SP’s communal tint to polarise voters: Maya||Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) of giving a Hindu-Muslim colour to electioneering to polarise voters in 2022 UP assembly polls, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Thursday instructed her party cadre to visit cities, towns and villages across the state to warn people against such designs.BSP chief called a meeting of the party leaders, office bearers, chief in-charges of party units in the 18 divisions and presidents of 75 district units in the party’s state unit office to review preparations all 403 assembly segments of the state. Addressing a press conference at the party state unit office, the BSP chief said, “Along with alerting the people about the plan of the BJP and the SP to polarise the voters on communal lines, the party office bearers and workers have been directed to create awareness among the masses about the anti-people policies of the BJP, the SP and the Congress governments as well as to highlight the development and welfare projects launched by the four BSP governments (1995, 1997, 2002 and 2007) in Uttar Pradesh.” “The party cadre should mobilise their resources to pave way for the formation of the BSP government in UP next year as they did during the 2007 assembly election. The people in UP want change and they have made up their mind to bring BSP to power in 2022 assembly election,” she said.“The BSP will seek support of people on the basis of the performance of its four governments in UP. Along with the rule of the Congress, the BJP and the SP, people have also seen the BSP government in power. I ask them which party government was the best on all the parameters of the government? The people and even the leaders of the opposition parties will tell that the BSP government was the best,” Mayawati said.She also called upon voters not to be carried away by the promises made by the rival parties or get driven by sentiments during the polls. “They should remember the good governance under the BSP rule. They should bring BSP to power. Uttar Pradesh needs a government that works for the development and welfare of the masses,” the BSP chief said. Rejecting the BJP’s claim of winning over 300 seats in the 2022 UP assembly election, Mayawati said, “Saffron brigade’s claim is baseless. Fearing defeat in the (upcoming) election, the BJP government is busy launching various projects. Union ministers and BJP central leaders have been sent for campaigning. The ministers in the state government and state unit leaders are visiting various districts several times. The BJP government is luring people and students with promises.”“The SP and other rival parties have also adopted same tactics. The rivals will not be able to trick the people. The BSP will come to power. I have faith in party workers and office bearers who are working on ground. They have strengthened the party organisation to the booth level and created awareness among the voters,” the former CM claimed.Mayawati said BSP office bearers had been given a week to complete the organisation work and that she will again review the election preparations in 403 assembly seats. When asked why she had not launched her election campaign whereas senior leaders of the BJP, the SP and the Congress were campaigning across UP, Mayawati replied that fearing defeat in the election, the rival parties’ leaders were moving from one area of the state to another whereas she was focused on strengthening the organisation and selecting candidates. Once she completed her ground work, she will start addressing public meetings, Mayawati said.

Usually, by December 15, many of the organisers announce the New Year parties around the city, but this year, the excise department has not received any requests for one-day licences from event organisers.“Unlike last year, where there were rules laid down by the state government, I am yet to receive any orders from them. We have had only some preliminary calls but nothing substantial enquiries for one-day licenses from event organisers,” said Santosh Zagade, state excise superintendent, Pune.Ajay Deshmukh, secretary Pune Wine Association said, “The uncertainty of the new variant and fear of growing numbers is keeping event planners at bay. These party organisers have to invest a lot of money for holding these New Year parties, and if the people don’t buy the passes or if government suddenly announces a ban, it will be a huge loss. The government has been unpredictable with their orders, which could be a reason for no parties this year.”However, people could opt for partying at home, with government’s decision to halve the duty on imported alcoholic products (from 300% to 150%) during the Christmas and New Year.Nita Kapoor, chief executive officer, ISWAI (International Spirits and Wines Association of India) said, “With the progressive policy announcement by the Maharashtra government slashing excise duty on imported foreign liquor by 50 per cent, it is legitimate access to better quality global brands. In a pandemic environment requiring social distancing and safeguard measures and the new threat of omicron, we may see an increase in at-home consumption replacing holidaying and large parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-requests-of-one-day-licence-for-ny-parties-say-excise-department-101640279173625.html

The warden and police were on tenterhooks, managing the onslaught of one-way traffic from the now wide Baner road and dissuading the U-turn commuters, requesting them to drive further until the Millennium Gate of the University for turning.“Diversion of the traffic began at noon and initially, it was smooth flowing, but during the evening rush hour, we faced a slight problem with many of the commuters still trying to drive straight towards Baner. It will take time for commuters to get used to this one-way idea. We will be monitoring the chowk for the next few days,” said PSI Arvind Chavan, Chatuhshringi Traffic division.Traffic police Shivram Bamble who came on duty at 3pm said, “The traffic police have been pulled in from other parts of the city and they have been divided in two shifts, 7 am to 3 pm and 3 pm to 11 pm, we have a total of six police personnel along with wardens to help manage the traffic.”Many of the Baner and Balewadi residents had mixed reactions to the diversion. Vaishali Patkar, who commutes from Mhalunge said, “Usually to go to my office on Senapati Bapat road, it takes me two-three signal halts, but today because of the one way on Baner road, it was quick, but returning will be a problem as the roads are not wide at Abhimanshree society which is the connecting road to Pashan and Baner.”“Confusion about which barricaded route to follow led to traffic snarls at peak hours.The traffic coming from SB road merges together with those going towards Aundh, Baner and commuters are confused, Then there are those who are trying to make a U-turn and slowing traffic further,” said Sarang Wable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traffic-changes-at-university-square-worsen-at-peak-hour-101640278759280.html

23-12-2021||Pune||Metro work on Sambhaji bridge finally resumes||PUNE With Ganesh mandals in Pune making their stand clear about no opposition for metro work, and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar ensuring police protection the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) resumed work of installing viaduct on Sambhaji bridge, popularly known as Lakdi pul in Deccan.Late on Wednesday, five Manache (most revered) Ganpati along with three other prominent Ganpati mandals held a meeting and issued a joint statement that they do not have any opposition to the height of metro rail viaduct, that some other mandals had opposed. The opposing mandals had cited lesser height as hurdle for the immersion procession. The manache mandals also released a joint statement stating that they never opposed the metro work but the message of the obstruction was passed in their name. “Now that Mandals have cleared their stand and deputy chief minister has given us police protection, we have resumed the work on Sambhaji bridge,” said Maha-Metro executive director Atul Gadgil. The Maha-Metro is executing two metro corridors -Vanaz to Ramwadi and Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate. The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) local unit seemed isolated on the issue as they along with Shiv Sena members created ruckus in the PMC on Tuesday, stalling the work. The BJP has already made its stand clear that work should resume at Metro site. The BJP members highlighted that the NCP and Congress leaders were well aware about height of metro corridor five years before when the Detailed Project Report (DPR) was approved. “That time, Congress and NCP leaders had given nod for it. But when the work is at the last stage, they began protesting in the name of tradition,” noted another BJP member. A Congress member requesting anonymity said, “Many members are angry with the Party’s stand. The Congress unnecessarily raised the issue, even though they were well aware about the bridge height. The work was delayed because of this.” Another NCP senior leader on anonymity said, “Our party too unnecessarily supported the Congress on this issue. Ajit Pawar had very clearly instructed not to obstruct development works and indulge into politics over it. But our party protested. Now, the Ganesh mandals have stated that halting work at Sambhaji bridge was never their demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/metro-work-on-sambhaji-bridge-finally-resumes-101640278339011.html

On October 6, 624 cases were reported in the city. With this, the daily positivity rate has touched the 1.46%-mark. Though the daily positivity rate in the city has marginally increased, the data reveals that there is no significant increase in the bed occupancy rate or hospitalisation.

For example, the daily positivity rate on December 1 was 0.28%, on December 15 it was 0.54% followed by 1.08% on December 22 and 1.46% on December 23. In the same period, the number of active patients also rose marginally from around 1,900 active cases on December 1 to 2,159 on December 21.Despite these factors, there has been no significant rise or fall in the bed occupancy rate, according to BMC data.

The daily positivity rate is 0.14% while the overall positivity is 4.37%. Currently, the total active cases are 327 (0.30%). “There are days when the cases are above 40 but at the same time, there are days when cases are below 20. So, the conclusion that there is a surge cannot be made on the instances of a few days. If the cases remain stable at a higher number continuously, then we can call it a surge,” additional commissioner, Sanjay Kakade, said.Medical health officer, Pramod Patil, has observed that there seems to be a spread this month mainly due to the travel history and the marriage functions happening.“There definitely seems to be a spread this month. Decembers are the wedding seasons. Also, December is the month when people go for vacations. While looking at the various cases, it is found that most of them had a travel history, especially to Lonavala and Pune. The weekend trips is what is causing this spread. Because, most of the time, the mask protocol is not followed. The way the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the police in Navi Mumbai have been implementing the Covid protocols here, it is not done at other places.”Patil has, hence, notified the Urban Health Primary Centre (UHPC) heads to keep a tab of people in their vicinity who go out over the weekends and to test them after they come back.Dr Patil has also issued letters to hospitals in Navi Mumbai that promote medical tourism to inform the corporation every time they get an international patient. The corporate companies at MIDC have also been notified to inform them about the international corporates visiting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/daily-testing-for-covid-increases-in-navi-mumbai-by-12-101640273533121.html

A London court allowed the couple’s extradition after much persuasion by the EOW through the country’s nodal agency for extradition – Central Bureau of Investigation – and soon they will be brought to India to be prosecuted in cases registered against them here, he said.Central law enforcement agencies had managed extradition in several cases, but it was rare for state agencies to succeed in getting the accused extradited from abroad, said the SP.The couple was arrested in London in October 2019 in a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust lodged against them in UP’s Bulandshahr in October 2015, he said.The SP said the couple’s Delhi-based firm – Bush Foods Overseas Private Limited – had purchased wheat and paddy from a Bulandhshahr ‘Aarhtiya’ (jobber) Lokendra Singh between 2013 and 2015 without making payment of ₹1.76 crore to his firm Saurabh & Sons. Singh lodged an FIR against the couple and their firm under IPC sections 406 for criminal breach of trust and 420 for fraud on October 20, 2015.He said the couple managed to get a conditional stay on arrest from the Allahabad high court on November 11, 2015, on the condition that they deposit their passports and not leave the country. “In January 2016, the Supreme Court allowed the couple to visit London for the treatment of Vir Karan Awasthy on a personal surety of ₹86 lakh and they did not return since then,” he explained. “The court issued stern directives for the extradition of the couple when they did not return,” added the SP.The case was transferred to the EOW on March 22, 2016. The EOW was making efforts to extradite the couple since December 2016 after seeking arrest warrant from the chief judicial magistrate court of Bulandshahr. He said the red corner notice was issued for the couple’s arrest and finally they were held in October 2019 after a process of nearly three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-eow-gets-nod-for-extradition-of-delhi-couple-from-uk-101640272273153.html

These are the people who saw the politics of Uttar Pradesh only through the prism of caste, creed, and religion. These people never wanted UP to develop, to have a modern identity. Schools, colleges, hospitals, roads, water, electricity, houses of the poor, gas connections, toilets, which have been built under sabka saath, sabka vikas, they do not consider these as development.”PM Modi also alleged that those thinking of selfish gains are not liking the development of the state.“They have an objection to the development of Purvanchal and works for Baba Vishwanath Dham. I have been told that last Sunday, 1.50 lakh pilgrims reached for darshan of Baba Vishwanath Dham,” PM Modi said.Those who pushed UP backward, their anger will further increase as people from all over the state are standing with the double engine government and giving their blessings, PM Modi said.The difference between what the people of UP got during the earlier governments and what the people of the state are getting from our government today is clear, he said.“We are also increasing the heritage in UP, we are developing the state,” PM Modi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/some-see-politics-of-uttar-pradesh-through-prism-of-caste-religion-pm-modi-in-varanasi-101640270532958.html

23-12-2021||Lucknow||Roadmap for trillion-dollar economy: 9 months on, UP govt yet to issue fresh bids to appoint consultant||LUCKNOW The Uttar Pradesh government has still not been able to appoint a consultant to work out a roadmap to make the state a trillion-dollar economy. After the task began in 2018, it floated international bids on June 19, 2019 to appoint a consultant and subsequently cancelled them on March 22, 2021, saying fresh bids will be issued soon. Nine months on, the state government has not been able to come out with fresh bids to appoint a consultant. “We have had a meeting at the chief secretary’s level. Fresh bids to appoint a consultant will be floated soon,” said a senior officer of state government. As two precious years of the five-year (2020-2025) timeline have already passed, the state government would have to come out with revised timelines to work out a roadmap to take UP’s GSDP to trillion dollars. “The target of making UP a trillion-dollar economy in five years (2020-2025) was too ambitious. Now, precious time has been lost in the bidding process. Revision of timeline will be required. Looking at the current growth trends in the state’s economy, this target can be achieved in about a decade from now,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of department, economics, Lucknow University. Asked about UP’s economy by the end of the 2020-2025 timeline, Tyagi said: “As per my calculation, UP’s economy is likely to end up with a size of around 330 billion dollars in 2024-2025, taking into account the current size of GSDP and prevailing rupee-dollar exchange rate. It will be better if the state government chalks out a long term plan for sustainable development.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mooted the idea of making UP a trillion- dollar economy while inaugurating the UP Investors’ Summit in Lucknow on February 21, 2018. “Can Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh compete with each other to become a trillion-dollar economy? Will UP government compete with other states? More the competition more will be the investment. This will result in creation of more jobs and strengthen the concept of cooperative federalism,” said Modi while inaugurating the summit. The PM’s observations had set the ball rolling for ‘trillion-dollar economy’ and the state government began holding discussions at various levels to work out a road map for its implementation. The Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow organised a programme ‘Manthan’, to impart lessons on good governance to all ministers and senior officers on September 8, 2019. Later, more learning lessons were organised at the chief minister’s residence. Subsequently, a decision to appoint a consultant to work out a roadmap to make the state a trillion-dollar economy was taken. The state government floated the bids on June 19, 2020. Following suggestions from bidders, a revised Request for Proposal (RFP) was provided with revised timelines and October 9, 2020 was set as the last date for submission of bids. The consultant to be selected was expected to work out a roadmap to make the state a trillion-dollar economy in a period of five years from 2020 to 2025. After opening of financial bids and zeroing down on selection of a bidder as consultant, the state government decided to cancel the bids vide notice dated March 22, 2021. 
23-12-2021||Lucknow||Cow is mother, sacred for us: PM Modi in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said talking about cow has been made a matter of “sin” by some people but “it is mother and sacred for us”. The PM was addressing a rally in Varanasi after inaugurating and laying foundation stones of 27 projects worth ₹2095 crore, including the Banas Dairy Kashi Sankul at Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority Food Park, in Karkhiyaon, just months ahead of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.He said those making fun of cows and buffaloes forget that the livelihood of eight crore families depends on “pashudhan” (livestock).“Talking about cow, talking about ‘gobardhan’ (cow dung) has been made a matter of ‘gunah’ (sin) by some people. Cow can be a sin for some people, for us it is mother, sacred (gaaye kuch logo ke liye gunah ho sakti hai, hamare liye gaaye, mata hai, poojniye hai),” Modi said.Alleging that previous governments ignored the dairy sector, Modi said strengthening and promoting this sector is one of the topmost priorities of his government. In this direction, the foundation of the Banas Dairy Kashi Sankul has been laid in Varanasi, he said.Spread across 30 acres, Banas Dairy Kashi Sankul will be built at a cost of about ₹475 crore and would process about 5 lakh litre milk per day. This is Modi’s second visit to his constituency in the past 10 days. Earlier, he had inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in the city on December 13.The Prime Minister digitally transferred a bonus of about ₹35 crore to the bank accounts of more than 1.7 lakh milk producers.“I firmly believe the dairy sector, animal husbandry, new energy in white revolution of the country can play a big role in changing the condition of farmers. There are many reasons for this belief. First, animal husbandry can become a huge source of additional income for the small farmers of the country, whose number is more than 100 million,” he said.“Second, India’s dairy products have a huge market abroad, in which we have a lot of potential to move forward. Third, animal husbandry is a great way for the economic uplift of women, to further their entrepreneurship. And the fourth is that our livestock is also a basis for biogas, organic farming and natural farming,” he said.Milk production in the country has increased by about 45% as compared to seven years ago, he said.“Today, India produces about 22% of the world’s milk. I am happy that today UP is not only the largest milk producing state in the country, it is also ahead in the expansion of the dairy sector,” he added.Modi also launched a portal and a logo dedicated to the Conformity Assessment Scheme of milk products developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) with the help of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).An integrated logo featuring Kamdhenu cow has also been launched for certification, he said.When this proof, this logo is visible, it will be easy to identify purity and also increase the credibility of India’s milk products, he said.The PM also stressed on natural farming, saying it is the need of the hour.With the passage of time, the scope of natural farming was reduced and chemical farming became dominant, he said.“For the rejuvenation of the earth, to protect our soil and to secure the future of the coming generations, we must once again turn to natural farming,” he said. Modi also paid tribute to former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh on his birth anniversary which is celebrated as Kisan Diwas.The Prime Minister also laid foundation stones for a biogas-based electricity generation plant and a homeopathic medical college.About the projects in Varanasi, he said, “Varanasi is fast turning into a model of development. New projects are bringing unprecedented ease and convenience for the people of Varanasi.”In another effort to reduce the number of land ownership issues at the grassroots level, PM virtually distributed the rural residential rights record, “Gharauni”, under the Swamitva scheme of the Union Ministry of Panchayati Raj to over 20 lakh residents of the state.Modi also inaugurated multiple urban development projects, including six for the redevelopment of Old Kashi wards, a parking-and-surface park at Beniabag, beautification of two ponds, a sewage treatment plant and provisioning of advanced surveillance cameras at 720 locations under the Smart City Mission.Projects in the education sector inaugurated by the Prime Minister include the Union Education Ministry’s Inter University Centre for Teachers Education, built at a cost of around ₹107 crore, and a teachers’ education centre at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, built at a cost of over ₹7 crore.He inaugurated a project comprising a doctors’ hostel, a nurses’ hostel and a shelter home, built at ₹130 crore, at Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre, a 50-bed Integrated Ayush Hospital at Bhadrasi.

People came to know after the gas spread in the area which caused panic among the residents.“The gas leak incidents have become a regular affair in Pimple Gurav and when we complain to MNGL officials or Smart City officials – the blame game starts. The incidents which happened during the Ganesh festival and in July were the major ones,” said Devyani Bharambe, a resident of Shri Krishna chowk.Another resident, Vikas Gaikwad said, “Officials are not serious about issues as they have not learnt from the past mistakes. If such activities are not stopped then we are planning to raise the matter with police as we don’t get proper response from officials and gas company.”The work of the Smart City project has been going on for the last one and a half years, however, Covid-19 has severely impacted the work which is still moving at a snail’s pace. Pimple Saudagar, Pimple Gurav and Wakad have been included in the area-based development project of the Smart City. The estimated cost of the project is Rs344.54 crore.“We are not responsible for the damages which have occurred from the gas pipeline leakage in Pimple Gurav, the people who are digging roads have to remain alert as we have placed route markers at every location from where the gas line is passed. Such incidents happen due to the negligent attitude of workers who are doing these works,” said an official from MNGL at the request of anonymity.“Whenever a gas leakage incident happens, our mobile van makes sure that the pipeline is restored at the earliest. Our helpline contact number is written on the route marker,” added the official.A smart city official said, “Few incidents happened due to human errors. We are taking precautions and we will take details from the officials who are in charge during the incident.”“We are planning to put barricades near the MNGL gas route marker in advance before starting digging work so it will alert the workers,” added the official.Incidents of gas leak in Pimple Gurav (2021)May 11: Four wheelers caught fire after gas leakage in a pipeline in RamnagarJune 4: Due to ongoing work via JCB around 11pm in Shrusti chowk, gas pipeline leakage occurred, causing panic in the areaJune 10: While digging a road during concretisation work a gas line was damagedJuly 3: Near Narmada Garden, gas leakage occurredJuly 17: At Shri Krishna nagar fire sparks erupted after the gas leakageJuly 31: One injured, one vehicle got damaged due to a gas leakSeptember 14: Fifth day Ganpati immersion process was put on halt in Pimple Gurav, after gas spread in the surroundingsDecember 22: Big tragedy was averted at the Ram Krishna chowk when a gas pipeline got damaged near parked vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pimple-gurav-residents-fume-over-mngl-gas-leak-cases-101640267353044.html

With traffic snarls and bumper-to-bumper traffic being reported all throughout the day, commuters are stuck for hours at the junction. Traffic jams happen daily between 8 am and 10 pm and sometimes stretch to 11.30 pm.Commuters are struggling to reach their destinations, both towards Ahmednagar road and also towards Hadapsar, Wanowrie, NIBM, Camp and other areas. According to civil society members , more than 10,000 two, four and other types of vehicles including trucks, trolleys and multi-axle vehicles pass through that road on a daily basis.The situation spirals out of control every day that residents who live in houses along the road have reported smoke flakes settling on the rooftops and inside the house early in the morning.A spot visit by HT revealed that Hadapsar-Kharadi bypass which passes through Mundhwa and the stretch from Mahatma Phule chowk till Lonkar School was overcrowded all throughout the day, with no or less enforcement by the traffic authorities.Residents of the area complained that traffic volume has gone up by more than 80 per cent during the past one year with no concrete steps being undertaken either by the PMC or the Pune Traffic branch to alleviate their sufferings. The residents complained of incessant honking and pollution affecting their health, with no check up being done by the PMC health department.Devidas Lonkar, an area resident said “ We have to take a one km long route to reach our house which is very troublesome. There is an urgent need to erect a grade separator or a flyover at Mahatma Phule chowk to decongest traffic. Also, the PMC must carry out free health checks for residents who are facing issues because of the faulty planning of the authorities.”Sagar Bhandari, another resident, pointed out that senior citizens, women and children were facing the worst ordeal due to PMCs inaction and lack of enforcement by the traffic authorities. “ The pollution levels are rising and authorities must carry out periodic checks and ensure that pollution levels are brought down at the earliest.”Amrita Sharma, a resident said, “Earlier there was space outside the house for children to play, now that has been taken over by the ever-expanding road. The rapid urbanisation undertaken by the PMC has resulted in a mess in Mundhwa.”DCP (Traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “We are in talks with the PMC and all the stakeholders including experts. We have taken a lot of follow ups with the authorities and will increase the number of policemen for managing traffic. Also, there are cases related to encroachments which need to be dealt with legally so that smooth flow of traffic is expected in the future.”BoxHead: For a smooth commute-Increase the number of traffic cops-CCTV surveillance-Adjusting timings of three vital signals on the stretch-Expansion of the road on Mula-Mutha river bridge-Construction of flyover or grade separator||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/travelling-to-mundhwa-keshavnagar-the-tougher-task-is-on-the-road-101640266752775.html

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Allahabadi Christmas cake blends creativity, cultures||A Punjabi relishing a British delight with an Awadhi twist! There couldn’t be a better tribute to the lip-smacking Allahabadi Christmas cake than this, I thought as I eyed the delectable spread on the dining table. I simply could not wait to sink my teeth into it. The aroma of Christmas cakes that lay in front of me was too hard to resist. After all Christmas, and the chance to savour the cakes, come only once a year. The Allahabadi Christmas cake is a perfect mélange of Indian and British culinary traditions and creativity, and thus, a symbol of bonhomie. The Awadhi twist granted to it by incorporating the famous ‘petha’ of Agra, is attributed to a Muslim baker and an Anglo lady of Allahabad. It is followed to a tee by the Christians possessing the recipe, which landed in my family residing in Amritsar, thanks to my maternal grandmother, who hailed from Allahabad, the city of Triveni Sangam. I fought the urge to steal a bite and waited patiently till after dinner and was rewarded with the first piece of the same. The first bite transported me into raptures of delight when my taste buds came in contact with the delicious mixture of fruit, peels, dry fruits and other ingredients marinated in rum for days. Meanwhile, my teeth romanced the ‘petha’. I have been relishing this experience for the past four decades. Yet, every Christmas season makes these cakes taste even tastier than ever before. There’s more to the Allahabadi Christmas cake than just the confluence of Anglo-Awadhi traditions. It’s a symbol of goodwill between families, friends and colleagues being a part of the process of gift-giving. I remember the time when my buddies and colleagues used to eagerly look forward to mine each Christmas. The cake, coupled with a cup of hot tea or coffee, helped us forge long-lasting ties and beautiful memories that we cherish to date. The uniqueness of the Allahabadi Christmas cake lies in the fact that it is something you simply cannot order or buy off the shelves on the spur of the moment. You have to have the proper recipe, buy, mix and prepare your ingredients as stipulated in it and get it baked at a bakery with ovens using coal furnaces to get that iconic taste. You can add your creative touch to make your confection unique. Besides, you have to book your slot and stick to it. That’s not much of an issue with the Christians of Amritsar, the food capital of India, where this Christmas tradition has received a fillip over the years. The gradually growing queues outside the few bakeries that bake these cakes, testify to people’s acceptance of this unique Christmas tradition. shaheen.parshad@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/allahabadi-christmas-cake-blends-creativity-cultures-101640264352490.html

The work of all these projects is under way and is expected to be completed in three-four years.“With the completion of these projects, the traffic situation in the city will change to a large extent in three-four years. At the same time, all the stakeholders including KDMC, traffic and RTO have jointly decided to work to find solutions of traffic-related issues in KDMC limits,” said Suryavanshi.Some of the immediate solutions put up at the meeting were clearing the footpaths of hawkers, action against illegal parking, auto rickshaws to be parked only in auto stands, introducing one-way traffic flow and penalising violators through e-challan.Suryavanshi assured that these measures would be considered and implemented in a few months. Balasaheb Patil, DCP (traffic), Thane, said, “We have asked for traffic wardens. This will give people an idea on how difficult it is to manage traffic. An auto stand outside the Kalyan station was closed down by the Railway during the lockdown. We will approach them to reopen the same as it will help control the congestion on the station road caused by the three-wheelers.”The traffic police also have plans to impose one-ways in the city in the coming days for smooth flow of vehicles. The department also raised the need to have truck terminus in the city for heavy vehicles. The auto union representatives highlighted their demand for proper auto stands outside the railway station in the SATIS project.“There is a need to have proper stands for us in the city. At present, they are not there and that is the reason we park here and there. If a proper space is provided, we will park the auto accordingly,” said Santosh Navle, representative, Kalyan Auto Rickshaw Driver Owner Union.A passenger association representative from Dombivli, Sachin Gawli, raised the need to have more civic buses on the streets while expert Rajeev Thayshetye emphasised on clearing the footpaths and roads of encroachment.Following the demand of a dedicated auto lane for women auto drivers outside Kalyan station by the Aboli Women Rickshaw Association, the Kalyan RTO has agreed to give one in a week’s time.

DCP Balasaheb Patil has informed that the department would implement the e-challan system in the twin cities from the first week of January.“The e –challan system is already used in Thane. It will help spot violators and control congestion caused by those who cut lanes or jump signals,” said Patil.The department has raised certain demands for marking the roads with stop lines wherever the signals are installed.“We have asked the civic body to mark the stop line and zebra crossing so that we can start penalising the violators. Presently, there is no marking on the roads where the signals are installed. The stop line is necessary to decide if a person has violated the traffic signal rule,” added Patil.As per the traffic police, the marking on the roads would be done in another eight to ten days.The Smart Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL) has installed traffic signals at five different locations out of the 20 locations decided as of now. The work on the installation of the remaining locations is under progress. Presently, these signals are functional. However, they are not activated for e-challan.“As per the requirement, the marking will be done soon at the five spots in a week’s time,” said an officer of SKDCL.
23-12-2021||Lucknow||Man in Lucknow gets life sentence for sexually assaulting autistic woman||LUCKNOW The special court (Ayurveda scam) on Thursday sentenced a man to life imprisonment and slapped a penalty of ₹50,000 on him after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting an autistic woman.The incident occurred three years ago when the man was 37 years old and the woman was aged 24. DNA sampling of the rape survivor’s 19-week foetus at that time and regular monitoring of the case by the prosecution helped in taking action against the accused, said Ashutosh Pandey, ADG, prosecution. He said the case was a bit different as the survivor had neurodevelopment disorder and was unable to express herself or identify the person.The convict, Khushal Singh, was the survivor’s trainer and he outraged her modesty at the training centre near Ram Ram Bank crossing in Madiaon, taking advantage of her disorder. The incident was reported to the police on November 26, 2018, after the survivor’s parents found her 19 weeks pregnant, said the ADG. Initially, investigators did not have any proper evidence against the accused as the survivor was unable to narrate the incident. The man was arrested on February 16, 2019, after his DNA sample was matched with the foetus, which was preserved after the victim’s pregnancy was terminated due to medical complications, said Pandey.He said Khushal Singh, along with his wife, runs Samarpan Day Care Foundation, in Madiaon, Lucknow. Earlier, the couple worked at different training centres for special children. The rape survivor was kept at a special children’s centre in Dehradun for 11 years as she was unable to speak and identify anyone because of her neuro-development disorder.The woman’s parents, who worked in Lucknow, brought her to the city during the summer vacation. She was kept her in the day care centre run by Khushal Singh for 10 days. After the incident, the woman, who has speech disability, could not tell her parents about it.The police first zeroed in on three suspects at the day care centre and collected blood samples to match them with the DNA sample of the foetus.“DNA sampling was done in two months’ time and it matched with that of Khushal Singh,” said the ADG, adding, “He later confessed to the crime when he was questioned. He said he raped the woman when his wife was not present at the day care centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/man-in-lucknow-gets-life-sentence-for-sexually-assaulting-autistic-woman-101640263692763.html
23-12-2021||Mumbai||Thane Police claim rise in conviction of cases; experts say otherwise||The Thane Police have claimed an increase in the number of convictions of cases that went for hearing in the Thane Sessions Court. However, lawyers and experts have claimed that there’s still a long way to go. The police record states that the conviction rate at present is 35% of the total cases that go for hearing. This was 25% in 2020 and 30% in 2019. The state average is 15% conviction rate in 2019 and 7.8% in 2020. The department claims the Thane rate is much more than this. Experts feel that with proper training to the police officials on evidence collection and recording statements, the rate can be much higher.In 2019, the Thane commissionerate saw conviction in 96 cases whereas in 2020 it was 24, less due to the pandemic lockdown, and in 2021, when the court had resumed only for important cases, the conviction again surged up to 107 cases in the Sessions Court of Thane. On the contrary, acquittal of cases has also increased slightly than earlier with 67 cases acquitted in 2019, 18 in 2020 and 70 this year. The conviction rate is steady despite several hurdles across the year, claimed the police. During the pandemic, most officers were infected with Covid while a few even lost their family members. Senior officials claimed that convictions are due to team efforts that involve investigation, collection of evidence, writing and documenting the evidence properly in the charge sheet, keeping an eye on the witnesses and victims to ensure they do not turn hostile, and efforts of the lawyers who fight the cases. Ashok Morale, additional commissioner of Thane police (crime), said, “Despite all odds during the pandemic, we have maintained a stable conviction of cases compared to the pre-pandemic year. One reason is the efforts of the police constables deputed to the court who are responsible for ensuring coordination between public prosecutors and investigating officers in a case. They work dedicatedly on each case assigned to them. They ensure the witnesses have received the summons and appear before the court on the scheduled date, help them in their statements, file evidence in court and complete all the needed paperwork on time.” These groups of court officers have a meeting once a month with senior officers of the police station to discuss errors and positives of the cases, he said. Morale added, “We regularly organise training sessions for these officers but due to the pandemic, these sessions were reduced. However, we ensure that the monthly meetings are held, the efforts of these officers are acknowledged and encouraged.” However, contrary to the police claims, lawyers have a different view and proper training of police officials is needed to increase convictions. Sangita Fad, a special public prosecutor with 100% convictions, said, “In my 20 years of experience, 80% to 90% acquittals are due to improper investigation. Cops need training in ensuring the FIR copy and the statement of the witnesses and victims are the same, the sections imposed and what evidence is needed to prove those sections, how the evidence should be bagged and presented. The cops also do not keep track of chemical analysis or other evidence of a case for years. There should be at least two law experts or knowledgeable officials in every police station.” Milind Mhaske, director of Praja Foundation, did a study on the pendency of court cases. He said that the police department needs more resources and manpower. “The responsibility of getting convictions lay equally with both the prosecution and the police. Our society is completely dependent on police for things like security, and also expects them to investigate. There is a huge disparity in the number of cases that are registered and the number of investigation officers we have. This has overburdened the police officer,” said Mhaske. He said that there was a talk of dividing the legal and investigation team but due to fewer resources, it did not take shape. “Secondly, prosecution and investigation officers both need training to coordinate and ideas to improve conviction rate. It is a team work and everyone is lacking in some things. The sole priority should be getting justice for the victim.” CASE STUDY – CONSTABLE PROTECTS SOLE EYE WITNESS Constable Gaurav Pachegaonkar, who works on the court cases, recently got conviction in two murders in Bhiwandi. He said, “In a case where a restaurant cook killed a waiter, the investigation officers were able to crack a young witness. My responsibility was to ensure the safety of this sole eye witness. With several approaches like arranging a different job for him, keeping him emotionally attached with the dead person’s memory and keeping regular checks on him, we got the accused convicted for life sentence.” Pachegaonkar himself was unwell at the time when the witness was called, but since the witness was attached to him, he went to support him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-police-claim-rise-in-conviction-of-cases-experts-say-otherwise-101640263332624.html
23-12-2021||Mumbai||Food for jab: BMC incentivises vaccination for ragpickers of Dharavi||Mumbai Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to distribute food grain packets as an incentive to ragpickers of Dharavi for getting vaccinated and has organised a special vaccination drive targeting this group of unorganised labour, on December 24 and 25. The food grain packets will be distributed after the ragpickers get inoculated at the vaccine centres, along with packets of hand wash, sanitisers, and masks.Approximately 2,500 rag pickers have already been identified by BMC’s G/North ward, which has jurisdiction over the Dharavi area. The civic solid waste management department started mobilisation work among ragpickers this week, with the help of local non-governmental organisations and other social groups working in Dharavi.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward said, “We have identified approximately 2,000-2,500 ragpickers as beneficiaries for this drive. BMC has tied up with Clean up foundation for distribution of food grain packets.”The drive will take place at the Dharavi Pumping station, at Sant Rohidas Road, in Dharavi, between 9 am and 6 pm. To avoid crowding at the vaccination centre, BMC has distributed coupons with time slots to all rag pickers. A senior civic official said, “Each day, we plan to vaccinate 1000 beneficiaries.”“Most rag-pickers are reluctant to get health care, not just regarding Covid, but otherwise as well. They ignore their health. Covid vaccination requires registration on the Cowin portal and documentation. Ragpickers usually do not have access to devices for such registration, and may or may not have their documents in place. We already held counselling sessions with them for this. Civic officials and the NGO workers are taking care of the registration processes for each of these beneficiaries,” the officer added.Civic officials noticed that ragpickers were not keen to get vaccinated and some of them did not have sufficient information about the need and benefits of getting vaccinated. Hence, the civic body has decided to distribute food grains after the beneficiaries get their shots.Ragpickers also are most exposed to infections due to the nature of their work, and the exposure they have to their surrounding environment, civic authorities said. “To effectively break the chain of the spread of the virus, vaccination of this group is an important step,” the officer quoted above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/food-for-jab-bmc-incentivises-vaccination-for-ragpickers-of-dharavi-101640262252260.html
23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Veteran Akali leader Brahmpura, son return to SAD after 3 years||Old-time Akali leader Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, 84, who had left the Sukhbir Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal three years ago, was inducted back into the party by SAD patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in Chandigarh on Thursday. Also read: Punjab elections: Congress to follow one family, one ticket normBadal Senior, accompanied by his son Sukhbir and other SAD leaders, arrived at Brahmpura’s house in Chandigarh’s Sector 15 and welcomed him back into the party along with his son Ravinder Singh, a former MLA from Khadoor Sahib, Ujjagar Singh Wadali, a former minister, and Karnail Singh Peer Mohammad, a former president of the Sikh Students’ Federation. Sukhbir offered Brahmpura the number 2 post as vice-patron after Badal Senior, who is the patron. Brahmpura, however, declined the offer, saying he was not eyeing any post but wanted to strengthen the party in the run-up to the assembly elections early next year. Sukhbir said he respects Brahmpura just as he looks up to his father. “Both of them are like brothers and have fought many battles together,” he said. On Dhindsa, Sukhbir says everyone welcome backAddressing the gathering, Sukhbir said that in the past, the SAD has fought against attacks on the Panth and Punjab and would continue to do that. Answering a query on the prospects of Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa joining back, Sukhbir said that he welcomed everyone into the party with folded hands. He also thanked Akal Takht jathedar (head priest) Giani Harpreet Singh for calling upon all Panthic fronts to unite. Referring to the elections, Sukhbir said that the SAD was fighting the might of three governments, one in Delhi led by the Aam Aadmi Party; the Congress government in Punjab; and the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. In reply to a query, Sukhbir reiterated that Bathinda SAD MP and his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal will not be contesting the assembly elections. Speaking on the occasion, Badal Senior said that Brahmpura had played a vital role in his becoming the Punjab chief minister five times. He admitted shortcomings in the past that have been rectified now. “I’m happy with Brahmpura Saab’s joining Akali Dal. We are ek jaan ek maan and now there is a need to strengthen the party when it being attacked on all fronts be it religious, personal or political,” he said. He also appealed to the workers to stand united for the sake of the party and suggested Sukhbir consider the advice from Brahmpura as a ‘elahi farman’ (God’s word). Pardon to dera chief led to breakup Brahmpura had left the SAD in October 2018 after the party’s debacle in 2017, questioning the party’s leadership. He was upset with the leadership for deviating from the Panthic agenda and not taking the party members into confidence before pardoning Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. In March 2019, Brahmpura founded the SAD (Taksali), which he later merged with the SAD (Democratic) founded by Dhindsa, who had also resigned from SAD in 2018. Last year, both the leaders merged their outfits into a new party SAD (Sanyukt). Speaking on the occasion Brahmpura referred to Badal Senior as “Baba Bohar” whose footsteps he had followed in his entire political career. “I was on a holiday for some time and am back now. I call upon everyone to come back into the Akali Dal and contest the upcoming elections with full strength,” Brahmpura said, urging the cadre to unite.

Two alleged members of the gang have been arrested with fake notes ( ₹8 lakh) in the denomination of ₹2,000. The currency was allegedly smuggled through the porous India-Bangladesh border in West Bengal. The arrested men have allegedly supplied fake notes ( ₹2 crore) in Delhi over two years.Deputy police commissioner Jasmeet Singh said the arrested men, Feroz Sheikh, 42, and Muffazul Sheikh, 52, belong to West Bengal’s Murshidabad and were arrested on Tuesday. He added in October, they received information regarding the circulation of fake notes. Singh said a team accordingly began collecting details about the persons involved and later identified two active members of the gang and kept a watch on their movements.On Tuesday, the team received inputs that Feroz Sheikh would deliver a consignment of fake notes to his associate. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the two were held.Police cited Feroz Sheikh’s Interrogation and added he procured the fake notes from one Salaam of Murshidabad. Salaam allegedly directed him to hand over the notes to Muffazul Sheikh in Delhi and their contacts in the city for circulation. The arrested accused have allegedly been circulating fake notes across the country for five years.“Feroz disclosed that Salaam used to receive the fake notes from Bangladesh. The two paid ₹30,000 in original currency notes to procure fake banknotes worth ₹1 lakh from Salaam. They further supplied that ₹1 lakh of fake notes to their contacts in Delhi-NCR and other parts of the country for ₹45,000. They confessed to having supplied FICN amounting to over ₹two crores in Delhi in the last two years,” said a second officer.Police said after the 2016 demonetisation of high-value notes, there was a pause in the circulation of FICN from Bangladesh and Pakistan for about a year. They added many syndicates have again started smuggling and circulating the FICN in India.Police said the notes seized from the two are of such fine quality that it is difficult to distinguish them from the original ones. The fake currency has almost similar security features such as texture, quality of paper, colour, security thread and watermarks.“From the investigation of various cases of big seizures of FICN in Kathmandu (Nepal), Bangladesh and in India after demonetisation, it has been strongly suspected that big consignments of FICNs are first brought into Nepal and Bangladesh from Pakistan through Gulf countries by air and from there they are smuggled into India through porous international borders of Nepal and Bangladesh,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-major-fake-currency-racket-two-persons-arrested-101640261052142.html

23-12-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Jagannath Shetty, harbinger of restaurant culture in Pune||A few years ago, I was talking with the late Charudutta Sarpotdar, the grand old man of Pune’s foodscape, when Mr Sankalp Thote, who owned a small manufacturing unit near Saswad happened to overhear our conversation. He was there to dine at Poona Guest House when Sarpotdar was recounting how Maharashtrian eateries in Pune shut down and were replaced by “Udupi hotels” like “Vaishali”. A day earlier, I had met Mr Jagannath Shetty, the man who owned the famous “Vaishali”, “Roopali”, and “Amrapali”. His eyes sparkled when he narrated how he came to Pune as a teenager with nothing in his pockets, and how he had to toil day and night to make the largely conservative people in Pune fall in love with his eateries. Thote too had fond memories of “Vaishali”. He was eight years old when he had idli with sambar at a friend’s house in 1982. It was his first time tasting the dish. He loved it and the next day demanded that his mother made it for him. Mrs Thote borrowed an “idli stand” and the recipe for sambar from a neighbour and proceeded to fulfil her son’s wish. But he was not satisfied with the dish. According to him, the idli-sambar his mother cooked came nowhere close to the one he had at the party. Upon further inquiries, it was revealed that idli-sambar at the party had been ordered from a restaurant named “Vaishali”. A few weeks later, Thote’s father took the entire family to the said restaurant. It was the family’s first time to dine in a restaurant. It was the first time that Thote’s mother had stepped inside a “posh” restaurant. Thote went there once a year with his parents to have his favourite idli-sambar. His love affair with “Vaishali” became serious once he enrolled in the Fergusson College. He had recently celebrated his son’s fifth birthday at the restaurant when I met him at Poona Guest House. Thote and thousands like him have fond memories associated with “Vaishali” and “Roopali”. Shetty’s restaurants have for years served as important, yet undervalued sites on which the relationship between Pune’s metropolitan culture and the wider world has prospered. Today, Pune seems to be perpetually engaged in eating. Go where you will between the hours of 7 in the morning and 10 in the night, and one is reminded that man is a cooking animal. Tables are always spread, odours from the kitchen are always rising, men (and sometimes, women) stand on pavements to eat. But apart from weddings and other religious ceremonies, there were very few public dining options available to Punekars, and Indians in general, till the middle of the last century. Before the First World War, restaurants in Pune were few and far between. Notions of “purity” and “impurity” ruled every aspect of living and eating out was taboo. The period before the First World War brought the first ripples of change in Pune. Several tea shops and “misal-joints” opened in the city. But they were looked down upon. They largely catered to students, small traders, and workers, who had no option but to eat out. Pune’s population growth after the Second World War was accompanied by an enlargement of the physical size of the city, and a concomitant increase in the distance between places of residence and places of employment. This rising population was accompanied by a slight increase in the number of restaurants. Pune had remained in a state of culinary insularity for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The slow emergence of the post-independence Indian middle-class signalled a new beginning for the city and its foodscape. This post-war culinary revolution in Pune was ably and successfully led by Jagannath Shetty and his restaurants. He made sure that public eating became an important aspect of the urban economy. Shetty was born on October 8, 1932, in a small village in the Udupi district in Karnataka. Like several men from the region, he too left for Mumbai to work in a restaurant. His uncle Shridhar Shetty ran a couple of restaurants in Kalyan and Pune. Jagannath Shetty was paid ₹3 per month. Men who ran the casual, café-style establishments in twentieth-century Mumbai and Pune often had begun as restaurant workers before deciding to go into business themselves. Typically located near colleges and markets, these eateries provided inexpensive “home cooking”, and served Maharashtrian dishes like “missal”, “thalipeeth”, and “ghavan”. Shetty followed in their footsteps. Four years later, he came to Pune and established “Madras Café” and “Madras Health Home”, later renamed as “Roopali” and “Vaishali” respectively. “Amrapali” was born a few years later. “Madras Café” and “Madras Health Home” served what was popularly known as “South Indian food”. In post-independence Mumbai, “South Indian food” was widely associated with migration and deemed culturally problematic. While the history of “South Indian” food’s rise to popularity in Mumbai reveals an uneasy coexistence between racism and exclusion and gradual development of appreciation, Pune embraced the first of the modern “South Indian” eateries with open arms. It was not a superficial or a cosmetic relationship, but a full acceptance of the cuisine. Restaurateurs like Gundi and Mijar were the pioneers of “South Indian food” in Poona. They served dosas and called them “ghavans” in the early twentieth century. A few eateries in Rasta Peth were the first to serve idlis in Pune. Shetty popularised these dishes. For many college students, both men and women, opportunities to eat out informally with friends at “Vaishali” and “Roopali” offered a means of shunning probing stares by the conservative society and home-cooked meals. The restaurants were approved by their parents who preferred those to the “non-veg” serving Irani restaurants. In the early restaurants of New York, London, and Calcutta, people gathered and exchanged information and ideas, and engaged in debate. In providing a space for these activities and a gathering place for information and news, these restaurants and coffeehouses also offered fertile ground for the questioning of authority, practices that were crucial to the development and survival of democracy. “Roopali” and “Vaishali” provided such space to actors, politicians, students, writers, painters, and most importantly, women, to talk and debate over dosa and coffee. Shetty’s restaurants combined the private world of the home and the public world of business, a feat very few could achieve. Elsewhere in post-independence India, the newly emergent social ritual of public dining was an overwhelmingly young, male, and working – or – middle-class phenomenon. Shetty’s restaurants made sure that they were inclusive. Women played a crucial role in the creation of this semipublic sphere, for it was their patronage that made these restaurants largely acceptable to the middle-class in Pune. Having become part of the everyday lives of many, Shetty’s restaurants have acquired a loyal mass following that had diversified to include families and a cross-class clientele. Some customers might have poked fun at the sambar served (they claimed it was not “authentic”), yet most patronised these establishments and enjoyed the cuisine on offer – regardless of it proclaimed “inauthenticity”. Even after eating houses proliferated throughout the city at the very end of the last century, “Vaishali” and “Roopali” have continued to enjoy the love and support of their customers. Jagannath Shetty’s biggest contribution to the food scene in Pune was to make public dining acceptable. His restaurants both reflected and helped to shape a new public culture in twentieth-century Pune. While the early restaurants catered mainly to the working class crowd seeking a cheap meal or snack, “Vaishali” and “Roopali” taught people to eat out for pleasure. And for this, we shall be forever grateful to him and his staff. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

23-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra panel backs longer jail terms, higher penalties in Shakti bill||Maharashtra legislature’s joint select committee (JSC) on a proposed law to prevent atrocities against women has recommended more stringent punishments than at present.For instance, under section 326A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Shakti bill proposes to increase imprisonment for acid attack perpetrators from the current 10 years to life to a minimum of 15 years extendable to life along with a fine paid to the survivor.“The expenditure of plastic surgery and face reconstruction operations for the victim will be taken care of from the penalty to be charged from the accused,” state home minister Dilip Walse Patil said in the legislative assembly on Wednesday while tabling the changes recommended by the 21-member committee.The revised version of the Shakti bill is expected to be placed before the state legislature soon for approval.The state government had placed Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, and Maharashtra Exclusive Special Court (for certain offences against Women and Children under Shakti Law) in the state legislature in December 2020. It was then sent to the JSC for deliberations.The committee also recommended an increase in punishment under section 175A of the IPC for failure to share data or electronic record for the purpose of investigation by social media platforms, internet service providers to three months from one month and a fine up to ₹25 lakh from the ₹5 lakh proposed in the previous draft.The committee recommended increasing the punishment for false complaints.

A discussion on the ordinances is expected to take place in both Houses, assembly and council, before they can be made into laws.State officials of the legal department said the government decided to table the ordinances as the SC stay did not imply that the legislative process — wherein an ordinance issued by the government has to be converted into legislation within six months before it lapsed — was also stayed.On September 23, the state promulgated an ordinance to amend two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats — to ensure up to 27% reservation to OBC candidates. This was done after the top court struck down a legal provision that granted exactly 27% political reservation on the grounds that it exceeded the 50% ceiling when taken together with constitutionally guaranteed reservations provided to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (SC, ST) candidates.On October 1, the state promulgated a second ordinance to amend three other laws — the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and the Industrial Townships Act — which govern urban local bodies.Political reservation to OBC candidates in local body elections fall within the purview of five laws in Maharashtra; two govern rural local bodies and three govern urban local bodies. On December 6, the SC stayed both ordinances and ordered the state to complete an empirical survey that would accurately identify the extent of the OBC community’s socio-economic backwardness before assigning political reservation to them. “There was no stay imposed by the apex court on the ordinances. On December 6, it stayed the elections on seats reserved for OBC category in the local bodies while on December 13, it directed the state election commission to hold elections on the reserved seats by notifying them as general category seats,” Sachin Patel, standing counsel of the Maharashtra government in the Supreme Court, said. However, a senior official from the law and judiciary department clarified said that there was no stay on the legislative process that required an ordinance to be tabled before the state legislature within six months of promulgation. “Placing the ordinance before the state legislature is a legislative process. It has to be completed and ordinances will have to be converted as legislation otherwise they are going to be lapsed. However, no court can impose a stay on legislative process if even it has stayed the ordinances,” he said.Chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty declined to comment on the matter.Leaders from the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties said the move was also a political one, as the coalition wanted to have a discussion on the issue on the floor of the House. “We want to discuss the issue in detail which can help us counter the allegations being made against us that we were lax in the court battle,”said a senior MVA minister who did not want to be named. Meanwhile, the union ministry of social justice and empowerment in a statement issued on Monday said that it plans to file a review petition in the Supreme Court to allow political reservation of other backward classes (OBC) in local bodies and municipal corporations “for the time being” till the states meet the criteria set by the apex court.

The minister’s announcement came in response to concerns expressed by legislators over threats being issued on social media.“Considering the sentiments and complaints of the members, a state-level SIT will be appointed to study this issue and probe incidents of threats and suggest measures for the future,” the home minister told the assembly after confirming that a man identified by the police as Jaisingh Rajput was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch’s cyber team in Karnataka capital Bengaluru, for threat messages over WhatsApp to Aaditya Thackeray.Dindoshi legislator Sunil Prabhu galuruunderscored the Karnataka connection to the threat message sent to Aaditya Thackeray. There was a Karnataka connection to the murder of social activists such as Dr Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and Gauri Lankesh as well, he said, asking if this was because it was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled state.Nationalist Congress Party leader and minister Nawab Malik suggested that a special team be set up to identify people behind such threats on social media, and the entities that have been funding them. The legislator, who alleged that ₹30 lakh was spent on social media campaign by an unidentified entity following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, said he too has received threats and had informed the home minister about them,Picking up from where Malik left, food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal demanded the Centre ban right-wing outfit Sanatan Sanstha which he said, have been allegedly linked to murders of rationalist Dabholkar and journalist Gauri Lankesh.Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis condemned the threats but questioned the effort to give it a political twist by ruling coalition lawmakers.

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Bikram Majithia moves Mohali court for anticipatory bail in drugs case; decision today||Mohali A day after the Union home ministry issued a lookout notice against him on the request of the Punjab Police, Shiromani Akali Dal MLA and former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Thursday moved a Mohali court for anticipatory bail in a drugs case registered on Monday. The court of additional district and sessions judge Sandeep Kumar Singla adjourned the case for December 24 (Friday), after the completion of arguments, and also summoned police records pertaining to the case. The plea of Majithia’s counsels Damanbir Singh Sobti and HS Dhanoa said, “The registration of the present FIR is nothing but an abuse of the process of law...in his public life, the applicant-petitioner has remained the MLA for three consecutive terms and has also had the privilege of serving as a cabinet minister in the state government, with important portfolios including Revenue, Renewable Energy, NRI Affairs etc.”It added, “There has been no allegation of any kind of misconduct in any of the decisions taken by the applicant-petitioner as a minister in any of the departments, even by the opposition. This only goes to show that the present case has been falsely and baselessly planted on the applicant-petitioner. Further none of the provisions of Sections 25, 27(a) and 29 of the NDPS Act are attracted to the facts and circumstances of the present case.”The plea added that petitioner may kindly be granted concession of anticipatory bail registered under Sections 25, 27(a) and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, Police Station Punjab State Crime, Mohali, in the interest of justice, equity and fair play. “The Bureau of Investigation has also seen three directors change. Police officers have been forced and coerced to falsely implicate the petitioner or face transfers, charge-sheets and dire consequences. Officers have also been induced with promotions and plum postings if they toe the line of the government,” the plea said, accusing Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa demonstrating “intense hatred” towards him.The plea said that the previous acting DGP, Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, was reluctant to falsely Majithia. Hence the present DGP, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, was given the additional charge of the posy. “He was appointed only to act as a tool to advance the political interests of the present government,” Majithia claims in the plea. The plea said that the report of the special task force (STF), which is the basis of the FIR, was either superseded or merged with the subsequent report of a state government committee. But, this fact was ignored and the FIR was registered. The STF and government committee reports were only for the consumption of the high court and were mere opinion reports for the court’s own assistance. Moreover, in the entire lengthy FIR no fresh evidence has been collected or statement recorded. The plea added that in all the cases registered under the NDPS, trials have been concluded with the acquittal of some accused and the conviction of others. None of the accused made any reference to the petitioner, nor did the trial court invoke its powers to summon Majithia. The plea also referred to the controversy involving ADGP SK Asthana, claiming that he refused to investigate the matter and raised questions on whether the matter can be investigated, it being sealed before court; superseded by other reports and whether investigation can be initiated without the permission of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bikram-majithia-moves-mohali-court-for-anticipatory-bail-in-drugs-case-101640253131101.html
23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Congress to follow one family, one ticket norm||The Congress has decided to follow “one family, one ticket” norm while selecting party candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab. Also read: Explosion inside Ludhiana district court complex; 2 dead, 5 injuredThe screening committee that the party’s national general secretary Ajay Maken heads took the decision to give the Congress ticket to only one member of a family at a meeting held in Delhi on Wednesday night. The two-and-a-half hour meeting of the committee tasked with the selection of candidates was attended Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar, All India Congress Committee secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary, secretary Chandan Yadav and joint secretary Krishna Allavaru. “The committee discussed all 117 assembly seats. A decision has been taken that not more than one ticket will be given to a family,” Chaudhary told journalists after the meeting, adding that the panel would meet again soon. The one family, one ticket rule is likely to dash the hopes of political families whose two or more members are eager to contest the polls on the Congress ticket. Channi’s younger brother Dr Manohar Singh, who was senior medical officer and has resigned from the service, is said to be eyeing the party ticket from Bassi Pathana assembly segment. The CM is a three-time MLA from the nearby Chamkaur Sahib segment. Similarly, brothers Partap Singh Bajwa and Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, the sitting MLA, have staked claim over the Qadian assembly seat. Partap Bajwa, who is the Rajya Sabha member and heads the manifesto committee, is seeking to return to state politics. Fateh Jung, who has Sidhu’s backing, welcomed the decision of the screening committee, saying that being the sitting and winning candidate, he was sure the party leadership would stick by him. Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Rana Gurjit Singh are also keen to push the candidature of their sons. A party leader said the committee held detailed discussions on 30-35 seats where the sitting legislators were either being considered shoo-ins or there were not many contenders for the party ticket. The screening committee is scheduled to meet again on Friday evening for another round of discussion. “The names of candidates will be announced only after they are approved by the party’s central election committee,” he added. Rival Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have taken a headstart in announcing their candidates. The SAD has already named candidates for 87 of the 117 seats it is contesting in alliance with the BSP, which has been allocated the remaining 20, whereas the AAP has announced its candidates for 40 segments. In 2017, the Congress had got a near two-thirds majority, winning 77 seats.

The directorate of higher education has also issued a letter to all district education officers in this regard, directing them to contact the nearest administrative officers.During the review of work of the education department in August, the chief secretary had suggested administrative officers start a new initiative in the state. Administrative officers who will take classes will share their experiences with students and guide them to decide their careers.The idea is that if the administrative officers visit schools, it will help build parents’ trust in government schools. Besides, administrative officers will also get to know if there is any deficiency in the school infrastructure.“The schools will send regular reports of administrative officers’ visits which will be further submitted to the government,” said secretary education Rajiv Sharma.Meanwhile, teachers feel the initiative will have both negative and positive impact. “It is like undermining the teacher community when you say it is strengthening standard of education in government schools. Does it mean it is weak when teachers are teaching?” said a teacher on condition of anonymity.He said the government system is more to be blamed for poor results of government schools than the teachers.“The positive is that when an officer visits the school, he will come to know about the problems being faced by the teaching community and the burden of extra work they have to carry out apart from discharging their primary duty of teaching,” another teacher said.“Not many students in Himachal are opting for central and state services. Administrative officers visiting schools will definitely motivate students. It’s a good step, provided the government maintains consistency,” said Dr Mamraj Pundir, an academician.Number of IAS, IPS officers declining in tribal regionKinnaur district, which borders China, was granted tribal status in 1967 as 50% of the population there is tribal. Tribal region Kinnaur is also known as the supper achievers district. Difficult terrain, which makes life harsh, has forced people to opt for government jobs.Due to the tribal status, many officers from the region went on to become IAS, IPS officers and a large number of them availing benefits of job reservation made it to the central and other state services.“The district has produced three chief secretaries: TS Negi, BC Negi and VC Pharkha. However, now, with change in socioeconomic status, not many are opting for government jobs. The new generation has many job avenues now. In our time, it was limited. Horticulture has improved the economy,” said retired chief secretary VC Pharkha.The village of Tholang, with just 36 families in the snowbound tribal belt of Lahaul, boasts of having produced over 50 professionals — including IAS, IPS and HAS officers. Part of the Lahaul and Spiti (reserved for ST) assembly seat, the area was declared as a Scheduled Area under the fifth schedule of the Constitution as per Scheduled Areas (Himachal Pradesh) Order, 1975 (CO 102) dated November 21, 1975, which enables reservation in government jobs for residents.The village had produced its first IAS officer AN Vidyarthi in 1968, who went on to become the state’s chief secretary. However, the new generation in the tribal Lahaul and Spiti district are not opting much for government jobs.

Officials had earlier said that there will be a constant, gradual dip in the temperatures till at least December 31.“Now that some cold wave conditions have been felt in north India, and since northerly winds are blowing over Maharashtra, the north Konkan will see a slight reduction in temperatures every day. We have been waiting for good winter conditions to set in the north first,” said an official with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, the minimum night temperature over the next week is expected to fall to about 17 degree Celsius by December 26. The daytime maximum temperature is expected to hover between 30 and 31 degrees Celsius around the same time. This will be followed by slightly warmer conditions until early in the new year.The city’s air quality index (AQI), meanwhile, remained in the ‘poor’ category on Thursday morning at 276 (same as the day prior), as per SAFAR’s network of monitoring stations. Officials cautioned that pollution levels will spike again as temperatures fall. “It is unlikely that the AQI will show sustained improvement for the next couple of weeks. Strong winds may result in temporary relief, but as the northerly winds bring down the temperature there will be more fog, and accumulation of pollutants particularly during the early morning hours,” explained Dr Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-wakes-up-to-its-coolest-morning-of-the-season-101640246231059.html

23-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to adopt e-Manas, mental healthcare software from Karnataka||Mumbai: Maharashtra is all set to adopt e-Manas, an online mental healthcare management system, that will consist of a statewide digital registry of mental health establishments, mental health professionals, persons with mental illnesses and their treatment records. Developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) and the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB), the software is currently being used in Karnataka. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been drafted between NIMHANS, the Karnataka government and Maharashtra which is likely to be executed in January 2022. “Implementation of the e-Manas software will ease the access of patients to mental health facilities as well as professionals,” said Dr Kanchan Wanere, assistant director (mental health), Directorate of Health Services, Maharashtra.“It will take about two to three months to completely adapt and start working on the software,” she said. The software will be customised as per Maharashtra’s needs. The state has already sanctioned around ₹70 lakh for the customisation and technical manpower. Mandated under the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017, the e-Manas software has a clinical module for professionals, a mental healthcare directory module for registrations of facilities and professionals and a patient module where users can fill or download advanced directive applications, raise grievances in front of the Mental Health Review Board and access their treatment history. As per the Act, an individual shall have the right to make an advance directive that states how he wants to be treated if and when he suffers from a mental health issue. The individual can also nominate his representative in the advanced directive. Maharashtra has formed eight Mental Health Review Boards which will be linked to the e-Manas software. The boards will consist of the chief judicial magistrate and include other members such as a medical practitioner, a psychiatrist, two recovered psychiatric patients or caregivers and a representative of the district collector or district magistrate or deputy commissioner. Patients, caregivers or other parties can raise grievances on the software. “All practising professionals in the public and private sector will have to be registered on the software, making it easy for the patients and caregivers to choose well-qualified professionals. Records of all patients who require admission will be on this software and can be accessed or reviewed by doctors with their permission,” said Dr Wanere. Access to the patient data will be granted through one-time passwords authorised by patients. Thus, if a patient moves on to consult another doctor or migrates to another city within the state, his treatment history can be accessed by the new treating doctor. “The 2017 Act mainly pertains to in-patients, meaning those requiring admissions. All the patient data stored in the software will only be of those who have required admissions in a mental health facility or hospitals,” said Dr Vijay Maskar, a medical officer with the Directorate of Health Services. The Centre is also considering the possibility of eventually linking the software nationally so that treatment records can be accessed anywhere in the country with patients’ approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-adopt-e-manas-mental-healthcare-software-from-karnataka-101640231890137.html
23-12-2021||Mumbai||Ahead of civic elections, NGOs release ideal public health manifesto||Mumbai A real-time data system for the number of deaths, cause of deaths and prevalent diseases in the city, strengthening primary healthcare by increasing the number of dispensaries and their timings, third-party audits of the healthcare sector for better accountability are some of the points that an ideal Mumbai public health manifesto must contain, according to non-profits Mumbai First and Praja Foundation. The two organisations released their ideal manifesto on Wednesday, ahead of the civic elections in 2022. Researchers across the country, including Mumbai, have highlighted the need for real-time, granular data during the pandemic in order to understand the issues correctly and draft effective policies. “The Registration of Births and Deaths Act calls for real-time data on causes of deaths. But if we look at Mumbai, the data that is available is for 2019, even as we are a few days away from entering 2022,” said Dr Neville Mehta, chief executive officer of Mumbai First. “How will we know what’s ailing Mumbaikars if we don’t have the current data,” he said. The manifesto, prepared in consultation with nearly 20 NGOs that work in Mumbai, highlights that that city has only 199 dispensaries, even as the ideal number would be 858 given the city’s population. Of these, only 15 dispensaries remain open for 14 hours, which all the others shut at 4 pm. “How will the working-class benefit if the dispensaries shut by 4 pm, which is much before they return from work. Dispensaries should be accessible for the citizens till 10 pm,” said Mehta. The manifesto calls for private health data to be made available to the government for planning purposes, streamlining of duplication of data between various cells of the civic body such as tuberculosis cell, epidemiology cell, ward data etc. “The manifesto also recommends the incorporation of an outcome-based budget to ensure targeted development and increase in access to the primary healthcare sector of the city”, said Yogesh Mishra, research and data head, Praja Foundation. “In terms of health policies and their implementation, Mumbai needs to put in extra effort to meet its sustainable development goals for many communicable and non-communicable diseases,” he said. The NGOs plan to reach out to political parties, bureaucrats, and other authorities to promote and endorse the manifesto. BOX Ideal Mumbai public health manifesto should contain: -Budget focused on strengthening primary healthcare -Third-party audits of the city’s healthcare sector -Increase the number of dispensaries in the city -Dispensaries should remain open till 10 pm -Real-time data on the number of deaths, cause of deaths should be made available - Data on all prevalent diseases should be maintained and analysed on a real-time basis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ahead-of-civic-elections-ngos-release-ideal-public-health-manifesto-101640231649943.html

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Now find videos of Punjab govt schools’ parent-teacher meetings on social media||Parent-teacher meetings (PTMs) are no longer just an interactive session to discuss the performance of students. The Punjab education department seems to have found a way to use these meetings to present a rosy picture of government schools. Ahead of the two-day PTM scheduled at government schools across the state, the department issued a circular, directing schools to capture the interaction between teachers and parents on video and upload these on social media platforms, to make it available to the public. Special written instructions were also given to teachers to treat parents with “utmost respect” by making seating arrangements for them and not making them wait for long.The teachers were further asked to highlight the positive characteristics of students, including good handwriting, attendance, performance in class and timely homework completion etc, in front of their parents. They were also told to motivate parents to discuss the daily lessons taught at school.A teacher at a local government school said, “It is obvious that when teachers praise the students, their parents will be elated and motivated to say good things about the school. Only positive videos will be uploaded on social media. The department is now putting a lot of emphasis on uploading these videos online.”A few teachers, however, appreciated the idea. According to them this will be an opportunity for government schools to make people aware of the change in functioning of government schools in Punjab.“Officials, teachers and students have worked really hard to bring digital reforms in government schools. Students of government schools are as smart as those at private schools. Credit should be given to the education department for uplifting the quality of education in Punjab. Through these videos, people will get to know about the immense efforts made by schools,” said Davinder Singh Chhina, principal of a local GSSS.

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Fire safety NOC in Mohali: Three weeks after notice deadline, violators yet to comply||Over three weeks after the deadline to comply with fire department’s notices expired on November 30, over 150 violators in Mohali have yet to apply for the no-objection certificate (NOC).In October this year, the fire department had issued around 150 notices to commercial establishments in Phase 8-B to obtain the NOC after ensuring fire-safety measures on their premises. But not one has applied so far, reflecting non-compliance of fire safety instructions as well.“We have asked for a detailed list of the violators from the fire department, following which we will be sealing their units. We have given them enough chances now,” said municipal corporation commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg.However, whether any unit will be penalised remains to be seen, as MC has not acted against any violator for the past three years, despite sending out 600 notices annually.Even in February this year, 600 notices were slapped on violators, with an ultimatum of 15 days, but 10 months later, no violating structure has been sealed.Through a survey last year, the fire department had identified various properties, including high-rise buildings and commercial establishments, that did not comply with fire-safety norms. The violations included the presence of only a single entry and exit point, which could prove dangerous in an emergency.Fire extinguishers were missing on many floors and those available did not have the ISI mark. Hose reels, smoke detection alarm system and illuminated exit signs were also found missing in most buildings. Several showrooms had loose electricity wiring.At several industrial units and housing societies, there was no underground static water storage tank of 75,000-litre capacity with pump, as required under fire-safety rules, and terrace water tanks with at least 10,000-litre capacity were also missing. Absence of a fire control room and emergency lifts with firemen switch was also among the violations.Last year in March, readymade clothes worth lakhs were gutted in a fire at Vishal Mega Mart, Phase 5.A factory on Barwala Road in Dera Bassi was ravaged in December 2020. Earlier, 2019 had witnessed two major fires at industrial units in Dera Bassi, which had left 18 workers injured.

As part of the initiative to cut down delays in registering FIRs, the Chandigarh Police are all set to launch the facility of e-FIR – only for vehicle theft for starters. Sources in the police force said five to six vehicles were stolen in the city on an average every day. But because complainants were required to visit the police station to get FIRs lodged, the process often got delayed. In his Independence Day speech on August 15, the then UT administrator, VP Singh Badnore, had announced that the Chandigarh Police were in the process of developing a mobile app for registration of e-FIRs in case of vehicle theft. In a step closer to making the facility a reality, the UT home secretary had issued a notification of setting up an e-police station on November 30. A designated court to deal with these FIRs will also be notified soon. “Online FIRs will help cut down the inconvenience caused to the victims. They will be able to file the complaint and check its status on the police website. This will also smoothen the process of insurance claims,” said superintendent of police (SP, City) Ketan Bansal.How will it work In case of vehicle theft, the complainant would need to fill up a form on the Chandigarh Police website The complaint will be marked to the police station concerned, following which the investigating officer will visit the complainant for verification In case the vehicle remains untraced after 21 days, a report will be sent to the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coming-soon-e-firs-for-vehicle-thefts-in-chandigarh-101640209627367.html

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Channi’s ‘hometown’ Kharar becomes epicentre of protests||Ever since Charanjit Singh Channni took over as Punjab’s chief minister three months ago, his residence town Kharar has become the epicentre of protests, much to the chagrin of commuters.Since Channi took the reins of the state government on September 21, 24 different organisations and unions have protested in the town over their long-pending demands. In these three months, these unions have held nearly 100 demonstrations in Kharar, and among these, they laid siege to the crucial Kharar highway as many as 24 times and the road near Kharar bus stand 28 times, repeatedly bringing inter-state traffic to a grinding halt.As per information, protesters blocked these roads for nearly 10 hours over five times in the past one month alone, while police watched silently.At the receiving end are thousands of commuters who take the Kharar highway, part of the National Highway-21, which connects Mohali and Chandigarh to Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh. Nearly 50,000 vehicles take the stretch every day and are stuck in gridlocks every time the highway is blocked by protesters.Currently protesting on the highway are anganwadi workers, contractual teachers and National Health Mission workers, who have been demanding regularisation of jobs.On Tuesday, they blocked the highway since morning till late at night, leading to serpentine queues of vehicles, a scene that repeated on Wednesday as well.Around 11.30am, contractual teachers began their protest under the Kharar flyover, but after 45 minutes, they crossed the barricades and reached atop the flyover, not allowing vehicles to move.Heated arguments were witnessed and even blows were exchanged after some local leaders and residents requested the protesters to lift the blockade, citing harassment to public. The matter was resolved with police intervention and the road was cleared around 4.30pm, only after an assurance for a meeting from the chief minister’s office. Meanwhile, for two days the traffic headed from Rupnagar to Chandigarh was diverted towards New Chandigarh (Mullanpur); traffic from Ludhiana to Chandigarh was diverted from Morinda towards Chunni-Landran. From Chandigarh, vehicles were diverted towards Mohali and back to Chandigarh to follow the way to Kurali.Helpless residents miffed“Since September, it has been an ordeal to reach home due the protests every other day. Often I am forced to take longer routes to return home. Why are the protesters harassing the common people and police watching like mute spectators?” complained Kartar Singh Grewal, an IT engineer who works in Chandigarh and lives in Kharar.“The daily protests have become a pain in the neck. Often emergency vehicles also get stuck in the traffic, which can prove costly. The protesters don’t feel the pain of the commuters who remain stuck in traffic jam for hours. We urge the government to do something,” said Kamaldeep Singh Tiwana, also a resident of Kharar.Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal said, “We are trying over level best to divert the traffic, but since it is the main highway in the area, traffic jams are witnessed. We have been diverting traffic to Siswan-Kurali and Landran road for people headed to Chandigarh and Mohali.”

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh markets once again bustling with Christmas shoppers||With Christmas right around the corner, city markets are abuzz with activity, with people completing their Christmas purchases.From Christmas trees to decorations and plum cakes to gifts, residents are checking off their to-do lists in the run up to December 25.Decked out with plethora of Christmas decorations, the Sector 20 market is the hot spot for Christmas trees in various sizes and designs.“After the celebrations were dulled by the Covid-19 pandemic last year, we barely got any business. With the situation better now, people, who couldn’t complete their shopping last year, are coming out to the markets in good numbers this year,” said Kunal Jindal, owner of Gupta Provision and General Store in Sector 20.The Christmas tree range in this market starts at ₹40 and goes up to ₹10,000 based on the height and design of the tree, available even at 15 feet high. However, Jindal said, there was a shortage of supply from suppliers in China, causing the prices to rise by around 1.5 times. Besides, the expensive permit from the municipal corporation to set up Christmas stalls outside their shops was digging into their profit.Vijay Goyal, another shopkeeper here, said although the footfall was higher this year compared to 2020, it was still lower than pre-Covid times. Diwakar Sahoonja, proprietor of Dewsun, Sector 11, and spokesperson, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said they were expecting more footfall from December 23. “Earlier people would start shopping earlier as they used to send greeting cards to friends and family in the country and abroad, but now virtual greeting cards are preferred,” he said. Shobha Yatra to return after a year’s gapAfter choosing to forego their annual Shobha Yatra due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the Tricity Churches Association will hold the Christmas procession on Thursday. President Lawrence Malik said, “The Shobha Yatra will feature representatives from around 200 churches from the region. It will start from the CNI Church in Sector 18, Chandigarh, and after moving through Sectors 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24, it will conclude at the Sector 25 rally ground.”After low-key celebrations last year, when even neighbourhood carol singing was given a miss, it is expected that this year, the festival will be celebrated at churches across the tricity with the usual fervour, while observing Covid protocols, including masks and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-markets-once-again-bustling-with-christmas-shoppers-101640209567366.html

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||PU senate: Petitions delay notification of members elected from faculties constituency||Even as 33 members elected from six constituencies of Panjab University (PU) senate have been notified by vice-president of India, M Venkaiah Naidu, who is the chancellor of the university, those elected from two constituencies are yet to be notified.This includes six elected members from the constituency of faculties and those from the constituency of teachers of affiliated arts colleges. Regarding the constituency of faculties, sources at the university said that three petitions have been filed against their election. “The petitions filed are still pending with the competent authority,” said PU registrar Vikram Nayyar, who was the returning officer for senate polls.It is learnt that the petitioners have raised questions over the validity of the voter list. However, a regulation of the PU calendar states, “A voter’s name shall not be removed from the register of voters for the reason that the voter has, subsequent to the publication of the final register, ceased to hold the capacity in which he was registered.”All six members who were elected from this constituency are from the Goyal group and are former senators. They are Navdeep Goyal, Ashok Goyal, Rajesh Gill, Keshav Malhotra, Ronki Ram and Anu Chatrath. The election for the constituency was held in September.Navdeep Goyal, former senator and syndicate member, said, “A petition can be filed within 10 days after the election but we do not know when these petitions were filed. It’s been a long time since the polls were held and it is shameful that the matter is still pending.” “Everything is happening for the first time, including the postponement of elections at first. The intentions are quite clear,” said former senator Ashok Goyal.Regarding the constituency of teachers of affiliated arts colleges, the delay is reportedly due to an issue over the election of Tarun Ghai, whose election was declared ineligible by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar last month. Ghai has filed a petition with the chancellor, questioning the V-C’s decision and demanded an independent probe in the matter. “I have not received any communication from the chancellor’s office so far,” said Tarun Ghai. Even after a majority of the members have been notified, university officials said that there is no clarity regarding when the meeting of the governing body will be held. Two years have passed since the senate last met in December 2019. The university is also functioning without a syndicate, the executive arm of senate, after its term ended on December 31, 2020.
23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Lok Sabha winter session: Ambala MP demands arms manufacturing unit in his constituency||On the last day of the winter session of the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, member of Parliament from Ambala and former Union minister, Rattan Lal Kataria, demanded an arms manufacturing unit in his constituency.Kataria said that there are two cantonment boards in his constituency - Ambala Cantonment and Panchkula (Chandimandir), and both are crucial in terms of their proximity to the Indo-Pak and Sino-India (China) borders. “Both the borders are 200-300 kilometres away from the air force station in Ambala and is highly sensitive. During the wars with Pakistan and China, the opposite forces always tried to attack the airbase,” he added.He had submitted his notice under Rule 377 to the secretary-general of the Lok Sabha on December 17 and spoke in the Parliament on Wednesday. His personal assistant at his Delhi office, Sunny, said that the request has been forwarded to the officials concerned.Kataria said that he has apprised defence minister Rajnath Singh of the fact that Ambala is also famous for manufacturing science equipment, and setting up of an arms unit here will also boost the “Make in India” initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The government of India is moving towards self-reliance in terms of defence affairs and has already exported arms worth crores. An arms unit in Ambala will also be helpful for the Indian defence policy,” the BJP lawmaker said in a video statement.During the Indo-Pak war in 1965, a Pakistani aircraft dropped bombs at the historic St Paul’s Church in Ambala, which is just metres away from the air force station. Now, the airbase is home to French-made Rafale fighter jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lok-sabha-winter-session-ambala-mp-demands-arms-manufacturing-unit-in-his-constituency-101640206626786.html

The 19-year-olds --- who have been eager to become self-reliant --- have bagged a job in the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). Inmates of Pingalwara, Sohna-Mohna, who hold a diploma (electrician) from ITI, officially joined their duty as Regular T Mate (RTM) at the 66-KV PSPCL office near the dental college here on Wednesday. They will be working in the supply control room, said officials. The twins will get a monthly salary of ₹20,000 initially. “We came to know that persons with rarest of the rare disability were pursuing a diploma in the ITI and wanted to make a career as electricians. We reached out and found them very active. The twins have a good technical knowledge. So, we decided to recruit them in our department under the disabled persons quota on compassionate grounds”, PSPCL CMD Venu Parsad said. Sohna-Mohna said they were grateful to the Punjab government for providing them this opportunity. “We will work hard with utmost sincerity and dedication”, said Sohna. “We are deeply thankful to the Pingalwara institution that has raised us, educated us and helped us in becoming self-dependent,” said Mohna.

The march started from MIA Bhawan in Phase 7, Industrial Area and culminated at the Phase 7/8 light point, where the industrialists raised slogans against the state and central governments. Addressing media persons, MIA president Anurag Aggarwal said that the association has always worked along with the government and rarely resorted to protests, but they have now been forced to express their anger as all their requests, including those made to the Union labour minister, Union health minister,director general of ESIC Corporation, New Delhi, Punjab health secretary and director of ESI, Punjab, have fallen on deaf ears. He said it is astonishing that ESI Hospital and dispensaries are currently working only from 8am to 2pm. “We urge the authorities to make them operational 24x7, as industry is working throughout the day. The insured workers may be referred 24x7 hrs only to empanelled hospitals under the ESI Scheme, where cashless medical facility is available, instead of government institutions. ESI dispensaries should also work round-the-clock. Also, time-bound clearance of medical reimbursements bills of beneficiaries should be ensured,” added Aggarwal. He said that if the corporation does not reply to their demand in two weeks, MIA will intensify the protest and may even ask industrialists to not deposit ESI contribution. Vivek Kapoor, vice-president of MIA, said that ₹10 crore is deposited with the ESIC every month from Mohali, but not even 10% of that is spent on the workers by the corporation. Dilpreet Boparai, joint finance secretary of MIA, that it is very shameful that despite spending their hard-earned money, workers are having to suffer.

The department said that around 12,000 acres of land would be covered in the survey, which started last week, and a daily report is being submitted to the district administration. In order to complete the survey in 45 days, the authorities are planning to fly drones simultaneously in several colonies. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that the drone survey will cover the entire district and find out the actual spread of unauthorised colonies and the infrastructure present there. “The layout plan of these colonies, area covered, number of plots and actual status of construction will be mapped using the drones. We have started it in Garhi Harsaru and New Palam Vihar, and to expedite the process, the plan is to fly multiple drones in the next couple of days,” he said. The survey will become the basis of a report on unauthorised colonies that will be submitted to the state government for providing essential services and deficient infrastructure to colonies outside the municipal area, said the DTCP officials. In a related development on Wednesday, the state assembly also passed the Haryana Management of Civic Amenities and Infrastructure Deficient Areas outside Municipal Area (Special Provisions) Bill, 2021, to make special provisions for providing essential services in infrastructure deficient areas outside municipal area. Referring to the Bill, the state government said that it has been observed that the colonies with deficient infrastructure are also situated outside municipal areas in various towns of the state. “To provide minimum infrastructure and ensure healthy living of the residents, this bill has been enacted,” the government said in a statement. Bhath said that the drone survey, registration of unauthorised colonies on DTCP portal with regard to their existing infrastructure and the proposed report on status of colonies was a step towards the implementation of the new law. “This will help provide required infrastructure in colonies after a proper assessment by the government,” he said.

The senior Brahmpura, a close friend of the senior Badal, along with former minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan and ex-MP Dr Rattan Singh Ajnala had raised the banner of revolt against Sukhbir in December 2018. The senior Brahmpura, the president of the SAD-Taksali party, which had merged with Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s SAD (Democratic) a few months ago, had been denouncing the Akal leaders for pardoning Dera Sacha Sauda chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, in a blasphemy case. Sources said the acting jathedar of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, Giani Harpreet Singh has played a major role in bringing Brahmpura and his son back to the SAD fold. “We are rejoining the SAD in the presence of Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir in Chandigarh on Thursday. All arrangements have been completed. We are obeying the appeal of the Akal Takht jathedar, who had asked us to get united for the panth,” Ravinder told HT over phone.It is likely that the SAD might announce Ravinder as its Punjab polls candidate from the Khadoor Sahib assembly segment, which is also known as the ‘panthic’ assembly. Ravinder had won by-polls on the seat in 2016, after Congress MLA Ramanjit Singh Sikki resigned over sacrilege incidents in the state.When the SAD-BJP alliance was in power, the senior Brahmpura was known as ‘Majhe Da Jarnail’ (the leader of Majha). After Brahmpura’s ouster from the party, Bikram Singh Majithia took on the mantel. The development comes soon after the Punjab Police issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) against Majithia, who was booked in a drugs case on Tuesday. With the return of the Brahmpuras to the party fold, the Congress party will have a tough competition during the election, sources claim. The senior Brahmpura, who has been keeping unwell, had also been launching attacks against Majithia for allegedly ‘running the drug trade’. Previously, former MP Ajnala’s son, Bonny Ajnala, had returned to the SAD and was announced as the party candidate from Ajnala assembly seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/brahmpura-son-to-return-to-sadtoday-101640204648300.html

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Panel to decide appointment mode in Haryana universities||CHANDIGARH: Following an outcry over the state government’s decision to change the recruitment procedure of teaching and non-teaching posts in the universities, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Wednesday that a five-member committee would be constituted for taking decisions regarding appointments to different posts in the universities of the state. The committee will include the representative of the governor (chancellor), principal secretary (higher education) and vice-chancellors (VCs) of three universities, Khattar said in the Vidhan Sabha, assuring that the instructions of UGC will be complied with.

Hooda had said that in this chat there were indications of exchange of money and manipulation in recruitments. The former CM on Wednesday said the state government should investigate the chat message on its own and that he would not become a party in this matter. “I have mentioned the mobile number involved in the conversation. Find out yourself who all are involved in this conversation,’’ Hooda said, as per a statement government issued.276 cases registered during farmers’ stir The CM said the state government will withdraw all cases registered against farmers except cases involving heinous crimes such as rape, murder etc. He said according to police records, 276 cases have been registered during the farmers’ agitation so far.

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drinking age reduced to 21 in Haryana||With intent to reduce the legal drinking age to 21 from the existing 25, the Haryana assembly on Wednesday passed an amendment Bill.According to Section 29 of the Haryana Excise Act, there is a prohibition on sale of liquor or intoxicating drug to persons under 25 years for consumption. The Haryana Excise (amendment) Bill passed by the assembly Wednesday has brought down the minimum age for drinking from 25 to 21.Following the amendment, the legal age for getting a lease to manufacture, wholesale or retail sale of any country liquor or intoxicating drug and to employ a person at a premises licensed to sell liquor or intoxicating drugs has also been reduced to 21.The statement of objects and reasons said that during the framing of excise policy for 2021-22 it was discussed that the above age limit may be reduced from 25 years to 21 as many of other states have prescribed lower age limits. The National Capital Territory of Delhi recently reduced this age limit to 21.“Moreover, the socio-economic conditions of the day have changed drastically from the time when the above provisions were incorporated in the Excise Act. The people now are more educated and participating in new endeavours and also can take rational decision when it comes to responsible drinking,” said the justification to reduce the drinking age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drinking-age-reduced-to-21-in-haryana-101640204226241.html

The bail plea was listed for Wednesday, but it was withdrawn by the suspect’s counsel. Rahul Chauhan, lawyer of Nawal, said that the hearing on bail application was not advanced on Wednesday as we had to place some documents to strengthen our arguments. “The documents were not brought before us before the bail plea hearing on Wednesday. So we sought an adjournment and the matter is now fixed for Thursday,” he said.On Monday, the bail application of Dr Gurpartap Singh alias Dr GP Singh, another suspect in the case, was rejected. He was a visiting doctor in the society and had passed on the information about the cash bags in the two flats to the prime suspects.Nawal, along with gangster Vikas Lagarpuria, have emerged as masterminds in the case, police said. The theft was committed on August 4. Nawal and Singh were arrested by the special task force (STF) of the Haryana Police on November 11 for their alleged involvement in the multi-crore heist. “Dr Nawal got the information about the money through his friend Dr Singh, currently lodged in Bhondsi jail, and passed on the information to the gangster. Along with the gangster, Dr Nawal planned the entire heist and theft was committed by henchmen of Lagarpuria. To get the matter covered up, Nawal had involved then Gurugram DCP Dheeraj Setia,” said Satheesh Balan, deputy inspector general of STF, on Wednesday.Setia has been suspended by the Haryana government.According to STF officials, Nawal is a native of Hisar who also tried to get a ticket for assembly elections held in 2019 from Barwala. The officials also revealed that Nawal had opened a multi-speciality hospital in Bhiwadi and suffered losses of nearly ₹6.5 crore and he was under pressure to return that money to the investors. 
23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Fortified rice: Hooda, Kiran question govt’s move to restrict purchase from five firms||Chandigarh: Leader of the opposition in the Haryana assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday questioned the state government’s move to restrict the purchase of fortified rice kernels (FRK) from five companies empanelled by the Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department. The questionable move, which is in contravention of Central government guidelines, was reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday. The former chief minister said the state government should follow the Central government guidelines to allow rice millers to take fortified rice kernel from all manufacturers holding Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license instead of restricting them to obtain supplies from empanelled manufacturers. The five companies, Hooda said, were supplying fortified rice kernels at a higher rate, taking advantage of the cartelization. Tosham MLA, Kiran Choudhry also joined Hooda in raising the matter in the House. Hindustan Times had reported that two Haryana government agencies, HAFED and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (HSWC) involved in the procurement of fortified rice kernels (FRK) have raised a red flag citing delays by the five empanelled companies. The objection by the two agencies comes close on the heels of allegations of anomalies and cartelization in the allotment of tenders for supply of FRK to three Maharashtra based companies. The allegations were levelled by Haryana FRK manufacturers association. The two state agencies- HAFED and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (HSWC) while quoting the guidelines of the Central government have written to the director general of Haryana Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs department asking it to allow rice millers to take FRK from all FRK manufacturers holding Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license instead of restricting them to obtain supplies from empanelled manufacturers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fortified-rice-hooda-kiran-question-govt-s-move-to-restrict-purchase-from-five-firms-101640204047544.html

Channi and Sidhu, both members of the 21-member campaign committee that former state unit chief Sunil Jakhar heads, were conspicuous by their absence at the meeting held in Delhi. Jakhar had convened the meeting to discuss the strategy and broad contours of the party’s election campaign. Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary, Congress national joint secretary Krishna Allavaru and seven MPs were among the 16 committee members who attended the meeting, held in the ‘war room’ of the Congress at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road. A party MP said that the CM and the state chief could not attend the meeting as they had prior engagements.Sources said that at the meeting, several members, while touching upon the lack of cohesion in the state unit, asked the party leadership to get the leaders to work together. Both Channi and Sidhu, two top leaders of the party in Punjab, have not been on the same page on key issues with the latter being critical of the government. There are also other tussles and turf wars in Doaba and parts of Malwa that have left the party divided. During the three-hour meeting, Jakhar is learnt to have suggested that the party would have to build the campaign around its achievements of the past five years and explain to people with conviction, how it proposed to take forward any promises and issues that could not be fulfilled or were left unattended. Rahul to launch campaign After the meeting, Jakhar told reporters that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi would come to Punjab in the next few days to launch the party’s election campaign. Though no date was indicated, Rahul’s visit is likely any time between December 27-30. The party is also planning to schedule a visit of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to the state. Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla said that since most of the Lok Sabha MPs in the state were from the Congress, they also gave lots of suggestions in the meeting. Those who attended the meeting included AICC secretaries Chetan Chauhan; Harshwarshan Sapkal; Gurkirat Singh; Raminder Awla; Punjab cabinet minister Pargat Singh; MPs Jasbir Singh Dimpa; Manish Tewari; Ravneet Singh Bittu; Santokh Singh; Amar Singh and Shamsher Singh Dullo and former Punjab Youth Congress president Amarpreet Singh Lally.Maken-led screen committee also holds its first meetingThe Congress screening committee that party’s national general secretary Ajay Maken heads also held its first meeting in Delhi.

The samples of this patient, who is currently under isolation at a government facility, has been sent for genome sequencing and the results are awaited, they said. The officials said that the patient had reached Gurugram on December 10 and tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, during testing of samples as part of the monitoring process. “One person who had returned from the United Kingdom has tested positive for Covid-19 and was immediately shifted to an isolation facility. His samples have been sent for genome sequencing to check if the patient is positive for the Omicron variant, and we are waiting for the results,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram.

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||From Jan 1, public places in Haryana out of bounds for not fully vaccinated||Chandigarh: Come January 1 and only fully vaccinated individuals will be allowed access to public spaces in Haryana. This was stated by Haryana health minister Anil Vij in the state assembly on Wednesday. The move apparently is aimed at pushing reluctant or indifferent individuals to get the second shot of coronavirus vaccine. Haryana though has a high percentage of about 93% individuals inoculated with the first dose of coronavirus vaccine, the number of fully vaccinated persons is 61%. Neighbouring states like Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand have a better second dose coverage than Haryana. According to the orders issued by additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, the deputy commissioners (DCs) of all 22 districts have been asked to direct head of offices or in-charge to constitute teams to ensure that only fully vaccinated persons are allowed access to public places. The DCs have also been asked to constitute multi-disciplinary teams to check the implementation of the restrictions. The order said that a large number of beneficiaries were due and overdue for long for inoculation of second dose of coronavirus vaccine. “New variants of coronavirus are emerging frequently and recently Omicron cases have shown an upward trend. Looking into the current scenario, steps need to be taken for increasing coverage of vaccination to mitigate spread of coronavirus,” the order said. The state government has decided that only fully vaccinated persons will be allowed entry in public places like private and public sector banks, religious places, petrol and CNG stations, LPG cylinder collection centres, sugar mills, milk booths, ration shops restaurants, bars, hotels, grain and vegetable markets, departmental stores, liquor and wine shops, shopping malls and complexes, cinema halls, haats, local market and places of public gathering. Only fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to travel from bus stands and railway stations. Parks, yogshalas, gym and fitness centres have also been directed to allow only those who have received second dose of vaccine. Managers and owners of these places will be instructed by deputy commissioners to ensure entry of only those who have received second dose of vaccination. ‘Violation facilitators to be booked’ACS, health, Rajeev Arora said that those allowing unvaccinated persons access in shops, malls cinemas etc can be booked under the provisions of Disaster Management Act. A separate order by the State Disaster Management Authority will be issued to this effect. The state government has also made vaccination mandatory for above 18 students of colleges, polytechnics. Truck and auto rickshaw unions will allow only second dose passengers. No individual including government servants will be allowed to visit government offices without being fully vaccinated.

Though preliminary probe points to theft, a special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the incident is also looking into possible sacrilege bid. The incident took place at Sri Lakshmi Narayan Temple in a densely populated area of Ajnala town on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. The temple’s priest, Swami Satya Akash, said the incident came to light when he woke up around 5am. His room was locked from outside and he had to call a neighbour, he said.The miscreants who had barged into the temple fled with gold and artificial jewellery from idols, a motorcycle and around ₹1 lakh from donation boxes. Meanwhile, the premises was ransacked and two idols were left broken, said the priest. As the news spread, many Hindu and Sikh organisations gathered outside the temple, demanding the arrest of the accused.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Ajnala, Jasvir Singha, who is heading the SIT, said: “We are examining CCTV footage of the area. We have also been using our technical experts to trace the location of the accused. Our preliminary investigation has suggested that the accused had entered the temple with a motive of theft. We are also probing the sacrilege allegation and hope to nab the accused soon.”A case under Sections 457 (house-trespass), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against the unidentified persons at the Ajnala police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/theft-at-ajnala-temple-sacrilege-angle-being-probed-say-cops-101640203635730.html
23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Not easy for Congress to repeat history in Amritsar||Due to its location along the international border and historical and religious importance, Amritsar is politically and strategically one of most important districts in the state. It has 11 assembly segments. Except Majitha, all seats are held by the Congress. However, as equations have changed in the past five years, it will be an uphill task for the ruling party to retain these seats in the upcoming Punjab polls, as the SAD is in a better position and even AAP is expected to give a tough fight on a few seats Amritsar North: Thanks to Joshi, SAD in fray for first time A Hindu-dominated urban seat, it covers the Civil Lines developed during the British rule. Considered a bastion of former BJP minister Anil Joshi, it was breached by Congress’ Sunil Dutti in 2017. After being expelled by the BJP over his anti-party statements on farm laws, Joshi is contesting the elections on the SAD ticket. Until now, the SAD was never in the fray, as its old ally BJP used to contest from here. The AAP has raised the stakes by fielding former Punjab Police IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, who made news while heading the special investigation team that probed the post-sacrilege police firing incidents that killed two Sikh protesters. Deteriorating infrastructure and basic amenities in the area are the main issues. Amritsar West: Congress bastion for over two decades Once a stronghold of CPI leader Satyapal Dang — owing to his popularity among the labour population living in the textile hub of Chheharta — this assembly segment saw the rise of OP Soni, who is now the deputy CM, in 1997. Soni won the seat as an Independent twice before joining the Congress and retaining it in 2007. After the seat was reserved in 2012, Congress fielded its Dalit face Raj Kumar Verka, who continues to represent it in the Punjab assembly. Now a cabinet minister, he has got the party ticket again. During the SAD-BJP alliance, this seat was with the saffron party, but now the Akalis have fielded Dalbir Singh Verka, who served as an MLA from the erstwhile Verka segment twice. AAP and BJP are yet to declare their candidates. Amritsar Central: Two-cornered contest within walled city This is a key assembly segment of Punjab as it houses the holiest Sikh shrine, Golden Temple. Comprising 70% of the historical walled city, it is dominated by the Hindu electorate, though Sikh and Balmiki communities also constitute a sizeable population. The seat has been held by both the BJP and Congress in the past. After moving from Amritsar West, OP Soni — who is now the deputy CM — has won twice from here, defeating senior BJP leader Tarun Chugh, and is in the fray again. The contest is expected to remain two-cornered again, though the BJP is yet to announce its candidate. SAD’s new ally BSP will field its candidate but has a limited voter base. Even the AAP has not named any candidate yet. The densely populated walled city is one of the largest trading centre, but locals are facing many issues with the increase in footfall of visitors and devotees at the Golden Temple and introduction of vehicles that cause frequent traffic congestion. Existing sewerage facility is not able to bear the burden of mushrooming hotels, while sanitation remains a problem. Amritsar East: No match to Sidhu couple on their home turf Formed during delimitation in 2012, it comprises parts of erstwhile Amritsar Urban and Verka assembly segments. Its voter base is mixed, and has elected the Sidhu couple in the past two elections. While Navjot Kaur Sidhu won in 2012 on the BJP ticket, her husband Navjot Singh Sidhu won in 2017 as the Congress candidate. The Punjab Congress president will once again be in the fray from his bastion. Although Sidhu is often criticised for rarely visiting the constituency, his aides remain in touch with the people here. The rival parties, including SAD, BJP and AAP, have no big face to challenge him. Even former CM Captain Amarinder Singh is expected to field a candidate of his newly floated party Punjab Lok Congress. Main issues are related to basic amenities. Amritsar South: Cong MLA facing multiple challenges Comprising Sultanwind Road and Tarn Taran Road, it is the only Sikh-dominated constituency in Amritsar city. Though present MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria is a Congressman, the SAD holds sway in the assembly segment. After his father and SAD MLA Raminder Singh Bolaria’s death, Inderbir won the seat on Akali ticket in the 2008 bypoll and 2012 assembly elections before moving to the Congress. However, the SAD has fielded a strong candidate, Talbir Singh Gill, against him this time. Former Congress MLA Harjinder Singh Thekedar, who recently joined Captain Amarinder Singh’s party, is likely to cut into the Congress vote share while AAP’s Dr Inderjit Singh Nijjar is also trying his best to garner support. Bhagatanwala garbage dump, the largest landfill in the city, is the key issue for voters as it has turned into an eyesore and is a health hazard. Ajnala: SAD back in reckoning with Ajnalas’ return Situated along the India-Pakistan border, Ajnala is considered a stronghold of SAD’s taksali (old guard) leader and two-time Lok Sabha MP Dr Rattan Singh Ajnala, who was elected as an MLA from here four times. His son Amarpal Singh Bony carried on the legacy, winning the seat in 2007 and 2012, but could not overcome anti-incumbency in 2017, losing to Congress’ Harpartap Singh. The Akalis got a jolt when Ajnala family floated SAD (Taksali) along with another old guard Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, but now Ajnala family is back with them. Though the main contest will remain between the SAD and Congress, AAP cannot be underestimated. According to political observers, a considerable section of the people is in the mood to vote for a third alternative, which could benefit AAP’s Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal. A rural segment comprising Jat Sikhs and Rai Sikhs (SC), it lacks development. The mining mafia has damaged the agrarian land, roads and embankments on the Ravi. Rajasansi: SAD, Cong neck and neck in rural segment Barring Rajasansi and Chugawan towns, the segment is predominantly rural. Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport and the famous Ram Tirath Temple, a holy shrine of Balmiki community, fall in this constituency. Dominated by Jat Sikhs, it has been a stronghold of the Akali Dal, but the Congress has managed to win the last three elections with narrow margins. Since 1997, the constituency has been witnessing contests between Vir Singh Lopoke (SAD) and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria (Congress). The two remained neck and neck in the previous two assembly elections. Sarkaria won the 2017 polls by just 1,084 votes, and his winning margin was 5,727 in 2012. Even the AAP has presence in this segment, but does not have any big name to challenge Sarkaria and Lopoke. Since a sizeable area of this constituency falls along the India-Pakistan International Border and the Ravi river, villages are backward and crying for government’s attention. Majitha: SAD bastion in the eye of controversy A rural constituency, Majitha is the home turf of SAD big gun Bikram Singh Majithia. In the centre of controversy after being booked in a drug case, the former cabinet minister has been accused by the opposition of using muscle power and high handedness. Brother-in-law of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Bikram Singh has been elected from here in the last three assembly elections. In fact, in the 2017 polls, Majitha was the only seat out of the 25 seats in Punjab’s Majha belt where the Akalis secured a thumping victory. Also, Majitha was among the few places where the SAD secured victories during local bodies and panchayat elections. Congress had fielded Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lally Majithia in the past two elections, but has not named anyone for the 2022 polls yet. The AAP, which secured 8.4% votes in 2017, is also yet to announce its candidate. Apart from Jat Sikhs, who are in a majority here, the Mazhabi Sikh community also has a considerable population. Support of both communities is the key factor in elections. Jandiala Guru: AAP set to give a tough fight A reserved constituency which is basically rural, it has Jat Sikhs, Kamboz Sikhs and Mazhabi Sikhs as the main constituents, though even Hindu community has presence in Jandiala Guru town. Mehta Chowk, which is the headquarters of Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal, falls in this constituency and wields influence. SAD is finding itself on a sticky wicket, after former MLA Malkiat Singh AR, who was declared as its candidate, is reported to be unwell. Thus, the ticket might be shifted to his son or other leaders, including former MLAs Baljit Singh Jalal Usma and Manjit Singh Manna Mianwind. On the other hand, incumbent MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala, who is also the working president of Punjab Congress, is almost sure to contest the polls. The AAP factor will also play a key role in this constituency, as party candidate Harbhajan Singh, who is a former PCS officer, performed well in the last elections and secured more than 27% votes. Attari: Locals looking for a third alternative This Akali stronghold represented by Gulzar Singh Ranike from 1997 to 2017 was breached by Congress’ Tarsem Singh DC in the last election. Basically a rural constituency, it also comprises private townships and sub-urban areas situated on the outskirts of Amritsar city. The locals say the contest is set to be a triangular one, as Jaswinder Singh Ramdas, who is staking his claim to the Aam Aadmi Party ticket, may give a tough fight to both the main rivals. Livelihood of thousands of people depends on the international trade being facilitated through the integrated check post at the India-Pakistan border. However, trade is suspended for a long time. Even health facilities are not up to the mark. With their issues remaining unresolved even after sending a Congress MLA to a Congree-majority assembly, the voters could go for the AAP this time. Baba Bakala: Both Cong, SAD face infighting Formed during delimitation in 2012, Baba Bakala mainly comprises areas of the old Beas segment from where both the Congress and SAD registered victories in almost equal numbers. The rural segment is reserved for SCs and is the home constituency of Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Dimpa, who was also an MLA from the erstwhile Beas segment. Both the Congress and SAD are facing infighting this time. While a tug of war is going on between former MLAs Baljit Singh Jalalusma and Manjit Singh Manna Mianwind in the SAD, the incumbent Congress MLA Santokh Singh Bhalaipur is facing challenge from former three-time MLA Ranjit Singh Chhajjalwaddi, whose son Satinder Singh Chhajjalwaddi wants to contest the polls. Even Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu has extended his support to Chhajjalwadi. Similarly, there is no clarity about the AAP candidate yet.

23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sacrilege bid has potential to polarise people in Punjab: Capt Amarinder||Former Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said that the sacrilege bid at the Golden Temple has the potential to polarise people along religious lines, which can lead to unrest and trouble in the state. Capt Amarinder, who has floated his separate party after quitting the Congress, said that foreign agencies like Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were active in Punjab in coordination with sleeper cells of various secessionist and terrorist groups. “They are desperately waiting for an opportunity to exploit such a situation and strike,” he said in an informal interaction with reporters in Chandigarh. The two-time former chief minister said that in the changed security scenario in South Asia, with China and Pakistan having come together and almost becoming “one country”, India would need to be more alert and vigilant. Given the geographical position of Punjab, the state faced more security challenges now, he added. Asked to comment on Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s demand for public execution for those found guilty of sacrilege, he said: “We are against sacrilege. There is a Constitution in the country. We have to follow the law. If we do not follow the Constitution or law, how the country will move forward?” The Punjab Lok Congress leader also castigated Sidhu for making such a comment. Sidhu had made the remarks at a public meeting in Malerkotla, a day after a sacrilege accused was beaten to death at the Golden Temple on December 18. Capt Amarinder added that there was no justification for mob lynching. On being asked to name the Congress ministers and MLAs involved in illegal sand mining, about whom he had made a reference in his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi last month, Capt Amarinder deflected the query, stating he would have to start from the top. The former CM had stated that on illegal sand mining, the offenders were the substantive bulk of Congress MLAs and ministers, including an “overwhelming number in the current government”, indicating his intention to make their names public. Capt Amarinder said he had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ₹1 lakh crore package to Punjab over five years to help the state diversify from water-guzzling paddy to pulses. “We will need ₹20,000 crore each year to give the minimum support price to farmers for pulses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacrilege-bid-has-potential-to-polarise-people-in-punjab-capt-amarinder-101640203631801.html

Slamming both the Congress and SAD, the AAP leader said: “They haven’t done anything in 44 years, and they are not going to do anything in the next five years either. These parties don’t have any agenda or development plans, but they are shamelessly asking for one more chance to plunder Punjab.” Mann said the AAP was the only party talking about development issues, like schools, hospitals, employment and children’s future. He also urged the voters to stay alert and not let incidents of sacrilege lead them astray from the issues of development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-bhagwant-mann-slams-congress-akalis-over-plight-of-border-areas-101640203630529.html

23-12-2021||Other||Faridabad: Five held for duping people on pretext of credit card points||The Faridabad police on Tuesday night arrested two men and took three others on production remand for allegedly duping many people on the pretext of redeeming their credit card points. The mastermind of the gang and his two accomplices were operating from Delhi’s Tihar and Mandoli jails, police said, adding that the suspects have duped over 50 people in Delhi-NCR and transferred over ₹65 lakh to their bank accounts in the last one year. Police said the suspects used to create a text message that would reach their potential targets informing them about their cards’ reward points, which could be used to get cashback offers and discounts. The suspects were identified as Vikas, Rohit, Imran, Muzib and Amanuullah alias Guddu. Police said Muzib is a native of Budaun in Uttar Pradesh and others are from Delhi. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that Vikas is the mastermind of the gang. “Vikas and Imran were lodged in Tihar jail while Muzib was in Mandoli jail. They were taken on production remand. Four other gang members have been identified but they are yet to be arrested,” he said. Kadiyan said Rohit and Amanullah used to throw packets containing mobile phones inside the jail premises. “Imran used to pick these mobile phones and used to hand over to Vikas who would make calls and send messages,” he said, adding that the suspects devised a cunning way to make the victims disclose their confidential bank details. The incident came to the fore after the gang duped a Faridabad resident, Yashpal Singh, of ₹95,000 last week following which a cheating case was registered at Cyber police station. Then a team was formed led by Basant Kumar, station house officer of the Cyber police station, who arrested the five gang members, said the officials. These suspects have been involved in cyber fraud for a long time, Kadiyan said, adding that they used to get phone numbers and other details through online sites. “The suspects used to generate fake link similar to that of a bank and victims used to fill in all details following which they used to transfer money from their accounts,” he said. Police said the suspects used to send at least 100,000 SMSes everyday. They used to ask customers to fill details such as credit card number, expiry date, CVV number, and email ID and its password in the fake online form and then they would use all the details accordingly, said police. Basant Kumar, SHO, Cyber police station, said that the credit card details were used to do online shopping. “The suspects were using property websites for the fraud as people fill their house address and other details in that. They used to create account on the name of the victim and an online wallet was created. The victim used to receive OTP on his/her email, but as the suspects had the email account’s password they used to take OTP and then delete the email. The money used to get transferred to their bank accounts linked to the wallet,” he said. Police said Vikas is involved in several cyber cases since 2017. There are 18 cases against Vikas in Delhi-NCR, of which nine are registered in Delhi, seven in Gurugram and two in Faridabad. 
23-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly session: Vij orders transfer doc during Question Hour||CHANDIGARH: Congress MLA Shamsher Singh Gogi caused quite a flutter in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday when he indirectly raised the issue of alleged corruption depriving people of the Assandh segment of better health facilities.During the question hour, Gogi initially wanted to know when the capacity of 100-bed hospital in Assandh will be increased as reportedly announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.However, health minister Anil Vij said that there was no such announcement or proposal and assured the House that the CM’s announcement is a “pathar ki lakir” (final word) for everybody in the government.Gogi reiterated that the CM had made the announcement in question and other Congress MLAs stood up in support of the Assandh MLA.“Our hospital is itself unwell. When will this hospital recover from its illness,” Gogi said and made it clear that he was unconvinced with the straightforward reply of the health minister. The MLA indirectly referred to institutional corruption in the health department and hinted that one doctor was a stumbling block. At this, visibly upset Vij asked the MLA to reveal the name of the doctor. “Dr Jaipal Chahal,” said Gogi and Vij announced: “Dr Chahal stands relieved right now.” And referring to Gogi’s “hospital is ailing” plea and how promptly Vij treated it on the floor of the House, speaker Gian Chand Gupta quipped: “Ek bimari dur ho gai, dusri bhi ho jayegi (one disease has been diagnosed and the second will also be taken care of).” Later, in a statement, an official spokesperson said health minister Anil Vij said that Dr Jaipal Chahal, medical officer of civil hospital at Assandh, has been relieved with immediate effect and transferred to civil hospital, Panipat. “Vij passed these orders during the ongoing winter session...on the demand made by MLA Shamsher Singh Gogi ...A letter has also been issued by the Civil Surgeon, Karnal in this regard,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-assembly-session-vij-orders-transfer-doc-during-question-hour-101640203386170.html

He added, “The SAD is not only fighting against the Congress party in Punjab, but also the Central government and the AAP government of Delhi. Attempts are also being made to weaken the party and our Sikh institutions.” “The Congress is raking up the issue of sacrilege as well as registering a false case against Bikram Singh Majithia, only to divert attention from its failures. Punjabis also understand the double game that AAP, an anti-Punjab party, is playing in Punjab,” he claimed. On the drugs case against Majithia, he said the Congress government had changed two DGPs and three Bureau of Investigation (BOI) directors to implement its vendetta. “Eventually, it was a DGP, not even eligible for empanelment as a regular DGP, who was given the post as a quid pro quo for registering a false case, who did it,” he alleged. “We will take this corrupt and vengeful government to task. All those who are working outside the purview of the constitution will have to answer for their omissions and commissions as per law,” added Sukhbir. “We are committed to development, including the construction of a ‘Bundh’, to ensure there is no crop damage due to flooding anywhere in the state,” said the Ferozepur MP. Core committee meeting todayIn the wake of recent attempts of sacrilege and the registration of an FIR against former minister Bikram Singh Majithia, Sukhbir has summoned a meeting of the party’s core committee, the top decision-making body, on Thursday. In view of Majithia being booked in a drugs case, the party plans to launch protests and corner the Charanjit Singh Channi government on the issues of sacrilege and the alleged witch-hunt of the party’s top leaders, Badals and Majithia. Since Channi has taken charge, the SAD has alleged, repeatedly, that the state government was hatching a conspiracy to implicate Sukhbir and Majithia in drug cases. YAD to gherao offices of SSPs, commissioners tomorrowThe Youth Akali Dal (YAD) on Wednesday announced that it gherao offices of district police heads across the state, including SSPs and commissioners, on December 24 (Friday), to protest against the registration of an FIR against Majithia. YAD president Parambans Singh Romana has charged the Congress government of using the ‘personal opinion’ of a Punjab police officer, who was related to Majithia, but had a strained relationship. Romana alleged that DGP S Chattopadhyaya had breached all norms of professional policing, by ordering the registration of the case against Majithia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sad-gaining-by-cong-s-vendetta-politics-sukhbir-101640203326448.html

Even as the violations for using polythene bags go unchecked, officials said that the campaign has taken a back seat due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Last December, the civic body had finalised four markets in each of its four administrative zones located at sectors 4, 23, 46, and Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok 1 for the polythene-free initiative.The officials said that during the initial stages they had success in turning some areas of these markets into polythene-free zones. However, after the second Covid-19 wave in April-May and transferring of MCG officials overseeing the project, the initiative has stalled, they said.“In December 2020 and January this year, the polythene-free campaign was at its peak as around the time officials from the central government were visiting the city for the Swachh Survekshan 2021. In April, the second Covid-19 wave occurred and as a result the campaign was temporarily suspended,” said a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity.In February, the MCG had issued a notification stating that from March using plastic bags can invite a penalty of ₹500.“In early June, the joint commissioner of MCG for Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) overseeing the initiative was transferred. The position continues to lie vacant and officials have simply forgotten about the initiative since August. The usage of polythene bags has returned to as it was before December 2020,” said another MCG official privy to the matter.On July 6, a former MCG official had sent a letter to the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB), a copy of which is with HT, stating that on July 12, eight markets, two in each municipal zone, will become free of plastic bags, and on July 15 the MCG will declare this publicly.In the letter, the official had also stated that the civic body will start issuing fines for using polythene bags from July 12 onwards.“The letter sent to the ULB was completely baseless and had nothing to do ground reality. The MCG was struggling to make four markets polythene-free, and another four were added to the list. The official who had issued the letter was also transferred soon after and challaning for polythene usage never started,” said the official quoted above.To supplement its polythene-free initiative, the MCG has also introduced cloth bag banks. The banks are supposed to supply cloth bags at nominal rates to shopkeepers in the four markets.“From each of the four markets, we still have two-three shopkeepers procuring cloth bags on a mass level, and they account for more than 60% of our supply. In a year, we have distributed around 300,000 cloth bags and saved around 1,500,000 polythene bags,” said Kuldeep Singh, brand ambassador (SBM), MCG.In December last year, MCG had opened its first cloth bag bank in Sector 8, the second such facility opened in South City 2 last month, and on December 11 the third bank opened in Wazirabad.

Saharanpur reported four fresh Covid cases while Lucknow, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad and Prayagraj reported three each. Agra reported two cases. Hamirpur, Meerut and Amroha reported one each. No death was reported in the state. So far, UP had reported 17,10,764 cases and 22,915 deaths, including a maximum 2,38,946 cases and 2,651 deaths in Lucknow.

Lucknow leads with 2,38,946 cases, followed by Varanasi 85,516 cases and Prayagraj 78,735 cases, as per the data. The health department intensified testing and contact tracing in these districts. “We are conducting focused sampling for Covid among people who walk out of their houses for work. Samples are being collected from among students, teachers, drivers working in public transport sector, shopkeepers including chemists and hospital front office staff,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer, Lucknow. He said the drive will continue till December 28. Health and family welfare minister Jai Pratap Singh said after the World Health Organisation and the Indian Council of Medical Research sounded alert on the new Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2, the UP government directed all the DMs and CMOs to focus on effective implementation of trace, test, treat and vaccination drive. No fresh Covid case had been reported in 39 districts of the states in the last 24 hours while hospitals were equipped with beds, human resources, medicines and oxygen to provide treatment to Covid patients, said officials. Experts said the risk of infection spread was more due to floating population that visited Lucknow and left after a day or two. “Intensified screening of passengers at airport, railway station and toll gates at highways/expressways (entry point of the state capital) is one way to identify people with Covid infection early,” said Dr PK Gupta, microbiologist and former president of the Indian Medical Association branch.

Doctors from the civil hospital conducted his post-mortem before the cremation. With nothing recovered from his possession, his identity could not be established. Amritsar deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Parminder Singh Bhandal, who is heading the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that the Punjab government had formed to probe the incident said, “As per rules, we kept the body in our custody for 72 hours, and advertised his photo grabbed from the CCTV footage, so that any of his survivors, relatives and nears and dears could come forward and claim the body, Nobody surfaced, so we cremated his body as per rules.” The incident took place on the evening of December 18, when the accused tried to desecrate the Guru Granth Sahib inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple during the evening rituals. He rushed towards the holy book after jumping the railings, and picked up a ‘kirpan’. Before he could do anything more, SGPC staffers got hold of him, and the crowd of devotees thrashed him to death. “Initial fingerprints of the accused failed to match with the Aadhaar card data. Maybe, he did not have an Aadhaarcard. Still, we have taken prints of remaining parts of the fingers of his hand to establish his identity. These prints have been sent to the department concerned in Delhi,” Bhandal added. Bhandal added that CCTV footage shows that the accused had also visited the area outside the Sri Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple) on December 16, two days before the sacrilege bid. “With the help of the CCTV footage, we are now trying to ascertain for which purpose he came on that day and how long did he stay.” On the completion of the probe, the deadline of which ended on Tuesday, the DCP added, “Investigation is underway, yet as we need more time to get a strong lead in this case. The post-mortem report will reveal the cause of death and is expected to take the probe forward.”

Sukhraj Singh, son of 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing victim Bhagwan Krishan Singh, whose protest sit-in for justice, entered the 7th day on Wednesday, said, “The government should punish those responsible for sacrilege and police firing incidents first, and after that, they should talk about giving jobs on compassionate grounds.”He added, “For votes, Sidhu’s own party leaders are visiting the Dera Sacha Sauda, which is responsible for sacrilege incidents, but he has not issued any statement on whether the Congress will stop taking the dera’s help. The least he can do as state party president is to ask Congress leaders to boycott the Sirsa Dera.”On Monday, Sidhu had joined Sukhraj, who is sitting on an indefinite protest against the delay in delivery of justice. “The government has only made false promises in the name of justice. Now, after five years again they are making hollow promises of jobs and justice,” said Sadhu Singh, father of Gurjeet Singh, who was also killed at Behbal Kalan firing. Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh said Sikh outfits had decided to hold an “Ardas Samagam” at the Akal Takht and the Behbal Morcha on December 26, seeking the release of Jagtar Singh Hawara, Balwant Singh Rajoana and Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar and six other Sikh prisoners who have completed their life sentences. “The Congress is busy in gimmicks, instead of delivering justice in sacrilege and police firing incidents. The plan of the Behbal Morcha will be announced on Sunday,” he added. 
23-12-2021||Lucknow||Gadkari claim about ethanol mere rhetoric, say farmers||MEERUT Union minister of surface transport Nitin Gadkari’s assurance to farmers that they would soon be known as ‘ urjadaata’ (energy-giver) by introducing ethanol as alternative fuel for vehicles has had least impact on sugarcane farmers who believe it to be as another ‘jumla’ (mere remark or rhetoric) of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to please farmers ahead of the assembly elections in UP. Launching the party’s ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ from Bijnor on Sunday, Gadkari had announced that ethanol would be used as an alternative to petroleum fuel in coming years. He said ethanol was produced from sugarcane and rice, so farmers would be in the role of ‘ urjadaata’ in coming years. He also shared that vehicles’ engines were being modified to use ethanol as fuel and separate ethanol pumps would be opened to ensure easy availability of this alternative fuel. Responding to claims of the union minister, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said that farmers’ benefits depended on honest implementation of policies and plans. He said the state governments of Chhattisharh and Odisha had sought permission for production of ethanol but it was pending with the union government. “Permission to produce ethanol in states would benefit rice and sugar mills and farmers would receive subsequent benefit out of it by selling them their produce at MSP,” he explained. Tikait suggested to first use ethanol in tractors and vehicles in Delhi as well as Delhi Transport Corporation buses to know its real impact before applying it to other vehicles. He reiterated that the farmers’ condition could not be improved without giving direct subsidy. “Inflation is at a high and the government is investing very little in education, health and other segments which are directly associated with the welfare of people,” he said and shared that leaders of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha would meet in Delhi on January 15 to discuss and decide the future course of action regarding issues of farmers and farming. Surendra Singh, national vice president of BKU (Asli), was more critical and made no bones in admitting that the BJP had lost peoples’ trust. He said,“What Gadkari said seems another attempt of BJP leaders to woo farmers by tossing another ‘jumla’”. He said that 10 percent ethanol was already being mixed in petroleum fuel and questioned, “How much did it help to improve farmers’ financial condition? Were farmers not ‘ urjaadata’ then?” Plant head of Daurala Sugar Mill Sanjay Rastogi explained that the government was in the process of developing flexi fuel so that vehicles could have choice to use any of these, including ethanol. He said the government’s target was to mix 20 percent ethanol in petroleum fuel by the end of 2025 and it was a good move to decrease the load on the exchequer because the major part of fuel was imported. He said that sugar production was high in the country and such policies would help utilize produce of farmers in making bi-products like ethanol, so farmers would certainly get advantage out of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gadkari-claim-about-ethanol-mere-rhetoric-say-farmers-101640200149457.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s AQI ‘severe’ for second day, NCR towns add PM2.5 load||Delhi’s pollution levels continued to be in the “severe” range for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, as calm winds led to the accumulation of pollutants in the region, senior scientists of the India Meteorological Department said. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed that on Wednesday, the overall Air Quality Index reading of Delhi was 407, in the “severe” zone. Delhi’s pollution level on Tuesday was also in the “severe” range, with an AQI reading of 402. IMD officials said that the air quality is likely to remain severe on Thursday as well, after which winds will start picking up and help disperse pollutants. “There will be a marginal improvement in winds on Thursday, but the pollution level will remain in the same range. There will be a slight improvement in air quality only from Friday,” a senior Met official said. Data from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s Decision Support System, an air quality forecasting system, showed that on Wednesday, the maximum share of Delhi’s PM2.5 came from neighbouring NCR towns such as Ghaziabad, Sonipat, Panipat and Faridabad. PM2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameter of 2.5 microns. It is considered the dominant pollutant in the region.Pollution from Faridabad and Sonipat contributed to 15% of Delhi’s pollution on Wednesday, 10% of Delhi’s pollution share came from Panipat, 16% from Ghaziabad, and 14% from Bagpat. Other factors, which according to IITM scientists don’t usually contribute to Delhi pollution, contributed to 19-46% of Delhi’s pollution levels. Among local sources, vehicular pollution continued to be the biggest factor in the Capital’s deteriorating air quality. On Wednesday, its share in pollution levels was 13% and scientists forecast the share will increase to 16% by Thursday. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, said that the upcoming western disturbance that will impact most of north India, will help improve the city’s air quality from Friday. “There is a forecast of rain from November 26 that should help improve the air quality,” he said. A western disturbance refers to an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India.On the directions of the Supreme Court, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on November 16 imposed a list of restrictions on polluting activities, including a ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR, scheduled operations for thermal power plants, allowing only those industrial units that have switched to piped natural gas (PNG) to operate, and a ban on the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items into Delhi. Over the last week, the commission has lifted these restrictions in a phased manner. On Monday, the final set of restrictions, the ban on construction activities in NCR and the ban on the entry of trucks into Delhi, were also lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-aqi-severe-for-second-day-ncr-towns-add-pm2-5-load-101640200148231.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||Drinking age reduced to 21 in Haryana, pubs and bars welcome move||Gurugram: The Haryana government on Wednesday reduced the drinking age in the state from 25 year to 21 years, with the state assembly passing an amendment to the Haryana Excise Act. According to the statement of objects and reasons stated in the amendment Bill, during the framing of excise policy for 2021-22 it was discussed that the age limit may be reduced from 25 years to 21 as many of other states have prescribed lower age limits. The Delhi government announced lowering the drinking age in the national Capital from 25 to 21 years.“Moreover, the socio-economic conditions of the day have changed drastically from the time when the provisions were incorporated in the Excise Act. People now are more educated and participating in new endeavours and also can take rational decisions when it comes to responsible drinking. Accordingly, The Haryana Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2021 has been passed to reduce the minimum age limit of 25 years as provided in Sections 27, 29, 30 and 62 of the Haryana Excise Act, 1914 to 21 years,” said the amendment Bill. V K Beniwal, deputy commissioner of excise and taxation , Gurugram (east), called it a “good move”. “This is a good move as Delhi has already reduced the age and it was impacting business in Gurugram. We were strictly imposing the rules pertaining to the drinking age, and have penalised several pubs and bars for serving to underage patrons. This move will benefit the licence holders and also the people in the age bracket as they can now drink legally,” he said..Pubs and bars in Gurugram also cheered the decision. Rahul Singh, trustee, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) , said they thank the Haryana government for the “significant change” to the legal drinking age that was prescribed “during the British Raj in 1914”. “This will reduce illegal consumption and also places the state at par with International norms as well as neighbouring states,” he said.Ashish Dev Kapoor, founder, Whisky Samba bar and grill, said it was a progressive move by the Haryana government. “If people are allowed to get married at 21, cast their vote, why can’t they allowed to drink legally. This will help in ensuring that people can drink in a transparent and responsible manner,” he said.Lalit Ahlawat, Director, Soi7 Pub and Brewery at DLF Cyber City, said 21 is the right age to be fixed for drinking. “Though all the pub and bars were following the rules and regulations, but this amendment will help the youngsters enjoy legally,” he said.Nearly 60% of the 28 states and eight Union territories in India allow the sale of liquor to those above 21 years old. With Delhi and Haryana both reducing the drinking age to 21 -- it stays 25 only in Punjab, Chandigarh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Teams of UPPCB were also asked to sensitise residents about the construction ban order,” said V K Mittal, president of Karwa, the umbrella body of different apartments’ RWAs. “Teams of UPPCB came on November 26 and took photographs of the sites, where alleged violation of construction and demolition waste norms were taking place, while teams of the municipal corporation came a day later. Since Tuesday, we have started receiving notices about the penalty. We have prepared our representation in this regard and we will meet the district magistrate for an appeal into the matter,” Mittal added.

23-12-2021||Lucknow||Anticipatory bail should be resorted to only in a special case: High court||PRAYAGRAJ: Rejecting the second anticipatory bail application of a person, who allegedly used forged BEd mark-sheet/degree to obtain employment, the Allahabad high court has observed, “Anticipatory bail being an extraordinary remedy, should be resorted to only in a special case”. Rejecting the anticipatory bail of one Hemant Kumar Saraswat, Justice Samit Gopal took serious note of the charges levelled against the applicant and observed, “By the act of the applicant of seeking appointment on the basis of a forged mark-sheet/degree, one deserving candidate has lost his seat and chance of appointment and it may be a lifelong loss for many reasons like crossing the bracket of prescribed age and many other factors”. An FIR was lodged against the applicant at Manth police station in Mathura district under Sections 420 (cheating) and other sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), alleging that the applicant was a beneficiary of a forged mark-sheet, which he had allegedly obtained from Agra University, showing him to have qualified the BEd Examination in the academic session 2004-05. Declining the plea for anticipatory bail, the court observed, “The case prima facie indicates involvement of the applicant in the offence-in-question as he was the beneficiary by making use of the forged mark-sheet/degree. The applicant has not established any special circumstance. No reason is found to falsely implicate the present applicant”. The court also rejected the ground of parity raised by the applicant, saying, “In so far as, the orders of the other persons are concerned who have been granted anticipatory bail/interim anticipatory bail, the same are not binding on this court”. Referring to the rejection of the first anticipatory bail by the high court, the court in its order dated December 21 further said, “While rejecting the first anticipatory bail application, the court was of the opinion that during investigation, even at times, the custodial interrogation may be necessary to reach the roots of the crime, the same cannot be overlooked. Therefore, looking into the gravity of the offence, nature of offence and the legal position enumerated above, this court is of the view that the anticipatory bail application has no merit and is liable to be rejected”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/anticipatory-bail-should-be-resorted-to-only-in-a-special-case-high-court-101640200087074.html

The suspects have been identified as Aman Rangad, Noor Hasan Saifi, Salman Qureshi, Suhail Malik and Yusuf Rangad, said police. Police said the house out of which the factory was operating belonged to one Zahiruddin Razi, whose accomplices were nabbed in connection with a similar operation of a factory at a different location in Muradnagar on September 25, while he fled and later obtained bail. Police said after his illegal arms factory was busted in September, Razi operated another factory in the same house in Muradnagar for some days and later shifted base. “The suspects told us that Razi later rented the house to them for ₹20,000 per month. The five suspects were nabbed while preparing illegal arms. They told us that the price for country-made firearm was between ₹5,000 and ₹10,000 while illegal country-made pistols were priced at ₹35,000-40,000. We suspect that the gang was operating this factory for supplying illegal firearms during the upcoming elections,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). The suspects also told police that apart from manufacturing illegal arms, they also procured cartridges of .315 and .12 calibre from two people--Rahees Lambu and Sonu Kumar, residents of Kithor in Meerut. “We are trying to trace the two suspects, along with several others, who were involved in operating the arms factory. Several teams are trying to trace them and are also on the lookout for people who procured arms from the gang,” said the officer. Police said they recovered 16 different calibre weapons, five magazines for pistols, different equipment used for preparing arms along with raw material from the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/5-arrested-for-operating-illegal-guns-factory-in-muradnagar-101640199975410.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution body hires 50 environmental engineers, to train them via 3-week module||The short-staffed Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) hired 50 environmental engineers last month to fill up a large chunk of its vacant posts. About 10% of its 343 sanctioned posts are vacant.Each engineer will undergo a three-week training module developed by IIT Delhi on over 50 topics, including how to source apportionment data to combat air pollution, atmospheric chemistry and air pollution modelling, toxic and hazardous pollutants and their sources, climate change and how to manage the different kind of wastes being generated in Delhi. Officials of DPCC said this training module, which HT has had a look at, will be the guiding tool for all future recruitments for technical positions, with particular focus on air pollution, for which 20 one-hour sessions will be held. The other sessions will focus on electric waste, septic tanks, reviving water bodies, water quality management, plastic waste management and noise pollution, among other key areas. “Those hired will be trained regarding the existing problems, and the technological and technical innovations that can be utilised for Delhi. For instance, we will focus on emission inventories for air pollution sources, air pollution source apportionment through measuring and modelling, atmospheric dispersion of pollutants and air quality forecasting,” said a senior DPCC official, on condition of anonymity.Of the DPCC’s 343 posts, nearly 50% are technical posts. The official said the remaining staff, which include those in clerical positions,is currently handling a majority of the work. “We needed technical expertise, but before deploying the new employees in different key areas, we will provide them with detailed knowledge, which will help them plan for next winter too,” said the official, adding the new employees will be deployed in the green war room, and be required to manage and analyse data from the web portal created to oversee construction and demolition sites, analyse data from the Green Delhi app, while also focusing on innovations and studies. Professor Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at IIT-Delhi, said while the current module includes over 50 topics, a few more are currently being added, based on the DPCC’s request. “These are not all air-pollution related, but a good chunk is centred on pollution. They are also very technical and will be explaining technologies and studies that can be used to solve the air pollution problem,” said Dey, who has designed the training module along with fellow IIT professors Dilip Ganguly and RK Kunchala. “We are still deciding whether to do it online or in-person. The entire module will take around three weeks,” he said.The Delhi government also inducted 28 “green fellows” last month to fill vacant seats in the environment and forest departments. The fellows -- three specialists, 10 fellows and 15 associate fellows – have joined the government departments for a period of four years as part of a Green Youth Fellowship under the Green Delhi mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-body-hires-50-environmental-engineers-to-train-them-via-3-week-module-101640199974096.html

She ran continuously for 15 hours covering a distance of 100 km with a provisional timing of 15:01:05 hrs. After returning to Prayagraj on Wednesday, Maj Deeba shared her experience. “I started the run from Jaisalmer on December 18 and reached the destination on December 19, completing the race that tests a runner’s stamina and commitment. I completed the first 50km in 6:21:07 hours,” she said. Maj Deeba, a mother of two sons, said that during the run she had two vomiting and dehydration, but she toughed up and fought to complete the race which is not meant for the weak-willed. “I am so proud to have run at the border on the occasion of 75 years of independence (Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav). The race was really a Hell as the name suggests. The challenges included lack of an active medical team. Hydration points at only 10 km gaps, plus biting desert dry heat during the day and icing cold at the night were also challenging. There were no human beings visible on road except the runners. The run started from the Golden City of Jaisalmer and ended at the battlefield of Longewala, passing via Ramgarh and some ruined, evacuated villages,” she said. According to Deeba, the route has almost all the likes of any famous 100 milers and 100kms. The participants are exposed to the elements of nature, face to face while fighting their own demons mentally as is the case with any Ultra Run. This race was devoted to the martyrs and the brave soldiers who confronted the enemy the entire night. Longewala is a border town in the Thar Desert in the western part of Jaisalmer district. It is very close to the border with Pakistan and is most notable as the location of the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 (December 4-7). Maj Deeba said, “Frankly speaking, I covered 110 km approximately as I missed the marking at 80 km. A fellow runner was kind enough to remind me to retreat. That was the worst feel. As my mobile phone and watch too did not support me, and my equipment failed but my mind remained positive because of which I completed the run well before the stipulated timing of 16 hours.” The ace runner had in August 2021 completed the stadium run held in Bengaluru. In that run, Maj Deeba had ran continuously for 12 hours covering a distance of 82.91 km at an average speed of 8.21 km/hr. She had also completed the run held in March 2021 in Chandigarh stadium wherein she covered 70.62 km in 12 hours. Major Deeba has been a regular participant in several major long-distance runs of the country, including Indira Marathon which is held in November in Sangam city. She is also one of the founding members of Prayagraj Pacers, a group of female fitness enthusiasts from the city who often undertake long-distance runs along with routine yoga, cycling and exercises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/border-ultra-hell-race-prayagraj-woman-officer-major-farah-deeba-runs-100km-in-15-hours-101640199970822.html
23-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body declares 94 wards eligible for “water plus” certification||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has declared 94 of its 100 residential wards eligible for the “water plus” certification and has invited public objections/suggestion in the next 15 days. The “water plus” certificate is awarded to cities that have met all the ODF Double Plus (ODF++) standards, a certification that Ghaziabad received in March this year. The “water plus” protocol aims to provide a guideline to cities and towns to ensure no untreated wastewater is released into the environment, thereby enabling sustainability of the sanitation value chain. According to the protocols of the “water plus” under the Swachh Bharat Mission, a city/ward/circle/zone can be declared as water plus provided all wastewater released from households, commercial establishments, drains, nullahs, etc. is treated to a satisfactory level (as per norms set by the Central Pollution Control Board), before releasing the treated wastewater to the environment. Further, there should be adequate sewage treatment facilities with the capacity to treat sufficient quantities of wastewater. The infrastructure should be maintained properly and cost recovery is ensured through reuse / recycling of treated wastewater to ensure sustainability. “We are applying for ‘water plus’ category. As part of the process, the initial declaration is done by the city and later it is to be verified by the state and then the Centre. We received the ODF++ certification in March this year, when we learnt that we can apply for the ‘water plus’ certification, which is a step higher than ODF++, only after six months. We are complying with 80% of the parameters and we feel that we are ‘water plus’ now,” said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar. “Once we get the certification, we will be able to get rank better in Swachh Survekshan. So far, we have declared only 94 wards as ‘water plus’, and not the six wards of Indirapuram as the locality is yet to be handed over to the corporation,” he added. Environmentalists said the city is still far from actually getting a “water plus” certification. “In many localities, the drainage system is absent and the entire drainage gets mixed with sewage and vice versa. There are several drains, which still flow untreated into Hindon river. This not only exposes the preparedness of the agencies but also has adverse impact on the environment and biodiversity,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. The councillors in the municipal corporation also raised questions over the city’s declaration of 94 wards being “water plus”. “There are many illegal residential colonies on the floodplains of Hindon river, whose sewage and drainage goes directly into the river near Chijarsi and Kanawani villages. Further, the high court in a petition directed the corporation to construct a drain in Sai Upvan as it goes untreated into the river. The drain has not been constructed till date,” said Rajendra Tyagi, a councillor from Raj Nagar. “Further, the functionality of the sewage treatment plants needs to be checked before the city goes ahead with its plan of applying for the “water plus” certification. Civic officials could not provide the figures of sewage, drainage and treated water in the city. However, the officials of the water works department said they have initiated the process for bio-remediation of untreated drains. “The pilot projects of bioremediation have been initiated for the drains at Arthala, Pratap Vihar and Brij Vihar to ensure no untreated water goes into the river,” said an officer from the water works department. Under many conditions for “water plus” certification, a city has to ensure 100% operations and maintenance costs of sewer networks/STPs etc are being recovered; a Minimum of 25% wastewater is being reused after treatment at city level for purposes such as horticulture, agriculture, industrial use, cleaning roads etc; designed capacity of STP is sufficient to treat 500 litres per day per household (or 100 liters per person) through a decentralized or centralized treatment plant for the number of households connected to a sewer, etc. 
23-12-2021||Lucknow||2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections: Major political parties vying to win support of women||A game of political one-upmanship is being witnessed among the major political parties ever since Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra promised 40% party tickets to women candidates and made some populist announcements for them ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.After making the populist announcements, the Congress has now begun a direct interaction with women, bringing women’s issues into political focus. Other major political parties too are now moving forward with programmes or announcements focusing on women.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra gave a bit of political twist to the Bollywood film Deewar’s iconic dialogue “mere paas maa hai” on Wednesday to make her point that the Congress, she hoped, would get the support of the women in 2022 polls.“Mere pass behenein hain….behenein rajniti main badlav laayengi (I have sisters…. Sisters will bring about a change in politics),” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi on Wednesday with the #Ladki_hoon_lad_sakti_hoon. (I am a girl, I can fight). Priyanka made the observation in response to a question about the Congress that was not left with any strong base in the politics of caste and community.A video clip of her reply to newspersons quoting the “mere paas maa hai” dialogue has been posted along with the tweet.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had on Sunday launched a direct dialogue with women at the Women’s Town Hall titled Shakti Samvad in Rae Bareli. She referred to the PM’s Tuesday meeting at Prayagraj, saying, “We are half of the population and the political parties are not taking the women seriously… the Congress’s initiative of empowering the women has awakened the political parties now. Asha bahu’s honorarium has been raised and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to hold an all-women meeting.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed women beneficiaries of various government schemes at a programme in Prayagraj. He said the daughters of Uttar Pradesh would not let the parties that ran the previous governments come to power in the state. Adding to her Sunday’s observations, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a twitter post on Tuesday said, “UP’s women may see. You stretched and Prime Minister @narendramodi has bowed before you. But this is only the beginning. There is going to be a storm of women power. Women’s unity will lead to revolution.”The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), too, are not lagging behind in making claims about the work done by them to empower women. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has referred to the work his government did for women in a post on social media on Tuesday.“The Samajwadi Party government worked for girls and women and for their empowerment in a true manner by distributing laptops, ‘Kanya Vidya Dhan’, launching 1090 women helpline and providing ambulance service for them. Problems, scarcity and their humiliation have put women against the BJP,” Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet on Tuesday.The SP may make some announcements in its poll manifesto in the coming weeks. The SP chief, viewing the sensitivity of women issues, recently distanced himself from party MPs’ observations with regard to the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani tabled in Lok Sabha on Tuesday. The amended bill proposes to increase the minimum age of marriage of women from 18 to 21 years. The bill was later referred by the lower house to a parliamentary standing committee for further scrutiny.The BSP has said it is following in the footsteps of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar to empower women and has demanded reservation for them.“Half of the population is women. But they are still deprived of their rights though respected Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar has contributed a lot to empower them by giving them legal rights. Now the BSP is following in his footsteps…. The Congress and the BJP have almost the same opinion about women empowerment and they believe only in show off. The BSP government worked a lot for social, economic and educational self-reliance of women and the parties opposed to the BSP are now encashing the same…Also, the BJP and the Congress are not serious about making women strong and self-reliant. This is evident from the issue of 33% reservation for women that is pending in the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies for years. The BSP demands reservation for women,” said BSP chief Mayawati in a series of tweets on Wednesday.The Election Commission’s statistics for the 2017 assembly elections indicates that UP had a total of 14,16,63,646 voters that year. Out of them, 77,042,607 were males, 64,613,747 females and 7292 other category voters. Out of this, 8,67,55,499 votes were polled. Those who turned up for voting included 4,55,70,067 male voters, 40906123 female voters and 277 other category voters. In all, 2,79,032 postal votes were also cast in the 2017 polls.On the importance of women in the elections, AK Singh former director, Giri Institute of Development Studies, Lucknow, said: “Women constitute 50% of the voters and they vote in large numbers. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra adopted a strategy to focus on them. The BJP appears wary because SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is getting a good response. The fight is becoming close and every vote is going to count.”
23-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s civic body to upgrade schools under NEP; redevelop Sarojini Nagar market||The New Delhi Municipal Council will upgrade all its schools according to the National Education Policy Framework for the holistic development of students. The council has also decided to upgrade the infrastructure of the Sarojini Nagar market, for which it will hold consultations with traders and other stakeholders, council members said on Wednesday after the monthly council meeting. Satish Upadhyay, the vice-chairperson of the council, said that three committees have been formed to finalise the modalities about school upgradation, market redevelopment and women empowerment-related issues. Kuljeet Chahal, member of council who chairs education upgradation committee said that there are 45 schools, 34 Atal Adarsh Schools and 11 Navyug Schools under NDMC which will be upgraded to ‘New India schools’. “We have visited several schools and a report has been prepared for knowledge upgradation of teachers, infrastructure additions and improvement of amenities being provided to students. A series of changes will be incorporated in all our schools,” he added. Chahal said that NDMC will sign MOUs with key institutions including Lalit Kala Academy, Sangeet Kala Academy, National Gallery of Modern Art among other institutes for adding new skills and training for the student community. “The building infrastructure needs to be revamped and a study report will be published in this sector soon. Four thousand tablets will be provided to the students which has been provided by council. The furniture upgradation has been passed by council on Wednesday,” he added. He also said that a separate civil and electrical division will be carved out to exclusively cater to schools under the jurisdiction of the council. Upadhyay said that the council is also planning to set up a separate residential school for the wards of armed forces personnel who have laid down their lives for the country. “The idea is in the nascent stage and a detailed plan will be presented before the council for a school that caters to such children and takes care of all their needs free of cost,” he added. Girish Sachdeva, council member who heads the committee on market redevelopment, said that the council will redevelop Sarojini Nagar market after wider consultations with all stakeholders. “Everyone in Delhi has memories associated with this market. The ownership of central market in Sarojini Nagar is private while the surrounding smaller markets have been rented out by NDMC. Common amenities such as parks, parking lots and walking areas will be upgraded. We will hold wider consultations with all the market associations to make an integrated plan. We have also held meetings with NBCC regarding the relocation of ring road market and Netaji Nagar market. The sites of relocation have not been finalised yet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-civic-body-to-upgrade-schools-under-nep-redevelop-sarojini-nagar-market-101640199913551.html
23-12-2021||Noida||Rating system for housing societies in Greater Noida West||The Greater Noida authority has decided to rank all housing societies on the basis of facilities and the quality of maintenance work done by the developers in the campus for the convenience of homebuyers, who can check the ranking of a society and take a well-informed decision before buying a house. CEO of Greater Noida authority Narendra Bhooshan came up with the idea of ranking housing complexes after realising that residents in newly constructed housing complexes are suffering due to lack of maintenance of basic facilities, such as water supply, sanitation, roads, parking, and other such services.“We have directed the builders department to formulate the detailed guidelines to be followed to rank the housing complexes. Once the rank is awarded to a complex, it will help the buyers and inspire the developers to ensure better facilities,” said Bhooshan. There are at least 200 housing complexes in Greater Noida west spread on around 4,000 hectare and the developers have a responsibility to look after the maintenance of the housing complex. However, apartment owners in many societies complain of pathetic services. “When a rank will be awarded, the developer will feel that poor rank will impact his sales and affect the revenue of the company. This may bring a change in the attitude of a developer, who will then ensure better maintenance, which in turn will apartment owners,” said Bhooshan.The common dispute between homebuyers and developers is that the newly built housing complexes lack clean drinking water supply, the level of cleanliness is not up to the mark and the developer’s staff do not behave properly with the apartment owners. Homebuyers alleged that the developers charge a hefty amount as maintenance fee but are reluctant to provide the required facilities.“The developers are not willing to provide basic services in most of the newly built complexes. As a result, the apartment owners face problems and have to resort to the protest. If the authority’s new idea works well, it will benefit apartment owners, who are otherwise at the mercy of developers,” said Vivek Raman, president of Greater Noida West Entrepreneur association. Developers too welcomed the move of the Greater Noida authority. “It will be a positive trend and may help in setting a benchmark in the field of maintenance of housing complexes after delivering the flat to consumer,” said Prateek Kumar Tiwari, president of Western UP of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.
23-12-2021||Noida||Doctor, his wife found dead at their home in Greater Noida||A doctor and his wife were found dead at their home in Greater Noida by their son on Tuesday night, said police on Wednesday. Police found a suicide note at their home, which mentioned about a dispute regarding their property in Delhi. A few people have also been named in the note, said police. “The couple was living in Sector Zeta of Greater Noida since August this year. Prior to this, they lived in Delhi. According to the suicide note, the couple was distressed over a property dispute,” said deputy commissioner of police (central Noida) Harish Chander. Avadhesh Pratap Singh, in-charge of Surajpur police station, said the couple’s 32-year-old son returned from Shimla on Tuesday night. “Around 9.45pm, when he reached Gaur City Chowk in Greater Noida West, he called his parents but no one picked the call. When he came home, he found his parents’ bodies in their bedroom,” said Singh. “During investigation, police found that the couple had sold their house in Delhi to some people...Around six people were harassing the couple over the property dispute, due to which they were stressed,” said Singh. An FIR under section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC has been filed against five known and one unknown person, all of whom are residents of Delhi. 
23-12-2021||Delhi||Airport Express Line case: DMRC asked to give all bank account details||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to give details of all its bank accounts in connection with a plea by Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited, seeking execution of an arbitral award of ₹4,600 crore.“The DMRC is directed to furnish the details of bank accounts... in Delhi or outside Delhi. It will also be mentioned in the affidavit, how much amount is lying in a particular account,” the court ordered.The amount is the compensation awarded to DAMEPL over an agreement terminated in October 2012 on account of DMRC failing to resolve defects in the structure supporting the Airport Metro Express Line. The DMRC had earlier offered to accept DAMEPL’s liabilities to the extent of the award.Noting that the DMRC has ₹1,642.69 crore available in its bank accounts, Justice Suresh Kait, however, said that if the DAMEPL does not want to accept the former’s offer of taking over its debts, the court can’t force it to do so.“(DAMEPL says) if it has money in hand, in an escrow account, at least it can bargain with banks for restructuring etc. Suppose it passes on total liability to you, to pay to the lenders, it will lose the bargaining power... If your (DMRC’s) offer is accepted, no issues…But when it is not accepting that, this court can’t force it that you (DAMEPL) accept in this fashion,” the judge said.The judge observed that though the attachment of the DMRC’s properties is not permitted, there is no such embargo with respect to its bank accounts.The order comes after DAMEPL refused to accept DMRC’s offer to directly negotiate with the banks and repay the arbitral award money.Appearing for DAMEPL, advocate Prateek Seksaria, informed that its lenders have rejected the DMRC’s proposal of taking care of its liabilities and contended that no special treatment can be given to the government in the present execution proceedings.He argued that the government should “set an example” by paying the award instead, adding that even after the DMRC deposited ₹1,000 crore in the escrow account, over ₹6,000 crore was still due. He also submitted that DAMEPL is entitled to the amount awarded in the arbitration proceedings as well as the benefit of “any surplus” which may be utilised to restart its businesses.He also relied on the DMRC’s affidavit to state that the corporation has nearly ₹5,800 crore in its bank accounts as on December 17 -- ₹1,642 crore earnings; ₹2,400 crore project allocation fund; and ₹1,700 crore deposit fund.He sought that at least the admitted earnings of the DMRC should straightaway be appropriated towards execution of the award.However, this was opposed by Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the DMRC, who submitted that they have no informationwith respect to the banks rejecting the proposal, and reiterated that taking over DAMEPL’s debts to the extent of the award and negotiating with the lenders will be in public interest.“The government says we are in negotiations with the bank. Reliance, the award holder… they come and say that banks are interested in we (DAMEPL) getting the money and they have rejected the government’s proposal. If this is so, this is very serious… Something needs to be examined by the banking division also,” Mehta stated.Senior advocate Parag Tripathi, also appearing for DMRC, urged the court to grant it an opportunity to work out a solution and submitted that nobody will gain if the bank accounts are attached and Metro services are stopped.“If Metro is stopped tomorrow, there will be a huge issue… I will work it out because as an instrumentality of the state, when I sit with the banks, the ability to get a rollover of the amount as a loan from the bank will be much greater,” Tripathi said.The court was hearing DAMEPL’s execution plea for the arbitral award won against the corporation.The consortium of Reliance Energy Limited (renamed as Reliance Infrastructure Limited) and M/s Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, SA, terminated the concession agreement in October 2012 citing failure of DMRC to correct defects in the structure supporting the Airport Metro Express Line. DMRC invoked the arbitration clause of its contract with the consortium.The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, except at the depot, and the remaining work were to be executed by DAMEPL, a joint venture of Reliance Infra (95%) and a Spanish construction company M/s Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles (5%).In 2017, the arbitral tribunal awarded damages to Reliance Infra, and it was upheld by a single-judge bench of the Delhi high court in 2018. A division bench of the same court set aside the award in 2019 after which Reliance Infra approached the top court.In September this year, the apex court set aside the division bench’s order January 15, 2019, and upheld the arbitral award in favour of DMRC, saying that there was a disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards.In November, the Supreme Court also dismissed DMRC’s plea seeking a review of its judgment.On the last date, the DMRC had told the court that it would deposit ₹1,000 crore in favour of DAMEPL while suggesting taking over its debt to the extent of the award money.DMRC had stated that since the corporation was facing a “financial crunch”, undertaking a “sudden liability” would impact public interest and authorities were, therefore, working out a solution. It had also claimed that the amount liable to be paid was approximately ₹5,000 crore which was lesser than DAMEPL’s claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/airport-express-line-case-dmrc-asked-to-give-all-bank-account-details-101640199852629.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||Cold wave eases in Delhi, light rain expected after Christmas||The temperatures in Delhi rose slightly on Wednesday, breaking the cold wave streak that the city has been experiencing for the past three days. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted a further rise in the temperatures in the next two days, and forecast light rain in Delhi-NCR from December 25. IMD recordings showed that on Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which provides representative data for the city, was 23.8 degrees Celsius—two degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature rose to 4.4 degrees Celsius, but it was still three degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year. At Palam, the minimum temperature was 7.6 degrees Celsius and at Lodi Road the night temperature was 4.2 degrees Celsius. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 4 degrees Celsius (°C) – four notches below normal. Mercury dipped even further at Ayanagar and Lodhi Road weather stations, dropping down to 3.8°C and 3.7°C, respectively. Till Tuesday, Delhi and neighbouring NCR cities was recording a cold wave, with the minimum temperatures witnessing a deviation of over 4.5 degrees Celsius from normal. The weather department declares a cold day if the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees below normal. It announces a cold wave if the day’s low is either 4.5 degrees below normal, or below 4°C. On Monday, Delhi recorded the season’s lowest temperature of 3.2 degrees Celsius. Met officials said that this spike in temperatures on Wednesday was the impact of a passing western disturbance. Over the next few days, successive active western disturbances may cause cold wave conditions to abate across northern India, and the minimum temperatures are expected to rise to around 7-8 degrees Celsius. “Minimum temperatures saw a rising trend over Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, signalling the abatement of cold wave conditions over these areas. Minimum temperatures are expected to rise further during the next 24 hours,” said RK Jenamani, a scientist at IMD. He said, “The western disturbances from December 24 onwards will lead to cloudy skies over Delhi. Rain is also forecast from December 26- 27 in Delhi.” Weather forecasters have, however, said this respite from cold will only be temporary and mercury levels will start falling again from December 29. “On Wednesday, even though the temperatures rose slightly in Delhi, the minimum temperature was still lower than what was recorded in Shimla (5.4 degrees Celsius). The reason could be clear skies over Delhi and partly cloudy skies over Shimla. Energy released by the earth during the night gets trapped between the clouds and the earth,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services. He said, “Once the western disturbances have passed the region, winds blowing over Delhi will change its direction back to northwesterly. But, around the New Year the temperatures will fall further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cold-wave-eases-in-delhi-light-rain-expected-after-christmas-101640199851318.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||South, Central districts adding most Covid-19 cases in Delhi||Four districts -- New Delhi, South East, South and South West -- reported nearly 70% of the fresh Covid-19 cases in Delhi in the two weeks ending December 19, according to a Delhi government analysis of district-wise distribution of cases.According to the data, the four districts accounted for 598 of the 910 cases reported in the last two weeks. Experts said the higher case load in these districts could be due to poorer prior exposure to the virus (as compared with the other districts) during the last two waves and of people from these areas possibly taking more international and inter-state trips.Districts such as North-east, East and Shahdara continue to report lower or declining cases, according to the analysis.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has called a high-level meeting on Thursday morning to review the city’s preparedness to tackle any outbreak of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2, and is likely to discuss issues related to hospital beds, oxygen availability, medicine stocks and home isolation facilities. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday directed police and district authorities to carry out raids to ensure restrictions on public gatherings, including on celebrations for Christmas and the New Year.Since December 1, active Covid cases in the Capital have more than doubled to 624. Delhi has reported 57 Omicron cases so far.The prevailing Covid situation of all districts was reviewed in a health department meeting on Tuesday where senior officials from the health department asked the districts to be ready to implement the Covid management plan in place during the fourth wave. The districts have also been asked to closely monitor the situation and increase testing, tracing and vaccination coverage.A study of the district-wise daily Covid case distribution from December 6 to 19, accessed by HT, shows that Covid caseloads increased by 93% in south-east district (from 43 to 83), 84.8% (33 to 61) in south-west, 81.7% (60 to 109) in south district and by 15.5% (91 to 112) in New Delhi. At 112, New Delhi has the most active cases (as of December 19) among all districts.In the same period, cases decreased in districts like East, Shahdara and North-east, which have higher population densities and more slums as well as unauthorised colonies.The number of new cases fell 65.7% -- from 35 to 12 -- in the East district during the two weeks. New cases also fell 50% each in North-east (down from 4 to 2) and Shahdara (20 to 10) districts.Some other districts have also reported an increase in cases but they have far less number of active cases as compared to the four districts seen as “areas of concern”.Cases increased from 21 to 34 in North district (61.9% rise); from 22 to 33 in North-west (50% hike); and from 28 to 41 in West district (46.4% increase). The total number of cases across all the districts increased 32.7% in the two-week period.In the second wave too, these districts were reporting more Covid cases and a higher number of containment zones as compared to the three with lower case trajectories at present.Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the districts reporting fewer Covid cases currently, reported a high infection rate during the first wave. “The first containment zone in Delhi was in Shahdara, followed by the East district. These are densely populated areas where infection spread quickly and people developed antibodies against coronavirus. Evidence has emerged that people who recover from mild Covid-19 develop antibodies which may last a lifetime,” Dr Rai told HT.Dr Rai added that a large number of people were infected with coronavirus and recovered without even realising that they got Covid: “It ultimately worked as a shield for them against Covid-19. It may be the reason behind these districts reporting lower cases even in the second wave.”Dr Suneela Garg, director-professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, said one of the reasons behind some districts reporting higher cases is the higher flow of international passengers to these districts. “Lack of proper masking and violations of Covid appropriate behaviour could also to blame,” she said.Meanwhile, officials said the districts reporting higher Covid cases have been put on alert. “One of the reasons behind New Delhi having higher cases is lack of clarity about the district boundaries in public. People living in Karol Bagh also write New Delhi as an address for tests. We have found several cases where positive persons belonging to neighbouring districts giving New Delhi as an address,” a district official, who did not want to be identified, said.Another official, who asked not to be named, said similar confusion existed in South and South-east districts. “People living in Kalkaji give South district as their address but Kalkaji actually comes under South-east,” the official said.A health department official said that the districts have been asked to increase random testing at crowded areas like markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/south-central-districts-adding-most-covid-cases-in-delhi-101640199848084.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||As temperatures dip, bonfires add to Delhi’s air pollution||As temperatures fall across north India, including Delhi, instances of open fires set by people in an attempt to keep warm has also started rising, prompting pollution control agencies in the Capital to direct municipal agencies to form special teams to keep a check on these fires, and limit its contribution to fouling up Delhi’s air.Senior officials of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said that it received 67 complaints of open burning between December 12 and 22 on the government’s Green Delhi app, as compared to 21 cases reported between December 1 and 10.Officials said though most of the cases were of garbage burning, instances of small localised fires to ward off the cold also featured in the list.Officials said these instances have increased especially over the last five-six days when temperatures across north India plunged, with many cities recording a cold wave.“Apart from the complaints that we are receiving, our own patrolling teams have also started noticing a rise in these local fires. As the temperatures are dropping, in many localities, people are lighting localised fires to keep themselves warm. While the intensity of these fires may be small, when the numbers increase, its impact on pollution increases,” said a senior DPCC official.The official said that along with their own patrolling teams, the municipal agencies in the city — North, South and East Delhi municipal corporations — have also been directed to keep a close watch on these fires.Officials said that the focus of prosecution is on large garbage fires, and that in cases of fires set by residents to keep themselves warm in the cold, authorities only resort to counselling and warnings, instead of fines.“These fires are usually set by people from poorer sections. They are either people who are on night shifts, like security guards etc, or the homeless people who do not have a roof over their heads. For them pollution is not a criterion,” the official said.Municipal agencies said that they have started night patrolling in localities.“Our special teams are keeping a close watch on these fires and putting it out. Since most of these fires are reported during the night, our teams are also conducting night patrols,” said Jogi Ram Jain, the chairperson of the North MCD standing committee.Enforcement agencies also pointed out that such fires can be controlled only with public cooperation.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials said that while the Supreme Court-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) lists giving heaters to security staff by individual house owners when the pollution levels peak to the ‘very poor’ levels during winter, it is a suggestion and cannot be imposed mandatorily.“We have been trying to get residents from upscale localities on board to get them to provide heaters so that these small fires can be stopped but we have not been able to get many on board with this. This is something that will have to be done by house owners. We can advise them but not force them,” a senior CPCB official said requesting anonymity.Aniket Aggarwal, president of the north Delhi residents welfare forum, said that they have been advising independent house owners to provide heating equipment to their staff, especially for those doing night shifts.“Many of our members have done this, but we cannot force anyone. In some areas, however, we have seen that despite being given heating equipment and blankets, they light fires because it helps them stay awake. More awareness campaigns will have to be conducted for house owners and staff alike,” he said.

A complaint was lodged by a 30-year-old employee of the company that took over the gold loan from another private financer. The loan was granted on March 25, according to the complainant. “We are checking if the earlier loan even existed or were the documents forged. The complainant is a loan manager in the current company and we are investigating all allegations in the complaint. So far it does not appear that the loan was paid to this company or the previous company,” said assistant inspector Umesh Londhe of Sahakrnagar police station who is investigating the case. The accused produced a receipt from a finance company claiming that the loan had already been granted once. The man then submitted 6 gold chains against which he took ₹5,77,966 loan which was transferred to his account. The gold was later found to be lesser than 18 carat as per the terms of the loan. A case under Section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Sahakarnagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gold-loan-firm-in-pune-defrauded-of-rs-5-77-lakh-101640199798072.html
23-12-2021||Noida||Noida: Veterans celebrate Vijay Diwas to commemorate Indian martyrs of 1971 war||Military veterans in Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday marked Vijay Diwas at the Shaheed Smarak in Noida’s Sector 29, a week after the event was observed across the country on December 16--the day it is usually observed every year--to honour the victory of the Indian armed forces over Pakistan in the 1971 war. Vice chief of the naval staff vice admiral S N Ghormande was the chief guest at the event, which paid homage to some 38 soldiers of Gautam Budh Nagar, who have been martyred in different wars. Some 40 people attended the event with strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “There was a wreath laying ceremony which was carried out with military precision and tri-service guards and buglers in attendance. The programme started at 10am and ran for an hour. The next of kin of those who died in the war, civil dignitaries, bureaucrats and school students were also present,” said Navy commodore(retd), Narinder Mahajan, a member of Noida Shaheed Smarak Sansthan (NSSS).Shaheed smarak was the only tri-services memorial in the country to honour soldiers killed in action before the National War Memorial was built at India Gate in 2019. The memorial in Noida was established on April 13, 2002. “The event reminds the families of martyrs that the sacrifices of their loved ones will never be forgotten and that the country will keep honouring them,” added Mahajan.The memorial has become an iconic landmark in Noida. Vintage equipment , such as 40 mm L 60 air defence guns, model of warship INS CHENNAI, naval surface-to-air missiles and an ISKRA jet trainer aircraft of Polish origin, are all part of the memorial.“It is an honour to pay homage to the valiant martyrs who have made the supreme sacrifice for the nation. I compliment the NSSS for maintaining this Smarak in a pristine and excellent manner that brings our community together,” said vice admiral Ghormande. Sanskruti Ghormande, wife of the vice-admiral, interacted and distributed gifts to the next of kin of the 38 martyrs.
23-12-2021||Delhi||Designated feeding spots latest sticking point in conflict over stray dogs||Delhi (like many metros) is divided over community dogs , and the July judgement of the Delhi High Court, which sought to strike a balance hasn’t really helped.In an 86-page judgement by Justice J R Midha, the HC established that citizens had a right to feed and dogs had a right to access food, but at the same time, the exercise should not cause inconvenience or infringe upon the rights of others.Sonya Ghosh, an animal activist, who has been designating feeding spots on behalf of the Animal Welfare Board of India or AWBI, says the 2021 order reiterates what a 2009 HC order did, the need to designate fixed feeding spots for community dogs so feeders and the general public will not come into a conflict.“This means the spots can only be fixed in corners or back lanes of colonies, areas that people do not frequent much and where the dogs will also not face any problems. This also reduces the number of people coming in contact with the dogs; those who generally feed the dogs also tend to sterilise them and ensure they are vaccinated, thereby ensuring no diseases are spread,” she adds.Ghosh, a resident of Vasant Kunj’s D-3 and D-4, has multiple feeding spots fixed in her own neighbourhood and says she has also fixed over 150 feeding spots in Delhi, since the 2009 judgement came out, but that even then, there is resistance from residents and resident welfare associations or RWAs.Many are opposed to multiple spots; some even want them to be fixed outside colony boundaries.“One or two spots are not enough in most cases as dogs are territorial and will fight amongst one another and not move large distances in a group. Therefore, spots to feed a small pack need to be fixed at multiple points,” explains Ghosh, who has successfully been able to fix spots in Vasant Kunj’s Sector A, pocket B&C, Sector B’s pockets 5&6, Sector D’s pockets 3&4, the Freedom Fighters Colony in Neb Sarai, in Malviya Nagar, two spots in Dwarka, Roop Nagar, Pusa institute, Khirki extension, Supreme enclave and Saket.Amongst the spots identified this year are those in Vasant Kunj’s E-2 block, but even there, feeders have faced stiff resistance from other residents. Urvashi Vashist, a resident, says there are 15 complaints currently registered in the local police station over physical attacks on feeders, but little action has been taken so far.“We thought the situation would improve once the feeding spots are fixed, but even then, there are residents who want the dogs to be fed outside the colony. Currently, we have five feeding spots fixed, but not all dogs can congregate at one spot and they also cannot move outside their territory,” says Vashisht.Delhi agencies do not maintain data on stray dogs; these are territorial, serve as guard dogs, and keep the rodent population down. But some are violent (sometimes because some residents abuse them) and bite passers by and young children. According to municipal data Delhi reported 31,913 dog bites this year so far, and most are by community dogs. These dogs can’t be exterminated (like some residents want to), or simply shipped out; there are legal restrictions against both. But voluntary animal groups in most neighbourhoods take care of them, sterilise them (ensuring their population remains low), and try and relocate violent community dogs in shelters -- usually at their own cost. But most neighbourhoods remain vertically split between dog lovers and dog haters, with even professionals and former bureaucrats thinking nothing of either using their influence or bribing corporation workers to relocate community dogs.Prachi Jain, assistant secretary at AWBI admits that few neighbourhoods directly approach them for assistance. “These are fixed when there is conflict and we are called in only when people require our intervention. In a lot of areas, residents fix a spot themselves and so there are many areas where residents have decided amongst themselves.”For instance, n Nizamuddin East, residents identified feeding spots themselves and placed boards identifying them as such. “One feeding spot was fixed by AWBI several years ago, but the remaining seven or eight spots have been fixed by us. Some dogs are territorial and will not go to these spots, but most follow a routine and now know which feeder will feed them when and where. This has reduced conflict to a large extent,” says Shobha Malhotra, a local resident.But not all RWAs are willing to adhere to the HC order.Dr. Sujit Kumar Dutta, Secretary, AWBI told HT he had to personally intervene in a conflict at the Amrapali Zodiac society in sector 120, Noida, where the RWA still refuses to allow feeding spots. “The HC judgement and the law are clear, but RWAs in cases are misusing this and not allowing spots to be fixed. Even we face resistance.”Nidha Sharma, a resident of east Kidwai Nagar cites similar issues, after she has been unable to get a spot fixed within the government colony she resides in, owing to the resistance from other residents.“The demands from some RWA members and residents are that the spots should be fixed outside the gates of the colony. It is not possible to take 50 dogs outside and feed them each time. Pet lovers have been feeding these dogs for years and also sterilise them, but we are not getting any support from others to get a designated feeding spot inside,” she says.Gauri Maulekhi, an animal activist and trustee at People for Animals (PFA) says while these points are not needed in all localities, AWBI should intervene swiftly in matters or areas where hostility is shown towards animals or caregivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/designated-feeding-spots-latest-sticking-point-in-conflict-over-stray-dogs-in-delhi-101640199788411.html
23-12-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad University begins search for Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Chair professor||Allahabad University (AU) would soon undertake researches in various aspects like political philosophy and integral humanism as defined by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, renowned social thinker and RSS ideologue. The varsity has started the process of the appointment of a professor for the Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Chair on its campus.“AU has started accepting applications and nominations from eminent social scientists, including academicians and scholars of outstanding track record in the designated areas of study for chair professor, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Chair,” informed AU PRO Prof Jaya Kapoor.The last date of applications reaching the office of the registrar, AU, is January 4, 2022, she added.The union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan had announced University Gants Commission’s (UGC) decision to set up this chair at AU during the central varsity’s convocation function on November 8. Once the chair professor gets appointed, he or she would engage in research, design and execute short-term capacity building programmes for teachers in higher education focussed towards the designated discipline of the chair. The professor would also publish articles and research papers besides reports, books and monographs on relevant topics besides participating in teaching and PhD programmes.In 2016, an expert committee of five members was formed by the UGC to examine establishing chairs in the name of eminent personalities. The committee of experts had recommended that Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Chair should be established by the commission to study his socio-economic thoughts and ‘Integral Humanism’. The commission bears all expenses for the chair. Already, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Chair has been set up in various varsities of the country, including the Central University of Jammu, Alagappa University in Tamil Nadu, Central University Himachal Pradesh, North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon in Maharashtra and Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.Pt Deendayal Upadhyay was a leading Indian philosopher, economist, sociologist, historian, journalist, and political scientist who gave the concept and developed the doctrine of integral humanism. According to Upadhyay humankind had four hierarchically organised attributes of body, mind, intellect and soul which corresponded to four universal objectives— Kama (desire), Artha (wealth), Dharma (moral duties) and Moksha (total liberation or ‘salvation’). Dharma is the basic, while Moksha is the ultimate objective of humankind and society. Dharma is the thread bear that abides ‘Kama’ and ‘Artha’ for the supreme goal of human life ‘Moksha’. This Chatushtya Purusharth, rooted in ancient Indian culture, are integrated and not disgruntled or conflicting like the western ideology of capitalism and communism. Deendayal’s idea of ‘Integral Humanism’ many believe can ensure holistic and sustainable development of the society that paves the way to happiness and peace at the individual, social, national and global level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-university-begins-search-for-pt-deen-dayal-upadhyay-chair-professor-101640199731597.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest 2 behind online Voter ID racket||Delhi Police busted a gang running a fake website voteridcard.ebharatseva.in and arrested two persons who allegedly masterminded the fraud in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday.Police said that the men established an online network in India to lure gullible people into applying for a voter ID. After the initial enrolment, they would charge ₹650 from each applicant. Police said the men managed to cheat over 10,000 people till date.Police said they formed a team to crack the case after a few complaints reached the Kamla Market police station. One of the complainants told police he wanted a few details changed in his Voter ID card, and found the website voteridcard.ebharatseva.in.He said that when he opened the website and filled in the application, he was directed to a payment gateway asking for ₹650 as mandatory charges. After making the payment, he received emails from info@ebharatseva.in and no-reply@razorpay.com, stating that the payment was successful and his application would be processed, after which an executive would contact him.However, when there was no further response, the complainant got suspicious and found that the official website of Election Commission of India is voterportal.eci.gov.in. The complainant then realised he was a victim of cyber fraud.DCP (central) Shweta Chauhan said, “During investigation we found the payment was processed through Razorpay payment gateway and credited on an account registered in the name of Titu Cyber Cafe. The proprietor was identified as one Manmohan Singh. During interrogation, he confessed his involvement and disclosed the complicity of his accomplice Ankit Kumar Pal. Both men belong to UP.” “The bank accounts of the suspects are being verified. We are making efforts to trace the other suspects involved in this case,” added the DCP.Police said the men also promoted their site on Google Ads. Police said that Pal has a diploma in electronics from Amroha, UP. He told them he met his accomplices while working at a BPO. He also said the same gang runs fake websites for HSRP, driving licences, food licences, and Fast Tag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-2-behind-online-voter-idracket-101640199730239.html
23-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC spent less than half of its capital budget in past 8 months||Mumbai In eight months since the financial year 2021 started, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has spent less than half of its capital budget outlay 2021 aimed at creating or repairing civic infrastructure in the city, data from the civic body has revealed. Until November 30, 2021, the civic body has spent 40.7% of its capital budget outlay of ₹18,750.99 crore for the year 2021-22. This amounts to a total expenditure of ₹7,629.33 crore on projects of civil works across departments such as Coastal Road, Roads and traffic, bridges, solid waste management, stormwater drains, health, and primary education infrastructure.This comes in the fifth year of the ruling Shiv Sena’s tenure in the BMC and municipal elections are scheduled to take place in early 2022. The capital budget is a part of the annual budget and is the money allotted for construction or repairs or the upgradation of civic development works in the city. The highest expenditure from its capital budget has been for the ongoing Coastal Road project, where BMC has spent 96% or ₹1,920.67 crore, out of its estimates of ₹2,000 crore for the year 2021-22. The construction cost of the Coastal Road project is pegged at ₹8,429 crore, and the total cost of the Coastal Road project is estimated to be ₹12,700 crore, according to the civic body. A little over 41% of the Coastal Road project work was completed until November this year, and the civic body aims to complete it by November 2023.For the sewage project departments including the upgradation of the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), none of the allotted amounts of ₹1,339.94 crore has been spent yet, data has revealed.Other departments which have utilised the most of their capital budget outlay 2021-22 are the roads and traffic department, which has used up 86.7%% or ₹1,185.89 crore of its capital outlay of ₹1,367 crore; the stormwater drains department has used 56.5% or ₹556.7 crore of its capital budget outlay of ₹985.06 crore; and the bridges department has used up 55.7% or ₹462.21 crore of its allotment of ₹830.1 crore.Elected representatives in the civic body have criticised the administration for inadequate work done in the financial year 2021-22. Ravi Raja, leader of the opposition in the BMC, said, “All the departments where expenditure is considerably higher, is due to money disbursed toward last year’s projects. No actual new work has been initiated on ground in 2021-22. If we are to examine the expenditure in detail, we will find actual new works do not amount to more than 20-30% of the planned expenditure. The last six-seven months have not seen a strict lockdown due to the pandemic, so work could have been initiated.”Kishori Pednekar, Mumbai mayor said, “The civic budget has been utilised aptly, and no compromise is done on development work in the city. The most important departments, such as roads, health, water, have seen fast progress of work. Coastal Road work has also progressed very fast. All of this work has progressed during a pandemic, under various departments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-spent-less-than-half-of-its-capital-budget-in-past-8-months-101640199726803.html
23-12-2021||Delhi||Corruption allegations by deputy CM Sisodia baseless: North MCD mayor||Senior functionaries of North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s allegations regarding the misappropriation of funds by Delhi’s municipal corporations are false and the civic body has approached the court to get its dues in tax share, which has not yet been released by the Delhi government. Mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said that earlier spokespersons of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would make allegations against the civic body, but a person holding a constitutional post should not make false allegations without getting their facts right. “We are open to debate in any public forum regarding the outstanding funds of the corporation,” he added.Singh claimed that the Delhi government owes ₹660.68 crore under the plan head for the last three years while ₹328.60 crore is pending for the current year. “This year, the government has not released the due funds -- ₹145.70 crore--for basic tax assignment, ₹45.70 crore for urban development and ₹137.20 crore for education. The government is not releasing the outstanding funds so as to paralyse the corporation financially,” he alleged.Sisodia on Monday said the Delhi government owes no dues to the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations, and added that despite the government disbursing ₹2,588 crore this year, the civic bodies failed to pay salaries to their employees. He alleged the MCD is being hollowed out because of rampant corruption.Chairman of the standing committee Jogi Ram Jain said that even the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi wrote to the Delhi government for the disbursal of outstanding funds, but since no money seems forthcoming, the corporation has filed a court case to get its dues. “The AAP is accusing us of ₹2,500 crore rent scam. It has been made clear several times that the standing committee had decided to take the rent from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Rupees 2,500 crore was shown in its budget provisions too,” he added. Jain clarified that the Biomining trommel machines at Bhalswa landfill site have not been hired at ₹18.5 lakh and the municipal corporation is paying ₹306 per metric ton, which includes manpower. “AAP is deliberately misleading citizens by saying a scam has taken place in Biomining. These are possibly the lowest rates in biomining all across the country,” he added. Similarly, he said, the reserve price for the Shalimar Bagh multilevel parking lot has been kept at ₹126 crore, which is higher than the circle rate.“How can there be a scam in open bidding process? Can the rate of land at Shalimar Bagh be ₹1 crore per sqm? These are absurd allegations,” he added. Leader of the House Chhail Bihari Goswami said that senior municipal functionaries also protested for 13 days at the chief minister’s residence for outstanding funds but he did not discuss the issue even once with them. “Allegations made by the Aam Aadmi Party regarding the sterilisation of dogs are false. The North MCD has to pay ₹1.98 crore for the year 2020 and ₹1.28 crore for the year 2021 to the NGO for dog sterilisation, which is still pending. No funds have been released so how can a ₹15 crore scam take place?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/corruption-allegations-by-deputy-cm-sisodia-baseless-north-mcd-mayor-101640199725445.html

Five other countries, along with the United States, have already announced a diplomatic boycott of the games to protest against China's human rights abuses.Meanwhile, China continues to deny accusations of forced labour or percussion of minority communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-imports-from-china-s-xinjiang-into-law-101640277968830.html
23-12-2021||World||Airlines face uncertain winter as Omicron stalls travel rebound||Airlines face an uncertain few weeks as the spread of the omicron coronavirus variant upends what’s traditionally one of the busiest periods of the year for flight sales. Ryanair Holdings Plc slashed its earnings guidance Wednesday as travel restrictions related to the strain weakened Christmas and New Year bookings. Other carriers will likely be assessing their capacity plans, according to Bernstein analyst Alex Irving. “Ryanair, EasyJet and Wizz Air all operate in broadly the same market,” he said. “It’s highly unlikely the same pressures affecting Ryanair aren’t hitting other airlines.”Although airline stocks rallied Thursday following reports that omicron is likely not as severe as previous iterations, countries across Europe are bringing back travel restrictions and even lockdowns. Britain is battling record daily case numbers and France and Germany’s ban on U.K. travellers was part of the reason for Ryanair’s gloom.While Ryanair opted to update the market, other carriers may hold off until they report their next set of financial results, Irving said. In the meantime, close-in bookings are likely to be particularly impacted as people postpone trips.The latest variant has disrupted a nascent travel recovery that began in summer when Europe responded to a successful Covid-19 vaccine rollout by reopening borders and transatlantic travel resumed. Carriers had added capacity for the winter months, betting on pent-up demand in what’s traditionally a slower season for flights. The outlook for next year is still hard to assess, according to Irving, with everything dependent on how serious the omicron variant turns out to be. If it’s less dangerous than delta, as has been suggested by reports out of South Africa, travel bookings could bounce back quickly as governments relax restrictions. In the short term, bookings for Christmas may hold up despite the headlines as people prioritize seeing friends and family or take long-awaited holidays. Airport trade body ACI Europe said Thursday the omicron impact on European passenger traffic has been “immediate and substantial,” reporting a 20% fall in the three weeks starting Nov. 24.

Other domestic issues also stirred the discontent.Six Chinese police liaison officers will equip and train the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, a statement from the Solomon Islands government said.The Chinese equipment includes shields, helmets, batons and "other non-lethal gears that will further enhance Solomon Islands Police ability in confronting future threats", the statement said.Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press conference in Beijing: "China firmly supports the Solomon Islands government in safeguarding its domestic stability, bilateral ties and the rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Solomon Islands."Sogavare has blamed "agents of Taiwan" in Malaita province for the protests, in which dozens of buildings were torched in the Chinatown district of Honiara and shops looted, after the premier refused to speak with protesters.Taiwan has denied any involvement in the unrest.China claims the democratically governed island of Taiwan as its own territory and has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claims, fuelling anger in Taipei and deep concern in the United States.To counter China's expanding interests in the Indo-Pacific region, Australia has ramped up its presence in the Pacific via its membership of the "Quad" group, together with the United States, India and Japan.Around 200 police and soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea arrived in the Solomons capital Honiara within days of the riots, at Sogavare's request.Some Australian soldiers who had been deployed in Honiara began returning home on Thursday.Australia has a bilateral security agreement with the Solomon Islands. Australian police were previously deployed there in 2003 under a regional peacekeeping mission and stayed for a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-police-advisers-to-solomon-islands-101640261795644.html
23-12-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson to hold next Covid update until after Christmas||Boris Johnson will wait until after Christmas to announce any new curbs to tackle the omicron Covid-19 strain, which has already pushed daily cases to a record daily level above 100,000.Any announcement will not come until the week after Christmas, people familiar with the matter said Thursday, when the government will give a Covid-19 update regardless of whether Johnson decides to introduce new restrictions.It means Johnson is diverging from the UK’s other devolved administrations over how to manage the pandemic. The prime minister, who oversees health policy only for England, has already promised he won’t tighten rules on hospitality and household mixing before Christmas but has left open the possibility of doing so after Dec 25.Governments across Europe, including in the UK, have already been forced to take steps to control the latest wave of coronavirus infections. The crisis has escalated with the emergence of the fast-spreading omicron variant.But Johnson faces a dilemma over whether to take further action after more than 100 of his ruling Conservative Party’s members of Parliament rebelled over the light-touch measures he has already introduced.They are likely to seize on two studies published Wednesday showing people contracting the new variant are less likely to need hospital treatment as proof more curbs are not needed.Risky dilemmaOn the flipside, his scientific advisers have warned that earlier action would help squash the growing wave and reduce pressure on the National Health Service. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, told BBC radio on Thursday that hospitals are under “incredible pressure” and that omicron poses a threat even if it is less severe due to the sheer volume of infections.“These are unprecedented levels of infection,” Paul Elliott, chair in epidemiology and public health medicine at Imperial College London, told Sky News on Thursday. “Even though a smaller proportion might get severe disease or go into hospital, that could still result in many cases and, of course, that could give pressure on the health service.”The spread of omicron is also affecting NHS staff, with absences due to Covid surging in London, the epicenter of the outbreak.Meanwhile the UK’s devolved administrations have decided the latest coronavirus wave is dangerous enough to change the rules. Wales on Wednesday announced new curbs starting Dec 26, including limiting gatherings to six people in hospitality and cinemas, mandating table service only in pubs and restaurants, and bringing in capacity limits on large events.Scotland from Dec 26 is limiting attendances at large events, and from Dec 27 it’s bringing in 1 meter of social distancing between adults in indoor hospitality and leisure settings from Dec. 27, and introducing mandatory table service in settings where alcohol is served.  And Northern Ireland is banning indoor standing events from Dec 26, and limiting gatherings in private homes and the size of groups in hospitality settings from Dec 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-to-hold-next-covid-update-until-after-christmas-101640260681887.html

23-12-2021||World||China’s Xian locks down its 13 million residents as Covid cases mount||The city of Xian in northwest China’s Shaanxi province with some 13 million residents went into a lockdown on Thursday following the detection of 234 Covid-19 cases since December 9.All residents have been ordered to stay indoors, communities have been put under “closed management”, and outgoing transport including trains and flights have been cancelled, health authorities said on Thursday as the city started the third round of nucleic acid testing for all residents.Thousands of contacts have been moved to centralised quarantine and put under observation.Starting Thursday, only one family member of each household is allowed to leave the house to purchase daily necessities every two days, city health authorities said.The city, known for the Terracotta Army historical site, has suspended long-distance bus services and banned taxis and cars hired on ride-hailing platforms for trips out of town.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases at 234 is low for a big city but given China’s “zero-Covid” policy, the lockdown is likely to be strictly implemented.City authorities directed movie theatres to suspend operations and prohibited dining in at restaurants; large-scale events have been banned and schools have either shut or moved classes online.Yang Zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the tabloid Global Times the key reason for the lockdown “lies in the scale of community transmission in Xian and unclear epidemiological routes - the outbreak has demonstrated at least three transmission chains”. No infection caused by the Omicron variant has been detected in Xian.The local outbreak, according to the tabloid, has spilled over to at least four other cities, including Yanan and Xianyang in Shaanxi province, Dongguan in south China’s Guangdong province, and Beijing. The Chinese mainland on Wednesday reported 71 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the national health commission said in its daily report on Thursday.Of the new local cases, 63 were reported in Shaanxi, four in Guangxi, two in Henan, and one each in Zhejiang and Guangdong, the commission said.As many as 29 new imported cases in nine provincial-level regions were detected, according to the commission.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 100,644 by Wednesday, including 1,823 patients still receiving treatment, of whom 10 were in severe conditions, official news agency Xinhua reported, adding that the death toll remains at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xian-locks-down-its-13-million-residents-as-covid-cases-mount-101640257632230.html
23-12-2021||World||Omicron variant has 37 spike protein mutations: Canadian study||Canadian researchers on Wednesday revealed, what they say, is the first molecular structural analysis of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the country which has shown that it has three to five times more mutations in its spike protein than any previous variant.A near atomic resolution analysis of the variant using a cryo-electron microscope, “reveals how the heavily mutated variant infects human cells and is highly evasive of immunity,” the Canadian researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC), which conducted the study, said.Dr Subramaniam, a professor in the faculty of medicine’s department of biochemistry and molecular biology who led the study, described Omicron having 37 spike protein mutations as “unprecedented”.“This is important for two reasons. Firstly, because the spike protein is how the virus attaches to and infects human cells. Secondly, because antibodies attach to the spike protein in order to neutralize the virus. Therefore, small mutations on the spike protein have potentially big implications for how the virus is transmitted, how our body fights it off, and the effectiveness of treatments,” he said.The pre-publication study at bioRxiv noted the Delta variant had seven mutations in the spike protein and had only two in common with Omicron. “Analysis of the sequence of the Omicron genome suggests that it is not derived from any of the currently circulating variants, and may have a different origin,” the Canadian study stated.“Our experiments confirm what we’re seeing in the real world — that the Omicron spike protein is far better than other variants at evading monoclonal antibodies that are commonly used as treatments, as well as at evading the immunity produced by both vaccines and natural infection,” Dr Subramanian said. It was, however, less evasive of immunity created by vaccines than that produced through natural infection.“Sera from convalescent patients shows an even greater drop in neutralization potency relative to the Delta variant (8.2x decrease) while the vaccinated group also shows reduction in potency, although to a lesser extent (3.4x decrease),” the study said.This point was also stressed upon by Dr Subramaniam, as he said, “This suggests that vaccination remains our best defence against the Omicron variant.”

Washington has barred imports of goods from Xinjiang over complaints of mass detentions, forced abortions and forced labor, which Beijing denies.Tension over Xinjiang is rising as activists call for a boycott of February’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, a prestige project for the ruling party. The White House says the United States won’t send dignitaries. Beijing on Wednesday barred four members of a U.S. government religious freedom panel from China in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Washington on two Xinjiang leaders.“So-called forced labor and other allegations on Xinjiang are completely lies concocted by anti-China forces,” said a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian. He called on Intel to “respect facts and tell right from wrong.”Some commenters online, where comments the ruling party doesn't want are deleted by censors, called for a boycott of Intel products.Intel processor chips are used in smartphones, computers and other products.The letter caused “concerns among our cherished Chinese partners, which we deeply regret,” said an Intel statement.“We apologize for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,” the company said.Other companies including retailer H&M and shoe brand Nike have been targeted for criticism and calls for boycotts after expressing concern about Xinjiang or saying they would stop using materials produced there.The Chinese government rejects complaints of abuses in Xinjiang, but companies say they are unable to carry out independent audits of factories and other workplaces.Pop singer Wang Junkai, also known as Karry Wang, announced Wednesday he was pulling out of a deal to act as “brand ambassador” for Intel’s Core line of processor chips.Wang’s move is a “fresh warning siren to Intel and other foreign companies that seek to undermine China’s core interests while also trying to profit from the vast Chinese market,” said Global Times, which is known for its nationalistic tone.Other singers, actors and other celebrities have broken ties with foreign brands that were targeted for criticism over Xinjiang, giving up millions of dollars in income to protect their careers from official retaliation.Xinjiang is a major supplier of silica used in making computer chips. Intel has a chip factory in Dalian in China’s northeast — its only one in Asia and one of four outside the United States. The company also has a research facility in Beijing.Criticism by state media might prompt consumers to look at products based on chips from other suppliers. But there are few alternatives. The include Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of the United States for chips in desktop PCs and servers and Britain's Arm Ltd. for smartphones.The Communist Party has spent billions of dollars to build a Chinese chip industry and reduce reliance on the United States, Taiwan and other suppliers. But its manufacturers are far from achieving the level of precision required for the most advanced chips from Intel and other global suppliers.Intel, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, reported 2020 profits of $23.7 billion on sales of $77.9 billion.Smartphones and other products are designed to work with the characteristics of a specific chip from one supplier. Switching would require a design overhaul and testing.Trying to switch to alternate suppliers would be especially hard and costly at a time when a global shortage of chips due to the coronavirus pandemic is disrupting production of products from smartphones to cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intel-apologizes-for-asking-suppliers-to-avoid-xinjiang-101640253679302.html

This grant will go a long way in bringing to life the first-ever museum in the US dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi,” Kothari explained.EGMH has acquired 3 acres of land in southwest Houston to house the museum. The proposed budget for construction is USD 6.5 million.The proceeds from the capital campaign have touched USD 2.9 million, with the board of trustees committing another USD 1.1 million.The trust has also secured another USD 0.8 million from private donor commitments.Recently, the Houston Endowment Foundation also awarded a capital grant of USD 500,000.A concerted fundraising campaign is currently underway through foundations, corporations and private donors to raise the remaining amount.To initiate this project, the EGMH board has also engaged with a reputed museum consultant, with a Smithsonian background.The museum will also include exhibits and interpretations that highlight the mission and vision of Mahatma Gandhi.Additional consultants engaged for this project include a design and build museum firm, architect and an education consultant."The museum will invite Houston and school children from surrounding areas for a field trip for free.The EGMH will be an interactive museum divided into three sections: ‘His Journey’ (Mahatma Gandhi’s Life), ‘Our Journey’ (Impact of Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy of nonviolent conflict resolution in the world featuring, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela and others around the world, and finally ‘My Journey’ where each visitor will be asked to make a commitment to make the community a better place to live in,” Kothari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eternal-gandhi-museum-in-houston-gets-grant-of-usd-457-000-from-fort-bend-county-101640253682356.html

Shringla, on a two-day working visit to Myanmar, met the State Administrative Council chairman, Gen Min Aung Hlaing, who has ruled the country since he seized power in a coup on February 1, and representatives of civil society and the opposition, including the National League for Democracy. The restoration of democracy and a complete end to violence figured in all these meetings, the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Shringla also pointedly raised matters related to India’s security, especially in light of the ambush on an Assam Rifles convoy in Manipur’s Churachandpur district on November 13 that killed Col Viplav Tripathi, his wife and six-year-old son. The Indian side has for long sought to strike a balance between backing the democratic process in Myanmar and maintaining cooperation with the military, mainly to contain the activities of insurgent groups from northeastern states that have bases in the neighbouring country. Also Read: Myanmar hands over 5 RPF militants to Manipur Police: Report“During his meetings with all concerned, the foreign secretary emphasised India’s interest in seeing Myanmar’s return to democracy at the earliest; release of detainees and prisoners; resolution of issues through dialogue; and complete cessation of all violence,” the statement said. Shringla reiterated India’s “strong and consistent” support to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (Asean) initiative on Myanmar and expressed the hope that progress will be made in a “pragmatic and constructive manner” on the grouping’s five-point consensus. The external affairs ministry said India has been involved in the democratic transition in Myanmar and has worked with various stakeholders in developing capacities for democratic systems and practices. “India proposes to renew these efforts for Myanmar to emerge as a stable, democratic, federal union in accordance with the wishes of the people of Myanmar,” the statement said. The visit was also an opportunity to “raise matters relating to India’s security, especially in the light of the recent incident in Churachandpur district in southern Manipur”, the statement said, referring to the recent ambush that has been blamed on the militant groups People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) and People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Shringla “stressed the need to put an end to any violence and maintain peace and stability in the border areas”, the statement said. “Both sides reiterated their commitment to ensure that their respective territories would not be allowed to be used for any activities inimical to the other,” it added. Any developments in Myanmar “have a direct impact on India’s bordering regions”, and peace and stability in Myanmar “remain of utmost importance to India, specifically to its northeastern region”, the statement said. Experts believe the instability in Myanmar’s border regions, especially the spike in activities of armed pro-democracy groups, has allowed anti-India insurgent groups to step up their activities in Nagaland and Manipur. The security situation has been further complicated by some 15,000 people fleeing Myanmar to take refuge in the northeastern states. While pointing to nearly 1,700km border that India shares with Myanmar, Shringla conveyed India’s continued humanitarian support for the people of Myanmar. He handed over one million doses of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines to the Myanmar Red Cross Society. Part of this consignment will be used for communities living along Myanmar’s border with India. A grant of 10,000 tonnes of rice and wheat for Myanmar was also announced by the Indian side. The foreign secretary also expressed India’s continued support for socioeconomic developmental projects, including those in the India-Myanmar border areas, and commitment to the speedy implementation of connectivity initiatives such as the Kaladan multimodal transit transport project, which will link Sittwe port in Rakhine state to Kolkata port and the Trilateral Highway between India, Myanmar and Thailand. Shringla reiterated India’s commitment to continue with projects under the Rakhine State Development Programme and Border Area Development Programme. Besides senior representatives of the military junta and political parties, Shringla was also scheduled to meet Myanmar-based ambassadors and representatives of the UN.

Before the latest round, Apple shut and reopened eight additional locations, including stores in Texas, Maryland, Hawaii, Ohio, and Ottawa. The closures typically lasted a few days each. A ninth closed store -- Lincoln Road in Miami Beach -- remains shut. In August, Apple also temporarily closed a location in Charleston, South Carolina.“We regularly monitor conditions, and we will adjust our health measures to support the well-being of customers and employees,” Apple said in a statement. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning, and paid sick leave.”Apple has previously said that all its workers are tested regularly and that it only reopens stores once each employee is tested again. As Covid-19 case numbers and the omicron variant surge across the world, Apple has started to limit occupancy inside its retail stores to promote social distancing. It has also restored its mask mandate across all U.S. stores and has once again put in plexiglass dividers to protect employees. At the same time, Apple added an incentive to order online. On Wednesday, the company rolled out free two-hour delivery for its products in “most metro areas.” The deal runs through Dec. 24.

This did not include cases from the Northwest Territories, meaning that the total could be higher. The previous record high was 13,670 cases reported on December 28 last year, according to Esri Canada.The spiralling caseload is likely driven by the new more transmissible Omicron variant of Covid-19, and health authorities have already confirmed that community transmission of the variant has started in Canada.“In less than a week, we’ve seen a rapid acceleration of epidemic activity in locations across Canada. While Delta is still spreading in many areas, Omicron is increasingly responsible for rapidly rising case counts,” Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said late Wednesday.“Modelling shows that by the beginning of January, we could have a very high number of cases, which underscores the need to act urgently to reduce the acceleration,” Tam added.The current surge in cases includes record daily highs being reported from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia.

Li also met with North Korean premier Kim Tok Hun, KCNA reported."Kim Jong Un highly praised the ambassador for successfully assisting several DPRK-China summit meetings over the past seven years, making much effort to develop the friendly relations between the two parties and the two countries and sharing bitters and sweets with the Korean people," Choe told Li, using the initials of North Korea's official name.Kim is very satisfied that the North Korea-China relationship has entered a "fresh heyday" under the leadership of the ruling parties in each country, Choe said.Li asked Choe to express his gratitude to Kim and congratulated the North Korean people on "making progress in all fields of socialist construction," KCNA said.China has been North Korea's only major ally since the two signed a treaty in 1961, and international sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes have made it more dependent than ever on Beijing for trade and other support.Since Li was appointed in 2015, relations between the two countries have seen major ups and downs.Kim sent China-North Korea relations to a historical low by prioritising nuclear weapons and missiles development, then harshly criticising Beijing when it supported international sanctionsStarting in 2018, however, Kim managed to quickly repair ties and made his first known international trip as leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Xi later visited Pyongyang, the first by a Chinese leader in 14 years.Li was one of a diminishing number of foreign diplomats in Pyongyang, as many embassies closed during North Korea's strict anti-pandemic lockdown that blocked the rotation of new staff or ambassadors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-praises-outgoing-chinese-envoy-li-jinjun-101640241885018.html

23-12-2021||World||Omicron: Doctor reveals 'telltale sign at night' to confirm presence of variant||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has left the world on tenterhooks, rapidly spreading across the globe and starting the surge on Covid-19 infections. The variant is highly mutated and believed to show a higher resistance to vaccines.There are also worries about the effects of the new variant on human bodies. Since Omicron is a relatively new strain, research is still on to fully understand its behaviour.So far, the results have shown that this new strain causes less severe Covid-19 symptoms, compared to early variants of the virus. Two more studies from Britain published on Wednesday showed that Covid infections with Omicron are less likely to result in hospitalisation compared to the Delta variant.But a doctor in the United Kingdom has revealed a new Covid-19 symptom caused by the Omicron variant - really bad night sweats.Dr Amir Khan, a physician with the UK’s National Health Service, told The Sun last week about the "telltale sign" - the sweats which are "those kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes”.This is apart from scratchy throat, mild muscle aches, extreme tiredness and dry cough reported earlier to be associated with the Omicron variant.Data coming out from South Africa, where the Omicron was first detected, shows that lower back pain could be another symptom.Dr Ryan Noach, the CEO of South Africa-based Discovery Health, recently said that the most common early sign was a scratchy throat and most of these symptoms are mild.The Omicron variant has been wreaking havoc in the United Kingdom, which reported 100,000 new daily cases for the first time on Wednesday. The United States is also battered by the fresh wave of infection, triggered by Omicron.On Wednesday, the US authorised Pfizer's anti-Covid pill for high-risk people aged 12 and above. Paxlovid, which comprises two types of tablets, was granted an emergency use authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after a clinical trial showed it to reduce the risk of hospitalisations and deaths among at-risk people by 88 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-doctor-reveals-telltale-sign-at-night-to-confirm-presence-of-variant-101640231352885.html
23-12-2021||World||Hong Kong university dismantles and removes Tiananmen statue from campus||A leading Hong Kong university has dismantled and removed a statue from its campus site that for more than two decades has commemorated pro-democracy protesters killed during China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The artwork, of anguished human torsos, is one of the few remaining public memorials in the former British colony to remember the bloody crackdown that is a taboo topic in mainland China, where it cannot be publicly commemorated.Known as the "Pillar of Shame," the statue was a key symbol of the wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong at its 1997 return to Chinese rule.The city has traditionally held the largest annual vigils in the world to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown.The Council of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) said in an early Thursday statement it made the decision to remove the statue during a Wednesday meeting, "based on external legal advice and risk assessment for the best interest of the University"."The HKU Council has requested that the statue be put in storage and that the University should continue to seek legal advice on any appropriate follow-up action," it said.Late on Wednesday night, security guards placed yellow barricades around the eight-meter (26-foot) high, two-tonne copper sculpture.Two Reuters journalists saw scores of workmen in yellow hard hats enter the statue site, which had been draped on all sides by white plastic sheeting and was being guarded by dozens of security personnel.Loud noises from power tools and chains emanated from the closed-off area for several hours before workmen were seen carrying out the top half of the statue and winching it up on a crane towards a waiting shipping container.A truck later drove the container away early on Thursday. The site of the statue was covered in white plastic sheets and surrounded by yellow barricades. University staff later placed pots of Poinsettia flowers, a popular Christmas decoration in Hong Kong, around the barricades.Several months ago, the university had sent a legal letter to the custodians of the statue asking for its removal.Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot, who created the statue, said in a statement he was "totally shocked" and that he would "claim compensation for any damage" to his private property.Galschiot, who values the statue at around $1.4 million, had offered to take it back to Denmark but said his presence in Hong Kong was necessary for the complex operation to go well and asked for reassurances he would not be prosecuted.HKU said in its statement that no party had ever obtained approval to display the statue on its campus and that it had the right to take "appropriate actions" at any time. It also called the statue "fragile" and said it posed "potential safety issues."The campus was quiet early on Thursday, with students on holiday. Some students dropped by the campus overnight after hearing the news."The university is a coward to do this at midnight," said a 19-year-old student surnamed Chan. "I feel very disappointed as it's a symbol of history."Another student surnamed Leung said he was "heartbroken" to see the statue "being cut into pieces".The removal of the statue is the latest step targeting people or organisations affiliated with the sensitive June 4, 1989, date and events to mark it.Authorities have been clamping down in Hong Kong under a China-imposed national security law that human rights activists say is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners, and curb basic freedoms.Authorities say the law has restored order and stability after massive street protests in 2019. They insist freedom of speech and other rights remain intact and that prosecutions are not political.China has never provided a full account of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Officials gave a death toll of about 300, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands may have been killed."What the Communist Party wants is for all of us to just forget about this (Tiananmen). It's very unfortunate," John Burns, a political scientist at the university for over 40 years who had called for the statue to remain, told Reuters."They would like it globally to be forgotten."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-university-dismantles-and-removes-tiananmen-statue-from-campus-101640230784271.html
23-12-2021||World||Is Omicron the final wave of coronavirus? Read experts' predictions about future||Since the emergence of Omicron variant of coronavirus, the world has been wary of opening up and allowing normal activities to resume. The new strain is believed to be highly transmissible and resistant to vaccines.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has brought the world to a standstill and again threatens to scuttle the holiday plans this year. The health experts have been studying the behaviour of the Omicron variant to develop new vaccines, or booster shots, for better protection of people.But will Covid-19 end after Omicron? And how will the virus behave in the next few months? Some recent comments from leading health experts have given a perspective.On Sunday, Dr Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, appeared on CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’ where he said that Omicron will only be a “temporary incident” on the road back to normality.“I think people are really tired of living diminished lives from Covid generally. And you're seeing that in terms of what people are doing. They're reengaging activity that we know are going to be conducive to the spread of this virus. Omicron really has thrown a curveball here. I think that this is a temporary incident,” Dr Gottlieb said.He, however, warned that Omicron will “blow through” the US population very quickly. This happened last week when Omicron dethroned Delta to become the dominant coronavirus variant in the US, accounting for 73 per cent of new Covid-19 cases in the country last week.On Friday, executives of pharmaceutical major Pfizer, told CNBC that coronavirus will become endemic. “We believe Covid will transition to an endemic state, potentially by 2024,” said Nanette Cocero, global president of Pfizer Vaccines.The company’s chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten added that the emergence of new variants could also impact how the pandemic continues to play out.Omicron was first detected in South Africa on November 24. Since then, the variant has affected people in more than 100 countries. In India, the Omicron tally has crossed 200-mark, with Delhi and Maharashtra being the largest contributors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-omicron-the-final-wave-of-coronavirus-read-experts-predictions-about-future-101640228453126.html
23-12-2021||World||New daily cases top 100,000 in UK as Omicron surges||British regulators on Wednesday approved Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for use in children aged five to 11, as the country reported more than 100,000 new daily cases for the first time as Omicron surged.The developments came after the government said it was cutting the isolation period required for positive cases while Wales and Northern Ireland followed Scotland in unveiling new post-Christmas curbs, primarily around hospitality and large events.Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had approved a new lower-dose formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot after finding it was "safe and effective" for children aged five to 11.MHRA chief executive June Raine said there was "robust evidence to support a positive benefit risk for children in this age group".The "overwhelming majority" of reported side-effects from the two-shot "age-appropriate" jab related to mild symptoms, such as a sore arm or a flu-like illness, she added.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments on immunisation, said it was now recommending a primary course of the vaccination be offered to some within the age group.Britain is in the midst of a stepped-up booster campaign, as it tries to minimise the impact of weeks of rising Omicron infections.On Wednesday the country surpassed 30 million third doses administered as it aims to offer the additional jab to all adults before the end of the year.Record infectionsThe variant is now the dominant strain of the virus across the UK -- already one of the hardest hit in Europe, with a death toll of nearly 148,000 -- as daily cases reach record levels.It announced 106,122 new infections Wednesday, the highest figure since mass testing began in the summer of last year.Earlier, the government said people who have tested positive can stop self-isolating after seven days instead of 10 if they have taken two negative lateral flow tests.Amid the skyrocketing case numbers, it could potentially allow many more to join family Christmas celebrations.Hours later, devolved governments in Cardiff and Belfast announced new curbs from December 26 -- leaving just England with no imminent restrictions unveiled.In Wales, socialising in pubs, cinemas and restaurants will be limited to groups of six people or less, while mandatory table service and providing contract tracing details will return.In Northern Ireland, nightclubs will have to close at 8 pm, alongside guidance to limit contacts with different households.It follows Scotland announcing renewed rules there Tuesday, which also come into force on December 26 for at least three weeks, and cap attendance at outdoor events at 500.The move means the pandemic has forced the cancellation of Edinburgh's hugely popular New Year's Eve street party for the second successive year.Antiviral drugs dealHowever, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has resisted calls to impose stricter rules in England over Christmas.The embattled leader, reeling from weeks of scandals and setbacks -- plus growing discontent in his own party -- has said he wants more evidence on Omicron's severity and ability to evade vaccines.Meanwhile his government has signed deals to buy more than 4 million courses of two new antiviral drugs-- Pfizer's ritonavir and US rival Merck/MSD's molnupiravir -- to treat Covid-19.Molnupiravir, sold as Lagevrio, is part of a national trial run by the University of Oxford that people can join if they have virus symptoms.Britain was the first country in the world to approve it last month and the authorities will make it available to those at high risk of severe illness, such as people with cancer.Pfizer's pill, marketed as Paxlovid, has yet to be authorised anywhere in the world.The company said Tuesday that clinical trials showed it reduced hospital admissions and deaths among at-risk people by almost 90 percent, when taken a few days after symptoms began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-daily-cases-top-100-000-in-uk-as-omicron-surges-101640227832186.html

Dr Leana Wen, a professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said that it’s prudent to re-evaluate the plans “based on the risk-benefit calculation”.Also Read | British study on Omicron shows hospitalisation rate lower than DeltaShe further said that it’s better to use the “two out of three” rules. Dr Wen explained then explained the concept, saying indoors, when there's a lot of virus, people need two out of three layers of protection: vaccination, Covid-19 testing and masking.“If you want to go an indoor gathering where people are eating and drinking - and therefore unmasked - and it's an area with high viral spread, you need proof of vaccination and same-day testing. If testing isn't available, keeping your mask on gives that added layer of protection. If vaccination is not required, or if there are unvaccinated individuals in attendance, then masking in addition to testing will be protective,” she added.The number of Omicron cases have been rising in India too. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to hold a meeting to review Covid-19 situation in the country amid the renewed threat posed by the new variant of coronavirus.In national capital Delhi, the disaster management authority has asked police to ensure the restrictions on public gatherings, including on celebrations for Christmas and the New Year, are not violated. The cops have been ordered to carry out raids in case violations are reported.Several states in India have rolled out restrictions in the wake of Omicron spread. In Maharashtra, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said that gatherings of 200 or more people will now require permission for local civic body chiefs. The Karnataka government has ordered quarantine for primary and secondary contacts of all Covid-19 patients. Delhi, meanwhile, has banned “all social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and festival-related gatherings and congregations”. The DDMA has advised markets and offices to implement “No Mask, No Entry” restrictions at all shops and workplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-threat-don-t-cancel-holiday-plan-use-2-out-of-3-rule-says-expert-101640226800725.html

Serge Gellé, 57, the Secretary of State for the Gendarmerie, was discovered in the water by a fisherman in a canoe who brought him to shore, according to officials.Another passenger, Chief Warrant Officer Jimmy Laitsara, also swam to the beach at Mahambo.“My turn to die has not yet come, thank God. I’m well. I’m just cold,” said Gelle in a video posted to Twitter by Madagascar's defense ministry. "But I’m sad because I don’t know if my friends are alive.”Gelle appeared on a lounge chair, still in his military camouflage, his hands pale and wrinkled by the water and the cold.“There were four of us in the aircraft. I was seated behind the pilot," he said of the crash on Monday evening."Not having a life jacket, I unfastened the seat and used it as a buoy. I stayed calm and took off anything heavy I was carrying like my boots and belt. I did everything to stay alive,” he said. Gelle said he expected to be back at work in 24 hours and said that he lost his cell phone in the crash.Many in Madagascar applauded Gelle's feat, calling him a “hero” an “extraordinary athlete,” and “an example to follow” on social media.The cause of the helicopter crash “remains undetermined,” authorities said. Gelle said that gusts of wind had destabilized the aircraft. The helicopter pilot and another passenger are still missing.The helicopter was one of two flying a government delegation to view the site where a boat, the Francia, sank, drowning at least 64 people on board.On Wednesday 25 bodies were recovered off the island of Sainte-Marie, in the northeast of the country, according to officials.The small cargo ship sank Monday while it was illegally transporting 138 people, according to a statement Wednesday by the Maritime and River Port Agency.Efforts continue to recover the more than 20 people still missing, said the agency.The Francia sank Monday morning about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the town of Soanierana Ivongo.“A flood in the engine room caused the massacre. Obviously, the boat had exceeded its loading capacity,” said Maurice Tianjara, deputy director-general of the maritime agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madagascars-police-chief-swims-12-hours-to-shore-after-copter-crash-in-ocean-101640224939761.html
23-12-2021||World||British study on Omicron shows hospitalisation rate lower than Delta||Two studies from Britain published Wednesday showed Covid infections with Omicron are less likely to result in hospitalization compared to the Delta variant, the latest research confirming a trend first identified in South Africa.The preliminary studies -- one paper from Scotland and the other from England -- were cautiously welcomed by experts, who nonetheless stressed that any advantage in milder outcomes could still be negated by the new strain's heightened infectiousness, which may still lead to more overall severe cases."We're saying that this is qualified good news -- qualified because these are early observations, they are statistically significant, and we are showing a reduced risk of hospitalizations," Jim McMenamin, a co-author of the Scottish research, told reporters on a call.The Scottish paper examined Covid cases recorded in November and December and grouped them by cases caused by Delta against those caused by Omicron.It found that "Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization when compared to Delta," while also showing that a booster vaccine offered substantial additional protection against symptomatic infection.The study was small and there were no people under 60 hospitalized at the time, but the authors said they had adjusted for these limitations using statistical methods.The second paper, from England, found there was a 20-25 percent reduction in any attendance at the hospital for Omicron compared to Delta, and a 40-45 percent reduction in hospitalizations lasting one night or longer, in other words, "admissions."The Scottish study only looked at admissions so this may account for part of the difference seen.Azra Ghani of the Imperial College London, who co-authored the England study, said in a statement: "Whilst the reduced risk of hospitalization with the Omicron variant is reassuring, the risk of infection remains extremely high."With the addition of the booster dose, vaccines continue to offer the best protection against infection and hospitalization."Neither of the studies has been peer-reviewed, but they add to growing evidence about disease outcomes with Omicron.It remains unclear whether the decreased rate of severe cases seen with Omicron is because of characteristics of the variant, or whether it appears milder because it is coming up against populations with greater immunity from prior infection and from vaccination.Penny Ward, a professor of pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, who was not involved in the research, said: “This news does not detract from the extraordinary spread of this variant across the population, and the fact that even a small proportion of people needing hospital care for Covid may become a very large number indeed if the community attack rate continues to escalate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-study-on-omicron-shows-hospitalisation-rate-lower-than-delta-101640220053449.html

The Israeli military said troops shot a Palestinian who had fired at them from a vehicle.The incident followed several Palestinian attacks on Israelis in recent weeks. Palestinians also complain of attacks by Israeli settlers, whose residence in the West Bank the international community considers illegal.In a statement, the military said the soldiers had come under fire from a passing vehicle while searching for Palestinians spotted approaching the Jewish settlement of Psagot."The troops responded with fire and hit the assailant," the military said, adding that none of the soldiers was hurt in the incident.Palestinian medics said the troops had chased a car up to the entrance of a refugee camp and then opened fire, wounding the Palestinian man in the back. They said he was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The medics said they did not know whether he had taken part in the alleged attack on the Israeli troops.The violence came a day after Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian motorist they suspected of attempting to drive his vehicle into a military checkpoint near the settlement of Mevo Dotan in the West Bank.Tor Wennesland, the United Nations Mideast peace envoy, last week said he was "alarmed" by the recent escalation of violence on both sides, saying the situation had become "volatile."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-killed-in-west-bank-israel-says-soldiers-shot-gunman-101640215679965.html

23-12-2021||World||Pfizer’s Covid-19 pill wins FDA emergency-use authorization||Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 pill gained clearance for emergency use in the US, delivering a more convenient treatment option for at-risk patients at a critical point in the pandemic.The drug, called Paxlovid, is the first at-home therapy for Covid-19 to win clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. It is expected to become a potent weapon in battling the virus once production gears up, giving people at high risk of severe complications from the disease a way to avoid winding up in the hospital.“This authorization provides a new tool to combat Covid-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement on Wednesday.The spread of the highly contagious omicron variant has led to concern that the US health-care system, already burdened from battling a months-long wave of disease caused by the delta strain, could be further taxed by a new surge of illnesses. While the variant appears to cause less severe disease among the vaccinated, the large numbers of people in the US who haven’t had a Covid shot could be vulnerable to worse outcomes.President Joe Biden said in a statement after the approval that Pfizer’s pill is a “promising new treatment option” that will lower hospitalizations and deaths. He said the federal government will use wartime powers if needed to help Pfizer increase production of the pill, which Biden’s Covid response coordinator said takes six to eight months to make. “Even in the face of the more transmissible Omicron variant, America is more prepared than ever to fight this virus,” Biden said.The White House has indicated that it sees Pfizer’s drug and another pill made by pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. as crucial tools for alleviating the crunch for hospitals. Regulators are expected to also authorize the Merck pill soon, according to people familiar with the plans.Shares of Pfizer were up 1% as of 3:48 p.m. in New York, and have surged 61% this year.In a large clinical trial, Paxlovid was shown to reduce hospitalizations by 88% when given to high-risk unvaccinated patients within five days of symptoms starting. Adverse events associated have been similar between the drug and placebo in clinical trials, Pfizer has said.Limited SuppliesSupplies will initially be sharply limited before ramping up next year. In November, the US government said it had ordered 10 million courses of the Pfizer pill for a price of nearly $5.3 billion -- about $530 per treatment. It expects to have only 65,000 courses available right away, with 250,000 courses expected by the end of January, US officials have said.  “Pfizer stands ready to begin delivery in the US immediately,” Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in a statement. Production of the pill is expected to ramp up dramatically next year, when the company expects to make 120 million courses.Until now, infused monoclonal antibodies have been the mainstay treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients outside of the hospital. But those are complicated to administer and target the fast-mutating spike protein, which showed significant changes in the omicron variant. Two of the three main antibody treatments used in the US, from Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., may not work well against the heavily mutated omicron. By contrast, Pfizer’s pill targets a protein inside the virus that is thought to change infrequently. Pfizer’s lab tests indicate that Paxlovid will still work against omicron.In a clinical trial of the drug involving more than 2,000 patients, 0.8% of those who received Paxlovid were hospitalized or died during 28 days of follow-up, compared with 6% of patients who received a placebo, the FDA said in its statement.Side effects of Paxlovid could include impaired sense of taste, diarrhea, high blood pressure and muscle aches, the FDA said. The pill was authorized for treating symptomatic Covid-19 in patients 12 years and older at high risk of developing severe disease. It is taken twice a day for five days and is used in conjunction with a second drug called ritonavir. Between the two drugs, patients take 3 pills twice day, or 30 pills in total over five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-pill-wins-fda-emergency-use-authorization-101640209962183.html

The authors of the study, however, cautioned that some of the reduction in hospitalisation and severity of the disease is likely due to high population immunity.The Omicron variant, which almost completely replaced other variants in South Africa in November, was associated with a rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in the country. Researchers across the globe are scrambling to gather more data on the new variant of concern as the high transmissibility of Omicron have forced governments to rethink the lockdown measures.The study used data from the national Covid-19 case reported to South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases, public sector laboratories, large private sector lab and genome data for clinical specimens to assess the severity of the disease. It assessed the severity of the disease by comparing the data of Omicron infections between October and November with data of Delta infections between April and November.The study, carried out by a team of scientists from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and major South African universities, has not been peer-reviewed yet and is available on the pre-print server. The findings suggest that the risk of hospitalisation from the Omicron variant was about 80% lower than those infected with the Delta strain of coronavirus."It is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of high levels of previous population immunity versus intrinsic lower virulence to the observed lower disease severity," they wrote.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia, said that the conclusions of the study are likely applicable to other countries since the paper “controlled for several of the main confounders such as age gender comorbidity.” Hunter, however, said that the study compares Omicron data from one period with Delta data from an earlier period, which is “always a weakness”.“There wasn't much delta around when omicron appeared. So temporal factors such as differing immunity likely to cause some bias,” he posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reduced-risk-of-hospitalisation-in-omicron-cases-than-delta-south-african-study-101640198554539.html

It said there was a need to prevent inter-state spread of the new variant.State health minister T Harish Rao told reporters that the state government would follow all the directions given by the court. He asked the Centre to take a decision on giving booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to the people to contain the spread of the virus.A village in Rajanna Siricilla district on Thursday went into a self-imposed lockdown for 10 days following the detection of an Omicron case on Wednesday.A 28-year-old man, who returned from Dubai to his native village of Gudem in Mustabad block on December 16, tested positive for the virus on December 20. His wife and mother also tested positive for Covid-19 a day later.The throat swab samples of the man and his family members were sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology for genome sequencing. On Wednesday, it was revealed that the Gulf-returnee was positive for Omicron. He was immediately shifted to Hyderabad for quarantine. The results of the other two, who were home quarantined, are still awaited.On getting to know this, the villagers held an emergency meeting on Thursday morning and resolved that the entire village should observe lockdown. “It is very unfortunate, but we have no other alternative. Except for a couple of hours in the morning hours for essential services, the entire village will be shut down for 10 days. We have asked the people not to come out of their houses except for emergency needs,” Gudem village upa-sarpanch S Srinivasa Rao told HT.He said the authorities had collected 64 samples of the primary contacts of the Gulf-returnee and sent them for tests. “All of them were sent to home quarantine. We have also informed our decision to higher officials,” Rao said.According to him, the man had also attended a wedding function at the adjacent Narayanapur village of Yellareddypet mandal on Sunday. “The authorities have also collected samples of 53 people who came in contact with him at the event. They have also been sent for testing,” he added.

23-12-2021||India||Meghalaya Speaker recognises merger of 12 Congress MLAs with Trinamool||Meghalaya assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh on Thursday recognised the merger of the 12 Congress MLAs with Trinamool Congress (TMC) — a month after the legislators switched sides in a sudden move. “I am satisfied that the merger of the 12 members of the Indian National Congress is valid as provided under paragraph 4 of the 10th Schedule to the Constitution of India and doesn’t attract disqualification,” Lyngdoh mentioned in a bulletin. “I do not find any merit in the submissions made in the petitions filed by Dr. M Ampareen Lyngdoh, MLA, (Congress legislature party leader) and therefore the same is dismissed,” the bulletin added. The 12 legislators-- former Chief Minister Dr. Mukul Sangma, Marthon Sangma, Jimmy Sangma, Lazarus Sangma, Miani Shira, H M Shangpliang, George Lyngdoh, Winnerson Sangma, Dikkanchi Shira, Zenith Sangma, Charles Pyngrope and Shitlang Pale—had handed over the letter of merger to the Speaker on November 24. Congress had, however, challenged the merger and sought disqualification of the MLAs. M. Ampareen Lyngdoh had, on November 29, filed 10 petitions with the Speaker seeking disqualification of the 12 defected legislators. She filed two more similar petitions earlier this month. The Speaker, thereafter, issued notices to the MLAs asking them to submit their response to the plea. However, upon receiving the response from the MLAs, he approved their merger with TMC. “The Speaker has decided and I respect his order. I will not pursue this petition because our campaign will take priority in 2022. The party, however, may have a different view on the matter,” Ampareen Lyngdoh stated in response to the Speaker’s decision. “As a CLP we took the available space to move a petition against the desertion, this being an opportunity to object to the manner in which the exodus disclosed, hence no regret on that,” she added.

23-12-2021||India||Kerala twin murders: Prime accused still at large says top cop||Amid investigations into Kerala’s twin political murders, the Additional Director General of Police, Vijay Sakhre, on Thursday said the main accused in the murder of the BJP leader in Alappuzha have slipped out of the state and special teams have been dispatched to neighbouring states to nab them. The top cop said five arrested workers of the Social Democratic Party of India, the political wing of the Popular Front of India (PFI), were held on charges of conspiracy and tampering with evidence and people who participated in the murder directly were still at large. Two state-level functionaries of the BJP and SDPI, Renjith Sreenivas and K S Shan, were murdered in Alappuzha on Saturday and Sunday within a span of 12 hours shocking the state. Police later admitted that both were retaliatory killings. “We have definite information that some of the accused who directly participated in the murder slipped out of the state. Both murders were well- planned and executed. Since the probe is on we can’t divulge any further information,” he said. He said the allegation of the PFI that some of those detained were forced to chant “Jai Sri Ram.” was baseless. “It is a baseless charge. If the allegation is found right I am ready to quit,” he said. The officer is supervising the special investigation team probing both the killings. He said the SIT identified all those who directly participated in both murders. In the SDPI leader’s murder police arrested three workers of the RSS so far, he said. The PFI has alleged that the ongoing investigation was biased and intended to satisfy the Sangh Parivar. “Our workers have been hounded and their homes searched in the night without women officers being present. A section of the police is totally biased and out to woo the Sangh Parivar,” it said in a statement in Kozhikode (north Kerala). The BJP has sought a probe by the central agencies. “We are not satisfied with the ongoing probe. Like in other political killings, the police are literally groping in the dark even after four days of the gruesome murder,” said state BJP president K Surendran. The police have started a crackdown on those who spread hate on social media after the twin murders. At least 30 people were booked and two arrests were made, said a senior police officer warning that strict action will be taken against those who try to disrupt communal harmony. Police have also approached the admin of these social media sites to block those who try to vitiate the communal atmosphere of the state. The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) said communal elements were trying to vitiate peace and carry out a vicious campaign for communal polarization. “Both RSS and SDPI are trying to foment trouble in the state to create an atmosphere of polarization. People will realize their follies and the government will take strict action against them,” said party state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan adding that it was wrong to dub all Muslims as PFI members and such a move will only help the fundamentalist outfit. He also denied the RSS-BJP allegation that many PFI activists had sneaked into the ruling CPI(M).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-twin-murders-prime-accused-still-at-large-says-top-cop-101640270114300.html

The BJP-led Governments decision to confer the award on the Sarvodaya leader was communicated by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to President K.R. Narayanan last evening. The surprise announcement came through a two-line Press communique issued by Rashtrapati Bhavan today (December 23). He is the 35th recipient of this award. A leading light of the Quit India Movement of 1942 against the British rule, ‘JP’ came to be known better for his nationwide movement against corruption in public life and excesses during Emergency. When Mrs. Indira Gandhi decided to revoke the Emergency and hold general elections in 1977, JP was instrumental in bringing opposition parties together. The Janata Party, under whose banner they fought the elections inflicted a crushing defeat on the Congress. He may have played a pioneering role in providing the country its first non-Congress Government, but JP declined to accept any public post. In the 1950s, many had regarded him a possible successor to Jawaharlal Nehru, but he counted himself out of any position of power. He had voluntarily retired from active politics towards the end of the sixties and devoted himself to Bhoodan Movement, launched by Acharya Vinoba Bhave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-dec-24-1998-jp-awarded-bharat-ratna-posthumously-101640268732864.html

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) tested the missile from the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast.It has a range of 150 to 500 kilometre, depending on payload, and can be launched from a mobile launcher.“In Thursday’s launch, the missile was tested for heavier payload and different range to prove the precision and lethality of the weapon,” the ministry said in a statement. The launch was monitored by range sensors and instruments, including telemetry, radar and electro-optic tracking systems deployed along India’s eastern coast and ships positioned near the impact point.The flight test met all the mission objectives, the ministry said.The twin flight tests came days after India tested an advanced variant of the Agni class of missiles from the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island test facility on December 18.The new generation nuclear-capable ballistic missile, named Agni P, can strike targets at a maximum range of 2,000 km and will further strengthen India’s credible deterrence capabilities, as previously reported.It is a canisterised missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 km.The other variants of the Agni missiles developed by DRDO include the 700-km Pakistan-specific Agni-I, the 2,000-km range Agni-II, the 3,000-km range Agni-III, 4,000-km range Agni-IV and the 5,000-km range Agni-V missile.The Agni P test came a week after India successfully tested a new locally-developed anti-tank missile and concluded a series of tests of extended range rockets also developed indigenously, weapons that will inducted into the armed forces shortly.The weapons successfully tested on December 11 were the helicopter launched stand-off anti-tank (SANT) missile and Pinaka extended range (ER) rocket systems.SANT has a range of 10 km.The new Pinaka rocket system has longer range with reduced length compared to the earlier variant. While Pinaka Mk-1 rockets have a range of 36 km, the ER variant can hit targets more than 48 km away and has been developed as per the requirements of the Indian Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tests-pralay-missile-second-time-in-2-days-101640266873136.html

23-12-2021||India||PIL in Gauhati High Court seeks independent probe into Assam fake encounters||An advocate has filed a public interest litigation in the Gauhati High Court seeking an independent investigation into the incidents of alleged fake encounters by the Assam Police. Arif Jwadder, a resident of Assam who is practicing law in New Delhi, mentions that 80 such incidents have happened in the state since May 2021 (when a new BJP-led government took charge) and resulted in 28 deaths and left 48 injured. In July this year, Jwadder had filed a complaint against such incidents with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The commission had sought a report from the Assam Police in September. In November, NHRC transferred the case to the Assam human rights commission. The complaint is still pending. Besides the state government, Assam Police, the department of law and justice, NHRC and the Assam human rights commission have been named as respondents in the petition. The HC had admitted the petition but is yet to list any date of hearing. In his petition, Jwadder stated that the people killed or injured in fake encounters by police were not criminals and the modus operandi of all such incidents as per police version has been the same. “It is stated that the alleged accused tried to snatch the service revolvers of police personnel and in self-defence, the police had to retaliate and kill or injure the alleged accused…It can’t be the case that all the alleged accused could snatch a service revolver from a trained police officer whose pistols are normally tied to a rope with the waist belt of the officer,” the petition, which HT has seen, stated. It added that while the police version mentioned about the alleged accused trying to snatch weapons from the police, there was no mention of the accused aiming or firing at police personnel. Also, all the encounters took place at night and the victims were unarmed and handcuffed at that time. The petition requested the HC to seek records of all encounters from the Assam government and police and order an independent investigation against police personnel involved in the incidents by an independent agency like the Central Bureau of Investigation under direct supervision of the court. It also sought a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the Gauhati HC into the encounters, direction to the Assam government to set up human rights courts in each district and order monetary compensation to families of encounter victims after due verification. In July this year, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had asked police personnel to shoot at legs of alleged criminals if they tried to escape from police custody.

It is a forward-looking bill that will address many challenges being currently faced,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on the legislation's passage in the assembly. During discussion on the bill, the Opposition Congress seemed to be on a back foot with the Basavaraj Bommai-led government claiming the legislation had been initiated by the grand old party with Siddaramaiah in the chief minister’s chair. The ruling camp also placed documents to support its claim before the House.While Siddaramaiah, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, initially refuted the charge, he later went through the records in the speaker's office, following which he accepted that as the CM he had only asked a draft bill in this regard to be placed before the cabinet and that no decision was taken on the same.Also read | Attacks on Christian groups expose fault lines in KarnatakaStating that the Congress vehemently opposed the bill in its present form that it said was "anti people", "inhuman", "anti constitutional", "anti poor" and "draconian", the senior Congress leader said the bill should not be passed for any reason and should be withdrawn by the government.Also read | Explainer: Karnataka anti-conversion law: The legality of other such lawsEarlier in the day, moving the bill for consideration, home minister Araga Jnanendra said the law was not against any religion and eight states have passed and are implementing such a law and Karnataka would become the ninth one. Noting that religious conversion has become a menace and quoting example of Hosadurga MLA Goolihatti Shekhar's recent statement that his mother has been converted to Christianity, the minister said the issue of conversion has created friction in the society, especially in rural areas, and there has been incidents of suicide in Udupi and Mangaluru recently in cases related to conversion.The bill provides for protection of right to freedom of religion and prohibition of unlawful conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-assembly-passes-contentious-anti-conversion-bill-101640261674849.html
23-12-2021||India||Killers of BJP functionary identified, chasing them: Police||All the 12 accused, suspected to have been directly involved in the recent murder of BJP functionary Ranjith Sreenivas here, have been identified but they have managed to escape from Kerala, police said on Thursday while the arrest of another person was recorded in the murder of SDPI's K S Shan for allegedly providing logistic support to the killers. Special police teams were deployed to track down the absconding culprits and the probe has been extended outside the state, ADGP (Law and Order) Vijay Sakhare told reporters here. The senior IPS officer, who heads the Special Investigation Team probing the back to back murder cases of Sreenivas and Shan, however, said they have got relevant information regarding the conspiracy in both cases but could not divulge the details as it would adversely impact the investigation. "All the 12 accused, directly involved in the murder of Sreenivas, have been identified. But, none of them are in the state now. We are chasing them. They will land in police custody soon," he said. It is sure that the killers had received external support to go into hiding and the police were examining the details, he said. Asked about the SDPI's allegations against frequent police searches in the houses of party activists and sympathisers, he said raids would continue in the suspected hideouts of the accused as it was important to nab the culprits. "We have to maintain that the law and order situation is not broken down. For that, raids are important," he said. An ambulance, suspected to have been used by the culprits involved in the Shan murder case, was seized by the police and its scientific and forensic examination would be carried out soon. "It is a cat and mouse game now. Every accused is in hiding but we will nab them at any cost," the senior officer added. Shan, the state secretary of SDPI, was killed by a gang on Saturday night while he was on his way home, while the BJP OBC Morcha state secretary Sreenivas was hacked to death in front of his family by some assailants in his house on Sunday morning. Five SDPI sympathisers have been arrested in connection with the murder of Sreenivas so far while the arrest of three persons have been recorded in Shan's killing, according to police. Meanwhile, police have registered as many as 30 cases across the state in the last five days against some people for spreading provocative messages through social media platforms in a manner that incites communal hatred. One person was arrested in a case registered by the West Police in Kollam district in this regard, an official statement said here. The highest number of cases was registered in the Ernakulam rural sector-13, while the other cases were registered in Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Kozhikode, Palakkad, Kottayam, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kasaragod districts, it said. State DGP Anil Kant said it was a crime to propagate messages through social media platforms in a way that promotes social hatred and communal disharmony. Stating that the state police have launched a special monitoring system to keep an eye on such messages, he also said district police chiefs have been directed to complete investigation and take action against such culprits including arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/killers-of-bjp-functionary-identified-chasing-them-police-101640260879585.html

Swami Prabodhanand Giri, president of the Hindu Raksha Sena, Swami Anandswaroop, Sadhvi Annapurna have spoken during the conclave. BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay attended the last day of the conclave but reportedly distanced himself from the 'hate speech'.

23-12-2021||India||Poush Mela to be held outside Visva Bharati, VC blames TMC government||The annual ‘Poush Mela’, a heritage cultural event attracting lakhs of travellers to West Bengal’s Santiniketan, will be held outside the premises of the Visva Bharati University campus.  The university’s vice chancellor, Bidyut Chakrabarty, said on Thursday that this year the fair could not be held inside the campus as there was no response from the state government.  “We took the initiative to organize the fair since October this year. We wrote to the state health secretary seeking advice on how to hold the fair. We sent three reminders. We didn’t get any response till date,” Chakrabarty told the media. The district administration, however, said that the fair is being held at an alternate place outside the Visva Bharati premises, as the university authorities didn't take any initiative. In 2020, the varsity authorities had cancelled the fair because of the Covid-19 pandemic. A local organisation later held the fair outside the campus in a small manner last year. “This year the same social organisation is organising the fair at an alternate place outside the university campus, around 1.5 km away. The district administration is helping the organisation to organise the fair. There was no initiative from the university authorities,” said Bidhan Ray, district magistrate of Birbhum.  Earlier in 2016 the university had been hauled up by the National Green Tribunal for flouting pollution norms in earlier versions of the festival. Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore’s father Maharshi Debendranath Tagore had first organised the fair in 1894 and Visva-Bharati, the university founded by the bard, started organising it from 1951. The over-a-century-old handicraft, handloom, art and music festival is usually held in December-end. It was inaugurated on Thursday and will continue till December 26.  “This is very unfortunate. I don’t know whose fault it was. The state, Centre and the VB authorities should have been more proactive about organising the fair inside the campus” said Anupam Hazra, BJP’s former MP and party’s national general secretary.  The TMC, however, lashed out saying that no Bengali would believe it if anyone says that the Mamata  Banerjee-administration didn’t give permission to VB. “Even a fool would not believe this,” said Santanu Sen, TMC MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poush-mela-to-be-held-outside-visva-bharati-vc-blames-tmc-government-101640258640002.html

Panicker at Poojappura in Thiruvananthapuram and said he wanted to remove the evil of illiteracy.The President said Panicker spread an important message - "Vayichu Valaruka" which means "Read and Grow".He said that Panicker made libraries and literacy a movement of the people."It is a unique feature of Kerala that in every village, even in the remotest villages, there is a library and people feel an emotional connect with the library in their village or town just as they feel a special connection with the temple or church or mosque or school in their village or town," Kovind said, according to a release by the President's Secretariat.He noted that libraries created by the movement of Panicker later became a nerve centre of all social and cultural activities of which the literacy movement of Kerala is an impressive example."The credit for libraries having a central place in the culture of Kerala goes to Shri P.N. Panicker who connected common people to libraries. The Granthashala Sangam started by Shri Panicker with about 50 small libraries in 1945 grew into a large network of thousands of libraries."The President said that Kerala displays India at its cultural and harmonious best."Recently, when the Covid-pandemic affected the entire world, nurses and doctors from Kerala were among the most visible Covid-warriors in India, the middle-east and so many other regions on the globe. The people of Kerala enhance the pride of India," he said.Pointing to the fact that Kerala became the first State to have a hundred per cent literacy, the President said that the 'Sakshara Keralam' movement became popular and effective due to the foundations laid down by Panicker.The President said that observing the birthday of Panicker on 19th June as 'Reading Day' is the most appropriate way of paying tribute to the great nation builder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-kovind-unveils-p-n-panicker-s-statue-in-thiruvananthapuram-101640259287701.html

23-12-2021||India||Elgar case: 8 activists denied default bail tell HC they will seek order review||Eight activists accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, who were denied default bail by the Bombay High Court earlier this month, told the HC on Thursday that they will file review petitions against the order which was based on a "factual error". The accused activists and academicians -- Sudhir Dawale, Dr P Varavara Rao, Rona Wilson, advocate Surendra Gadling, Professor Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira, -- had earlier this week filed an application for 'speaking to minutes', which is used for getting minor corrections made to an order of a court. On Thursday, a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said the court could not pass any orders accepting or denying the claims made by the parties, or even listen to the arguments on merits since the accused had preferred to move the speaking to minutes application. Senior advocate Sudeep Pasbola, who appeared for one of the accused activists in the case, then told the bench that the accused will withdraw the speaking to minutes application and file fresh pleas seeking a review of the HC order. Pasbola said the accused will file the fresh pleas in January 2022, once the HC reopens after the Christmas vacation.The bench then said it was not granting any liberty or specific permission to the accused to file the review petition. However, if the procedure established under the law provided for a review petition, they were free to file it, the HC said. On December 1 this year, the bench of Justices Shinde and Jamadar granted default bail to Sudha Bharadwaj, also an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, on the ground that the Pune sessions court, which had granted an extension of time to the Pune police for filing of charge sheet after the mandatory 90-day period was over, did not have the jurisdiction to do so. At that time, the bench rejected the same relief for the eight other co-accused in the case. The HC then said these eight persons had not exercised their right to seek default bail in time. It had observed that while Bharadwaj filed a plea before the Pune court seeking default bail as soon as the 90-day period for filing of the charge sheet in the case got over, these eight accused had delayed filing of their applications. On Tuesday, however, the eight accused persons informed the bench through their counsel R Sathyanarayanan that its judgment denying them default bail was based on a "factual error". They said Dhawale, Wilson, Gadling, Sen and Raut had filed default bail pleas before the Pune sessions court on September 26, 2018, after the 90-day period of their arrest got over and the charge sheet remained to be filed. The activists said they were arrested on July 6 2018, and the first charge sheet against them was filed only on November 15, 2018. They filed their default bail pleas in time, but the same are still pending hearing before the sessions court, they said. Gonsalves, Rao and Ferriera told the high court that they had applied for default bail on November 30, 2018, just four days after Bharadwaj filed her application before the Pune court. They told the HC that the Pune sessions court had rejected their default bail applications along with Bharadwaj's default bail plea through a common order passed on November 6, 2019. It was this November 6, 2019 order that the high court bench of Justice Shinde had set aside on December 1 this year in Bharadwaj's case, they said. The Elgar Parishad case was earlier with the Pune police and it is now being handled by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the 'Elgar Parishad' conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the city's outskirts. The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-case-8-activists-denied-default-bail-tell-hc-they-will-seek-order-review-101640257022566.html

23-12-2021||India||Delhi court orders probe against former Maharashtra home minister Deshmukh||A Delhi court has ordered a probe against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with the leak of confidential information related to the investigation into an extortion case involving him. The court said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had “forsaken the man pulling the string” while only booking the “hands”.On December 22, special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal took cognisance of the charge sheet filed against Deshmukh’s lawyer Anil Daga and CBI sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari over alleged bribery related to the leak. It directed the CBI to “discreetly” conduct an investigation into Deshmukh’s role.The CBI arrested Daga and Tiwari on September 1 alleging a criminal conspiracy involving them and unknown persons to subvert the probe in the extortion case against Deshmukh.The Enforcement Directorate arrested Deshmukh in November in a money-laundering case linked to alleged extortion. The CBI earlier booked him in connection with the allegations of bribery that former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh levelled against the politician. The agency has alleged Tiwari shared sensitive and confidential documents with Daga in lieu of “undue advantage and illegal gratification” for sabotaging the probe in the extortion case. It said Daga was allegedly involved in the “manipulation” of the CBI’s preliminary inquiry against Deshmukh.On August 29, a report that was part of the preliminary inquiry the CBI conducted into Singh’s allegation of corruption against Deshmukh was leaked in the media. The report said the agency concluded that Deshmukh committed “no cognisable offence”. The CBI later said it found Deshmukh’s legal team tried to bribe some CBI officials and leaked the report as part of a “larger conspiracy to subvert the investigation”.Also Read: Chandiwal commission imposes ₹50k fine on Anil DeshmukhThe Delhi court pulled up the agency for not investigating Deshmukh’s role. “The CBI seems to have left the engine/horse pulling the cart, thereby only arraigning those traveling in cart, as without pull of engine or horse the ride of cart or conspiracy would not have been possible, despite mountain of apparent evidence, CBI seems to have forsaken the man pulling the strings or the controlling mind or master mind or head while only charge sheeting the hands,” said Aggarwal. He noted the two accused were closely associated with Deshmukh. Aggarwal said they may have been acting in tandem with him and “controlling the mind of the larger conspiracy, whereas those arrested may only be the hands”.The court said Deshmukh was the main beneficiary of the leak and the common objective of the conspiracy appears to be to get access investigation done in an illegal and clandestine manner and thereafter to use and circulate it. It referred to a series of conspiratorial acts to obtain the information. The court directed the agency to investigate Deshmukh’s role in a time-bound manner and file a status report within four weeks.The matter would be heard next on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-orders-probe-against-ex-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101640256971988.html
23-12-2021||India||Activist accuses Assam govt of targeting him after cops question his nationality||An activist has accused the Assam government of targeting him because of his opposition to its policies after police raised questions over his nationality in their report for his passport renewal.Pranab Doley, 35, who contested this year’s assembly polls on Anchalik Gana Morcha’s ticket and lost to Asom Gana Parishad president Atul Bora, belongs to the Mising tribe. He said he applied for the renewal in April after the validity of his passport expired in November last year. “Since I was busy with the election process, I did not apply for renewal earlier. I have held a passport for 10 years and travelled to many countries. Therefore, I expected the renewal to be an easy process.”Doley said he was called to the local police station around a month after he submitted the passport renewal form. “...on December 20, I got a letter from the regional passport office in Guwahati, saying as per police report, my nationality is doubtful.” HT has seen the letter. Doley called the adverse report a violation of his fundamental rights. He questioned the police for sitting on his application before forwarding it to the passport office. “I have been at protests against human rights violations in the state and have taken a strong stand against the government’s evictions drives like the violent one at Gorukhuti. I feel the police report terming me a doubtful citizen is an impact of that,” said Doley. He added he feels the state government is afraid and wants to silence him.Golaghat police superintendent Sumeet Sharma said they would look into the matter after getting a “written grievance” from Doley. “We sent our verification report following due processes. Doley has several criminal cases lodged against him and those details were also mentioned in our report. If he makes a formal complaint, we will check our records and see what the issue is.”Doley has been arrested thrice over four years. He maintained the arrests related to his protests against the extrajudicial killing of a minor, compensation for crops damaged in floods, and for exposing a scam in the distribution of rice.In July, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma asked police to clear passport verification applications within a week except in cases of applicants whose nationalities are doubtful.

He lived in a rented flat in Bukit Purmei Road with four of his co-accused.A year after he arrived in Singapore, one of Singh's flatmates introduced him to a money-making scheme, where he could earn money by providing his bank account for the receipt of overseas funds.Although he suspected that such an agreement was illegal, he was promised a commission and he agreed, the report said. Singh was added to a WhatsApp group with the other accomplices, which was used to coordinate money-laundering activities and ensure that fund transfers were received into various bank accounts.The funds would then be withdrawn and handed over to other individuals further down the laundering chain, court documents stated.Between September 2, 2020, and September 5, 2020, Singh provided a cross-border money transfer service, receiving a total of three inward transfers into his DBS Multiplier Account amounting to Singapore dollars 60,238 (USD 44,293)He also facilitated 14 outward transfers of Singapore dollars 60,200 (USD 44,265). These were in the form of transfers to his accomplices or unidentified individuals and cash withdrawals made either by himself or his accomplices to circumvent daily withdrawal limits.In exchange, Singh received a commission of about Singapore dollars 1,900 (USD 1,397).The process turned out to be a money-laundering chain by a cross-border syndicate targeting victims in Canada.Two Canadian men fell victim to scams related to money laundering. The first man filed a police report with his police authority in Ontario on September 14 last year.He said he was deceived into transferring a total of 66,390 Canadian dollars (USD 51,787) between September 3 and September 10 on the premise that he was returning excess refunds wrongly transferred to him for a terminated computer virus protection subscription service.A total of Singapore dollars 68,350 (USD 50,265) had been transferred into a DBS account and an OCBC account belonging to two of Singh's accomplices.The second Canadian man filed an online report with the Singapore Police Force on September 16 last year, saying he had been cheated into transferring 12,200 Canadian dollars (USD 9,516) on September 10 to a DBS bank account.The same premise was given to him - that he should return excess refunds wrongly transferred to him for a terminated computer virus protection subscription service.About Singapore dollars, 12,525 (USD 9,209) were transferred to the DBS account held by Singh's accomplice.The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) began investigations and found that Singh's bank account was also implicated in the offences.On September 22 last year, CAD officers raided Singh's rented flat. While he was being raided, Singh deleted the WhatsApp chat group used to coordinate the group's money-laundering activities and exited it. The deleted information could not be recovered by CAD.In mitigation, Singh's lawyer said he was the youngest child in his family and had come to Singapore to study and in hopes of getting a higher-paying job.Although he is the youngest, he is the sole breadwinner of the family, as his father stopped working after injuring his leg and his mother is a housewife. He was acquainted with the wrong company and foolishly agreed to allow his account to be used for illegitimate activities, said the lawyer.Singh is the fourth of the group to be dealt with. The other three were also Indian nationals who had come to Singapore to pursue diplomas.Mukherjee Sukanya, 24, pleaded guilty in November and was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, while Tenzing Ugyen Lama Sherpa, 23, was given 40 months' jail term earlier this month.Tenzing was one of the coordinators of the Singapore branch of the criminal syndicate, facilitating almost Singapore dollars 205,000 (USD 150,737) in transfers with his bank account, of which Singapore dollars 37,795 (USD 277, 90) was traceable to criminal proceeds of the money-laundering syndicate.Tirth Singh, 22, was given six months' jail earlier this month, and the other cases are pending, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/money-making-traps-indian-national-into-prison-for-six-months-in-singapore-101640254387933.html
23-12-2021||India||Bells all set to toll again in Srinagar church that was closed for decades||SRINAGAR: A church built over a century ago in Srinagar’s Dalgate area has reopened ahead of Christmas after renovation three decades after it was closed when insurgency erupted in the region in 1989. Prayers were held at Saint Luke’s Church on Wednesday.“We sang carols and the father gave a speech. We were overjoyed and very happy. We do not have words to express... It is such a joy that this church has opened again after over 30 years,” said Kennedy David Rajan, a worshipper, who runs an NGO. Rajan said the church’s reopening is a dream come true. “...we were eager that prayers resume here again which has happened after decades.”According to a plaque at the church, it was built in 1896 and was dedicated to the then bishop of Lahore. It is located near Srinagar’s Chest Diseases Hospital, which the Christian missionaries established.Mohammad Rafiq, 41, a local resident, said his great grandfather worked with the missionaries who established the hospital in the late 1860s and later the church. “They (missionaries) were doctors and established the church near the hospital...” He said he would visit the church as a child and local Christians prayed there during the peak of insurgency.Also Read: In pics: Srinagar’s oldest church, closed for decades, opens ahead of Christmas“I remember as children, we would go on Sundays and the father would come and open the church to pray. It used to happen as a low-key affair. Even a few families used to live in the church during the militancy.”Grace Paljor, an educationist, said the church’s opening is a sort of an expression of the government’s gratitude to their community’s contribution in the fields of health care and education. “It was very significant... the influence of the Christian community in the fields of medicine and education has been impactful.”The church was dilapidated until it was restored as part of the Srinagar Smart City Project. Zahoor Ahmad, an engineer associated with the project, said the church has been handed over to the tourism department.“One of the components of the Smart City Project is the up-gradation of existing shrines. ...this church is one of the prominent sites since 1896 and we gave it a priority. There was some delay in renovation due to Covid-19 but for the past few months, the tourism department has done good work. Our target was to restore it by Christmas...” He said a lot of work went into the renovation. “It was a challenging job to get...masons and experts. We restored its khatambandh (traditional Kashmiri wooden ceiling), brickwork, and flooring.”Suhaib Naqashbandi, an architect involved with the project, said the church was a listed heritage site and one of the few places with Gothic architecture in Kashmir. “It has significance in terms of religion and also...heritage.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also set to chair a meeting later in the day. With a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa, gearing up for Assembly election early next year, campaigning has begun full throttle in several places and rallies have started witnessing large gatherings, any of which may turn into a potential hotspot for coronavirus spread."Observe all precautions. Don't let your guard down,” the Centre said, while urging local administrations to remain vigilant and monitor case positivity, doubling rates, clusters of new cases across districts.According to ANI inputs, the Centre also asked the states to ensure 100 per cent coverage of those who are yet to receive their first dose against the virus and accelerate the inoculation of eligible second dose beneficiaries.

The revenue department of the state government has been directed to conduct the investigation and present a report in a week.Congress leaders, led by Rahul Gandhi, have launched an attack on the UP government saying that while “Hindus follow the path of truth, Hindutva robs under the guise of religion”.

Founded in 2015, IVM Podcasts is India’s premiere podcast network that aims to serve listeners with a wide portfolio of audio content across genres. The network produces, distributes and monetizes talk and narrative based audio content across genres from comedy and politics to advertising and business. Q1. The pandemic has led to a newfound importance of holistic wellness, where people are not only seeking to be physically healthy, but are also prioritizing mental health. How is your show tying the two together?A1. I believe in having real conversations with people and showcasing the complete picture. People always look up to athletes and influencers for inspiration, but they only show their determined and motivational selves and not their vulnerable selves. However, even these people suffer from the same problems and insecurities as we all do. Raw and Organic podcast opens up that window for everyone and makes people come alive with normalcy, by showcasing a real and full picture.Q2. Can you share something about your journey as a fitness coach?A2. My journey as a fitness coach has always been evolving. I have evolved as a person who really understands and appreciates the human journey and the human mind. Over the years, I have realized that coaching is not the most difficult part, the most difficult part is understanding and relating to everybody else. My journey as a coach has always been in constant evolution, and I have always wanted to get better at departing knowledge and communicating my version of fitness better. But over time, I came to a point where I started relating to people as much as possible and helped them meet their goals in the most convincing and fun way possible.Q3. The most difficult aspect of any routine or regiment is consistency, how do you stay motivated and consistent with your workouts and what is your advice to your audiences on the same?A3. I think constantly staying motivated and being consistent is about understanding that motivation has a very different role to play in your journey. Motivation is the starting point of any kind of journey, but the only thing that is going to help you reach your goal is discipline because motivation passes and discipline stays. In order to be consistent, you have to ensure that you make things a habit.What has personally helped me is having conversations with myself and always asking myself ‘why?’ - why I started what I’m doing right now, why I’m working on something, and so on. The second thing that helps me stay on course is giving myself due credit and tapping myself on the back for every achievement.Q4. When one speaks of ‘wellness’ what does it encapsulate?A4. In my opinion, wellness is the proper balance of physical, mental and spiritual well-being. As humans, we are always trying to achieve an ideal version of our life.I think there is no ideal version of life, it’s what you hold within yourself. Everybody’s learnings, problems and achievements are different. Understanding who you are, and what you enjoy, and striking a balance between physical, mental and spiritual well-being is what wellness is all about.Q5. What role does your diet play in overall wellness?A5. A person’s diet is the most important part of their fitness journey. Besides maintaining a healthy and balanced diet for fitness, it also helps with overall wellness as there are foods that control your moods, your mental well-being and your hormones. It is extremely vital to maintain a balanced diet to ensure that you are getting all the minerals and nutrients your body requires. You should be able to eat what you like and at the same time understand what is not working for you; eventually creating that kind of balance.Q6. What is your the diet you would recommend people to try and what is your take on fad diets, keto, intermittent fasting etc?A6. As I have been doing this for a very long time, and I have a deeper relationship with my body, I know the signals my body gives me and I eat accordingly. I understand that when I feel low on energy I should have a heavy carb meal. If my recovery is slow, I have a high-protein diet. It’s something that is more variable according to my lifestyle.When it comes to different diets, you need to try and see how it works for your body. Intermittent fasting leads to a lowered calorie intake due to a small eating window, so people tend to lose weight with this diet.Q7 Is there any special advice you’d like to give to people working from home to balance their work and home life and the stress it entailsA7. It is vital to have a structure to your life and have a proper timeline. When you do not have to be at a different place and move around, you tend to get lazy and put things off for later. This is when the balance is lost. It is vital to have a schedule and adhere to it so that your life has some structure and discipline. At the end of the day, it will also make you feel like you have achieved something from your day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understanding-who-you-are-and-what-you-enjoy-is-what-wellness-is-all-about-says-kunal-rajput-101640253611720.html

For us, the cow is our mother. Those making fun of cows and buffaloes forget that almost 8 crore families in the country earn their livelihood by the means of livestock,” Modi said.It is because of such families that India can produce milk worth ₹8.5 lakh crore, Modi said, adding, that this value is more than the cost of production of wheat and rice.He added one of the top priorities of his government is strengthening the dairy sector, and hence, the foundation of the Banas Dairy Kashi Sankul was laid.Also Read| UP's women won't let opposition come back to power: PM Modi“Milk production in India has increased by about 45 per cent as compared to the last six-seven years. Today, India produces about 22 per cent of the world's milk. I'm happy that today UP is not only the largest milk-producing state in the country, it's also ahead in the expansion of the dairy sector,” the Prime Minister further said.The Banas Dairy Kashi Sankul is situated at the UP State Industrial Development Authority Food Park in Varanasi's Karkhiyaon. Spread across 30 acres of land, the dairy will be built at a cost of about ₹475 crore and will have a facility for processing 5 lakh litres of milk per day.Modi will also transfer a ₹35 crore bonus to the bank accounts of over 1.7 lakh milk producers associated with Banas Dairy.This is Modi's second visit to Varanasi in just 10 days.

Anybody trying to disturb the peace and harmony of the state will be taken to task," Channi tweeted.SAD leader advocate Harish Rai Dhanda, who will be contesting in the upcoming assembly election, claimed that he was the target of the attack.

Pb govt must focus on law & order instead of political vendetta to ensure peace & communal harmony in State.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also condemned the incident and said, “First sacrilege, now blast.

You come now': Court to Juhi Chawla on her plea against dismissal of 5G petition||Bollywood actor Juhi Chawla has moved the Delhi high court challenging the dismissal of her suit against the rollout of 5G. As the Delhi high court listed the appeal for hearing on January 25 saying that there was no grave urgency in that matter, the bench said, "Order is of June. You come now. Six months have gone." Juhi Chawla's counsel Salman Khurshid said the present case was an "unfortunate" one and urged the court to advance the date of hearing, news agency PTI reported.Juhi Chawla and a few others had approached the Delhi high court against 5G rollout which a single-judge bench in June termed as 'defective' and 'abuse of process of law'. The bench also noted that the suit was filed for gaining publicity and imposed a fine of ₹20 lakh.Against the single-bench rule, the petitioners, including Juhi Chawla, has moved before the division bench and contended that the single judge dismissed the plea and imposed costs without any jurisdiction and contrary to the settled law. A plaint can be dismissed only after it has been allowed to be registered as a suit.The appellants reiterated the points against 5G that they earlier stated. "Every day that the 5G trials are allowed to continue constitutes a distinct and imminent danger to the health of the people who reside in the vicinity of the area where the trials are being conducted," it said.The original plea was moved in May and Juhi Chawla joined the court proceeding through video conferencing. Following the dismissal of the plea, Juhi Chawla had released a video saying she is not against 5G technology. The petition was only to seek the government's clarification on 5G that the technology is safe, the actor said at that time.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-is-of-june-you-come-now-court-to-juhi-chawla-on-her-plea-against-dismissal-of-5g-petition-101640251078019.html

Conducting a press conference, the Congress general secretary said that an impartial inquiry needs to be conducted into the allegations and if proven true, it would mean that the state's ruling party has been “looting” and “toying with” the devotions of countless people in the country who donated something or the other for the Ram Mandir Trust.“Almost every household in the country has donated something to Ram Mandir Trust,” said Priyanka Gandhi while addressing reporters in New Delhi. “A door-to-door campaign was held too. It is a matter of devotion and that is being toyed with. The pieces of land of Dalits, which could not have been purchased, were grabbed.”LIVE: Special Congress Party Briefing at the AICC HQ.प्रेस वार्ताhttps://t.co/Cn3AxDrdzkShe alleged that there were a few pieces of land that were of a much lower value than what they were sold to the trust at.“It means that there exists a scam regarding the money which was collected through the donation,” Gandhi claimed.Taking note of the fact that the Uttar Pradesh government has ordered a probe into the ‘land grab’ reports, the Congress leader said that the Yogi Adityanath administration cannot be conducting the inquiry since the interests of BJP functionaries and senior government officials are allegedly involved.“Yes, the UP government is appointing an inquiry commission to probe the allegations, who will be the ones conducting the investigation? These are officials at the district collector-level,” Gandhi said, demanding instead an “unbiased” inquiry headed by the Supreme Court.“The temple is being built on the orders of the Supreme Court; so it is only natural that the inquiry, too, should be conducted at the level of the top court,” said the Congress leader.Notably, a news report has claimed that MLAs, mayors, relatives of the commissioner, SDM and DIG bought land in Ayodhya after the Supreme Court announced the verdict in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, clearing the way for construction of the Ram temple.Soon after the report came out, the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (information), Navneet Sehgal, told the PTI news agency on Wednesday that “chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered the revenue department to probe the matter thoroughly”.Congress leaders have been attacking the government on the matter, with Rahul Gandhi charging that “Hindutva robs under the guise of religion”.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala termed it a “land scam”, charging there is an “open loot of land inside Ayodhya city by people connected to the BJP”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looting-devotion-of-countless-people-priyanka-gandhi-on-ayodhya-land-scam-101640244626982.html

The explosion took place in the washroom on the second floor at around 12.22pm. The second floor of the building houses eight courtrooms, but not many people were present on Thursday because of a strike by a section of lawyers. The area has been cordoned off by the police and the court premises is being vacated. One of the injured has been identified as advocate RS Mand.According to reports, the lawyers were on a strike and that's why the number of lawyers present on the premises on Thursday was fewer than any other day. It is not yet known whether the blast was from any cylinder as the second floor also houses the canteen of the court.

23-12-2021||India||Shashi Tharoor talks about Rahul Gandhi; says why he had signed G-23 letter||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said G-23, a group of 23 'rebel' Congress leaders who demanded more democracy in the party, was a media creation as 23 people happened to have signed the letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi. There could have been more people but only 23 could be reached as there was a lockdown at that time, Tharoor said. "I signed it because there was nothing exceptional... The letter says Congress should democratise itself more, we should revive the parliamentary board of the party, we should have elections to the elected seats of the working committee which are currently filled by nomination, we should revive the party at the grassroots," Tharoor said at the launch event of his latest book. Tharoor's claim comes at a time the party is staring at another crisis brewing in Uttarakhand as Harish Rawat expressed his helplessness in the party.Tharoor also claimed that all 23 leaders never met. "I did not think signing that, especially since people who were promoting it were very senior figures of the Congress party establishment, would cause as much offence as it turned out to cause. Indeed, it was seen as 23 people in rebellion and I do not think it was intended that way but has been seen that way."Focus on G23 leaders ahead of Congress organisational pollsIn August 2020, a group of 23 senior Congress leaders wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi seeking an overhaul within the party. The 23 leaders include Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Anand Sharma, PJ Kurien, Renuka Chaudhary, Milind Deora, Mukul Vasnik, Jitin Prasad (now in BJP), Bhipender Singh Hooda, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Veerappa Moily, Prithviraj Chauhan, Ajay Singh, Raj Babbar, Arvind Singh Lovely, Kaul Singh Thakur, Kuldeep Sharma, Yoganand Shastri, Sandeep Dixit, Vivek Thankha.'That is where we are now': Tharoor on Congress electionOn the issue of Congress getting an elected president, Tharoor said people who are there by bloodline can also get elected. "In fact, there is very little doubt that Rahul Gandhi, if he were willing to contest, would get elected against anybody else in the Congress because the electorate of party workers has a certain sense of allegiance to the Gandhi-Nehru family for decades now which is not going to be easily overcome," Tharoor said."In Rahul's case, in all fairness, he stepped aside, he even made a statement that 'it should not be me or anyone from my family', but the working committee went for Mrs (Sonia) Gandhi and pulled her out of retirement and said please lead us. So that is where we are now," he said."I would say that this is a phenomenon across all parties. In SP, was there any question that after Mulayam ji, it would be Akhilesh; in DMK, was there any question that after Karunanidhi, it is Stalin; in Shiv Sena after Balasahab Thackrey, it is Uddhav," Tharoor said.'Told party we should not disrupt Parliament'Tharoor said he believes that the opposition parties should not disrupt the parliamentary proceeding but should use it as a platform for debate. Going in for disruptions, the opposition has become marginalised and it is complicit in its own marginalisation, Tharoor said as the Winter Session of Parliament ended on Wednesday."To some degree, we are complicit in our own marginalisation, by going in for disruptions, we no longer have a choice to voice our positions for the nation to understand. But I recognise that mine is a minority view. I have not hidden my view and the party is very aware of my view that we should not disrupt, that we should use Parliament as a platform for debate, and do our rallies, dharnas and agitations elsewhere and on the streets," the Thiruvananthapuram MP said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-talks-about-rahul-gandhi-says-why-he-had-signed-g-23-letter-101640242029927.html

I have faith that Lord Kedarnath will provide me guidance in this situation," Rawat said.What happened in Uttarakhand?Harish Rawat's tweets have not made it clear exactly what happened in the state unit of the party. While speculations are rife that Harish Rawat may quit the Congress which will be a big jolt for the party in the poll-bound state, some political observers think the stage is not yet set for Rawat's exit as Rawat has been a trusted man of the Congress. Not part of the G-23, Rawat has the reputation to be the Congress's troubleshooter -- be it in Assam or in Punjab.Harish Rawat's advisor Surinder Aggarwal hinted at BJP's role in a conspiracy creating a rift inside the Congress. "Harish Rawat is a senior leader of Congress. If his posters are removed from Rahul Gandhi's rally in the presence of Devendra Yadav, then his role comes into doubt. There's a probability that Devendra Yadav is involved in the conspiracy. BJP may have used ED or CBI to threaten any of our members. They may have misguided our colleague to fulfil their motive of creating differences between Harish Rawat and our members. BJP has done this before and it is a small task for them," Rawat's advisor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harish-rawat-uttarakhand-congress-leaders-called-to-delhi-amid-fresh-row-101640236081621.html

The developmental trial of the missile was successful with the platform reaching a range of 500 kilometres.'Pralay' is India's first conventional ballistic missile and is an answer to any conventional missile attack from northern or western borders. The missile development is significant as India had no conventionally armed ballistic missile and was hampered by 'No First Use' nuclear policy. It is also the first time in history that two tests of conventional ballistic missiles were done successfully on consecutive days.Watch: Made-in-India new generation 'Pralay' missile successfully testedWednesday's missile range was 400 kilometres. The missile is an offensive weapon to destroy targets across land and sea and is Indian answer to any carrier task force of the adversary in future.The solid-fuel, battlefield missile developed by the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) is based on Prithvi Defence Vehicle from the Indian ballistic missile programme.‘Pralay’ is powered with a solid propellant rocket motor and other new technologies. The missile guidance system includes state-of-the-art navigation and integrated avionics, according to the DRDO.The advanced missile has been developed in a way to be able to defeat interceptor missiles. It has the ability to change its path after covering a certain range mid-air.After the missile test on Wednesday, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO and associated teams for this maiden development.He also complimented DRDO for the fast track development and successful launch of the modern surface-to-surface missile.

My salary is ₹11,000 monthly...I have not got any money for so long... I have been completely dependent on my parents and family for food. Other field staff, who have larger families, are lending...which they have to repay when we get our salaries. Christmas is our most important festival but none of us will be able to celebrate,” said Lal Vohbika, a guard.The staffers stay in the anti-poaching camp in the reserve’s core area for a week by turns. They patrol the core and buffer areas, conduct camera trapping and other conservation activities. “Our work involves a lot of risks. Hunting and poaching are common problems here. We have to spend a week in the anti-poaching camp which is difficult. At least we should be compensated on time. We did not go on strike till now mainly because of the hunting problem here,” said Vohbika.Mizoram’s principal chief conservator of forests Pu Jitendra Kumar said they were hoping to pay the staff salaries soon.National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) officials blamed the state government’s non-compliance with new regulations for the non-payment. “Earlier we used to transfer money and that would often get diverted by state departments for other purposes. Now under the new rules and the Public Financial Management System, payments will be made scheme-wise. So, the state government was supposed to open an account only for NTCA related payments. But the state government could not create that account. From our end, the money has been transferred. We are not sure why it has not reached the staff yet,” said an NTCA official, requesting anonymity.Wildlife Conservation Trust president Anish Andheria called the field staff the lifeblood of the protection mechanism in tiger reserves. “To not pay them for seven months is inhuman. They earn ₹250 to ₹300 daily... Unfortunately, this problem is not limited to Dampa, it is happening in many other parks. Because they are temporary staff, the state government does not seem to recognise them. They are faceless entities despite their unparalleled contribution. Undoubtedly, for tiger reserves, they are the most important defence mechanism in the absence of an adequate number of permanent staff.”The Status of Tigers, Copredators, and Prey in India report released last year noted reserves such as Dampa require resources and targeted management.Forest guard Zakhuma Don camera trapped a tiger in Dampa in June this year after seven years while an elusive Blue Pitta was photographed in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-go-on-strike-over-unpaid-wages-say-mizoram-s-dampa-tiger-reserve-staffers-101640235070089.html
23-12-2021||India||Manish Tewari speaks out on Harish Rawat issue, says ‘First Assam, then Punjab’||Congress G-23 leader Manish Tewari on Thursday posted a cryptic tweet criticising Harish Rawat and indirectly the Congress leadership, a day after senior Congress leader and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat stirred a fresh row for the Grand Old Party, expressing dissatisfaction over the factionalism in the state unit of the party.  Pointing out a pattern, Tewari said, "First Assam, then Punjab, now Uttarakhand." “Bhog poora hi paun gaye. Kasar na rahe jawe koi,” Tewari tweeted. Harish Rawat played a crucial role in the functioning of the party units in all these states. FIRST ASSAM THEN PUNJAB NOW UTTRAKHAND…..BHOG POORA HI PAUN GAYE KASAR NA RAHE JAWE KOI 😎@harishrawatcmuk https://t.co/yQYClbLRMBHarish Rawat, who was taking care of the affairs in Punjab and was the Congress's trusted man in resolving the issue between Navjot Sidhu and Amarinder Singh, which finally led to Amarinder Singh's exit from the CM post and then from the party, on Wednesday said his hands were being tied. He alleged non-cooperation from the party's Uttarakhand unit and dropped a hint that the idea that 'it is time to rest' has been crossing his mind."Isn't it strange, one has to swim in the sea in the form of forthcoming electoral battle, instead of cooperation, the organisation has turned away its face or is playing a negative role," Rawat said. "There are many crocodiles of the ruling dispensation. On whose directions one has to swim, their nominees are tying my hands and feet," he added.The cryptic tweets triggered speculations on whether Rawat is now finding himself in the place of Amarinder Singh, who claimed he was insulted by the Congress leadership. Later on Wednesday, Harish Rawat was asked to clarify his tweets to which he said, "When the time comes, I will call you (media) and share it with you. For now, enjoy this."Amarinder Singh, who has floated Punjab Lok Congress, to challenge Sidhu and the Congress apparently found a moment of divine justice in Harish Rawat's disgruntlement in the party and said, "You reap what you sow! All the best for your future endeavours (if there are any)"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manish-tewari-speaks-out-on-harish-rawat-issue-says-first-assam-then-punjab-101640233614670.html
23-12-2021||India||Delhi’s air crisis: Who pollutes, who suffers?||Monu, a 13-year-old living in a Delhi slum near the Yamuna river, was exposed on a particular day to an average of 150 micrograms per cubic metre (very poor) of PM2.5 while it is 35 (satisfactory) for 11-year-old Aamya, who resides in an apartment in a colony in GK-II in Delhi. So said a multimedia story (https://tinyurl.com/5au2kccx) by The New York Times in December 2020. Aamya and her family have access to air purifiers at home and in school even as her exposure to outdoor pollution is limited by air-conditioned cars, while the same doesn’t hold true for Monu.Chart 1 shows the exposure to PM 2.5 for both these children over 24 hours. As a result, Monu risks losing almost 5 years of his life, while Aamya half a year of hers. Both are avoidable. But how? The next three charts look at the problem of pollution from the lens of class and discuss possible ways out.What pollutes?Pollution is measured by the Air Quality Index (AQI), which is calculated separately for eight pollutants — PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ground-level ozone, ammonia, and lead — and the highest of these subindices is reported as AQI for that particular day. Since these pollutants are related to each other, controlling one will help control the others too. Instead of tracking all pollutants, the policy could focus on PM2.5, which measures all aerosols under 2.5 micrometers in diameter (our hair is almost 30 times as thick) and has contributions from all the other gaseous components.Chart 2 shows the source attribution for PM2.5. Three major contributors to pollution from the consumption side are — transport (private and public), fuel and electricity, and construction. Based on these numbers, 60% of AQI is contributed by consumption. But if these are the major sources, shouldn’t AQI remain similar through the year? It gets worse in winters not only because of stubble burning but also, among other factors, natural factors such as Delhi being shaped as a bowl, which traps pollutants for far longer as a result of the wind slowing down during the winter months.Who pollutes?It is beyond obvious that the affluent classes, as a result of their consumption patterns, pollute more than the poor but is it possible to quantify their respective contributions? It is difficult to provide an accurate measure but an approximate one can be derived from National Sample Survey (NSS) consumption data, which provides data on consumption of different deciles. We categorise different commodities in the consumption basket from the 2011-12 Consumption Expenditure Survey of the NSS according to the above mentioned three major sources of pollution. Based on the consumption basket of each decile and weighing them according to the shares of these three sources, we arrive at each decile’s share in total pollution. In chart 2, we show the share of each decile in the total pollution in Delhi. Chart 3 shows that the richest 10% of the population pollute 10 times as much as the poorest 10%.Who suffers?While all residents face the adverse health effects of pollution, the poor are more vulnerable to its ill-effects than the rich. This class difference comes out starkly in pollution related death data. NFHS does not generally provide reasons for death but in one of its rounds — the second (1998-99) — it had a question on the cause of death and two respiratory ailments were listed, both of which have a direct link to pollution: asthma and tuberculosis. This paper published in World Development (https://tinyurl.com/zhmp2evr) measured the difference in mortality across income groups. We club the classes in NSS to correspond to the NFHS category, using the above-mentioned paper’s methodology, to present a class funnel of contribution to the problem and its resulting effects (chart 4). While the contribution looks like a funnel with the high-income category polluting the most (chart 4 -a), the burden of death falls unduly on the bottom (the two pyramid like structures in chart 4-b). Those who contribute the least to the problem bear the maximum brunt of it.What is to be done?The pollution crisis needs a systemic solution. Lockdowns are no solutions, nor are the symbolic odd-even schemes or “red light on, engine off” placards at the traffic signals. We need to hit at the source of it — commodities that pollute and the classes that consume most of it. But how does one do that?Some of these solutions are low-hanging fruits. Energy efficiency in India is one of the lowest in the world, which means for every unit of consumption, a lot of energy is wasted. To give an example, air conditioners running in houses/offices with poor or no insulation would invariably mean higher consumption of electricity and more pollutants in the air. Government of India estimates (https://beeindia.gov.in/content/buildings) show that at least 30-40% of energy can be saved purely by retrofitting, insulating buildings and offices, steps which can be incentivised through policy.Some other solutions are more difficult but much needed. Delhi needs to consider a pollution tax . It can be levied at the source of energy usage — fuel and electricity — since that is the easiest to implement. Additionally yearly excise tax on cars, high parking charges as well as congestion charges can be implemented. A part of this tax needs to be spent on overhauling the public transport infrastructure of the city with dedicated bus lanes to ensure reliability, a much larger fleet of buses, cycle lanes (to ensure last mile connectivity) and pedestrian-safe pavements. Driving cars should become expensive but only after a better, cleaner, and, most importantly, reliable alternative has been provided.The problem with such a tax is that the burden will fall unduly on the poor since they will be paying the same price as the rich for a given commodity. To address this regressiveness, one could implement a “pollution tax and clean dividend” policy. The tax collected, after deducting the infrastructural spending, is distributed equally among all citizens of Delhi as a “clean dividend”. The poor will gain at the cost of the rich. Let’s say a pollution tax of 100 is collected of which the rich have contributed 80 since their overall consumption is much higher than the poor, who contribute 20. After spending, say 40 on infra, when the remaining 60 is distributed as a clean dividend equally, they get 30 each, which means a net gain of 10 for the poor. In reality, this net gain will be even higher since their proportion in the population is generally higher. This clean dividend can be in cash or kind. If implemented in kind, it could be in the form of access to commodities such as food through ration shops, electricity, health and transport up to a certain amount.We suggest the implementation of pollution tax to be staggered and only after the infrastructure is in place. This is for two reasons. The onset of a sudden high tax may not be acceptable to most people, as was the case in France with the “yellow vest” movement. However, if people receive benefits from Day One, including infrastructural development, and are then presented with a gradual tax, they will be more likely to buy into it. Delhi residents, especially the wealthy, need to be convinced that current and future inhabitants of the city, especially their children, will have a healthier life with the implementation of such a clean and just policy.Rohit Azad is an assistant professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

The campaign is being implemented in a bid to increase the Covid-19 vaccination percentage in the district.According to the guidelines, anyone who seeks to enter these places should at least be administered with on dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The announcement for the same was first made on December 16, after a meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in Nashik."The 'no vaccine-no entry' rule will be implemented in all government, semi-government and private offices, business and industrial establishments, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, theaters, cinema halls, lawns, marriage halls, APMCs and all other public establishments and programmes from December 23," the administration stated in the official order.The campaign is also being launched in view of the rise in Omicron cases, the latest and three times more contagious mutation than its previous variants -- Delta, Delta Plus. "Although the danger posed by the Omicron variant of the virus is less, it spreads rapidly. Against this backdrop, the speed of vaccination will be increased in the district," said district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the meeting, according to an ANI report.The responsibility of implementing the 'no vaccine-no entry' rule is on the heads of the concerned establishments, according to the guidelines. Those who are found in violation of the rules, may face strict action towards them.Maharashtra has a total of 54 cases of Omicron, the second-highest after the national capital (57), according to the tally by the Union health ministry. It is followed by Telangana (24), Karnataka (19), Rajasthan (18), Kerala (15), and Gujarat (14). Jammu and Kashmir has reported three Omicron cases, while Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have two cases each. Total the country has over 200 cases of Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-no-vaccine-no-entry-campaign-to-kick-off-in-nashik-from-today-101640232793505.html

According to the report, the land management authority has already issued a public notice for the same.There are more than 1,500 such families in Delhi who came from Pakistan during Partition who do not have property title, according to Livehindustan report. Such families can now claim ownership rights on their properties in the city. The work of giving ownership rights in the unauthorised colonies in Delhi is going on, it added.The ownership rights will be given in colonies that settled on the government land, Livehindustan also reported.According to a public notice issued by the DDA, the properties of those who had built residential houses on government land at that time will be regularised. In colonies where legal cases are underway will need a no-objection certificate from the respective department, according to the report.People seeking the ownership title of a property will need to pay a certain fee according to the circle rate. After this, they will be able to get construction rights as well on the basis of the approved map.Recently, more than 50 properties of the Parda bagh area in Dryaganj were given the benefit of ownership after the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) passed a similar proposal in October.SDMC’s order was a result of a two-decade battle for ownership rights started by Pankaj Bhatnagar, president of the Parda Bagh resident welfare association. Since 1998, Bhatnagar has been running from pillar to post to rectify the what he said was an “anomaly” in the Master Plan of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dda-approves-ownership-rights-to-refugees-who-came-from-pakistan-after-partition-101640232254288.html
23-12-2021||India||Man who claims to be Sushant Singh Rajput's fan arrested for threatening Aaditya Thackeray||The cyber cell of the Mumbai crime branch has arrested a man on the charges of issuing threatening messages to Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, news agency ANI reported. The man, Jaisingh Rajput, claims to be a fan of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. According to reports, Jaisingh called the minister on December 8 and as the minister did not receive the call, he left a message. The arrest was made from Bengaluru.Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik said the threat might be connected to the organisations that killed Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. “The manner in which Aaditya Thackeray received a threat letter, we suspect if it's connected to the organisations that murdered (Narendra) Dabholkar and (Govind) Pansare. I too have received such threats. We've written for an investigation into it. I think it is a serious matter. After losing power, some organisations are behaving in this manner. Home Department will probe it and find out who is behind it. They will be nabbed and punished,” the minister said to ANI.The CBI has been probing the death of the Bollywood actor who was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his residence in Bandra on June 14, 2020. There has been no headway in the case so far and the central agency, in the past, issued statements clarifying that the investigation is not over and the agency is probing the death case from all angles.The investigation will take some more time as the CBI last month approached the United States through a formal channel, seeking assistance in retrieving deleted data of the late actor's social media account. “We don’t want to leave any loose ends before we finalise the case. We want to know if there are any particular deleted chats or posts which could be useful in the case," an officer told HT.Apart from CBI, two other central agencies, ED and the NCB are probing the money laundering and the drugs angle pertaining to the case.In the initial investigation, the Mumbai Police ruled out any foul play in the actor's death. The medical board of AIIMS also said the actor died of suicide.In connection with the drug-related case, the special NDPS court has recently denied bail to Sushant Singh Rajput's flatmate Siddharth Pithani. The court said photographs and videos recovered by the NCB show that Pithani was passing contraband material to Sushant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-who-claims-to-be-ssr-s-fan-arrested-for-threatening-aaditya-thackeray-101640230792245.html

While the central government has already issued specific instructions to states after noting the “initial signs of surge”, the states have also strengthened curbs in districts once again reporting high case positivity rates with measures such as bringing back the night curfew, strictly regulating large gatherings, and putting prohibitions on the numbers of guests who can attend marriage ceremonies and functions.The following are the set of restrictions imposed in several states/cities in view of the Omicron alert:MumbaiThe Mumbai Police has said that in the wake of the Omicron concerns, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) will be imposed in the city from December 16 to December 31, a period covering Christmas and New Year eve, banning large gatherings and parties common in this time of the year.Only people up to 50 per cent of the capacity at a venue will be allowed to attend any event; organisers of programmes should be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.According to the order, people have to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour at all times. All public transport shall be used only by fully-vaccinated persons, and all persons travelling into Maharashtra will either have to be fully vaccinated or carry an RT-PCR test valid for 72 hours.DelhiThe Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday directed district magistrates (DMs) to ensure no Christmas and New Year gathering takes place in the national capital.However, restaurants and bars will continue to operate with up to 50 per cent of the seating capacity. Marriage-related gatherings are permitted with a maximum of 200 people in attendance.The DMs have also been directed to identify potential Covid-19 superspreader areas ahead of Christmas and New Year and tighten the enforcement machinery to ensure people follow social-distancing norms and wear masks.In these identified pockets, “concerted action” will be taken according to the prescribed protocol – which includes test, track and treatment, prompt and effective containment measures, and enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour.BengaluruBengaluru, like the rest of Karnataka, will see fresh restrictions on New Year 2022 celebrations. However, in a silver lining for partygoers, the Basavaraj Bommai-led state government has allowed fetes and festivities in clubs and restaurants but only with 50 per cent seating capacity. According to the orders, there cannot be any special event like disk jockey (DJ) nights and such, either. Moreover, full vaccination will be mandatory for everyone at the places of celebrations. The curbs will be in effect from December 30 to January 2, a period only covering the post-Christmas and New Year's celebrations.NoidaNoida and Lucknow are two cities in Uttar Pradesh where the Yogi Adityanath-led government has invoked Section 144 of the CrPC till December 31 keeping in mind the Omicron concerns and the upcoming Christmas and New Year's festivities.“Section 144 CrPC has been implemented in Gautam Buddh Nagar till December 31 keeping the law and order situation in mind,” the Gautam Buddh Nagar Police said in a circular issued earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-scare-from-delhi-to-mumbai-curbs-return-ahead-of-christmas-holiday-season-101640226822218.html

According to news agency PTI, the development has anguished the entire state administration.PM Modi took part in the second meeting of the national committee on ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, in which other chief ministers were also present. Banerjee expressed her displeasure for not getting a chance to speak at the virtual meeting.Hindustan Times’ sister publication Livehindustan quoted a state secretariat official to report that Banerjee’s name was not in the list of speakers.This is not the first time that Banerjee has accused the Centre of not giving her a chance to speak. A similar incident took place in May this year, when the Prime Minister held a meeting with chief ministers to review the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation and government machinery’s preparedness.At that time, Banerjee had said that she felt “insulted”. The chief minister had said that instead of sending an official, she herself came for the meeting to urge the central government for Covid-19 vaccines.In Wednesday’s meeting, PM Modi said that the pandemic has taught new lessons and shattered the existing structures which will lead to the emergence of a “new world order” in the post-Covid era, according to a government statement.Emphasising that this is an opportune time to set eyes on 2047 when the country will celebrate 100 years of Independence, he said the current generation will be at the helm of affairs then and the nation’s destiny will be in their hands.“Therefore, it is important to decide what we must inculcate in them now so that they will be able to make big contributions in the future towards the country,” the Prime Minister said. “We have always insisted upon and fought for our rights but there is a higher greatness in following one’s duties,” he added. It is only when people follow their duties religiously that they are able to ensure rights of others automatically, PM Modi said.At the meeting, culture ministry secretary Govind Mohan gave a presentation on the overview of activities of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, being held to mark the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-unhappy-over-not-getting-a-chance-to-speak-at-pm-s-meeting-101640225167011.html

On Monday and Tuesday, they blocked railway tracks at different places in Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, and Hoshiarpur, affecting the movement of as many as 156 trains.According to Ferozepur division railway officials, 84 trains were cancelled, 47 short-terminated and 25 short-originated.Meanwhile, a group of farmers also staged a sit-in on Wednesday outside the office of the deputy commissioner (DC) in Ludhiana.DC Varinder Kumar Sharma, who was not allowed to move out for lunch by the protesting farmers, finally came out of his office in the evening under a security cover.In the wake of this agitation, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi will be meeting the protesting farmers to discuss the demands placed before the government. Ahead of this all-important meet, members of as many as 32 farm unions met in Ludhiana on Saturday to finalise their agenda.What are the farmers demanding?“Farm debt waiver, cancellation of FIRs lodged against farmers during agitation, and low compensation given for land acquired for highway projects are major issues that we will take up,” said farm leaders Harinder Lakhowal, Prem Singh Bhangu, Hardev Singh Sandhu, Kirpa Singh, and Kiranjit Singh Sekhon.Also Read | Punjab polls: Farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni launches political partyBhangu added, “The state government had assured us that FIRs lodged against farmers during the stir in the state will be cancelled and the issue of cases lodged in Chandigarh will be taken up with the governor. Nothing has happened.”The government will be pressured to regularise contractual employees, who have been on protest across the state. Farmers said they also demand the suspension of the DSP who cane-charged protesting ETT Teachers.

23-12-2021||India||Opposition leaders meet Naidu after Parliament ends||After a bitter fight with the ruling dispensation during the winter session of Parliament, leaders belonging to opposition parties on Wednesday gathered at Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu’s chamber, people familiar with the matter said. Naidu set the mood for friendly talks when he quipped how Dravida Munnetra Kazagham’s Tiruchi Siva, who usually wears a mundu (a garment worn around the waist by south Indians) and a shirt, was “looking smart in the suit”.Some other leaders took the opportunity to suggest Trinamool Congress’s vocal floor leader Derek O’ Brien be made chairman of a House panel. But a witty Opposition leader said that O’Brien refused to agree with the suggestion as he believes that he may lose opportunities to disrupt the Upper House, the people cited above said without naming the leader. The leaders at the chamber held some serious discussions, too. A leader pointed out that the government had taken no action on the recommendations of a panel set up by Naidu on Online Child Pornography, the people cited above said. To this, leader of Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, quickly assured that he would follow up on the matter with the ministries of child and women development and information technology. The leaders also spent time discussing the lack of attendance in House panel meetings. A witty Congress leader told Naidu that the latter should give the Opposition “adequate notice of seven ministers meeting him to suspend some of us for the budget session”, referring to the incidents that led to suspension of 12 MPs in the winter session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-leaders-meet-naidu-after-parliament-ends-101640200150665.html
23-12-2021||India||32 women commandos ready to join CRPF, protect Z+ personalities||The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which also handles VIP security, will soon have 32 women commandos ready to be deployed in the security detail of some leaders. The move means that Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former prime minister Manmohan Singh’s wife Gursharan Kaur, will have women deployed as personal security officers in their security detail.“In 2019, we started a VIP security wing and initially it had only men. However, we started training women to be part of the team and now the women will be posted with the VIPs by the second week of January,’’ said a spokesperson of the paramilitary force which took over VIP protection responsibilities in 2019, when a change in law                limited the Special Protection Group or SPG to only providing security for the Prime Minister or for former prime ministers and their families  for a maximum of five years. The spokesperson confirmed that the women personnel would be attached to the three women but  “on a need basis’’ but added that will be deployed with other Z+ category protectees.  “The Congress president and Ms Gandhi Vadra had not asked for women personnel because they believe in the professionalism of the force.’’ said the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. When the SPG cover was removed two years ago,  the Congress objected to what it saw as petty politics. The SPF cover did have women officers.When a VIP is travelling, it’s the state government which is responsible for their security but the immediate security to their person is provided by CRPF. Each VIP protectee has five to seven guards and so this election season may see the inclusion of women in this detail.These commandos, when deployed for house protection, will frisk female visitors and will be part of the overall security detail of the VIP’s house during tours. The women commandos, like their male counterparts,   will carry arms, ballistic protection and other gadgets as required on the job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/32-women-commandos-ready-to-join-crpf-protect-z-personalities-101640200146987.html
23-12-2021||India||Anti-conversion bill to be discussed today, says Karnataka assembly speaker||Karnataka assembly speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri on Wednesday said the discussions on the controversial anti-conversion bill will be held on Thursday morning, following requests by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the principal opposition, Congress.The contentious “Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Act, 2021” was scheduled for discussions on Wednesday after it was tabled amid opposition from the Congress a day before in the lower house in the ongoing winter session in Belagavi, about 505 kms from Bengaluru.Congress insisted that there needed to be more discussions on problems of Northern Karnataka, which has districts that are among the aridest and backward in the country, and not prioritise the anti-conversion bill.“Extend the session for a few more days,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition said, reasoning that the legislature was being held in Belagavi after almost 2.5 years.The BJP continued to insist on a discussion on the bill, which is an extension of its plans to introduce laws in line with its core ideology. The proposal of introducing such a law in September had triggered protests and attacks against members of the Christian community, who the right-wing believes, is converting people by force or allurement.“We don’t know how you will manage but please allow for the bill to be passed by tomorrow (Thursday) noon as we have to send it to the council as well,” JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s law, parliamentary and minor irrigation said.The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) have formally opposed the bill with the former staging a walkout on Tuesday afternoon when the bill was tabled in the assembly.Congress has also sought that the session is extended for a few more days since the discussions have not yet been complete, especially concerning the development of the northern districts of Karnataka.Congress has also asked that the joint and budget session be extended to have more comprehensive debates.“Decision on extending the duration of the legislature session, including the joint session and budget session in the coming days would be taken after due discussion. It would provide more time for meaningful debates in the house,” Basavaraj Bommai, the chief minister of Karnataka said.“Opposition parties should naturally get more time and importance. A system of allotting time to a political party according to its strength in the house is in practice in the Lok Sabha. The problem could be resolved if the same system is adopted here,” he added.He added that along with the extension of the duration of the session, a close look is also needed to examine the effectiveness of the debates witnessed in the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticonversion-bill-to-be-discussed-today-says-karnataka-assembly-speaker-101640200098354.html
23-12-2021||India||Both Covid-19 doses must for access to public places from Jan 1: Haryana govt||Only fully vaccinated adults will be allowed access to public spaces like shopping malls, restaurants and cinema halls in Haryana from January 1, 2022, state’s health and home minister Anil Vij said on Wednesday, adding the vaccine is the biggest protection from Covid-19, including its various variants.Replying to a question in the ongoing winter session of the Haryana Assembly, Vij said, “From January 1, 2022, any eligible person who has not taken both doses of Covid vaccine will not be permitted in malls, hotels, restaurants, marriage palaces, cinema halls, offices, banks or any such places that attracts crowds.”An order was issued in this regard by additional chief secretary, health, government of Haryana, Rajeev Arora. According to the order, deputy commissioners (DCs) of all 22 districts in the state have been asked to direct head of offices or in-charge to constitute teams to ensure that only fully vaccinated people are allowed access to public places. The DCs have also been asked to constitute multi-disciplinary teams to check the implementation of the restrictions.The move is aimed at pushing reluctant or indifferent individuals to get the second shot of Covid-19 vaccine. Till Wednesday, Haryana has vaccinated around 93% of its eligible population with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while little over 60% have been fully vaccinated. Neighbouring Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand have a better second dose coverage than Haryana.The order said that a large number of beneficiaries were due and overdue for long for inoculation of second dose of coronavirus vaccine. “New variants of coronavirus are emerging frequently and recently Omicron cases have shown an upward trend. Looking into the current scenario, steps need to be taken for increasing coverage of vaccination to mitigate spread of coronavirus,” the order said.As per the order issued on Wednesday, only fully vaccinated persons will be allowed entry in public places like private and public sector banks, religious places, petrol and CNG stations, LPG cylinder collection centres, sugar mills, milk booths, ration shops restaurants, bars, hotels, grain and vegetable markets, departmental stores, liquor and wine shops, shopping malls and complexes, cinema halls, Haats, local market and places of public gathering.To travel from bus stands and railways stations, people will have to get both doses of Covid-19 vaccine, the order said. Besides, parks, yogshalas, gym and fitness centres have also been directed to allow only fully vaccinated individuals.ACS, health, Rajeev Arora said those allowing unvaccinated persons access in shops, malls cinemas etc. would be booked under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act. A separate order by the State Disaster Management Authority will be issued to this effect.The state government has also made vaccination mandatory for above 18 students of colleges, polytechnics. Truck and auto-rickshaw unions will allow only fully vaccinated passengers.No individual including government servants will be allowed to visit government offices without being fully vaccinated. The civil surgeons have also been directed to depute vaccination teams where and whenever there is a demand by office in charge for on-the-spot vaccination or for regular vaccination camps at places of gathering, the order added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-doses-of-covid-vaccine-must-for-access-to-public-places-from-january-1-haryana-govt-101640200096756.html
23-12-2021||India||Lookout notice against Akali Dal leader Majithia in drugs case||The Union home ministry on Wednesday issued a lookout circular (LOC) against Shiromani Akali Dal MLA and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia a day after he was booked in a drugs case by the Punjab Police .The notice, which is issued to prevent and monitor the entry and exit of persons who may be wanted by different law enforcement agencies, was issued by the home ministry’s Bureau of Immigration on the request of the state police, which is trying to arrest the 46-year-old MLA, who was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act following a report submitted by a Harpreet Singh Sidhu, an additional director general of police and the chief of a special task force (STF) in 2018. The STF was formed by the Congress government in 2017 to look into drug cases.The copy of the notice has been sent to the additional director general of police (ADGP), counter intelligence. “The lookout circular shall remain in force until and unless a deletion request is received by the Bureau of Immigration from the originator itself,” the notice, a copy of which HT has seen, said.A lookout circular is a letter used by authorities to check if a travelling person is wanted by the police. If immigration officers of a country have a LOC, then the offender can be nabbed at the airport.If the immigration officers of a country have LOC against any offender then the person can be nabbed at the airport.A Special Investigating Team (SIT) constituted by Punjab DGP to look into the case raided various places in Chandigarh, Himachal and the national capital to arrest the former minister. The team comprises assistant inspector general Balraj Singh, deputy superintendent of police Kulwant Singh and DSP Rajesh Kumar.According to a 49-page FIR registered at the State Crime Police Station in Mohali, Majithia has been booked for cognisable offences under Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises etc. to be used for commission of an offence), 27(A) ( financing activities indulging in production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, use or consumption, import and export or deal in any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of the NDPS Act. These sections have the provision of imprisonment up to 10 years along with a fine as decided by the court.HT has seen a copy of the FIR.“According to the findings of the STF report, prima facie there is sufficient evidence to further investigate the role of Majithia as regards the allegations made in application under scrutiny,” the FIR said. The STF chief’s report was prepared after the analysis of an investigation done by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the Jagdish Bhola drug case -- a drug network involving Arjuna award-winning wrestlerand dismissed deputy superintendent of police Jagdish Bhola that was busted by the Punjab Police in 2013.The drug menace and efforts for its eradication have always remained at the centre of the political discourse in Punjab for the past one decade. Putting the big fish behind bars has been a major promise of the Congress government to voters.In 2018, the STF chief was given the task of analysing the former Akali minister’s role on the directions of Punjab & Haryana high court. His report, based on the statements of drug case accused Jagjit Singh Chahal and Maninder Singh Bittu Aulakh to the ED, are part of the FIR. On February 1, 2018, the STF had submitted its status report in the Punjab & Haryana high court, which later sought comments from the Punjab DGP and the home secretary. Since then, it was lying in a sealed cover in the court.The FIR also mentioned the legal opinion of Punjab’s advocate general DS Patwalia, who strongly pushed for action on the STF chief’s report. “In my considered opinion which has been formed after having gone through the proceedings of the court, there is no impediment/embargo for the STF or any state agency to act upon the report submitted in the court. In fact, the court has made it categorically clear that law enforcement agencies must act upon the said reports in accordance with the law,” he said, according to the FIR.Patwalia’s opinion is different from that of his predecessor, who advised against acting on the report without the consent of the high court.Majithia is an influential member of the SAD, the brother of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, and held revenue, renewal energy and information and public relations portfolios in the Punjab government.The process to register the case was initiated after DGP Sidharth Chattopadhyaya wrote to the director, Bureau of Investigation (BoI), on December 20, two days after taking charge as the officiating DGP of Punjab.The FIR has been registered on the complaint of the station house officer (SHO), state crime police station, inspector Kailash Bahadur.A special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted to investigate the case.The move led to a political backlash from SAD, which accused that the ruling Congress of trying to settle political scores ahead of assembly elections scheduled for early next year.“The Congress government changed two DGPs and three Bureau of Investigation (BOI) Directors to implement its vendetta. Eventually, it was a DGP who was not even eligible for empanelment as a regular DGP who was given charge to falsely book Majithia as a quid-pro-quo. The party will expose this false case both in the courts as well as publicly,” SAD chief Sukhbir Badal said in Sultanpur Lodhi of Kapurthala“God’s justice can be delayed but not denied. We did struggle to give justice to those who ruined Punjab’s youth for years. At last, Waheguru ji has heard prayer of Punjab. Only God has the power to do justice, we have only become means,” state home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa tweeted, using the hashtag #majithiainprisonsoon.
23-12-2021||India||12 Rajya Sabha MPs suspended to manufacture majority: Opposition||With both houses of Parliament being adjourned sine die a day before schedule, the Congress and Trinamool Congress (TMC), two opposition powerhouses, on Wednesday alleged that the government had suspended 12 MPs to “manufacture” a majority in the House for quick passage of legislations.Both parties refused to take responsibility for the logjam in Parliament.As proceedings in the Rajya Sabha, which witnessed maximum disruptions over the suspensions of opposition lawmakers, were concluded for the season, the Congress, for the first time, revealed that it was ready to read a statement to express regret over the behaviour of the suspended MPs in the last session and end the logjam.“We came prepared to raise issues such as unemployment, inflation and Chinese aggression. But the government was not eager to discuss any issue. We were 120 MPs, they were 118. They wanted to manufacture a majority and the suspension was part of the government’s plan,” leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters here.“It’s wrong to say that Opposition parties did not run the house. As soon as we said something, they would adjourn the House. The chairman adjourned Rajya Sabha due to government pressure,” he added.Speaking on the row over the suspension of the MPs, Kharge said: “I said that whatever happened, it was done. On the same day (November 29, when the MPs were suspended) I was ready to read a statement to express regret on behalf of everyone. Why should we increase the problem? …despite our best efforts, they (the government) did not listen to us.”HT on December 18 reported how the Congress had prepared a draft statement, containing the phrase “regrettable incidents”, to be read out by Kharge in the House.Speaking on similar lines, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said: “I personally met the Chairman, leader of the house Piyush Goyal, and Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi. Kharge told Goyal on the evening of November 29 and on the morning of November 30 that if you want, I will stand up as LOP and say that what happened in the monsoon session is a matter of regret…”Congress’ Lok Sabha floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury alleged that the Opposition was not allowed to speak on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence among other issues. “As soon as they heard L of Lakhimpur, our microphone would be turned off,” he said, accusing the government of trying to be “Bahubali of bahumat”.Chowdhury emphasised that the Opposition came to Parliament with a clear intent to allow the house to run and discuss issues such as the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and demand the resignation of junior minister for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra, whose son has been accused of running over farmers. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the October incident.TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien, who was suspended on Tuesday for hurling a rule book at the chair pointed how the Opposition’s planned protest lasted the entire season.“While we maintained distance with the Congress, we coordinated through CPIM, DMK and Shiv Sena,” he said.O’Brien was referring to the growing distance between the Congress and TMC, especially after the latter poached several lawmakers and senior leaders from the former in the past few months.The TMC leader said the winter session set “a very good example of Opposition fighting for democracy against the BJP”.
23-12-2021||India||Kerala high court grants ₹1.5L to girl accused of theft||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday ordered the state to pay a compensation of ₹1.5 lakh to a minor girl and her father who were accused by a woman police officer of stealing her mobile phone and were questioned in public.Single bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran also imposed ₹25,000 as the cost of the legal expenses and directed the government to take disciplinary action against the officer. The petitioners, an 8-year-old girl and father, had moved the court two months ago seeking compensation of ₹50 lakh from the government for humiliating them in public in Attingal, Thiruvananthapuram on August 27. According to the petition, they were watching movement of cargo headed to Vikram Sarabhai Research Centre on that day. The pink police was part of the police deployment to control the public. When a woman officer misplaced her mobile phone, she accused the father-daughter duo, who were standing near the police vehicle, of stealing it. Both were questioned in public by the officer and the girl was frisked, the petition added. According to the petition, the officer’s phone was found in the vehicle a few minutes later and the police team left the scene immediately without tendering an apology to the girl. A video clip of the incident surfaced on social media after which the police officer was transferred and asked to undergo behavioral training. Though the police officer tendered an apology, the father-daughter refused to accept. “We cannot let our daughters grow up in anger; immediate remedial steps should be taken. No one can dispute that her Fundamental Right under Article 21 to lead a dignified life,” the judge observed while delivering the verdict. The ruling comes as a setback to the state government which opposed the father-daughter plea and insisted that there was no need to pay compensation. The court also recorded that it expected the state to rise in defence of the petitioner since she was “its daughter” as well. It expressed disappointment at the refusal of the state government to acknowledge the trauma she went through. The court also said disciplinary action should be taken against the officer. Earlier, while hearing the petition, the court asked the state government what it proposes to do to assuage feelings of an 8-year-old girl and her father so as to ensure her faith in humanity and police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-grants-1-5l-to-girl-accused-of-theft-101640200089584.html

Polio-stricken, once Salim Kumar (38) gets into his specially-modified car with the help of two persons, he swifts away to reach the needy. Since 2019, Salim is the most sought after person in Ranni town of Pathanamthitta district, where he has helped more than 2,000 Covid patients reach the hospital in the past two years. At the start of the Covid-19 outbreak when people dreaded to come out, Salim also ensured proper burial to many in his hometown. Even government agencies in the district, at times, rely heavily on him. “Crippled below the waist, I need help from others to wear the PPE kits. For me, a person’s life is important, and at times I have to deal with them without PPE kits. If you have the will you, don’t have to worry. I didn’t test positive for Covid until now,” Salim said on Wednesday, adding that setbacks in personal life and rigours of daily grind turned him to social service. “I witnessed terrific scenes in last two years, and they steeled my resolve further. In the initial days, I came across a Covid-infected family that was without food for three days. At times, I arranged food and medicines also to the needy,” he said. Talking about his struggle, Salim said that he moves around in a wheelchair, and after his wife separated from him four years ago, leaving two minor children behind, he thought of ending life several times. “I studied till class 10 and then ventured into many fields. First, I opened a shop and later ran a music sound system shop, but all flopped, and debt mounted. But once I took a deep dive into social service, I forget about all sorrows,” he said. He said he initially formed a Whatsapp group of local youngsters called ‘Athikayam Brothers’ (Athikayam is a remote village in Pathanamthitta) and started co-ordinating voluntary works. Soon, help poured in from different quarters. “I never ask for money. But some people who can afford to give me fuel charges. Many good samaritans also help me financially,” said the 38-year-old. “At one point in time, I used to get 20 calls a day. I started living in my vehicle since I need assistance to get into my vehicle, which wasted time. Even post-midnight, I took patients to the hospital and saved many lives,” he said, adding that once he drove more than 250 kms to the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border in Walayar to pick two stranded Covid? patients. Salim was felicitated by the Asianet News channel on Tuesday in Kochi and the main guest at the function, M A Yousef Ali, chairman of retail giant Lulu Group, promised him a house and his dream of a modified ambulance. “I feel small before you. I salute your grit and passion,” Ali said after felicitating him. Actor Mamooty, who was present, also showered praises on Salim. “Owning a home and an ambulance have always been my dreams. Since they will be full filled, I will devote more time for the needy. I will also work for the differently-abled,” he said.

In the case of the 2016 Rafale deal, this was 50%.The MBDA weapons on the Indian Rafales are the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, MICA multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles.In a report tabled in Parliament in September 2020, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had made critical observations after a scrutiny of the status of a raft of offset contracts — including the September 2016 Rafale deal — signed between 2005 and 2018.The country’s top auditor said that Dassault Aviation and MBDA had not confirmed the transfer of technology (ToT) to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), an integral part of the contract.The induction of Rafale jets is expected to be completed by February 2022, with 32 of the 36 ordered already delivered to the Indian Air Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-deal-india-imposes-penalty-for-delay-in-offsets-duty-101640200033699.html

An order was issued by the state’s finance department in this regard to administrative secretaries, divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners on Wednesday, asking them to inform the employees that they should register their vaccination certification number for both jabs with its web-based human resource portal.The finance department, which made the provision for entering the vaccination certificate number in the Integrated Human Resource Management System (iHRMS), also asked the departments to link the vaccination particulars with the salary module. “If any employee has got one dose administered, then they should register the number of that certificate. In vaccination certificate details are not furnished, the employee’s salary with not be released,” read the order, which is likely to come into effect from January 1, 2022. The government order comes amid fresh concerns caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and the Centre issuing an advisory to states and Union territories to stay on alert and increase scrutiny and vaccination. Meanwhile, Sukhchain Singh Khehra, president of Punjab Civil Secretariat Employees’ Association, said the government should not impose such orders in a hurried manner. “The employees are fully aware of the Covid threat and almost 80% to 90% have got themselves vaccinated. They must be given time to register their vaccination particular on the portal. If salaries are cut or withheld, we will protest,” Khehra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/furnish-vaccine-certificate-to-get-salaries-punjab-govt-employees-told-101640200032199.html
23-12-2021||India||National Oxygen Stewardship Programme: Centre to train health care workers to rationally utilise medical oxygen||The Union government on Wednesday launched an initiative to train health care workers in rational utilisation of medical oxygen to prevent wastage as part of its preparedness for any possible surge in Covid-19 cases. As part of the National Oxygen Stewardship Programme, at least one oxygen steward will be identified and trained in each district across the country, the Union health ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. “These trained professionals would be responsible for leading the training on oxygen therapy and management in their respective districts and also support audit of oxygen delivery and preparedness for a surge scenario,” said the statement. During the peak of the second Covid-19 wave, Delhi, for example, witnessed a major medical oxygen crisis. At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,300 Covid-19 cases in a day on April 20, and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 22. The government on July 20 informed Parliament that there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen and it peaked at nearly 9,000 MT compared to 3,095 MT in the first wave. “Request for data on the subject was emailed to all states and UTs including the last email sent on November 29, 2021. In response, only two states (Punjab and Arunachal Pradesh) have responded,” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya informed the Lok Sabha on December 3. He was responding to a question on whether the government had sought a report or data from states and Union territories regarding deaths of Covid-19 patients due to oxygen shortage in various hospitals across the country during the second wave. “The initiative aims to empower all health care workers engaged in oxygen management and administration with the essential knowledge and skills to ensure rational utilisation and avoid any wastage of medical oxygen, especially in resource constraint settings...,” the health ministry said. The government has sanctioned at least 1,500 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants, of which 1,463 have been commissioned, including 1,225 that have been installed and commissioned under PM CARES Fund in every district of the country. All states and Union territories have been asked to install PSA plants in public health facilities and to facilitate installation of such plants in private facilities as well. “Oxygen is life saving and critically important in the treatment of several illnesses, not just Covid-19. The country witnessed an increased oxygen demand during the pandemic. Hence, the rational use of oxygen has become mandatory and need of the hour,” said Bharati Pravin Pawar, minister of state for health and family welfare, during the launch of National Oxygen Stewardship Programme at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Health officials, meanwhile, said the government is making all efforts to ensure there is optimal utilisation of resources at hand. “Resource constraint is faced by all countries but it is important that the available resources are used prudently; the focus of oxygen steward initiative is on ensuring efficiency in oxygen administration,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog. The Centre has also set up OxyCare, a dashboard that disseminates information on the available oxygen stock for its better distribution. “The Covid-19 pandemic not only accelerated the demand for medical oxygen but also the need for its timely delivery; while the Union government has supported the states in setting up and strengthening oxygen production and delivery mechanisms, variable gaps were observed in the training of professionals involved in the administration of oxygen. This workshop aims to repurpose, re-orient and upskill the existing manpower in order to make sure that any untoward incident arising due to the pandemic gets managed professionally without any undue stress on the systems,” said Rajesh Bhushan, health secretary, Union government.

23-12-2021||India||Telangana: Maoists kill ex-sarpanch branding him as police informer||Telangana police on Wednesday found the body of a former sarpanch at the Kothapalli forests on the Andhra Pradesh-Chhattisgarh border, two days after he was reportedly abducted by members of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), the police said.A senior official from the Mulugu district police confirmed the death of Korsa Ramesh, former sarpanch of K Kondapuram village in Mulugu. The police also recovered a letter near the body, purportedly written by CPI (Maoist) Venkatapuram-Vajedu area committee secretary Shantha, stating that he was eliminated for allegedly acting as a police informer after being tried at a “people’s court”, the senior official added.Mulugu superintendent of police Sangram Singh Patil told HT that the murder had taken place at Kothapalli in the Chhattisgarh limits and the Mulugu police had received the information about the body being found at around 8 am. He was on his way to Charla village of Bhadradri Kothagudem district when the abduction happened. “We are coordinating with the Chhattisgarh police to bring the body to his native village,” he said.His wife, Korsa Rajitha, who works as an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) at a government hospital in Etur-Nagaram block, told local reporters that her husband used to work as a car driver and had not committed any crime. After his abduction, she had appealed to the Maoists to release him unharmed. But within 36 hours, the Maoists killed him, alleging that he was acting as a police informer. In the letter, a copy of which was seen by HT, the Maoist party leader said Ramesh had been acting as a double-agent – working for the Maoists and pretending to be their sympathiser while at the same time, passing on information to the police.“Ramesh had been in touch with the Venkatapuram police and was passing on vital information about the movements of the Maoists, for which he was being paid money by the police. At the behest of the police, he supplied milk powder laced with poison to the Maoists, who fell sick after consuming the same. One of the Maoists, M Bhikshapathi alias Vijender, died of poisoning,” Shantha alleged in the letter.Accusing that Ramesh was also responsible for a major encounter, the Maoist leader said the deceased had collected ₹2 lakhs from the police for the same. “We are killing him as per the people’s wish as he betrayed the people and party,” Shantha said.
23-12-2021||India||Parliament: Stormy winter session ends||The winter session of Parliament, which was marked by heated protests by opposition parties and the passage of major legislation was adjourned a day ahead of schedule on Wednesday, with the Lok Sabha managing 82% productivity and the Rajya Sabha just 48%, amid a raging controversy over the suspension of 12 Upper House members.The stormy session, which kicked off with the repeal of three contentious agriculture laws, witnessed a bitter face-off between treasury and opposition benches in both chambers. Amid disruptions inside the House and protests outside, the government introduced 12 bills and pushed through 10 pieces of non-financial legislation, including one to link electoral rolls to the Aadhaar database and two others extending the terms of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate chiefs.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government also introduced a bill to raise the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21, though later decided to refer it to a parliamentary committee on the penultimate day of business. This is the fifth time in a row that a Parliament session has ended earlier than scheduled.The Rajya Sabha’s 48% productivity was the fifth-lowest figure in the past four years. A miffed Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu said that the Upper House functioned “much below its potential” and urged the lawmakers to “collectively reflect and introspect if this session would have been different and better”.In his valedictory speech, Naidu said that he didn't want to speak elaborately on the course of the session as it will lead him to “take a very critical view”.Leader of the Opposition, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, said that the government and the Opposition were fighting but “there was no mediator”, referring to Naidu’s insistence that the two sides must sit and talk to end the logjam.“The chairman adjourned the House due to government’s pressure whenever we said something,” he added, referring to the frequent disruptions.The suspension of the 12 opposition lawmakers on the first day of the session, November 29, over unruly scenes in the previous session of Parliament set the tone of acrimony and set off daily protests and disruptions that consumed 49.32 hours or 52.08% of the 95.06 hours available to the Upper House this session.The Question Hour — the window to seek replies from Union ministers on myriad issues — became the biggest casualty in the Rajya Sabha with 60.6% of its total time drowned in din. Naidu asked MPs to realise that “what happened is wrong” and urged them to work towards a “constructive positive atmosphere” in the future.The Lok Sabha lost 18.48 hours to disruptions, primarily to over the Congress-led Opposition’s persistent demands for the resignation of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra ‘Teni’, whose son Ashish Mishra is the prime accused in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence that killed eight people.Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla emphasised that “agreements and disagreements on issues may be reflected in debates and not through disruption”.“Democracy in India is a way of life. leaders of political parties and members must work in the direction of strengthening democracy and democratic institutions,” he said. He maintained that “smooth conduct of the House is the responsibility of all stakeholders” and added that he will be talking to lawmakers to improve attendance in the House.Birla later explained that the government and the Opposition couldn’t reach a consensus to discuss the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. “Some issues were not agreed by government and the Opposition,”he said, triggering a sharp response from Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury.Chowdhury termed the comment “laughable” and said Opposition lawmakers in the Lower House moved adjournment motions every day and tried to discuss the issue. “But as soon as they heard L of Lakhimpur, our microphones would be turned off,” he said.The winter session saw the introduction of 12 bills, as against the planned 26. Parliament approved 10 non-financial bills and the Lok Sabha also cleared the appropriation bill to provide additional budgetary support.Trinamool Congress member Derek O’Brien, who became the 13th member to be suspended on Tuesday for throwing a rule book at the Chair, said that the highlight of the session was the rediscovered unity of opposition parties.Union minister Pralhad Joshi lashed out at Opposition parties for repeated disruptions and said that the Opposition was “unable to digest” the mandate of 2019, when the BJP returned to power with an expanded majority.“It is unfortunate that despite our efforts and reaching out to the opposition, they created ruckus in the House. It seems that Congress and other opposition parties are unable to digest the mandate of 2019 given by the people,” Joshi told a press conference.
23-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 23, 2000 - Lashkar men storm Army camp in Red Fort, 3 killed||Even as a function of the Army’s Seven Rajputana Rifles was on, Lashkar-e- Tayyeba militants stormed the Red Fort at 9.30 tonight (December 22) and opened fire with AK-47s, killing at least three soldiers. This is the first such strike in the national capital and agency sources say a two-member Lashkar fidyaeen (suicide squad) was involved. The attack comes two days after the Centre extended the Ramzan ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir.Two members of the Rajputana Rifles were killed on the spot, while another was wounded and succumbed en route to hospital. The militants had switched off the lighting system inside the Mughal fort before launching the attack, apparently targeting the garrison inside. Lashkar is reported to have contacted the BBC and claimed responsibility for the attack. They also claimed that one of the militants was still inside the Fort. Army and police sources also did not rule out the possibility of militants holding out inside. The militants are supposed to have entered through the Saleem Gate of the Fort, outside which there are 400-500 slum dwellings. Police sources said the militants had carried out ambush at three separate places in the Fort. The attack was said to have been carried out near the residential quarters where hundreds of Armymen stay with their families. The Army has surrounded the Red Fort complex. Significantly, another function of the Rajputana Rifles was slated for tomorrow, which was to be attended by senior Army officials. Officials pointed out that both the Inter State Bus Terminus and the Old Delhi Railway Station are near the Red Fort and that it was possible that militants might have escaped from there. Several members of a family including women and children were trapped inside the Red Fort when the shootout occurred. They, however, reportedly escaped unhurt. There are two entry posts to the Red Fort, the Lahori Gate Khas and the Lahori Gate. There are at least four armed security guards on duty always at both these entry points. What is surprising is that the armed militants apparently managed to walk up to the cantonment area inside the Fort, where the function was going on, without being challenged. Clearly, the militant attack at the heavily-guarded Red Fort indicates a grave security lapse. The Red Fort is guarded by the 7th battalion of the Rajputana Rifles, the military police and Army headquarters post unit. The military intelligence was clueless about the attack and the shootout caught them napping. However, military intelligence officials are not ruling out the possibility of it being an insider’s job. This evening’s attack comes in the wake of several suicide attacks carried out recently by the mercenaries of the Lashkar on Army camps in the Kashmir valley. The Army cordoned off a huge area around the fort and, assisted by anti-terrorism squad personnel, launched combing operations in the entire walled city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-23-2000-lashkar-men-storm-army-camp-in-red-fort-3-killed-101640199915007.html

A senior GCC official said they were revisiting the project with the help of IIT-M and that they had submitted a report to the District Coastal Zone Management Authority during the end of October. “They have cleared it. And now, it has gone to the state-level authority. Whenever they have their next meeting this will be taken up,” the official said.As opposed to other parts of Chennai where there is a demand for more drain coverage as it floods every monsoon the story is different in south Chennai. This region covered by M3 from Kottivakkam to Uthandhi – a 12km stretch – lined up primarily with independent houses along sea side of the popular East Coast Road (ECR) is a sandy area and acts as a natural aquifer for rain water to percolate underground, argue those who moved the NGT. Even when normal life was thrown out of gear through November when the city received 80% excess rainfall, the arterial roads in these localities were dry but the civic body says interior localities which were inundated make the project necessary.The NGT in September ordered the state government under the previous AIADMK regime and the GCC to revisit the project and that it cannot be built without obtaining Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) because the East Coast Road is an ecologically sensitive region based on a petition of several residents welfare associations.The NGT had constituted a joint-committee headed by an official from the union environment ministry which in its final report said that the drain project violated CRZ norms. The order said that the state and GCC can consider views of expert institutions like the IIT-Madras, Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore to go ahead with the project with suitable changes and CRZ clearance.“South localities do have flooding so drains are necessary. So as per orders we have redesigned them. But we are open to criticisms of the resident welfare of associations,” another senior official of the GCC said.Residents and activists are asking authorities to justify spending crores in this project which they think may obstruct the natural flow of water. A resident, who did not wish to be identified, said localities such as Sea Cliff, Juhu beach did not flood but drains were already constructed here before the stay over.“It’s naturally a sandy area so it is demarcated as an aquifer recharge zone,” says Pooja Kumar, coordinator, Coastal Resource Centre. “The drains were being built over sandy areas so the percolation is impacted. And the drains aren’t maintained well. Since it’s close to the sea level there are also chances for sea water to enter into the conduits.”Environmentalist and founder of SWARAN (Save Water and And Recharge Aquifers Network) Ram Shankar who has backed resident welfare associations who are petitioners in the NGT case says that the corporation will have to be transparent on the changes made by IIT-M. “We had submitted a map of the outfalls, 27 of which were discharging into turtle nesting areas and that’s a no-go zone,” says Shankar. Outfalls are a point where drains discharge rainwater and in Chennai’s case drains are connected to four river basins including Kovalam which is finally let into the sea.”Since the East Coast Road residents are primarily dependent on groundwater, drains carrying urban runoff and letting it into the sea is a waste of fresh water resource, says Sekhar Raghavan, founder of Rain Centre. “The solution is for Metrowater to extract groundwater, store it in overhead tanks and supply it to residents through pipelines,” says Sekhar. This solution has also been relayed to the NGT’s joint committee.“This region is extremely sensitive and cannot take such heavy infrastructure like storm water drains,” adds Shankar. “From the perspective of ground water management, if it is not managed properly it can result in long term irreversible consequences. If precious rain water is drained off into the sea or if groundwater is extracted indiscriminately, it can result in intrusion of sea water into the groundwater so freshwater will become saltwater.”Meanwhile, the corporation has invited bids for the project in M1 and M2 sections for ₹150 crore for 27 km. “This work will begin soon. And in M3, if there are areas which don’t require drains we will not go ahead with it. The NGT has asked us to re-look at the project and residents have concerns which we will address sincerely,” the GCC official quoted above said.
23-12-2021||India||TRS accuses Goyal of ‘insulting’ delegation||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on Wednesday demanded an unconditional apology from Union minister for food and civil supplies Piyush Goyal for allegedly humiliating a party delegation in New Delhi on Tuesday. Telangana state finance minister and nephew of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, T Harish Rao alleged that the Union minister spoke in an insulting tone when the delegation of MPs and ministers met him to represent the paddy procurement issue. Goyal told reporters in New Delhi that the TRS was trying to politicise the issue by camping in New Delhi. He said he was out of station for two days on official work, yet, “they came to Delhi and accused me of not giving them an appointment.” “We are all busy with our work. They seem to have no work in their state and hence, came here to sit for two days. Who asked them to come?” Goyal had asked. Reacting strongly to the remarks, Harish Rao said Goyal had hurt the self-respect of 7 million farmers and 40 million people of Telangana. “The Telangana government’s delegation comprising six ministers and a dozen MPs went to the national capital, not because they don’t have work here, but to represent the farmers’ problems,” he said. He said the tone and tenor of Goyal’s comments were unbecoming of a central minister. “What right do you have to humiliate our ministers and the state? We have not come to you begging or requesting. We only wanted to remind you of your responsibility of procuring paddy,” Harish Rao asked. The state minister pointed out that the Union minister had a meeting with BJP leaders from Telangana before meeting the Telangana delegation. “You had time to give appointments to the state BJP leaders, but not to the Telangana government’s delegation. Our priority is farmers, but your priority is politics,” he criticised. Harish Rao said the delegation was in Delhi to ask the Centre to clarify if it would procure the entire paddy during the current Kharif season or not. “Since the Centre had fixed the target of 40 lakh tonnes paddy and the state has already procured 50 tonnes from farmers and another 20-30 lakh tonnes is lying in the market, the delegation went to Delhi to request the Centre to enhance the target and lift the entire paddy,” he said. Harish also took exception to Goyal’s remarks blaming the state government for not procuring paddy from farmers. He pointed out that the state government sent several letters to the Centre, requesting it to make all arrangements to lift the paddy stocks. Senior BJP leader and lawmaker M Raghunandan Rao said the TRS government was conspiring to defame the Centre instead of finding a solution to the problem. “There is nothing wrong in Goyal asking the state delegation for running around Delhi, instead of coming to the rescue of farmers,” he said. He alleged that the TRS was trying to politicise the paddy procurement issue only to cover up its inefficiency in addressing the issue at the state level.
23-12-2021||India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold Covid review meeting today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting on the Covid-19 situation in the country on Thursday, amid concerns caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.India has so far recorded 263 cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus across 15 states and Union territories and 90 of the infected people have either recovered or migrated, according to the Union health ministry’s data updated on Wednesday.The people cited above said that PM Modi will take stock of the Covid-19 pandemic situation across the country.There have also been demands that the government allow booster doses of vaccines to be administered to those already fully inoculated against Covid-19, as has been done by many countries.The meeting by PM Modi comes on the heels of Union government’s advisory to states and Union territories on Tuesday, asking them to “activate” war rooms, keep analysing even small trends and surges and keep taking strict and prompt containment action at the district and local levels. In its communication on Tuesday, the Centre said the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 is at least thrice more transmissible than its Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-to-hold-covid-review-meeting-today-101640199905861.html
23-12-2021||India||Govt blames Opposition for disruption-hit winter session of Parliament||Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi on Wednesday put the onus of the disruption-hit winter session on the Opposition, saying they were not able to “digest” the mandate received by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2019 general election.“It is unfortunate that despite our efforts and reaching out to the opposition, they created ruckus in the House. It seems that Congress and other opposition parties are unable to digest the mandate of 2019 given by the people,” Joshi said, after the winter session was adjourned a day ahead of schedule. The session, which began on November 29, was marred by prolonged disruptions, particularly in the Upper House, where the suspension of 12 Opposition lawmakers on the first day touched off a heated confrontation between the government and Opposition. The productivity in the Upper House stood at only 48%. In the Lower House, which clocked a productivity of 82%, the Opposition’s demand to debate the Lakhimpur Kheri violence sparked some disruptions and limited work. The Opposition accused the government of stifling debate in the House and rushing bills through. But Joshi rejected the charge and said that adequate time was granted to Opposition leaders for studying bills, particularly the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, which proposes linking electoral rolls to the Aadhaar database. “The bill was circulated among members in advance to prepare for an informed debate,” the minister said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) particularly targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for instigating disruptions in the House. ”It has always been the endeavour of the government that there should be a healthy and smooth discussion in the House. But the Opposition was adamant on obstructing the business of the House on one pretext or the other,” Joshi said. “We will pray to God to give wisdom to Rahul Gandhi and his colleagues so that the next session can go on smoothly,” he quipped. The minister said the Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was referred to the joint committee of both Houses of Parliament and five bills were referred to standing committees. Giving added importance to issues raised in the Zero Hour—the slot for MPs to raise issues primarily of their constituencies—Joshi informed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed all ministers to give priority to Zero Hour matters. He also pointed out that during the United Progressive Alliance era (2004 to 2014), members hardly got time to raise issues of the people in their constituency during Zero Hour, “The MPs can now raise issues in the Zero Hour,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-blames-opposition-for-disruption-hit-winter-session-of-parliament-101640199857126.html
23-12-2021||India||Mysuru: 27-year-old dies after cleaning sewage, family stages protest||Family of a 27-year-old man who allegedly died due to manual scavenging in Mysuru held a protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office on Wednesday demanding justice. Madhu, a resident of Pourakarmika Colony in Mysuru, was asked to clean the sewage soak pit in a schoolteacher’s house in Krishnapura Road on December 18. A day later, he was rushed to Periyapatna Government Hospital, from where he was taken to a hospital in Mysuru and was admitted there. Madhu later breathed his last at the hospital on Monday, the family said. Madhu’s family alleged that he was forced to clean the pit and the health department officials refused to recognise his death as a manual scavenging-related incident. The family also said it was after the Safai Karmachari Jagruti Samithi, an association for the cleaning staff (Pourakamirka), learned about the incident, health department officials rushed to house and removed Madhu from the location.The family members further alleged that no action was taken against those responsible for employing Madhu for the manual scavenging job and said no compensation was paid since “it was not a manual scavenging related incident.” Responding to the allegation, a senior official of the health department said that a complaint has been lodged at Periyapatna police station against the teacher who employed him. Mysuru DC B Gautham told the media that adequate compensation would be provided to the family members and that he has directed police officials to complete all legal procedures soon. “I have directed the officials concerned to conduct an investigation and take legal action against those who had made the Pourakarmikas indulge in manual scavenging,” said the DC. Gautham also said they will pay the compensation as per the SC directions and an additional ₹8.5 lakh under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. Earlier, pourakarmikas led by former Karnataka State Safai Karmachari Commission chairman Narayana also staged a protest and asked the DC to arrest the person and officials who forced the pourakarmikas to clean the pit manually. They demanded that the government pay a compensation of ₹25 lakh to the family of the deceased besides a government job, reported a news agency. According to Karnataka State Commission for Safai Karamcharis, the state has witnessed 36 manual scavenging-related incidents since 2008, resulting in 72 deaths. Police cases were filed in all the incidents, but there has not been a single conviction. In four cases, police filed a B Report, which meant they did not find evidence to file a charge sheet. Five cases were registered as unnatural death, 15 still are under trial, two under investigation and in 12 cases, the accused have been acquitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mysuru-27-year-old-dies-after-cleaning-sewage-family-stages-protest-101640199853912.html

We will file an application to direct the CBI to conduct a fair probe,” the lawyer further said.Earlier on December 16, the prime accused Indrani Mukherjea had also written to the CBI and said that she will move to CBI court to record a statement of a jail inmate who claimed to have met Sheena in Kashmir.Indrani Mukherjea, the mother of Sheena Bora in her letter to the investigating agency stated that an inmate in Byculla prison at present had told her that she had spotted Sheena in Kashmir some time ago. In her letter, Indrani has requested the CBI to look into the possibility of Sheena being alive.Indrani has always maintained that Sheena has not been murdered and is alive and had gone abroad for her education in 2012, although Indrani could never prove her claims in any way.Indrani Mukherjea, who is currently lodged in Byculla jail of Mumbai had also sent a letter from the jail to CBI stating that Sheena Bora is alive. A source close to Indrani confirmed that the letter was written based on input given by another jail inmate.Indrani’s lawyer Sana Raees Khan refused to confirm anything about the contents of the letter but said that she will file an application before Bombay High court on December 28 and only after filing that application, she will share the details of the letter written by Indrani to CBI.The CBI has been investigating the Sheena Bora case since 2015, after taking over the case from Mumbai Police. According to the case registered by Mumbai Police, Sheena Bora was kidnapped and murdered by strangulation in April 2012.This case first came to light after the arrest of Indrani’s driver, Shyamvar Rai in another case in August 2015. During the investigation, he confessed to having murdered Sheena Bora in April 2012 and said that he dumped her body in the Raigad district of Maharashtra. He also told Mumbai Police that Sheena’s mother, Indrani Mukerjea and Sanjeev Khanna (Ex-husband of Indrani) were also involved in this murder.According to CBI’s case before the court, Indrani Mukerjea killed Sheena Bora because she was furious over the relationship between Sheena Bora, whom she introduced as her sister to everyone, and Rahul Mukerjea, son of Peter Mukerjea (third husband of Indrani Mukerjea) from his first marriage.According to the CBI, Indrani killed Sheena Bora as Sheena was threatening to expose her in public over the fact that she was not her sister, but her daughter, CBI said. Driver Shyamvar Rai turned approver in this case.Peter Mukerjea was given bail by a special CBI court in March 2020. During the trial of the case, Indrani and Peter decided to end their relationship too.

23-12-2021||India||After students refuse to eat food cooked by Dalit woman, she is fired for ‘wrongful appointment’||A Dalit woman, whose appointment as a cook in a government school in Uttarakhand sparked a boycott of midday meals by “upper caste” students, lost her job on Wednesday after authorities decided that norms were allegedly flouted in her appointment.Officials in the state’s Champawat district said the principal of the Sukhidhang government inter college (GIC), Prem Singh, didn’t get Sunita Devi’s appointment as the bhojanmata (person who cooks midday meals) cleared by higher authorities. Secondary schools are known as inter colleges in some districts of the hill state.“We found during the inquiry that the principal of the college had failed to follow the norms in the appointment. After this, we cancelled the appointment of the Dalit Bhojanmata unanimously,” said RC Purohit, chief education officer (CEO) of Champawat district.Sunita Devi was appointed as the bhojanmata on December 13, replacing Shakuntala Devi, an upper caste woman. On Devi’s first day, all students consumed the midday meal together.But a day later, some 40 upper caste students in classes 6 to 8 -- out of a total of 66 pupils in these classes -- stopped eating the meals and started bringing tiffin from home, said Prem Singh.Parents of the upper caste children backed the boycott and alleged that Devi had been chosen as the cook by overlooking a more deserving candidate, Pushpa Bhatt, a Brahmin. The incident sparked protests and prompted the government to set up an inquiry.On Tuesday, Purohit , deputy education officer (DEO) Anshu Bisht visited the inter college on Tuesday and called a meeting of the school management committee (SMC), parent teacher association (PTA) and the village head.“The principal should have taken approval before the appointment but he failed to follow the norms. As per norms, approval is must from DEO before the appointment. Now, whole process will be again conducted and the Dalit bhojanmata can again apply,” said Purohit.Till the appointment of the new cook, another bhojanmata, an upper caste woman, will make the midday meals. “I made the children of every caste sit with one another and eat the midday meal on Tuesday. There is no problem between parents and children now,” the CEO added.Government schools are mandated to provide a midday meal to all students to encourage attendance and ensure adequate nutrition. There are two posts for cooks in the school. The other cook belongs to the upper caste community.“Our higher authorities found some lacuna in the appointment process and cancelled the appointment of the Dalit bhojanmata. We will again start the process for this post as per norms. All children have started eating midday meal from today cooked by at college,” Prem Singh said on Wednesday.Parents of the upper caste students said they were satisfied with the government decision.“Parents are satisfied with the inquiry and decision of education officers. Process of the appointment has to be conducted again. We hope all norms will be followed in the appointment of bhojanmata. Upper caste children have called off the boycott and are having midday meals as earlier,” said Narendra Joshi, president of the PTA.The move to dismiss Devi was sharply criticised by many activists and rights groups, who said it reeked of caste discrimination and bias.“This is a social evil that upper caste students boycotting the midday meal cooked by Dalit woman. In this case, the authorities should appoint her again and set up an example,” said PC Tiwari, president of the Uttarakhand Parivartan Party, a political party registered with the Election Commission of India.Devi couldn’t be contacted for comment.“This kind of discrimination will alienate scheduled caste people from the society. Dalit woman should be given opportunity to serve as bhojanmata if she fulfil the norms and parents of upper caste students must understand that it will strengthen relationship in the society,” said Anita Arya, a local activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-after-students-refuse-to-eat-food-cooked-by-dalit-woman-she-is-fired-for-wrongful-appointment-101640199844816.html
23-12-2021||India||Will probe ‘anti-minority’ speeches by right-wing outfits: Uttarakhand police||Haridwar/Dehradun: Uttarakhand Police said on Wednesday it would inquire into alleged speeches made against religious minorities by members of right-wing organisations at the three-day Dharma Sansad held December 17-19 in Haridwar. The move comes after video clips of the speeches were circulated widely on social media, drawing flak from several corners. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of these videos. The speeches allegedly made at the event held from December 17-19, includes one participant saying he wished to become Nathuram Godse and shoot then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Another participant warned Haridwar administration that they would vandalise hotels and commercial establishments where Christmas celebrations are held. Another speaker could be heard targeting religious minorities. Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said on Wednesday, “As of now, the police haven’t received any complaint against the speeches made by participants in the event. However, the police would look into them and take action as per law.” One of the seers at the event could be allegedly seen passing objectionable statements against former PM Manmohan Singh. He cited a statement made by Singh in Parliament, which however, could not be heard in the video.He then said, “Ye humare pradhan mantri sahab sansad me bole the. Aur maine jab ye padha na paper me to hua mann me ki kaash mai bhi saansad hota aur haath me revolver hota, aur mai Nathuram Godse ho jata. Aur apni 6 ki 6 goliyan Manmohan Singh ki chaati me laga deta. (This was said by our PM in the Parliament. And when I read about it in the newspaper, I just wished that if I would have been an MP there holding a revolver, then I would have become Nathuram Godse and put all the six bullets in him inside the Parliament).”During the same event, some seers also made objectionable statements against religious minorities. One of them targeted a particular minority community saying swords were not enough to kill them and people needed much better weapons. Supporting the call to disrupt chirstmas celebrations, Shri Akhand Parshuram Akhada has also pitched in and threatened of protests if hotels and restaurants continue with their plans to celebrate. “Sanatan Dharma regards Ganga as a deity. Hindus should ensure they observe and promote Sanatan Dharma and not other religions. We oppose such celebrations in a non- violent manner,” said akhada founder Adheer Kaushik. Another outfit Kali Sena has also warned of legal action against those establishments which celebrated Christmas. “Haridwar is a religious city where any celebrations of other religions are not apt. We seek cooperation, otherwise we will file a complaint at police stations against such hotel owners” said Vikas Chauhan, state president of Kali Sena. Former chief minister and Congress national general secretary Harish Rawat termed the speeches “highly condemnable and objectionable.” “It is shocking and hurtful that someone can use such words against a man like former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who is the epitome of sobriety and a thorough Gandhian. He might have never said anything which hurt any other person. Despite that, if anyone thinks of killing him, then it is upto the people of country to think where we are heading towards?” said Rawat. He added, “More hurtful was the fact that such speeches were made near Maa Ganga who might be thinking how can someone say something so objectionable against others.” The BJP meanwhile, distanced itself from the statement made by the seers against former PM Singh and minorities.Party state vice-president Devendra Bhasin said, “BJP has nothing do with the statements made by the participants of the event. Having said that, party also never supports violence against anyone.”Haridwar police have assured hoteliers and restaurant owners of maintaining law order in the city during Christmas. “Police will ensure of maintenance of law and order with adequate security so that peaceful Christmas celebrations can be held here,” said SP (city) Swatantra Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-probe-anti-minority-speeches-by-right-wing-outfits-uttarakhand-police-101640199799383.html

23-12-2021||India||India should emerge world leader in post-Covid global order: PM Modi||New Delhi: India should emerge a world leader in the post-Covid global order, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday, calling for “surging ahead with a focused approach setting new targets for ourselves for 2047”.Addressing the second meeting of the national committee on ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, Modi said the pandemic has taught new lessons and shattered the existing structures which will lead to the emergence of a “new world order” in the post-Covid era, according to a statement. It is commonly stated that the 21st century belongs to Asia, and it is important to focus on India’s stature in Asia in this century, he said. Emphasising that this is an opportune time to set eyes on 2047 when the country will celebrate 100 years of independence, he said the current generation will be at the helm of affairs then and the nation’s destiny will be in their hands. “Therefore, it is important to decide what we must inculcate in them now so that they will be able to make big contributions in the future towards the country,” he said. “We have always insisted upon and fought for our rights but there is a higher greatness in following one’s duties,” he added. It is only when people follow their duties religiously that they are able to ensure rights of others automatically, he said. Therefore, as Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is celebrated, the commitment to duty should be the uppermost priority and the pledge to contribute meaningfully for the country should be the main resolve, he said, asserting the programme will sow the seed of a sense of duty among the youth. Noting that it must be remembered that the future is always born in the lap of the past, he said people must not forget their forefathers who have sacrificed their youth, their lives and their families for the country.No stone should be left unturned to pay respect to the freedom fighters and unsung heroes of the freedom movement, he said. “The Prime Minister concluded that as we observe Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, we should surge ahead with a focused approach setting new targets for ourselves for 2047,” the statement said. The members of the national committee who attended the meeting included the Lok Sabha speaker, governors, Union ministers, chief ministers, political leaders, officials, media personalities, spiritual leaders, artists, film personalities and eminent personalities from other walks of life, it said.Culture ministry secretary Govind Mohan gave a presentation on the overview of activities of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, being held to mark the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence. The members who gave inputs at the meeting included former prime minister H D Deve Gowda; governors Acharya Devvrat and Arif Mohammad Khan; chief ministers Yogi Adityanath, Ashok Gehlot and Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy; BJP president J P Nadda, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, iconic singer Lata Mangeshkar and actor Rajnikanth among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-should-emerge-world-leader-in-post-covid-global-order-pm-modi-101640199791872.html

The new Variant Of Concern (VoC) - Omicron is spreading rapidly across the Globe and some cases are reported in India and Karnataka too, which is a cause of concern,” the circular stated, adding that “if left unchecked, may trigger a spike in (the) number of new infections.”The government added that to sustain the gains achieved so far in surveillance, containment efforts and to make the best effort to prevent the occurrence of the third wave, it is necessary to track and quarantine the primary and secondary contacts more effectively.The state government has added that all international travellers from high-risk countries need to be quarantined for seven days upon their arrival, tested and checked on the eighth day.The government added that the districts as well the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) shall post dedicated and full-time persons separately for contact tracing and quarantine/home isolation watch immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karntaka-issues-guidelines-for-contact-tracing-of-omicron-patients-101640199787054.html
23-12-2021||India||PM Modi to launch projects worth over ₹2,000 crore in Varanasi today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Varanasi on Thursday and launch multiple projects and schemes worth over ₹2,095 crore, his office said on Wednesday.This will be the Prime Minister’s second visit to his constituency in 10 days, ahead of the Uttar Pradesh elections next year. On December 13, he visited the city to inaugurate the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor.Among several projects, Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Banas Dairy Kashi Sankul (complex) at Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority Food Park in Karkhiyaon area, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kashi region spokesperson Navratan Rathi said.A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said that the dairy, spread over 30 acres, will be built at a cost of about ₹475 crore and will have a facility for processing five lakh litres of milk per day.The project will empower farmers and milk producers of eastern Uttar Pradesh region, besides providing customers good quality products at affordable rates, Rathi said.Besides this, the Prime Minister will also digitally transfer a bonus of about ₹35 crore to the bank accounts of more than 1.7 lakh milk producers associated with the Banas Dairy.At Ramnagar, Modi will lay the foundation stone for a biogas-based electricity generation plant for the Milk Producers’ Cooperative Union Plant to make it energy sufficient, the statement said.The Prime Minister will also launch a portal and logo dedicated to the Conformity Assessment Scheme of milk products, developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) with the help of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). The unified logo, featuring logos of both BIS and NDDB quality mark, will simplify the certification process for the dairy sector and will reassure the public about dairy product quality, the statement said.In another effort to curb land ownership issues at the grassroot level, Modi will virtually distribute the rural residential rights record, “Gharauni”, under the Swamitva scheme of the Union ministry of panchayati raj, to over 20 lakh residents of the state, the PMO said.Multiple urban development projects, including six projects for the redevelopment of Old Kashi wards, a parking-and-surface park at Beniabagh, beautification of two ponds, a sewage treatment plant at Ramna village and the provisioning of advanced surveillance cameras at 720 locations under Smart City Mission will be inaugurated.In the education sector, the Union education ministry’s Inter University Centre for Teachers Education, built at a cost of around ₹107 crore, and a Teachers’ Education Centre at Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, built at a cost of over ₹7 crore, will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Residential flats and staff quarters at Benaras Hindu University and Industrial Training Institute, Karaundi will also be inaugurated.For the health sector, Modi will inaugurate a project comprising doctors’ hostel, a nurses’ hostel and shelter home amounting to ₹130 crore, at the Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre. He will also open a 50-bed Integrated Ayush Hospital at Bhadrasi.The Prime Minister will lay the foundation of the ₹49 crore Government Homoeopathic Medical College in Pindra tehsil under the Ayush Mission, the statement said.In the road sector, the Prime Minister will lay the foundation stones of two “four-to-six lane” road widening projects for Prayagraj and Bhadohi. This will improve connectivity to Varanasi and be a step towards resolving the problem of the city’s traffic congestion, the PMO said.Modi will also inaugurate Phase-1 of a tourism development project related to Ravidas temple at Seer Govardhan, Varanasi.Rathi said that all arrangements have been completed for the Prime Minister’s programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-elections-modi-to-launch-projects-worth-over-rs-2-000-crore-in-varanasi-today-101640199785595.html
23-12-2021||India||Delhi plans strict action on Christmas, NY gatherings||Police and district authorities should carry out raids to ensure restrictions on public gatherings, including on celebrations for Christmas and the New Year, are not violated, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority ordered on Wednesday.The directive came as the country prepares to stave off a possible surge due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant and on a day when 125 new infections were recorded in the Capital, the highest since June 27. Active cases in the city are now 624, up from 286 at the beginning of the month.“All social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and festival-related gatherings and congregations are completely prohibited in Delhi, hence all DMs/DCPs shall ensure that no cultural event, gatherings, congregations take place for celebrating Christmas or New Year in the capital,” said the DDMA order issued on Wednesday.An order on December 15 already banned such gatherings but Wednesday’s directive specifies a particular focus on celebrations for the two events.To be sure, these restrictions don’t apply to private gatherings at homes.A senior official, who asked not to be named, said no Christmas Mass or congregation will be allowed but visitors will be allowed to churches with all Covid protocols. “We will hold meetings with Church authorities and plan steps to enforce Covid protocols in the church premises so that all protocols are strictly complied with,” said the official.DDMA has advised markets and offices to implement “No Mask, No Entry” restrictions at all shops and workplaces.In addition to banning all social, political, entertainment, cultural and other gatherings, the December 15 order also limited restaurants and bars to function at up to 50% of their capacity. Wedding-related gatherings are permitted with a ceiling of 200 people.DDMA said in its order that restrictions and safe-behaviour guidelines, such as wearing masks, were not being strictly complied with by the general public and there was laxity on the part of the enforcement authorities as well.This prompted the agency, the main authority for rules related to the pandemic, to direct district magistrates (DMs) and deputy commissioners of police to conduct raids at markets and crowd-pulling areas and take strict action against defaulters.District authorities have been asked to tighten the enforcement machinery and deploy sufficient number of teams at public places to prevent a possible surge in cases.All DMs have been asked to conduct surveys of the entire area within their jurisdiction and identify markets and public places with a potential to become super spreaders. They will also need to convene meetings with the resident welfare associations (RWAs) and market associations to sensitise them on the necessary steps needed for Covid protocols.Market associations and neighbourhood groups have been directed not to allow residents, shopkeepers and customers to be without masks in their respective areas and public places. “They should also be made aware that if they fail in compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour, DMs will be compelled to take action against them, like shutting down markets,” said a senior official, asking not to be named.B S Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA Joint Forum, said: “Since we have witnessed a rampaging pandemic in April, this is a good move. Everyone must comply with this order so that we can avert another disaster.”Health experts welcomed the directives. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said: “Every step taken to check congregations and crowds is useful in managing Covid. The Omicron variant is very highly transmissible and congregations help the virus spread faster”.The national capital is home to largescale celebrations during this period and the ban was seen as a blow to the restaurants and hospitality sector, which has been among the hardest hit due to the pandemic.“We were already devastated due to Covid restrictions. Many banquet halls and hotels had taken advance booking for Christmas and New Year parties. Now, they will have to cancel them,” said Kapil Nagpal, general secretary of the Community Welfare Banquet Association.Brijesh Goyal, chairman of Chamber of Trade & Industry, an association of markets, said the ban on celebrations will hit traders. “Many events are planned in advance, so the decision will come as a blow for the traders,” said Goyal.Restaurateurs said the ban will not affect routine events in restaurants, which will need to stick to the 50% cap on seating capacity. Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said: “We are already running in loss because of 50% cap on seating capacity while the running cost is the same,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-plans-strict-action-on-christmas-ny-gatherings-101640199739541.html
23-12-2021||India||‘Hands tied’: Rawat takes dig at Congress top brass||Senior Congress leader and former Uttarakhand Harish Rawat, who is believed to have played a part in Captain Amarinder Singh’s exit as Punjab chief minister, and also from the party itself, took to Twitter on Wednesday to air grievances seemingly targeted against the central leadership of the party. The posts, coming months ahead of the elections in Uttarakhand, indicate that all isn’t well in the party, and that another state unit of the Congress is heading towards an internal crisis. In a series of tweets in Hindi, Rawat alleged that he was not getting support from the party leadership and that representatives of the high command had “tied his hands.”“Isn’t it strange that the organisational structure at most places, instead of extending a helping hand, is standing with its head turned away or playing a negative role at a time when I have to swim across the ocean of elections...the powers that be have left crocodiles here. People on whose orders I have to swim, their nominees are tying my hands and feet,” he tweeted .The BJP, which governs the state, has had its share of problems (it is currently on its third chief minister), but the comments from Rawat, the Congress’ biggest and senior most leader in the state, have taken most people by surprise. In one of them, he even hinted at retirement. “I am filled with thoughts. A voice from within sometimes tells me ‘It is enough Harish Rawat, you have swam long, it is time to rest’,” he said. At a press conference later, he refused to clarify his tweets and said he would speak on them at the right time. When reporters insisted on a response, he said,”Anand lijeye (enjoy).”Party leaders, who asked not to be named, said he was referring to the Congress incharge for the state, Devendra Yadav, and leader of Opposition in assembly, Pritam Singh.Yadav and Singh did not respond to calls seeking comment. In July, Rawat was made campaign committee in-charge for the state but not declared the chief ministerial candidate. Singh, a rival of Rawat, is also a probable CM candidate. Party leaders said the state Congress unit was divided into two factions, one loyal to Rawat and another to Singh.Congress leaders considered close to Rawat said his tweets were a clear indication that he was not happy with the party leadership in the state. “He is clearly telling the party high command that if he doesn’t get the required support, the party will lose the elections,” one Congress leader said. The ruling BJP said Rawat’s comments show he is not even acceptable to his own party. “Harish Rawat and his party has been claiming he will form the next government. But it seems his own party members don’t want him to lead the party in state. They know that it was because of him, that he Congress had to face such a drubbing in 2017 elections,” said BJP state media incharge Manveer Singh Chauhan. Dehradun-based political analyst M M Semwal said Rawat’s cryptic tweets have put the Congress on the back foot. “It is difficult to decipher his social media posts and statements, but it is clear that he has sent a message that if things aren’t set right, the party’s electoral prospects will weaken. He wants to make it clear to the party high command that without him the party may not win the elections in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hands-tied-rawat-takes-dig-at-congress-top-brass-101640199738663.html
23-12-2021||India||Congress gives ticket to Goa’s Pratapsingh Rane, sets up face-off with his son||PANAJI: The Congress on Wednesday named Pratapsingh Rane, 82, as the party’s candidate from Goa’s Poriem assembly seat, setting up a face-off between the former Goa former chief minister and his son, Vishwajit Rane, who is in the the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The announcement comes just a day after Pratapsingh Rane declared his intention to contest the elections, prompting his son to rebuke the veteran Congress leader for not retiring “gracefully” from politics. At 83, why does he have to continue in politics? One should gracefully retire after becoming a chief minister for more than nine terms. A person who is my idol and someone I have so much respect for, that person should gracefully retire, not retire in the battlefield. It will be a very messy thing,” Vishwajit said on Tuesday.Also Read: ‘Retire or will be messy’: Goa BJP’s Vishwajit Rane’s harsh advice to his fatherVishwajit Rane, who has represented Valpoi assembly seat since 2007, also declared that he will contest from the Poriem seat as well. Vishwajit later tweeted that he will sort it out “internally within the family”.Pratapsingh Rane’s candidature was announced by AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik. He is the eighth Congress candidate to have been named by the party. The Congress earlier named eight candidates for assembly elections early next year but one of them, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Lourenço, this week resigned from the assembly and joined the Trinamool Congress led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Vishwajit initially hoped to get a BJP ticket for his nominee from the neighbouring Poriem seat that his father represents. Both seats are located along Goa’s forested eastern border with Karnataka and are considered the Rane family’s pocketborough.Pratapsingh Rane’s declaration of his interest in contesting the assembly elections on Tuesday, and later Mukul Wasnik’s confirmation, have upset Vishwajit Rane’s calculations.“The Central Elections Committee has approved the candidature of Shri Pratapsingh Rane as Congress candidate for the forthcoming general election to the Legislative Assembly of Goa from 18-Poriem constituency,” Wasnik’s statement on Wednesday said.Vishwajit Rane has not reacted to the Congress fielding his father as the Poriem candidate. On Tuesday, he suggested that his father earlier agreed to retire from politics but was probably under pressure from the Congres party to throw his hat. Pratapsingh Rane is Goa’s longest serving MLA; he has won 10 assembly elections since 1972. Pratapsingh also holds a record for having served as chief minister of the state for a little less than 16 years across six terms between 1980 and 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-gives-ticket-to-goa-s-pratapsingh-rane-sets-up-face-off-with-his-son-101640199733904.html
23-12-2021||India||Variant watch: First SA study says Omicron may be less severe but with riders||People infected with the Omicron variant in South Africa had 80% lower odds of requiring hospitalisation than those infected with another variant between October and November, a new study released on Wednesday by health experts in the country has found, offering new hope that the new variant of concern (VOC) may be less virulent in some populations.In a second study and in press briefings later on Wednesday, South African health experts said the apparent reduction in disease severity was likely due to the high rates of prior exposure to Covid-19 in Gauteng, the province where Omicron first became widespread and where the studies were focussed. Both studies are still based on early data and carry a wide confidence range.The first study found that Omicron-infected people had 80% lower odds of hospital admission when compared to those who caught another variant during the current (fourth) wave of infections, and 70% lower odds of developing severe disease compared to those infected by the Delta variant in the previous (third) wave.But, importantly, it found that if people infected with Omicron required hospitalisation, their likelihood of developing severe disease was no different to those who were infected with other variants during the ongoing wave.The study offers the first insights after standardising data based on age and gender, the two factors that dictate severity and hospitalisation risks. It stresses that the findings do not suggest the new VOC is inherently less severe, but may be manifesting in a less intense manner now due to high population immunity from past outbreaks.The second study found that at least 68% of the unvaccinated population in Gauteng is estimated to have had a past infection prior to the Omicron wave. “The biological basis for the uncoupling of case rates and rates of severe disease with the Omicron-dominant compared with the previous Delta-dominant wave is possibly the extensive cell-mediated immunity in the population induced by previous natural infection and vaccination,” said the second study.What does this mean?Cheryl Cohen, professor at the Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis at the National Institute for Communicable Disease, said during a press briefing that the results likely hold for other regions where a large number of people have been infected, although it is still not clear how Omicron will hit countries where vaccination rates have been high but infection rates were kept low.“These results are likely generalisable in countries in sub-Saharan Africa which has high levels of prior infection. But what is unclear is whether this picture will be similar in countries where there is high levels of vaccination but very low level of [past] infection – where the baseline epidemiology is very different,” Cohen said, and agreed that population immunity after two years of the pandemic “may be leading to attenuation of severe disease”.For perspective, India’s seroprevalence among unvaccinated people was estimated at 67% (similar to Gauteng’s) in July following the devastating Delta wave of infections.Cohen added during the meeting that there were several limitations to the study. First, Omicron infections were estimated on the basis of a test report artefact – Omicron infections do not test positive for the S gene, while other variants do. The so-called S gene target failure (SGTF) happens only in one particular test kit, which meant the findings could be biased towards geographic regions where it was used.The other limitation was that the analysis was done early in the fourth wave when numbers were small and mild patients were more likely to be admitted.The South African researchers in the second study identified other possible implications of the trends seen in Gauteng.First, it appears that cell-mediated immunity (a more advanced line of defence compared to antibodies, which tend wane) may be more important in combating variants.Second, determining inherent virulence may not be easy at the moment. “The virulence of the Omicron variant relative to other variants remains to be determined, and it is not epidemiologically possible to draw conclusions based on our data due to the differing prevalence of immunity compared with what existed in the past,” they said, implying that most people infected now are either vaccinated or had a past infection.Anecdotal reports of Omicron infection deaths from other countries suggest that unvaccinated people remain most at risk. This is corroborated by scientific evidence that has found that the virus has not evolved enough to cheat killer T cells (part of cellular immunity) in the same way as it does antibodies (which are part of what is known as humoral immunity),
23-12-2021||India||Ready for safe polls, says CEC Chandra||The Election Commission of India said it is ready to hold the elections in Goa (and by extension, the other states going to polls around the same time), despite the looming threat of another wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic, but emphasized that local election officials have been empowered to ensure strict adherence to Covid protocols during campaigning, and that the polling itself will also be held with adequate precautions.It’s realistically possible to do this, Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra said while fielding questions from journalists at the end of a two day visit to review preparedness in the state ahead of the elections.The Election Commission came in for criticism over the conduct of assembly elections in West Bengal -- Covid protocols were not followed by all parties involved for much of the campaign -- which coincided with the second wave of the pandemic. The Madras High Court even observed that the commission needs to be booked for attempt to murder for failing to react to the changing situation and pressing ahead with the elections.This time, it is clear the commission is taking no chances.“We are making all our booths in a Covid compliant manner, we are giving everyone masks and sanitizers, social distancing norms will be followed and it will be an absolutely safe election,” Chandra said when asked whether he was considering a possible postponement of the election should cases being to rise in January-February.“The commission is monitoring the situation and that is why we have reduced the number of voters per polling station from 1500 to 1000 and have increased the number of booths by 60 (in Goa). So, on average there are only 662 persons per polling booth, we can definitely maintain social distancing, we can definitely maintain social distancing norms also and ensure compliance of every norm will have to be done at the booths,” he said.Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand also go to polls around the same time, with UP, India’s most populous state, likely to pose the biggest challenge to the commission in terms of conducting the election. Although India has so far detected only a few hundred cases of Covid-19 caused by the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the trajectory of infections in other countries suggests that a surge in cases can’t be ruled out. The variant has been found to be more transmissible, and has the ability to cause breakthrough infections even among vaccinated or previously infected people, although initial evidence suggests the infections are mild and unlikely to require hospitalisation in most cases.Chandra said that the State Disaster Management Authority will be specifically directed to act against rallies where social distancing is not being maintained.“Rallies will absolutely have to be restrained and the park or the ground where the rallies are held, they should also maintain social distancing, the rules and conditions of the Disaster Management Act should be followed and the DEO (District Election Officer) has been given the power to act against those who violates the provisions of the Act. If anybody violates the provision, they are liable to be acted against. We will inform the SDMA (State Disaster Management Authority) that they should take actions on those grounds”.The term of the Goa State Legislative Assembly will expire on March 15, 2022. Elections are to be held before that for 40 assembly constituencies out of which 39 are general and one is reserved for scheduled castes.“ECI is totally committed to conduct the assembly elections in a free, fair, impartial, transparent and absolutely inducement free elections,” Chandra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-safe-polls-says-cec-chandra-101640199728948.html

Seven accused including one absconder have been charge sheeted,” Rai said.Through his query, Congress MP Mallikarjun Kharge sought to know the reasons behind a sudden increase in unrest and targeted attacks on religious minorities in the Union territory.“...there have been a few targeted attacks on people belonging to religious minority communities by terrorists sponsored from across the border,” Rai said.The minister added that there has been an overall decline in terrorists incidents, from 417 in 2018 to 203 in 2021 (till 30th November, 2021), and the law and order situation in the Union territory has improved.Rai said that a robust security and intelligence grid has been set up to prevent any terrorist attack. Besides this, day-night area domination, patrolling and proactive operations are also being carried out in the Union territory, he said.Round-the-clock checking at ‘nakas’ and road opening parties are being adequately augmented at strategic points to thwart any terrorist attack.A State Investigation Agency (SIA) has been constituted by the Jammu and Kashmir government for speedy and effective investigation and prosecution of terrorism-related cases, Rai said.The SIA shall be the nodal agency for coordinating with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and other central agencies, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-terrorists-involved-in-j-k-attacks-on-minorities-killed-govt-in-parliament-101640199728254.html
