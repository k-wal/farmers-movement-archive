The two temples have been selected under the BHOG (Blissful Offering to God) scheme—an initiative started by the Association of Food Scientists and Technologist of India (AFSTI) along with the Food Safety and Standards India (FSSAI) to offer clean and hygienic prasad to devotees, they said. As part of the initiative, the state FSDA department would now supervise implementation of this scheme, they added. “The two popular temples of Prayagraj have been selected in accordance with the instruction of the divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal. Cooks and workers involved in preparing the bhog and the prasad would also be trained in ensuring proper hygiene and cleanliness as part of this initiative. For this, the FSDA department will also organise camps at the two temples,” informed Sanjay Kumar Pandey, assistant commissioner (Food safety), Prayagraj. During the camp, training and tips regarding precautions that need to be taken while making the prasad, taking it out and distributing it as well as additional steps to maintain cleanliness would all be imparted to the people concerned of the two temples, he added. He said that this BHOG scheme was being implemented in a total of five districts of the state, including Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura, Kanpur city and Prayagraj.

The matter was brought to light by an environmentalist from Gurugram, who filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court in the ongoing Khori Gaon demolition case.In the third week of July, the Supreme Court, while hearing a case about the demolition of Khori village in Faridabad, observed that “the direction to remove all unauthorized structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception”.SS Oberoi, a city-based environmentalist who filed the affidavit in the Supreme Court on Saturday, said, “The Supreme Court had directed the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad to clear unauthorized structures on the forestland. A farmhouse spread across 10-acres in Ankhir village of Faridabad was also demolished also by the civic body pursuant to the orders of the court. However, despite the demolition, construction of the demolished structure has started again. The farmhouse is among the 123 other illegal encroachments listed in the affidavit filed by the forest department of the state of Haryana before the National Green Tribunal in the matter titled Sonya Ghosh vs. State of Haryana & Ors.”The land in question falls under specific notifications under special Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, which extends protection against land-use change to certain specified areas and forests in the Aravallis.He further said the place where the farmhouse is being constructed is just a kilometre away from the Asola Bhati Wildlife Sanctuary and acts as a buffer area with wildlife movement in the region. In June this year, a two-year-old female leopard was found dead at the Surajkund-Pali Road, which falls in the same area.After the apex court issued directions in July, the forest department started taking preparations to raze all illegal structures, including farmhouses, banquet halls and institutes, constructed on forest land. Around 15 farmhouses that were set up illegally in the Aravallis were also demolished.In Faridabad, officials estimated that around 120-130 illegal structures are currently standing on land notified under Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA).“We will look into the matter and send a team for inspection at the area on Monday itself. We have demolished 15 illegal structures in the district,” said a senior forest official, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/construction-of-farmhouses-on-aravalli-land-starts-again-says-activist-101638728674606.html

05-12-2021||Gurugram||MCG may miss Dec 15 deadline for fixing potholed stretches in Gurugram||With the ongoing ban on construction activities in the city, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is likely to miss its deadline of December 15, the third such deadline, to fix potholed roads across the city. MCG officials said it is likely that the road repair work will commence in February next year due to current cold weather conditions. In September, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed Gurugram agencies, including the MCG, to fix all roads damaged due to rains by November 30. On October 26, the MCG commissioner set a deadline of November 15 to fix all pothole-ridden stretches in the city.After the MCG missed the two deadlines, Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg on November 23 directed the civic body to fix all potholed roads by December 15 to check dust pollution.“Due to the ongoing construction bans, there have been no construction activities by the MCG in the past three weeks. Work on potholed roads has remained suspended,” said a senior MCG official from its engineering wing, requesting anonymity.The Haryana government on December 3 banned construction activities in 14 NCR districts of the state, including Gurugram, till further orders, in the wake of the deterioration in air quality in the region. On November 24, the Supreme Court reimposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). The ban on construction activities in the NCR was lifted on November 22 in view of the improved air quality.The MCG official quoted above said that the civic body had anticipated procuring by November-end jet patcher machines that fix potholes within hours and due to its non-polluting component and all-weather resistance could repair roads even during the construction bans and peak winter season.“The procurement of jet patcher machines is still in process. So, there will be no road repair work until the construction ban is lifted,” said the official.MCG officials further said that with bitumen-related work infeasible during low temperatures, the civic body is only likely to start work on repairing potholed roads in February next year.“The minimum temperature needs to be above 15°C for executing bitumen-related work. Ideally, we will have to wait till early February to start road repair work for a long-term fix,” said another MCG official, privy to the matter.As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city had a minimum temperature of 10°C on Sunday. MCG chief engineer TL Sharma said that once the construction ban is lifted and there is an uninterrupted on-ground work, it will take the civic body around 10 days to fix all stretches.“We were on course to fix all potholed roads by November 20. However, the construction ban completely disrupted this. Once the ban is lifted, it will take us around 10 days to complete all remaining road repair work,” said Sharma.Sharma further said that for mending potholes on most roads, only bitumen emulsion is required.“Emulsion work has no relation with weather and can be used at any time of the year. Only for stretches with extensive road damage, a hot mix of bitumen is required for which warmer temperature is ideal. If required, for dust mitigation, we can take exemption from the departments concerned and fix stretches during ongoing construction bans,” said Sharma. For residents, the delay in the fixing of potholed stretches further adds to their woes.“During the rains, several arterial stretches across Sector 56 developed potholes. Even after two months, there have been no attempts to rectify them and the road conditions have only worsened. As a result, a large number of commuters no longer use the arterial stretches as alternative routes to reach Golf Course Road or Golf Course Extension Road,” said Sanjeevan Lal, a resident of Sector 56.
05-12-2021||Gurugram||Air quality improves to ‘poor’ in Gurugram||The air quality in Gurugram took a turn for the better, enough to move from ‘very poor’ to the ‘poor’ category on Sunday. According to the 4pm air quality index (AQI) bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Gurugram recorded an AQI of 277 on Sunday, in the ‘poor’ zone, compared to the reading of 334 on Saturday. Delhi and Faridabad, the cities neighbouring Gurugram, experienced ‘very poor’ air quality on Sunday with AQI readings of 305 and 311 respectively. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. To control rising levels of air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Commission For Air Quality Management (CAQM) has constituted an enforcement task force which is coordinating with the inspection teams in all NCR states to review and monitor the situation. In Haryana, 12 inspection teams have been constituted to examine activities in various sectors (industrial, vehicular transport, construction and demolition, dust from roads and open areas) aggravating the pollution levels. According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve further but remain in the ‘poor’ category on Monday and Tuesday. On December 8, the air quality is likely to remain in the moderate category and remain in poor to moderate category for subsequent days. Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted dense fog at isolated places in the South Haryana region on Monday--a result of a fresh western disturbance. On Sunday, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 23.6 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, and a minimum of 10 degrees Celsius, which was two degrees above normal.“There would be no significant change in the minimum temperature during the next 24 hours...the mercury will gradually fall by three to five degrees after that,” said Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre Chandigarh, a regional centre of the IMD. The weather bulletin of the Meteorological Centre Chandigarh also issued a yellow weather warning (indicating authorities have to be prepared) predicting dense fog at isolated places in south and south east Haryana, including districts like Gurugram and Faridabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-improves-to-poor-in-gurugram-101638728314514.html

05-12-2021||Pune||Seven more Omicron cases detected in Pune, state tally climbs to 8||Seven more cases of Omicron, the new Covid-19 variant, have been reported in Maharashtra which took the total count in the state to eight, the state health report and officials from Pune district health department said on Sunday.All the eight cases of the new variant are from Pune district, six are from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and one each from Pune city and rural parts of the district, officials said.One of the seven patients reported mild symptoms while the others have not reported any symptoms. All the six patients from PCMC area are from one family and three of the patients had returned from Lagos Nigeria on November 24. The Pune city patient is a 47-year-old man and was found positive for the Omicron variant through routine surveillance. He visited Finland from November 18 to 25, 2021. He was tested owing to mild fever on November 29 and was found Covid-19 positive. He has taken both doses of the Covishield vaccine and he is now completely stable without any symptoms.The patient from Pune rural is a native of Alandi village though officials said not much information is available about the case.Both Nigeria and Finland are not one of the three ‘high risk countries’ listed by the state government which are South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe.The six patients from Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation area include a 44-year-old woman who had come from Lagos, Nigeria on 24th November 2021 to meet her brother who lives in PCMC, along with her two daughters, aged 12 and 18 years old. The three of them and her brother along with his two daughters – a total of 6 people – have tested positive for Omicron as per the report obtained from the National Institute of Virology, Pune on Sunday evening.Thirteen contacts of the woman and her daughters were traced and tested during which her 45-year-old brother with his daughters, aged seven and 1.5 years old have also tested positive. The Omicron variant has been found in all three contacts. The Nigerian woman reported mild symptoms the rest of the five have not reported any symptoms at all.Earlier in the day, Rajesh Tope while speaking to reporters in Parbhani said, there is not much information is available on the new variant.“What we know so far is that the transmissibility rate of Omicron is high but the intensity may not be very severe. There is still no authentic information on whether it escapes the vaccine shield,” he said.Out of the six people, three are under 18 years of age and therefore have not taken any vaccine. The three adults have taken both doses of the vaccine – 2 have taken Covishield and 1 has taken Covaxin. All these patients are being treated at the Jijamata Hospital in Pimpri-Chinchwad and are stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/seven-more-omicron-cases-detected-in-pune-state-tally-climbs-to-8-101638728195514.html
05-12-2021||Pune||Vaccine stock with private hospitals in Pune running into ‘expiry’ trouble||Even as the threat of the Omicron Sars-Cov-2 variant has people rushing to civic vaccination centres, a large quantity of vaccines is pending at private hospitals in the city. These vaccines have been part of the stockpile for the past three months and with the validity of Covid-19 vaccines at six months, private hospitals hope that either the government or the manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII), would take back the stock and allocate fresh stock. The fresh stock is for future demand for vaccines either in the form of booster doses or a possible third wave. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the hospital board of India, Pune chapter, Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, “As of last week, as per government figures provided to us there are about 650,000 vaccine doses available with private hospitals. We have had this stock with us since the past three months and since the validity of the vaccine is for about six months in total, this stock would remain efficient until March. We had discussions with the government to take this stock and distribute it to various centres and then allocate fresh stock to us later, as the demand goes up, but there has been no reply.” Dr Patil added: “Now we are planning to write to manufacturers, Serum Institute of India (SII), in this case, to take back the stock which they can distribute and give us fresh stock later when the demand goes up.”Dr Patil further said that the only way the demand would go back up is when the government permits administering a booster dose to those who want to take it, especially healthcare and frontline workers. Since the emergence of the Omicron variant, the demand for vaccines has gone up at government centres which have plenty of vaccine stock available. Dr Avdhut Bodhamwad, medical superintendent with Ruby Hall Clinic said, “The Omicron scare has not led to any resultant increase in vaccinations in our hospital. As per me, people want booster doses and not the regular ones because a lot of people already have taken both doses. If we get permission for booster doses from then demand will increase.” Dr Abrarali Dalal, CEO of Sahyadri Hospitals, said that vaccination for 18+ age group which started in the last week of May 2021 steadily picked up pace and remains stable as of now. “We have not seen any significant change in the numbers of vaccinations since the news about the Omicron variant,” added Dalal.Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital said, “There is just a slight increase in vaccination demand which has gone up from 25 doses a day to now 75 doses a day, which can be attributed to the Omicron scare.”While vaccine stocks are nearing their expiry date at private hospitals and government hospitals have more than enough stock, Pune still has about 1.3 million who have not taken their second dose of Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vaccine-stock-with-private-hospitals-in-pune-running-into-expiry-trouble-101638728194327.html
05-12-2021||Noida||Work expedited, Noida’s 1st habitat centre to be open by October 2023: Officials||The work on a 31-storey ‘Noida Convention and Habitat Centre’ — first such project in the city — in Sector 94 has been expedited for completion and opening for public use by October 2023, officials said on Sunday.The project — with the total cost estimated to be ₹684 crore — is to promote art and culture, and offer a green smart building to the people for socio-cultural activities in the city, according to the officials. A green building means to apply green technologies to a building throughout its life cycle, i.e., from construction to operation to demolition, so that the negative environmental impact of buildings can be minimised as far as possible.Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Noida authority, directed the staff last week to expedite the work at the site, they said. Noida — a planned city in Uttar Pradesh — was established over 20,000 hectares of land adjoining the national capital, Delhi, on April 17, 1976. The Noida authority signed an agreement with the Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam (UPRNN), which is building the project, on May 5, 2021 for the same.Following Maheshwari’s direction, the additional chief executive officer of Noida authority, Neha Sharma, inspected the site on November 30 (Tuesday) and instructed officials concerned to expedite construction works there.“The digging work for the project started in May this year, immediately after the agreement was signed with the state public sector undertaking UPRNN. But it takes time to prepare the ground for such a tall building and lay the foundation. We have dug up a 11-metre-deep structure for it, and will finish the de-watering work in the next 15 days, with this, the digging work will be completed. Then we will start the piling work to build the foundation of the building, and finish it within the deadline,” said Vijay Rawal, senior project engineer of the Noida authority, who is also the project in-charge.Spread across 20 acres, this project will house food courts, restaurants, retail outlets, banquet halls, waiting lounges, open lawns, art galleries, exhibition halls, workshop space, office space, gymnasium, swimming pool, and conference hall among other facilities, said the authority officials.There are two basement floors for parking spaces which will be able to accommodate nearly 7,000 vehicles, leaving five floors dedicated for the socio-cultural activities.“It will be a unique green smart building of its kind in the city, and is being built according to the provisions of the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). The convention centre will have connectivity with the Delhi Metro, and will use solar energy to run the restaurants, hotels, and other facilities in the building. People will be able to enter the building with the help of smart cards, and the parking will be automatic,” said Rawal.

Officials, however, said that “there was no reason to be concerned about the situation yet”.The coronavirus testing in Noida has been increased from an average of nearly 1,000 to 2,200 daily. Officials said that random Covid-19 testing has also been increased.Five of a family were among the nine persons who tested positive for the virus on Saturday, and none of them have any Covid-19 symptom, except a female who has a cough and cold, according to the officials.“The five persons from the family tested positive for the virus during a random check, and all of them are doing fine... We have increased the Covid-19 testing in the district, and have also asked all the hospital authorities to report about fresh cases immediately after those are being detected. There may be a few extra cases once in a while, but that is miniscule compared to the district’s population. There is no reason to worry about the increase in the number of cases yet,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.The other patients included a health worker from the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), who tested positive for Covid-19 during a random sampling, and the remaining three persons tested positive for the virus during hospital visits. All primary contacts of the GIMS health worker have also been tested.Meanwhile, as a case of the new Covid-19 variant — Omicron — has been reported in Delhi, officials said that no connection to Noida has been found yet.However, with cases of the new Covid-19 variant coming to the fore in India and the state government issuing directions to check the spread of the infection, the district health department on Thursday reserved 30 beds at the Noida Covid Hospital in Sector 39 for all international travellers who test positive for Covid-19.Gautam Budh Nagar has received a list of 499 international travellers so far, who have come to Noida from “at-risk” countries. Most of them have been tested for Covid-19, and no positive case has been reported yet, said the officials. The list includes all countries in Europe, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. There are about 44 European countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-reports-9-new-covid-cases-in-a-day-noida-on-new-variant-alert-101638728074524.html
05-12-2021||Pune||No lockdown in Pune, but zero tolerance for those not following Covid norms, says Dr Shashank Joshi||In light of the Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2, Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid task force, said on Sunday that there would be no lockdown and the emphasis would only be on following Covid-19-appropriate behaviour and vaccination. Dr Joshi said that there would be guided restrictions with zero tolerance for those not following Covid-19 norms in public places. He further said that while taking the vaccine or being fully immunised is encouraged, it cannot be made mandatory as vaccines have been approved under the emergency use authorisation and not as per the regular norms of the Drug Controller General of Indian (DCGI). On Omicron, Dr Joshi said: “We have many suspects and we might already have many cases. As of now, we have to ensure two things, double mask and double vaccination. Follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and focus on proper ventilation. As far as inbound travel is concerned, we need to do a very tight screening and tracing of all coming in from abroad, because Omicron is everywhere. They have to ensure home quarantine and if anyone is asymptomatic they should go for testing voluntarily.” “Currently, all Omicron cases in the country are sporadic and they are travel related. Domestic transmission is rare and there are no clusters and no community transmission right now. Even the Delta variant which caused the second wave had almost got extinct now so from the Delta standpoint also the infection has come down,” he added. Dr Joshi said, “However, vaccination should not be made mandatory. These are early generation vaccines. Only when they are formally approved can we make a case for compulsory vaccination and there are a lot of people ineligible for vaccinations due to allergies. Despite this our state has done reasonably well with regards to vaccination and we have to ensure that the second dose is taken by as many people as possible and we have to maximise our vaccination reach voluntarily. These vaccines are not formally approved by the Drug Controller, but they have only got the EUA.” He further added, “Currently we do not have restrictions and we have screening mechanisms at places from where potentially Omicron can come from. We are upping the guard in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour, public health strategies, masking and vaccination policies. There is no question of any restrictions other than what are there currently and the lockdown will not occur at all. The restrictions would be guided by the positivity rate, so currently there is no need for any restrictions except zero tolerance for people who do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.” On Sunday, state health minister Rajesh Tope while speaking to reporters in Parbhani, when questioned about restrictions said, “We have to now strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and increase vaccination. Once WHO shares more information about the new variant, ICMR will prepare the protocol, which we have to follow in Maharashtra. What we know so far is that the transmissibility rate of Omicron is high, but the intensity may not be very severe. There is still no authentic information on whether it escapes vaccine shields. As of now in Maharashtra, we have tested 3,738 persons who came into the state in the past month from high-risk countries.

On Saturday, trade license camps were organised at the Arcadia Market in South City 2, Bani Square in Sector 49, Ardee Mall in Sector 52, and Qutub Plaza in DLF Phase 1.“To facilitate the traders to apply for trade license on the spot, special camps were organized by the MCG at four places... about 200 traders applied for trade licence...,” said S S Rohilla, public relation officer (PRO), MCG.According to MCG officials, under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, all types of commercial buildings operating within the limits of the municipal corporation have to obtain a trade licence from the civic body.According to MCG’s property tax records, there are more than 47,000 commercial buildings in the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation. Last month, during a review meeting with the taxation branch, municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja pointed out that the civic body has issued few trade licences, leading to loss of revenue for the MCG. Subsequently, he directed officials to inspect commercial areas across the city and ask the owners to procure licences, or else their structures will be sealed. According to civic officials, a special trade licence camp will also be organised at the Hong Kong Bazar in Sector 57 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-200-shopkeepers-procure-trade-licence-in-gurugram-101638727954522.html

Over 1,000 doctors from across the state, under the banner of the Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) Association, held a meeting in this regard on Sunday in Karnal and later submitted a memorandum to the chief minister. The doctors said that if the long pending demands are not met then out patient departments of all government hospitals in the state will be closed for the whole day on December 13, and emergency and postmortem services will also be shut from December 14 onwards. “Doctors are being forced to go on a path of agitation. On November 9, doctors wore black badges and on November 12 there was a token pen down for two hours throughout the state. It is unanimously decided that our above mentioned issues should be resolved within one week, otherwise doctors will be forced to close OPD services on December 13 and to stop all services, including emergency and post mortem, from December 14 till our demands are met,” states the memorandum submitted to the chief minister. Dr MP Singh, vice-president of HCMS Association said, “We have been demanding the state government to stop direct recruitment of SMOs for months now. Due to direct recruitment, promotions of many officers in the department get affected. Also, there is an acute shortage of specialists in HCMS. Nearly one third of the specialists are working in cadres against the required strength. We have submitted a memorandum to the chief minister through his officer on special duty (OSD).”A senior official in the state health department did not respond to messages sent by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-doctors-in-haryana-threaten-to-go-on-strike-from-december-13-101638727895711.html

Around 103 prisoners from Uttar Pradesh serving life sentence have moved the Supreme Court seeking their premature release. These prisoners have served 20-25 years of prison term.“The state government is scrutinising details of all 103 prisoners before filing its reply in the Supreme Court. Legal opinion from the advocate general’s office is being sought on the issue,” said a state government official in the know about the development. Last week, a Supreme Court bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice AS Bopanna had issued a notice to the state government seeking its response in two weeks saying that though 103 convicts had approached the court, it will not go into individual cases looking at the impact of their release on the society.“The United Provinces Prisoners Release on Probation Act, 1938, clearly states that the government must consider release on probation of such prisoners who have served 14 years’ prison term,” said senior advocate IB Singh. “Only such prisoners who are serving life term for committing heinous crimes are not considered for release on probation. Rest can be considered for release,” Singh added. The Supreme Court had granted ad interim bail in September this year to 97 convicts serving life imprisonment in Agra and Varanasi central jails for more than 20 years. The top court pointed out that the prisoners were not released even though they were entitled to premature release under the Uttar Pradesh government’s 2018 policy. Out of these 97 prisoners, 65 were lodged in Agra central prison, 30 in Varanasi and one each in Mathura and Naini (Prayagraj) jails. The state government had framed a policy on August 1, 2018, for premature release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment annually on the Republic Day or the Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti. The government had amended this policy on July 28, 2021. Under the 2018 policy, only on specific dates, including January 26, August 15, or October 2, convicts were considered for premature release after the prisoners applied under the policy. Now, after the amendments, they are considered for premature release on every 15th day of the month.

05-12-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi has fulfilled dreams of Purvanchal with ₹10 K crore projects: Yogi||Gorakhpur: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said here on Sunday that December 7 would be etched in golden words in the history of development of eastern Uttar Pradesh, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi would gift projects worth almost ₹10,000 crores to the region. These projects include a fertilizer factory (worth ₹8600 crores), AIIMS (worth ₹1010 crores) and three high class laboratories at BRD Medical College. Addressing a press conference at Gorakhnath temple, Yogi said that PM Modi had fulfilled the dreams of Purvanchal and added that this whopping investment would be the largest ever in eastern Uttar Pradesh since independence, propelling the region on the path of growth and development. Notably, PM Modi had laid the foundation stone of the fertilizer factory and AIIMS at Manbela ground on July 22, 2016 during a rally in the run-up to the 2017 assembly elections. “What appeared impossible in opposition rule has been made possible by Modiji,” Yogi said, referring to the establishment of the premier health institute and fertilizer factory. He said that the fertilizer factory which was once the pride of Purvanchal for producing urea for agriculture sector, was shut down following an accident, rendering many jobless. It always seemed impossible to restart this unit, but PM Modi made it possible by first laying its foundation and then inaugurating it. “Whenever we demanded restoration of the closed fertilizer factory, we merely got assurances from the previous government. But Modiji realised that the fertilizer factory was necessary for prosperity of the region,” Yogi said. The CM said that the fertilizer factory, coming up in an area of 600 acres with a capacity to manufacture 12 lakh metric tonnes of neem coated urea, was being set up by Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Limited (HURL). Talking about the deaths of children due to encephalitis and recalling his effort as Gorakhpur MP to fight against the disease, the CM said, “There was a time when flood and disease became the identity of Purvanchal. Over the decades, 40,000 to 50,000 children died of encephalitis but the previous government remained insensitive towards the condition of the poor and helpless people. It was PM Modi who understood their pain and gave AIIMS for treatment of such diseases.” He said that the virus of encephalitis was first recognized in 1971 by the Institute of Virology in Pune, but there were no labs in Gorakhpur and samples used to go to Pune. “But now we have set up three highly advanced labs at the Regional Medical Centre, BRD Medical College,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-has-fulfilled-dreams-of-purvanchal-with-rs-10-k-crore-projects-yogi-101638727294876.html

Category 3 instrument landing systems are installed at airports which face regular issues of low visibility.“There are different types of instrument landing systems Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 (aka, Category A, Category B and Category C). According to the system installed at the airport, pilots are trained accordingly,” said a Lohegaon airport official, on the request of anonymity.“In Delhi, Category 3 is installed so even if visibility is 100m, a pilot trained on that system can do the landing. This type of system is only installed where low visibility is a common occurrence, like airports in the northern belt like Delhi, Amritsar, Jaipur, Lucknow, and Chandigarh,” added the official.Most other airports have landing systems that are Category 1 or Category 2.“In Pune this is a very abnormal phenomenon and it has been caused due to upper air cyclonic circulation off the south Gujarat coast and north Konkan system,” added the official.On Sunday, 11 flights got delayed between 2am and 10am at the Pune airport. Flights UK 971 (Del-PNQ) and AI851 (DEL-PNQ) were diverted to Mumbai due to bad weather conditions.

Moving forward with a plan to improve pedestrian safety, and therefore walkability, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has allocated a budget to install 125 pedestrian signals at various chowks in the city. “As part of Pedestrian Day, observed in the city on December 11, we have approved 125 chowks in the city to be installed with modern pedestrian signals with countdown timers. The proposal was submitted by the electrical department and has been approved. Similarly, under Smart city project, more 125 chowks in the city will also get new pedestrian signals,” said Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol. According to the survey conducted by PMC, roads like Gadital Solapur road, Ganapati chowk, Vimannagar, Pen chowk, Senapati Bapat road, Athavale chowk, Law College road, Karnatak School chowk, Gulwane road, Sant Kabir chowk, Nehru road, Khadi Machine chowk, Katraj-Kondhwa road need better pedestrian crossing and management in order to install new signals. Besides signals, the mayor is also keen on zebra crossings being highlighted distinctly as well as having better footpaths in the city. “We have specifically asked our departments to keep the underground pathways in the city, clean and to be fully equipped with lights and CCTV cameras from December 11 onwards,” said Mohol. Harshad Abhyangkar, representing Save Pune Traffic Movement (SPTM) said, “SPTM and other NGOs are compelling Maha Metro to ensure that the roads along the Metro corridors provide sufficient road space for ‘walk-bus-cycle’ infrastructure. A cycle track that implements SPTM’s design suggestions is taking shape on Pashan road. We hope that with it, more cyclists will use the track instead of the carriageway. We have also encouraged the PMC officials to do a ‘Pathpathyatra’ of about 1 km to take note of the difficulties encountered while walking on the sidewalk and make improvements.” “On this Pedestrian Day, we are trying to highlight pedestrian’s importance through various interventions like safer streets, safer junctions, safer mid-block crossing, pedestrian only shopping streets, and pedestrian signals. Most of the city’s arterial streets are so motorist-oriented that citizens can barely cross the street Pedestrian signals must be implemented at every junction on priority to improve pedestrian’s safety on the streets,” said Aditya Chawande, architect urban designer, project associate at Parisar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/125-pedestrian-signals-to-be-installed-across-pune-city-101638725495545.html

This is on the behest of Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, who along with the Save Pune Traffic Movement (SPTM) has declared December 11 as the city’s Pedestrian Day where more importance will be given to walking than to vehicles. Laxmi Road will be closed to traffic from Nimbalkar Talim chowk to Umbraya Ganapati chowk. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) will arrange special buses for the day. “We request the citizens to enjoy the bus ride and try not to get their vehicles in order to experience the open street mall. This will be done for only a day. The shopkeepers have also welcomed this decision. This is part of our attempt to create public awareness regarding pedestrian’s way,” said Mohol. Pranjali Deshpande, an expert on Urban traffic management and also part of this movement said, “On December 11, pedestrians will be able to enjoy shopping without traffic hurdles. On this day the street will be closed for vehicles from Nimbalkar Talim chowk to Umbraya Ganapati chowk.” The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), in November conducted surveys to understand views of pedestrians, and shopkeepers on pedestrianising Laxmi road. “Most of the respondents are positive for a one-day trial of the same. Pedestrians have given a positive response, as most of them walk a long distance from the parking area to shops. Pedestrians also mentioned that crossing the street multiple times to access shops on the other side is a big hassle,” added Deshpande, who helped the officials with technical support to analyse data, survey form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vehiclefree-laxmi-road-on-pedestrian-day-101638725255981.html

05-12-2021||Noida||Noida: 37 luxury buses fined ₹10k for illegally picking up, dropping passengers||The transport department on Saturday evening fined 37 luxury buses ₹10,000 each for illegally picking up or dropping passengers on the Noida Expressway near Mahamaya Flyover. Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), enforcement, Gautam Budh Nagar, said the luxury buses have All India tourist permit. “This permit allows tourist buses to pick up passengers from one place and drop them at another place. This permit does not allow picking up or dropping passengers on the way. On Saturday, we conducted a vehicle-checking drive and found these buses, which were going from Delhi to UP west via Noida, were illegally picking up and dropping passengers near Mahamaya Flyover. These buses have been fined ₹10,000 each for permit violations,” he said. Tiwari said illegal parking of these buses also leads to congestion on the Noida Expressway and slows down traffic movement. He added some buses were also fined for using pressure horns with an aim to check noise pollution as per the orders of the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal. Shyam Lal Gola, president of All India Luxury Bus Union, said there are 4,780 luxury buses having All India permit in his union. “These buses travel interstate and ferry a number of passengers to Bihar, UP, Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and other states. A number of people from Noida also travel in these buses. However, there is no bus stand in Noida for these buses for pick-up and drop service. Commuters sometimes gather near Mahamaya Flyover to catch the bus. The drivers stop the buses there to pick up passengers,” he said. Gola said he has advised bus operators not to stop buses in Noida. “We demand a bus stand in Noida so that local people can easily board the buses. The bus driver will also be able to drop commuters without any problem,” he said adding it will also add revenue to the government exchequer. Officials from the transport department said roadway buses and buses with stage carriage permits are allowed to pick up and drop commuters on the Noida expressway. In July 2019, the Noida transport department had seized around 72 luxury buses in Noida and Greater Noida for violating permit rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-37-luxury-buses-fined-10k-for-illegally-picking-up-dropping-passengers-101638724714229.html

05-12-2021||Lucknow||UPTET question paper leak: Role of police constable under scanner||While exploring further nexus of people involved in UP Teachers’ Eligibility Test-2021 (UPTET) question paper leak, the UP police Special Task Force (STF) is cross-checking the role of a police constable whose name surfaced during recent arrests from Aligarh in the case, said senior police official. He said the raids were carried out in Aligarh and Agra in search of the constable and his associates. The official said the constable’s role surfaced after the arrest of one Gaurav Kumar from Aligarh. He said Gaurav, who is resident for Aligarh’s Tappal, revealed during interrogation that he had arranged question papers with the help of his friend Nirdosh Singh, the resident of Gonda, Aligarh. The investigation revealed that Nirdosh has arranged these papers through Dharmendra Malik, Ravi Pawar alias Bunty, Manish Malik alias Monu, Ajay alias Bablu from some contact in Mathura. He said it is suspected that Nirdosh’s brother, who is a police constable, was also in the knowhow of the entire thing. He said the investigation about Nirdosh’s involvement is being crosschecked. So far, 39 people had been arrested in connection with the paper leak case while the involvement of at least 10 others surfaced in the matter. The UP STF had arrested 34 people while five others were arrested by the local police unit in Basti district. The state government had cancelled the UPTET-2021 scheduled on November 28 after the paper leak came to fore following the arrests and recovery of question papers from some of them hours before the exam on November 27.

05-12-2021||Pune||Swachh a pity, say Bavdhan residents; conduct own cleanliness survey||Pune jumped 10 spots to be ranked India’s fifth cleanest city in the ‘Swachh Survekshan 2021’, results of which were declared on November 20. However, this did not sit well with the Bavdhan residents who believe the reality on ground is contradicting and their area is an embodiment of irresponsibly discarded filth. Suggesting that the ratings could be rigged, a group of 10-20 volunteers from Bavdhan Citizens’ Forum decided to take matters in their own hands and conducted their own survey. “We surveyed 10 main lanes and service roads in Bavdhan and documented every spot where garbage was being dumped. This is what we found, considering the total area of Bavdhan, the number of janitors is inadequate. There is also a lack of garbage trucks and lanes are not cleaned daily. So much so, some lanes aren’t cleaned for ten days. The garbage isn’t picked up immediately, leading to accumulation of garbage on the road. The cleaner’s sort and store garbage on the road, which in turn leads to people dumping more garbage on that spot, said Dushyant Bhatia, a member of the forum. Through the survey, the members also observed, that no action was taken against hotels, societies, citizens, vegetable growers, shopkeepers who litter the streets. Due to the lack of a timetable for the garden waste pickup, the society and the citizens throw mulch and branches on the road. The members have used the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) complaint portal to highlight the ever- growing garbage menace, only to have the ticket closed without attending or some temporary clean-up done. In their survey, the members found that root of the problem are habitual violators, weak system of garbage pickup service, improper ways of street sweeping and collection of collected waste, no fixed garden waste collection schedule and unfinished road/footpath works. Resident Deepa Prabhu says, “We have a concept called adopt a lane, wherein volunteers adopt the lane they live in and report civic issues, connect with concerned departments and get it resolved. But garbage is a huge issue and needs holistic approach. So, we have got all the chronic spots and pain points covered through this survey. This exercise helped us to identify major issues and hence give crisp points for discussion and probable solutions. Now it’s easy for us to sit with the ground level PMC cleanliness team to take appropriate action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/swachh-a-pity-say-bavdhan-residents-conduct-own-cleanliness-survey-101638723635240.html
05-12-2021||Pune||Nod sought for hiring 50 firemen on contract basis in Pune||Following the state government’s reluctance to fill vacant posts, the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) has decided to hire firemen on contract basis. Given the shortage of manpower, the PMC standing committee chairman approved the contract-based recruitment, according to officials of the city fire department. According to Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, Pune city, a total of 910 posts have been sanctioned, out of which 527 posts are vacant. The current strength of PMC fire department is 383, and the contract hiring will add 50 firemen to the existing strength. “Yes, the number of firemen being hired is less. However, in the old jurisdiction of PMC, we have had fire stations which were functional with only two people. They are not able to use the vehicle, so their vehicles are brought to the central station. These 50 firemen will ensure that every station has a vehicle and staff strength to use it,” said Ranpise. While the temporary post-filling will help the fire department in mitigating the fire-related duties in the city better, the fate of those hired in these temporary roles is something to be pondered over. “This has been done before. We had hired firemen on contract three years ago,” said Ranpise. However, what the deal means for those signing up for the risky job on a temporary basis was evident from Ranpise’s answer, “I do not know what happened after the year was up. We were not hiring, and the contract ended.” The fire department of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) works with maximum percentage of staff on contract basis. A 27-year-old fireman from Pirangut division, who has been on contract for the past three years, outlined their plight under condition of anonymity. “We do not get housing facility like fire officials usually do or dearness allowance. We work six days a week and there is no concept of annual leave. If we remain absent on a day aside from our weekly off, we face pay cuts. Health insurance is a joke. The training that we underwent in Mumbai was paid for by us; it cost me around ₹1-1.5 lakh. The difference between the lives of my colleagues on government payroll and mine is vast, while we both do the same job,” said the official.  Manpower crunch Sanctioned posts: 910 Number of ranks: 22-24 Vacancy: 527 Present strength: 383 Number of fire divisions: 12 Retired in 2020-2021: 33 Estimated staff requirement for new jurisdiction: 2,500||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nod-sought-for-hiring-50-firemen-on-contract-basis-in-pune-101638723344824.html

The council elections are slated to be held on December 10.Bommai, who addressed the 'Vijay Sankalp' convention organised by the Bharaitya Janata Party (BJP) at Attibele, said, "The Congress had stooped to the level of using any means to win the elections. Fielding those with moneybags as its candidates, making them pay big for the party kitty. There is a clear fall of morality in the Congress. People should show the Congress its place as the party is trying to win the election through immoral splurge of money."Hitting back at Congress veteran and former CM Siddaramaiah's allegations that the BJP always used money and muscle power to win elections, Bommai said it is the grand old party which indulged in money distribution."What morality do you talk about when you are banking on money for selecting candidates to fight the election? You (Siddaramaiah) did not bother to look at gram panchayats when in power. Your promise just ahead of the 2017 election to distribute one lakh houses has remained a promise," Bommai said.The CM further said the BJP-led government in the state has initiated steps to build one lakh homes in urban areas and four lakh homes in rural areas, which would be completed in the next one and half years.The BJP is contesting in 20 out of 25 seats in the legislative council election across 20 local bodies, voting for which will take place on December 10.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/cm-bommai-says-congress-trying-to-win-council-polls-through-money-101638720030311.html

Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, Maharashtra said, “Though it is too premature to predict if a third wave may set in, the Omicron strain shows mild symptoms. Hence, this variant may be in disguise. It may also act as natural vaccination and build up immunity.” So far, a total of 4,901 international passengers have arrived in Maharashtra, at the Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports, from countries designated as high-risk. Their RT-PCR samples have been collected, and of these, nine were found to be Covid-positive, and have been sent for genomic sequencing. Public health minister Rajesh Tope stressed on the need for increasing vaccination coverage and observing Covid-appropriate behaviour. “However, there is no cause for panic. Experts from South Africa said that the variant shows mild symptoms, but with high transmissibility,” he said, adding that in South Africa, there were no reports of any high need for hospitalization, ICU admissions or death rate. On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 707 Covid-19 cases with Mumbai accounting for 207, with a total of 7,151 active cases. It also saw seven fatalities, taking the mortality tally to 1,41,170. A total of 78,858 people are in home quarantine and 916 people are in institutional quarantine. Maharashtra has till 7pm on Sunday had administered 11,84,35,568 doses to 7,58,84,638 people inoculated with first dose and 4,25,50,930 with both their doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/seven-more-omicron-cases-reported-in-state-101638718658082.html
05-12-2021||Patna||Judges should not count their leaves: SC judge||Judges should not count their leaves and instead devote all the time to the service of the people, as there is no alternative to hard work, said Justice MR Shah, Supreme Court judge, at the valedictory session of the 30th batch of civil judges (junior division) of the Bihar Judicial Services, organised by the Bihar Judicial Academy here on Sunday. Speaking as the chief guest, Justice Shah reminded the young officers that honesty, integrity, impartiality, empathy and a complete dedication towards work were the hallmarks of a good Judge. He interacted and met the 337 civil judges and motivated them to give their best to society, said a communique issued through the district public relations officer, Patna, on Sunday. Justice Sanjay Karol, chief justice of the Patna high court-cum-patron in chief, Bihar Judicial Academy, spoke about the quality training provided to the young officers by the best minds of the country even during the pandemic. He also reminded the young civil judges that a judge should always be humble and behave properly with the advocates and the litigants. He highlighted the fact that Patna high court and the people of Bihar had high hopes from these young judges and that they need to work hard and follow the necessary judicial discipline to live up to the expectation. Justice Rajan Gupta, judge of the Patna high court-cum-executive chairman Bihar State Legal Services Authority, cautioned the young officers that due process of law should not be compromised on account of haste to merely contain the figures of pendency. On the other hand, due process of law should be used to instil confidence in the general public. Justice Ashwani Kumar Singh, judge of the Patna high court-cum-chairman, Bihar Judicial Academy, urged the young judges that they should keep evolving as a person and not let their knowledge stagnate. Earlier, Alok Kumar Pandey, director of the Bihar Judicial Academy delivered the welcome address while Bharat Bhushan Bhasin, additional director of the academy proposed a vote of thanks..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/judges-should-not-count-their-leaves-sc-judge-101638716793582.html
05-12-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai fire brigade to train sr citizens and homemakers with fire-safety skills||From January 2022, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) will begin an awareness drive in a phased manner to arm senior citizens and homemakers with basic firefighting skills. The training will be free of cost and will be held during weekends in the command centres at Byculla, Wadala, Vikhroli, Mankhurd and Borivli.Explaining why MFB has decided to rope in senior citizens in the drive, Hemant Parab, chief fire officer, Mumbai Fire Brigade informed, “Several senior citizens hold a key position in the management bodies of the housing societies across Mumbai. Sensitising them with fire prevention acts will enable them to carry out regular maintenance in their premises and also, they will be able to identify and alert us about discrepancy or malfunction in fire equipment of their buildings.” Last month, the fire brigade sent notices to more than 90 residential buildings for non-compliance with fire safety norms. MFB discovered during their regular inspections that members of several housing societies are not aware of the maintenance of the firefighting systems. “Besides teaching and sensitising them with provisions of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, basic firefighting techniques like operating an extinguisher, maintaining the refuge areas, evacuation techniques and household items that can be used to douse the fire, will be included in the training session,” shared Parab.Homemakers will be trained under the unique module which has been jointly organised with an NGO, Project Mumbai, as the fire brigade found in its case studies that women and children are some of the most vulnerable during fire incidents.Parab informed, “Several fire incidents occur due to cylinder blasts at home. The idea is to give homemakers a basic understanding of how to control the flame at its initial stage. The NGO will be providing all the logistic support and help people get registered for the course.”Shishir Joshi, founder and CEO of Project Mumbai said that the overall programme has been divided into four categories. While the first two involves senior citizens and housewives, the third and fourth categories will be arranging awareness drives and campaigns at schools and municipal ward levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-brigade-to-train-sr-citizens-and-homemakers-with-fire-safety-skills-101638716673741.html

The Army personnel were conducting an operation in the area after receiving inputs on the movement of militants of Yung Aung faction of proscribed outfit NSCN (K) but mistakenly fired at a ferry van carrying local coal miners, officials said. Another civilian was killed while a few others were injured in Mon town on Sunday when security personnel opened fire to fend off an angry mob that had vandalized the camp of 27th Assam Rifles camp after Saturday’s incident, officials said. “In the two firing incidents, in all, 13 civilians were killed,” said a local police officer, who was not willing to be quoted considering the sensitivities involved. Army personnel reportedly fired at a ferry van carrying local coal miners to Oting village from Tiru on Saturday late evening. Police officials said the pick-up truck was ferrying Oting villagers who were working in a coalfield near Tiru. The coal miners normally return home on Saturday and report back to work on Monday, the official said.The vehicle was allegedly fired on by Army personnel who were conducting an operation in the area after receiving inputs on the movement of militants of Yung Aung faction of proscribed outfit NSCN (K), the police officer quoted above said. Mon shares a porous international border with Myanmar, where the Yung Aung faction of NSCN (K) is based. Hearing about the incident, police said, angry villagers reached the spot and attacked Army personnel in which a jawan lost his life. They also reportedly set ablaze two security vehicles, sparking off another round of firing by security forces to “control the situation”, police said. The injured and the dead bodies were said to have been shifted to Mon district headquarters. “The security forces have suffered severe injuries in the incident including one soldier who succumbed to the injuries,” the headquarters of 3 Corps, the Army unit conducting the operation, said. Arson was reported from different parts of the district on Sunday in which two government vehicles were burnt and protest marches were held. The Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO), the apex body of six Naga tribes of five districts including Mon, directed locals not to participate in the Hornbill festival, the state’s biggest festival that started last week. Nagaland home commissioner Abhijit Sinha said section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been imposed in Mon district and internet services have been suspended “till further orders”. Local police are conducting a flag march in the area to prevent any other untoward incident, he said. The state government and the army have both constituted inquiry teams to probe into the incident. In a statement, the Army said a court of inquiry has been ordered and “deeply regretted” the incident. The Army said the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated at the highest level. Chief minister Neiphiu Rio promised a high-level probe into the incident and appealed to all sections of the society to maintain peace as he returned to Kohima from New Delhi after the incident. “The unfortunate incident leading to the killing of civilians at Oting, Mon is highly condemnable. Condolences to the bereaved families & speedy recovery of those injured. High level SIT will investigate & justice delivered as per the law of the land. Appeal for peace from all sections,” he tweeted. Union home minister Amit Shah also tweeted, “Anguished over an unfortunate incident in Nagaland’s Oting, Mon. I express my deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives. A high-level SIT constituted by the State govt will thoroughly probe this incident to ensure justice to the bereaved families.” The Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO), the apex body of six Naga tribes of five districts including Mon, has vehemently condemned the “barbaric act” of the security forces. The ENPO has requested all its six (Konyak, Khiamniungan, Phom, Sangtam, Yimkhiung and Chang) tribes to abstain from participating in the ongoing Hornbill Festival with immediate effect till the funeral rites of the deceased are completed, and directed them to hoist black flags at their morungs (traditional huts) at the main festival site- The Naga Heritage Village Kisama. The Konyak Union Kohima, whose office in Mon Town was also vandalised, has already announced to abstain from any further participation at the ongoing festival citing atrocities perpetrated by the security forces at Oting village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/14-die-in-security-operation-in-nagaland-cm-calls-for-high-level-probe-101638716313780.html
05-12-2021||Mumbai||Mamata not considering a political foray into Maharashtra: Shiv Sena||Stirring the political pot, Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha (RS) MP Sanjay Raut has said that All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) president and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee seems to be looking at creating an anti-Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) front while excluding the Congress from it. Raut added however that the AITMC is not considering a political foray into Maharashtra as the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are standing up to the might of the BJP effectively.In his weekly column on Sunday in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, of which he is the executive editor, Raut said that Banerjee, who visited Mumbai last week and met Sena leader and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, wants to expand beyond her state. The AITMC has already created a footprint in Goa, Meghalaya and Tripura, he said. “It seems that she is thinking of doing something new minus the Congress,” wrote Raut, quickly adding that the AITMC chief had said that they are not eager to make a foray into Maharashtra due to the strong presence of the Shiv Sena and NCP.Taking a potshot at the BJP for claiming that Banerjee came here to poach local industries, Raut said, “They (BJP) criticised Banerjee but did not utter a word against the Gujarat chief minister who met industrialists from Maharashtra for the Vibrant Gujarat summit. This is hypocrisy.”The Congress is a constituent of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, which is led by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. During her visit to Mumbai, Banerjee, while speaking to the press, questioned the existence of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) which is anchored by the Congress.In a deliberate reference to Banerjee’s slogan during her visit, “Jai Bangla, Jai Maharashtra” Raut said, “This cry is a symbol of how politics will shape up in the future.” He likened Banerjee’s visit to that of a sister returning to her parents’ home.Raut said that like the BJP’s resounding defeat in West Bengal at the hands of Banerjee, a similar set of events had played out in Maharashtra (through the formation of the MVA government) “to stand up to the overarching dominance of Delhi”. The people of Maharashtra and Bengal had defeated the “power, money and extreme terrorism of the central investigating agencies,” he said.Referring to the clashes between the West Bengal government and the Centre, Raut quoted Banerjee as saying, “the Marathas and the Bengalis are martial people; they will not step down…”With the BJP having questioned details of the meeting between Banerjee and Aaditya Thackeray at the Trident hotel, Raut said that the duo discussed the development of tourism in both the states and that Banerjee demanded a plot in Mumbai for accommodating cancer patients visiting the Tata Memorial hospital in Mumbai.BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar had ridiculed Banerjee’s visit to Mumbai as “a storm in a teacup”. “All regional parties cannot coalesce together due to the contradictions involved. So, there will be multiple alliances… Hence, an anti-(Narendra) Modi all-party alliance cannot shape up,” Bhatkhalkar had said. In a cautious comment, Atul Londhe, chief spokesperson of the Maharashtra Congress, said that the column and Saamana’s editorial position had put forth an anti-BJP stance. He said that unlike Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel and his predecessor Anandiben Patel, Banerjee had come here to serve as a link between Maharashtra and Bengal. “The Congress has nationwide presence… to defeat the BJP, the Congress will have to be taken together,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mamata-not-considering-a-political-foray-into-maharashtra-shiv-sena-101638716074097.html

05-12-2021||Patna||Omicron scare impacts hospitality sector in Bodh Gaya||Though the Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease is yet to make an entry into the state, the hospitality sector in Bodh Gaya, the major tourist destination of Bihar, has started feeling its impacts. Bookings and even queries to block facilities at hotels, tour packages and guides have stopped coming and even those which were to be confirmed in the last three-four days, have been cancelled, as per hotel owners, package tour planners and guides in Bodh Gaya. Bodh Gaya is one of the most visited destinations in the state during winters. It was here Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, located on the premises of Mahabodhi temple. To mark the spiritual significance of that incident, various Buddhist sects and groups hold Buddhist Puja ceremonies, rituals and prayer sessions during winters which include Chivar Daan, a ritual of donating robes to the monks and nuns to Sutta Path and prayers for world peace. These festivals are learnt to be attended by tourists from across the world, keeping the hotels, tour package centres and guides at Bodh Gaya occupied and throbbing with activities throughout the tourism season from October to March. “And when Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual Guru is in the holy city, more than 1.5 lakh foreign tourists stay back there. A huge number of tourists mean big businesses for all in Bodh Gaya, ranging from hotels, tour planners and guides to roadside food vendors and handicrafts sellers. Everybody remains engaged and earn money. And this time as the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC), which manages the maintenance and activities at the Mahabodhi temple, allowed six Buddhist festivals and Pujas, the entire sector expected a good season after a long gap of two seasons amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The knock made by Omicron variant of the Covid-19 in the country has spoilt everything,” Suresh Kumar Singh, the Bodh Gaya Travel Association secretary, said. Even the case of a member of the Mongolian delegation, which visited Bodh Gaya a couple of days ago, testing positive for Covid-19 seems to have created panic among people. “We had a good number of queries for the bookings of the packages and hotels. In fact, people were preparing to visit Bodh Gaya in December end or in January-February 2022 to attend Buddhist Pujas. And Srilankans were planning to turn up in March 2022,” he said. But there came the news of Omicron cases being identified in the country and all the queries stopped. Even those which were to be confirmed have been put on hold, he added. “What if the state again comes under the lockdown?” he said. Rakesh Kumar, the Bodh Gaya tourist guide association secretary said the hospitality sector people just started getting back to normal when the Omicron hit again. “The immediate impact of the new variant of Covid-19 is Union government’s decision to revise its plan to resume international flights from December 15. Now, the new date will be announced later, “ he said. The hospitality sector in Bodh Gaya cannot survive without foreign tourists. Though the government has been promoting domestic tourism and people are also visiting Bodh Gaya, they are not staying back, he added.

05-12-2021||Mumbai||FIR against gangster Suresh Pujari for extortion||Mumbai The Mumbai police have registered an extortion case against gangster Suresh Pujari for allegedly trying to extort money from a Borivali-based hotelier by threatening to kill him. Apart from the local police, the case against Pujari is also being probed by the city crime branch officials. The complainant, a resident of Bhayander, works in a Borivali hotel as the manager. The hotel is owned by four partners.According to the police, on June 25, the manager received a call from an unidentified number asking for the four owners. The caller identified himself as gangster Suresh Pujari and asked the manager to tell his employers to give him the extortion money. Again between June 26-29, the manager received several phone calls from seven different and unknown numbers, but he didn’t answer. He then received a threatening SMS stating that if the hotel owners did not call Pujari, then his men would barge into the hotel and kill him. The hoteliers were afraid and didn’t inform anyone about the threats. On October 15 when Suresh Pujari was arrested in Philippines by the local intelligence services, the hoteliers mustered courage to report the matter to the police. The police have registered a case against Pujari under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for extortion and death threats. The crime branch officials are also making a parallel probe in the case.At present, Pujari has eight extortion cases registered against him in Mumbai. Pujari had been on the run for the past 14 years and in 2015, Interpol issued a Red Corner Notice against him.According to police officials, Suresh Pujari was initially associated with underworld don Chhota Rajan and Ravi Pujari gangs, but in 2011 he formed his own gang. “Even after forming a separate gang Suresh Pujari and Ravi Pujari stayed in touch and helped each other,” said a crime branch official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-against-gangster-suresh-pujari-for-extortion-101638708333303.html

05-12-2021||Delhi||ATM withdrawal: Need to clearly define terms of use||A court’s interpretation of a law or a rule or even terms and conditions of a contract, can well have far reaching implications for consumers. One such verdict of a district consumer disputes redressal commission, given in 2018, continues to haunt consumers even today.I am referring to the order of the Fourth Additional District Consumer Commission in Bengaluru, saying that when a wife or a husband withdraws money from an ATM at the behest of the spouse, it constitutes ‘unauthorised’ use. Therefore, the bank enjoyed immunity from liability towards any deficiency in service connected with that particular ATM withdrawal.Of course, one can put forward many arguments against this verdict. Besides, there is some comfort in the thought that neither the apex consumer court nor the final authority in the matter — the Supreme Court — has looked into the issue. However, given the consequences of such a verdict on millions of ATM users, it is absolutely essential to find an immediate out-of-court solution to the problem created by the consumer court verdict, keeping in mind the ground realities in the country.Before I go further, let me give a brief account of this case for the benefit of those who may not be aware of it. The case is about a woman, recuperating after delivering a child, handing over her ATM card and PIN number to her husband, for withdrawal of ₹25,000 from her account. Unfortunately, the ATM did not dispense the money, but showed a debit in her account. The husband immediately called up the bank’s helpline and was assured that the money would be deposited into his wife’s account.When this was not done, the couple lodged a complaint and was told that as per the terms and conditions governing the ATM card, the card was not transferable, the card holder was not entitled to hand it over to anyone nor disclose the PIN number. By asking her husband to draw the money, the consumer had violated these terms and conditions and therefore was not entitled to claim any relief.The district consumer commission agreed with this view and held that the bank bore no liability for the unauthorised use of the card and having violated the terms and conditions, the consumer was not entitled to any relief (Mrs. Vandana Vs the General Manager, SBI local head office, Bengaluru — CC. No. 1786 of 2014, decided on May 29, 2018).Now there are many unanswered questions here. For example, did the bank bring to the notice of the customer, the terms and conditions of usage and explain the meaning of the term ‘not transferable’? Did the bank tell the customer that asking the spouse to withdraw money constituted violation of the terms of usage? Does not asking your spouse to draw money from the ATM on your behalf constitute ‘deemed authorisation’ and therefore such withdrawal, authorised? If the cash was not dispensed by the ATM, how can the bank keep the money that legally belongs to the customer? Is it not illegal? Does it not constitute ‘unjust enrichment’? How can such conduct be upheld?These are of course questions to be considered by the courts, but in the meanwhile, it is imperative that the banks immediately provide for such ‘authorised’ withdrawal. A large section of the population — the sick, visually challenged, physically constrained people and very senior citizens, depend on their spouse or a close relative to draw money on their behalf. While cheques are mostly used in these situations, there could be emergencies where someone has to rush to an ATM in the night to draw cash. Besides, with many banks closing down branches as unviable, a bank branch may be too far away. In fact, the very convenience of an ATM card would be defeated if one is unable to authorise even a spouse or a close friend or a close relative to draw cash on your behalf, particularly in emergencies. One way out could be to provide for an ‘authorised user’. That is, the ATM card holder can be given an option of filling up a form, giving details of an authorised user and his or her photograph. It is a little different from an add-on credit card in that here the card remains with the card holder and whenever necessary, he or she can give the card and the PIN number to the authorised user to draw cash. The card holder can withdraw this authorisation-again through a proper format — whenever required and of course change the PIN. This way, the debit card holder enjoys the convenience of asking the authorized person to withdraw money on her or his behalf , while also taking responsibility for withdrawals or usage by the authorised user. Will the Reserve Bank kindly consider this?

He also said that the BJP was in touch with several other AAP MLAs in Punjab, according to a report in the Indian Express.The two-time MP from Sangrur, however, did not name anyone, even as he stated that he was contacted four days ago. "Mann sahab, what would you take to join the BJP?,” Mann quoted the BJP leader as saying, adding that he was also asked if "you need money".Maan said he was further told that if he joined the saffron camp, he would be made a Union cabinet minister. "I told him (BJP leader) that I am on a mission not on commission," said the AAP's lone MP from Punjab while talking to reporters in Chandigarh.He said he told the BJP leader that there might be others "whom you could buy", but he could not be bought with money or anything else.When asked to name the BJP leader, he said he would disclose it when the time comes, adding that the BJP has no base in Punjab. “Its leaders are not even allowed to enter villages and are facing anger from farmers over the agri laws that its government at the Centre introduced. No one who has the future of Punjab in mind would join the BJP,” Mann added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bhagwant-mann-of-aap-says-bjp-offered-him-money-cabinet-berth-to-switch-camp-101638702469267.html
05-12-2021||Pune||Your Space: Authorities should step up prevention measures to deal with Omicron threat||We all witnessed devastation caused by the second wave, many were infected, some succumbed to it and some outlived the tragedy. In view of the new variant, we do not want to relive the second Covid wave nightmare and the government should take steps to contain its spread, say readers.Preventive measures should be in placeAs the threat of the Omicron variant looms, it is necessary to contain its spread. The government should have preventive measures in place and not cause panic by imposing lockdowns. After numerous lockdowns, businesses have resumed and are started to get back on track, if the spread is contained, a lockdown can be avoided. Along with preventive measures, vaccination of all beneficiaries is also essential. With the government on alert, they should be well prepared for all challenges. Sudden change in the rules create panic. Sudden changes in the guidelines cannot be fulfilled immediately. The government should intimate 4-5 days in advance so that people can be prepared. There should be consistency in the rules and proper coordination between government agencies. Bhoovnesh KakaniIncrease testing, follow Covid-19 protocolsAfter handling two Covid waves, it is expected that authorities would know what to do and how to handle this challenge appropriately. Testing should be increased and those who are not vaccinated yet should be encouraged to take the jab. All stakeholders in the various industries should be asked to exercise utmost care, follow all Covid-19 protocols and educate others on Covid-appropriate behaviour. Now that new Covid variant Omicron has entered Maharashtra, hopefully our authorities will take proper care by strictly following appropriate protocols. They should start surveillance at all public places such as markets, malls, mandis. Many people have stopped observing it. Aamar JoshiWe need a pragmatic approachIt is a little early to predict the exact course of how this variant will impact us. Businesses are watching closely as already the global business eco system is stressed. Container rates are at an all-time high, fuel costs have been high, input cost inflation has never been higher. Further disruptions by this variant will have tougher pressures on all.Also, the global and domestic travel restrictions and testing protocols will hamper business travel; that had just started to open. Overall, we need a pragmatic approach from global leaders towards handling this crisis. Sudden changes and prohibitive rules will not solve problems. Politics and optics should not outweigh businesses and sustainability.Indraneel ChitaleMask up, wash hands and sanitiseAuthorities should follow the pragmatic and sustainable ways instead of rushing to show that they are doing something. Also, responsibilities lie with people as well. Now, no new suggestions are being made. Wear mask, wash hands, avoid crowding, follow Covid protocols if tested positive are the basic norms which we have been told again and again. But somehow, we are not paying attention to that and not following these rules. Fines and penalties have their limitations. They won’t work every time. People should follow this on their level for the safety of their family. Now if you go to public places like malls or parks, hardly anyone wears mask or even carries sanitiser. Seems like we have left washing hands frequently and not touching the surfaces behind us. So, we should not wait for the virus to ravage us again to start following the protocols. If we do it now, then probably the worst can be averted.Kamal JagtapRemain cautious and proactiveVariants of coronavirus will keep coming. We don’t need to panic but remain cautious and proactive. We can protect ourselves from variants if we’re fully vaccinated and observe Covid-appropriate behaviour. But unfortunately, this is not happening. Everyone seems to have forgotten about the virus. If the pandemic has taught us one thing, it is that we cannot fight and win the war against this virus with half-measures and half- drafted policies. If authorities are not willing to do that, then there’s no point in having restrictions. Also, people who are spreading misinformation about the ineffectiveness of vaccines should be tapped and prohibited from doing so. Pooja JoshiImprove border surveillance and vaccinationWe have already suffered during the last two waves on every be it finance, health or loss of lives. It is evident that this virus is not going anywhere. We will have to keep fighting it with proper measures. It is a collaborative fight against the common enemy in which citizens and authorities should come together. Experts have said that vigilance, genome sequencing, improving border surveillance and vaccination are some of the things that are necessary to tackle the new Omicron variant. I hope authorities are taking the necessary steps to implement it. Citizens should also keep following the preventive norms.

05-12-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai local train operations to become faster, say Railways. Here's how||The Western Railway (WR) zone of the Indian Railways, which operates the Mumbai suburban railway network, has announced that the essential Mumbai local trains will now be running at a faster speed. The announcement comes as the railways carried out several major works on the line to remove operational constraints and enhance the mobility and safety in train operations.According to a LiveMint report, with the successful removal of several bottlenecks on the operational lines, the punctuality of Mumbai suburban trains has increased from 95% in the year 2019-20 to 99.3% in the year 2021-22.Here are the changes brought into effect:The Railways said that they removed the permanent speed restriction (PSR) of 20kmph on Marine Lines saving 2 minutes per train or 560 minutes in a day, as reported by LiveMint. The PSR of 60kmph has also been removed between Bandra and Khar section, saving 1.25 min/train or 307 min/day.Further, the report stated, the 3 line crossover at Santacruz has been converted into a 2 line crossover, enabling officials to increase the speed from 15kmph to 30kmph.The speed at crossover 145/146 at Dadar has been increased from 15kmph to 30kmph, enabling faster receipt and dispatch of trains from platform 6. At Mumbai Central, the shunting time has been reduced by 30 minutes, due to extension of shunting neck for 25 coach LHB rakes.“The relaxation of Permanent Speed Restriction has also resulted in increasing the speed of the trains to 50kmph from 35kmph on harbour line. It will be useful in increasing the punctuality of the trains by 2 minutes per train," a senior official of the Western Railway told LiveMint.“Similarly, the speed at cross over 101/102 at Bhayander has been increased to 30kmph from 15kmph, resulting in savings of 1.25 min/train. Also, the common loop at Bhayander has been made fit for passenger trains which will help in better operational flexibility for prioritising the trains," the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-train-operations-to-become-faster-say-railways-here-s-how-101638698040303.html

05-12-2021||Bhopal||Road roller set on fire in MP as Naxals declare bandh on December 10||Naxalites burnt a road roller engaged in construction work in Madhya Pradesh's Balaghat district and left behind pamphlets calling for a bandh in MP, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh on December 10 to protest the killing of rebels in an encounter in Gadchiroli last month, police said. The incident took place on the intervening night of Friday-Saturday near Korka village of Balaghat, they said. Enraged over the killing of Naxals in a police encounter at Gadchiroli in neighbouring Maharashtra, a group of 18 to 20 rebels burnt the roller engaged in road construction work near Korka village under Birsa police station area, Superintendent of Police Abhishek Tiwari said on Saturday. The Maoists also left behind pamphlets, calling for a bandh on December 10 in three states - Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, he said. Police patrolling has already been increased in affected areas since the past one-and-a-half-months, the official said, adding that search is now also underway for Naxals involved in burning the road roller. A banner with seven pamphlets, mentioning the name of the Chhattisgarh Zonal Committee and Malajkhand Area Committee of Maoists were also found at the spot, police officials said. The pamphlets mentioned the killing of 26 Naxals, including prominent Maoist leader Milind Teltumbde (57), who was carrying a bounty of ₹50 lakh on his head, in the police encounter in Gadchiroli on November 13, they said. On Saturday, Madhya Pradesh Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Rajesh Rajora informed that the state government had decided to bring three Maoist-hit districts - Dindori, Balaghat and Mandla - under one police zone from December 1. Dindori was part of the Shahdol police zone, but now it has become a part of the Balaghat zone as all the three Naxal-affected districts are brought under one zone, he said. Balaghat has been one of the most Naxal-hit districts in MP. Last month, a group of Naxals allegedly killed two villagers on the suspicion of being police informers in Malikhedi village of Balaghat. In a similar incident in June this year, the rebels had killed a 42-year-old man in Bamhani village under Roopjhar police station area in Balaghat. In August this year, in a major success against Naxalism, the Balaghat police had after an encounter arrested a 25-year-old rebel, identified as Sandeep Kunjam aka Lakkhu, who was carrying a reward of ₹8 lakh on his head. During a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on November 29, officials had informed that seven hardcore Maoists (Area Committee Members or ACM) were killed in police encounters and three others arrested in the past two years in MP, which also led to the seizure of arms and ammunition as well as curbing of extortion activities of the ultras among tendu leaves contractors. Eighteen people were also arrested on charges of supplying arms to Maoists during this period, officials earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/road-roller-set-on-fire-in-mp-as-naxals-declare-bandh-on-december-10-101638693185674.html

The flight operation resumed by 10am after the visibility improved with the city witnessing sunny morning after four days, Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said.To deal with the rush of stranded passengers, the airport authority had to open up the International Security Hold Area for passenger seating.Earlier, Pune airport’s official handle tweeted, “There is low visibility at Pune due to fog. Current visibility is below 100m. As a result, all flights are delayed for the next few hours. All passengers travelling from Pune Airport are requested to check flight timings with their Airlines.”The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had earlier said that high humid conditions with clear skies and calm winds created a favourable condition for fog formation over Pune.As per realtime information provided by IMD. “The visibility at Pune airport was nil at 6am, however it improved to 200m at 9am.”Vineet Kumar, researcher at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said, “Visibility factor depends on flight instruments and the airport.

05-12-2021||Delhi||#WallsOfKindness: A warm hug in winters||New DelhiCome winter, and we pull out the woollens tucked away neatly in our bed boxes or at the top most shelves of our wardrobes. But for the needy, it takes much more than that to stay cozy when the temperature dips to an unbearable low. Fighting this cold with warmth is the initiative named Neki Ki Deewar (wall of kindness), many of which have mushroomed in vibrant colours, at various places in Delhi and even NCR. It’s at these spots that anyone can donate by simply hanging clothes, placing shoes and other objects of utility, for the underprivileged who can pick up whatever they need.“There are several such walls in Janakpuri, and people donate in good amount,” says Vijayan KP, a businessman based in Janakpuri’s C-2 block, adding, “The demand is so high now that if you donate today, it’ll be gone by tomorrow. What’s commendable is that nobody donates clothes are too worn out to be worn. People understand that they are making an effort for a good gesture. My family is also planning to donate a bundle of warm clothes, socks and gloves this month, as this is the time when these things are needed the most. Winter is only going to get more intense in the days to come, and we better lend a helping hand to the needy.A number of walls have resumed operations after the reduction of Covid-19 cases in the city. These often house the repurposed waste collection centres called dhalaos. Monica Rani, a merchandiser by profession, who is a resident of Dwarka’s sector 10, shares, “I heard about Neki Ki Deewar concept when one such wall came up in Dwarka, last month. I went to check out the place and ended up donating some clothes myself. All I did was leave them in hangers for anyone to pick up. This initiative is like a warm hug during this season. More and more people should come forward to give away clothes for those who require them especially for the winter season.”“Assigned caretakers look after each of these facilities, to maintain their cleanliness and operation,” says Yogesh Saini from Delhi Street Art, who has painted some of these dhalaos in colourful scapes of fauna with human figures. Saini informs, “Over the past few months, our team has been actively partnering with both North Delhi Municipal Corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to turn old dilapidated garbage dhalaos into aesthetic looking Neki Ki Deewars, which are essentially donation centres where people can bring their surplus supplies of clothes, books, shoes, toys, etc for donation. The artworks created by us focus on clear and colourfully written visual messages, so that anyone — the donor as well as the recipient of donated goods — can immediately identify these donation centres from a distance.” Rajeev Kumar Jain, superintending engineer (west zone), SDMC, informs that this initiative began in Delhi in 2018 when a wall in Subhash Nagar was earmarked for this purpose. “Today, that wall has more than 250 cloth hangers at any given point of time,” says Jain, adding, “In west Delhi itself, there are six dhalaos that have been converted into Neki Ki Deewar. This initiative actually restores dignity and self-respect of the needy, as there is a certain anonymity in donating and collecting the clothes. And people also get a chance to donate selflessly, to a broader scope of people apart from their househelps. It eliminates that ‘ehsaan’ wali feeling in the whole process and yet spreads the message of kindness.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wallsofkindness-a-warm-hug-in-winters-101638688775588.html
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||‘Daffodils’ moment, calcified into metaphor and life lesson||Writer Aldous Huxley once said: “Every man’s memory is his private literature.” So was William Wordsworth’s memory of The Daffodils, which he transformed into an eternal poem. Human memory is not merely a storage box, but a dynamic repository that derives its strength and durability from its power of imagination. Memories are our personal assets, inspiring us to be curious and creative, and no two persons react to a common memory in a similar way. Perhaps another poet accompanying Wordsworth to the same site would have reacted to the daffodils in a different way. My ‘Daffodils’ moment came when I was travelling by train about four decades ago. As the train left the station and passed through the quarters of class IV employees, my eyes fell on a man in a blue uniform, squatting at the entrance of his house. He had come home for lunch, and even from the fast-moving train I could catch a glimpse of a thali (brass plate) in his hands which contained two chapattis, an onion, two green chillies, and two little mounds of salt and red chilli powder. The glowing smile on the face of the man was unmissable. This is the image I have carried in my mind for years. Initially, it was simply a matter of cheer that I could capture the scene from the running train, but then my curiosity led me to reflect on that enigmatic smile. What could have evoked that fervent expression on his face? Was it the satisfaction of having a meal after working long hours on the railway tracks; or was it the joy of having the lady of the house taking care of his needs by getting the thali ready for him; or was it his humility, expressing gratitude towards God for having provided him with a square meal? Thus the ‘Daffodils’ moment lying ensconced in the deep recesses of my memory got calcified into a metaphor and a life lesson that would ‘flash upon that inward eye’ not to fill the heart with pleasure, as it did with Wordsworth, but to remind me of human simplicity, humble joys, caring relationships, and modest desires. This image surfaced quite often during the despondent days of demonetisation, and it has been my constant companion during the coronavirus lockdown, always urging me to be humble; to find happiness in the smallest things; to understand and respect the value of the home and familial bliss; and to be grateful for whatever has been bestowed upon me, howsoever minimal it might be, without pining for what is not. The secret of that smile will always remain a riddle for me, but this is my memory, and this is my private literature, as Huxley put it. njkaur1953@gmail.com The writer is a Patiala-based retired associate professor in English||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/daffodils-moment-calcified-into-metaphor-and-life-lesson-101638687930751.html

The air quality index in Delhi will, however, remain in the very poor category, according to the real-time data of the Central Pollution Control Board.The Air Quality Early Warning System’s forecast for this evening said that the AQI in the national capital region is likely to be on the lower end of ‘very poor’ category.As of this morning, Delhi recorded an AQI of 305 (very poor), Faridabad 296 (poor), Ghaziabad 288 (poor), Gurgaon 174 (moderate) and Noida 273 (poor).The mercury dropped to 11.4 degrees Celsius in Delhi, two notches above the season's normal on Sunday, according to the weather department, while the maximum temperature is likely to be around 25 degrees Celsius, they said. The relative humidity recorded at 8.30am was 95 per cent.Foggy conditions are expected to persist over the next six days as well, the IMD forecast showed, while the temperature could hover around 9 to 11 degree Celsius.Delhi's air quality in November this year was the worst for the month in seven years. The city witnessed ‘severe’ pollution on 11 days and not a single day of "moderate" or "better" air quality, according to data shared by the Central Pollution Control Board.Although stubble burning remained a major factor behind the spike in the air pollution levels, experts believed that local sources of emissions are the primary reason for highly PM levels in the air in the post-farm fire period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-thundershowers-likely-in-delhi-today-aqi-to-remain-very-poor-imd-101638684476451.html
05-12-2021||Patna||Bihar’s rescued child labourers now want to return to work||*Mantosh (name changed), a 15-year old boy from Supta village in Bihar’s Gaya district is one among several victims of human trafficking who were rescued last year from Jaipur, where they were working at a bangle manufacturing factory. Back to his village now, he does menial jobs to earn his bread and also helps his parents at the village farms. While these are busy days for a farm hand, Mantosh wants to leave the village to earn “better” money outside. *Taj Mohammed (name changed), another victim of human trafficking from Bhulli village in Sitamarhi district, who was also rescued from a bangle factory in Jaipur in October this year, has been working at a village farm since his return. The head of his family who used to work as a labourer in Kashmir has been seriously ill for the last one year and had to borrow ₹40,000 from a local money lender for treatment and sustaining the family. Taj Mohammed has been working to pay back the debt at the village farm but is desperate to go out for better earnings. Ramesh (name changed), yet another child labourer from Bhitiya village under Rasulpur Panchayat in Jehanabad district, was also rescued from a bangle factory in Jaipur this year. The boy despite his harrowing experience in Jaipur where he was threatened by employer’s goons before he managed to leave with police’s help, now wants to leave home again to earn. HT has learnt that altogether 711 child labourers were rescued mainly from the bangle factories in Jaipur between 2018 and 2021 and many of these are in the same mental condition these days. The euphoria of returning to their native places is over now and the harsh economic realities have taken over, forcing them to reconsider earning options outside. The common refrain among them is that while life was tough as captive labourers at the factories but it’s even tougher to survive and sustain without earnings.“What option do they have except working? He will have to leave home to earn money,” Urmila Devi (40), mother of rescued child labourer from Gaya, said. “Though he is working at a village farm, he doesn’t like it. Payment is very poor,” she added. “He couldn’t even join the school as the authorities refused admission on the ground of him being overage,” she said. The woman said Mantosh was one among the 50 children who were taken from Aligarh to Jaipur. “In fact, we were working at a brick kiln in Aligarh in UP at that time. We have been going there for the last six-seven years. We go there every year in May and return during winter. It was at the Aligarh brick kiln that the broker lured our children to go with him to Jaipur. My son was also working there with us. Though we didn’t want to send him , he insisted and joined the group,” Urmila Devi said. Mantosh said life was difficult at the bangle factory. “We had to work since morning till late evening. I was not beaten as I never disobeyed the employer,” he said. He adds that he was able to save some money while working at the factory in Jaipur and the life at the village was not any better since he had to work here too but for very little payment in return.Also Read: Ahead of rabi sowing, Bihar farmers face fertiliser crisisHis mother said every child in the family has to work to sustain. “We are daily wage earners and have been going to Aligarh to work at brick kilns for the last six- seven years. They pay good money and provide food and accommodation also. Here in the village, the work is irregular and the payment too is very poor. Here sometimes ₹250 a day is paid while in Aligarh they pay ₹400 a day,” she said. We would have preferred to stay here had there been any government assistance and even the boy would not have been eager to leave, she added. Aas Mohammed, father of the rescued child labourer from Sitamarhi, said the boy has been working at the village farm for the last few days. “How would the family survive? I cannot work now because of my poor health. For over 10 years, I worked as a labourer in Kashmir. Most of the people in our village go to Kashmir during summers to work. But now, I can’t work, but the debt has to be cleared,” he said. He too hopes that the family gets some financial support from the government. “I have come to know that there is a provision, but we haven’t been given the financial support,” he said. Suresh Kumar from Centre Direct, an Non Government Organisation (NGO) which has been in many rescue operations, said the government has various kinds of support schemes for the rescued child labourer. “But many of rescued children have not been given the support,” he said. Soon after the child labourer is rescued, ₹3000 is given by the labour resources department as immediate financial support. This money is meant to meet immediate expenses of the child. And later, ₹25,000 is given to the family from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund under the Child Labour Tracking system initiative,” he said. Out of the 711 rescued child labourers , only 21 have received immediate assistance of ₹3000 given by the labour resources department. And only 31 rescued child labourers have received financial assistance from Chief Minister Relief Fund, he added.

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ajay asks father OP Chautala to reconsider on party bifurcation||National president of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) Ajay Chautala, whose party is the junior partner in the ruling alliance in Haryana, has asked his father and INLD supremo Om Prakash Chautala to reconsider the decision of expelling him and his sons, which might unite the family again. The former chief minister’s decision had led to a divide in the erstwhile INLD and the subsequent formation of the JJP in 2018. Next year, the party clinched a post-poll alliance with the BJP and Ajay’s elder son Dushyant Chautala became the deputy chief minister of Haryana. “He (OP Chautala) is our elder. He should reconsider his decision. He should take the first step and we will follow,” Ajay said. He was responding to a query on his father’s recent comment that “there is nothing permanent in politics”, which had created a political buzz on the family feud and its unification. Ajay was in Ambala to invite the party cadre to the JJP’s third foundation day celebrations in Jhajjar on Thursday. Accompanying him were state president Nishan Singh, state spokesperson Vivek Chaudhary, party’s Ambala incharge Kulwant Multani and other local leaders. The JJP leader also alleged that he was expelled unconstitutionally by his father, who was following the instructions of his younger son Abhay Chautala. “My sons (Dushyant and Digvijay) were debarred due to anti-party activities, but I wasn’t told why I’m being expelled. As per the party constitution, a worker or leader in question is served notice, but I wasn’t,” Ajay told the gathering at Sector 8. Ajay also targeted former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and said the Jhajjar rally will show him their strength. He was also hopeful that other demands of the farmers will be accepted soon. “No meeting gets failed, but a series of discussions begin. In this case, I’m hopeful that a solution will be brought by the Union government in a couple of days,” he added. On being asked about a possible protest by farmer unions against the JJP rally, Ajay said, “Everyone is free to agitate in a democracy.”In a statement, the party said that they will also welcome all the workers who left them during the farmer agitation and are willing to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ajay-asks-father-op-chautala-to-reconsider-on-party-bifurcation-101638651380290.html

Addressing a press conference during his visit to the 15th Punjab International Trade Expo (PITEX) in Amritsar, Sidhu said, “The trade via the Integrated Checkpost (ICP) with 34 nations will usher in development in Punjab and elsewhere. Only 5 of the 34 countries are present here at PITEX.” He, however, did not list the names of 34 countries. “A huge potential of trade lies locked. I am not saying that there is no need to be vigilant at the border. Just a year after the World War II when all European nations were fighting each other, the borders in the continent were opened. The progress of centuries took place in a few years,” he said. All the 34 countries should be brought on board via the PITEX festival, he said, adding that the trade should be via 2,100 km Dubai route instead of just 20-km route from Attari to Lahore.Sidhu said, “The minimum support price (MSP) on wheat was increased to ₹1,300 per quintal in 30 years in the country. But here is an opportunity to sell wheat at ₹3,000 and basmati at ₹7,000 per quintal.” Any passport holder should be allowed to trade through borders, he said. “With this, Punjab will see development of six years in six months. If Mumbai-Karachi port trade can take place, why Amritsar-Lahore circuit should not be opened. We are doing trade of less than 5% of the total potential,” he added. The Punjab government, he said, will start giving MSP on pulses. “Why can’t we give MSP on pulses when we are importing pulses from other countries,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-roots-for-opening-india-s-trade-with-34-countries-via-attari-border-101638651261162.html

In a press release, Sirsa said that he has joined the saffron fold with the sole aim to serve the Sikh community and the party has provided him a platform which will help him resolve the issues unresolved for long. “Had the BJP coerced me, it would have asked me to join as the DSGMC president and not as an individual. I joined on my own volition because the Akali Dal was not in a position to work on resolving the Sikhs’ issues after breaking alliance with the BJP,” he said. It is possible to serve his community only by being a member of a national party, he said, adding that he will focus on resolving the issues of Sikhs and will not get distracted by wild allegations. “The Akali Dal today has been reduced to a regional party as its leadership itself claims and it’s not focusing on pan-India Sikh issues. The Sikhs living outside Punjab are looking to me to take up their issues. The Sikhs of Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh and UP are faced with a host of issues,” he added. These issues can be resolved on a platform like the BJP by raising his voice at the national and international level, Sirsa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/joined-bjp-to-serve-sikhs-sad-making-baseless-claims-manjinder-sirsa-101638650958959.html

These are our biggest enemies and not any other party,” he said. “I don’t consider any party or leader my enemy. The enemy is poverty and backwardness and against them, we have to wage a jihad,” he added.

He criticised the government for evacuating the people from government land and said, “Had I been the chief minister, I would have asked the people to take all the land because people in a hilly state have no land to eke out their livelihood.”

Principal secretary (home) Anurag Verma in an order dated November 25 had said that the extension in service from August 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, granted to Romana was cancelled with immediate effect on the directions issued by the department of personnel and the official was retired on November 24, 2021. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Maluja confirmed that the home department had ordered to cancel extension to Romana. “But Romana has been asked to continue verbally. We have not received any official orders so far. But new orders are likely to be issued soon as there are various provisions available for this,” he added. When contacted, Anurag Verma said the extension given to DSP Romana was cancelled and he was retired with immediate effect. “These are the last orders from our side,” he said. Romana, who is deputed as a DSP-1 in Bathinda since July 2018, was granted extension even as the Punjab government had scrapped the service extension policy for its employees from March 31, 2020. Romana was in the centre of controversy in 2017 after being indicted in departmental inquiries for releasing an accused in a drug case. He was held guilty for his suspected role in an FIR lodged against one Gobind Gupta for allegedly having an illegal stock of 1,500 habit-forming tablets. Gupta, who was arrested on April 10, 2017, was released within 10 days of lodging the FIR at Bathinda’s Nehianwala police station after a court granted him bail. In the cancellation report, Romana had reportedly cited a drug inspector’s statement claiming that Gupta had licence to sell and purchase such medicines. Official sources confirmed that no action was taken against Romana as the internal report later concluded that “Gupta’s release was a mistake on the part of Romana and not a deliberate attempt”.

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Fearing road cave-in, RTI activist files second complaint with PSHRC||Fearing a road cave-in following the Municipal Corporation’s failure to fix a leakage in water supply lines in Model Town, Gol Market, for over a year, RTI activist Arvind Sharma on Saturday submitted a second complaint with the Punjab State Human Rights Commission (PSHRC). Sharma, who himself owns a shop in Gol Market, accused the MC officials of submitting a wrong report to the PSHRC after he filed his first complaint in the month of January. He further alleged that the authorities failed to resolve the issue even after laying new lines in the past, citing frequent accidents that take place due to the pot holes in the roads. Seeking strict action against the concerned officials, Sharma stated that leakage might eventually lead to the road caving in.“It seems like the MC has failed to learn lessons from the past mistakes. Even after two students and a woman had a narrow escape after a major portion of the road caved in in Deep Nagar in October, the authorities are adopting lackadaisical approach toward the leakage in water supply lines,” his complaint read. Sharma elaborated on the issue, “The authorities stated that Deep Nagar road caved in due to leakage in sewer or water lines. But even after over a year has elapsed, the officials have failed to stop leakage in water supply lines in Gol market. Strict action should be taken against the concerned officials and they are putting the lives of residents at stake.”The corporation’s superintending engineer, Ravinder Garg, was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts. Pardeep Sabharwal, the MC commissioner, meanwhile, stated, “As per the report submitted by the concerned officials with my office, the line was repaired in the past. If any problem is being witnessed in the area, the staff will again be directed to resolve the same at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-fearing-road-cave-in-rti-activist-files-second-complaint-with-pshrc-101638648739091.html

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sahnewal MC chief Hara attacked by unidentified persons||Unidentified miscreants opened attack on Sahnewal municipal council president Captain Sukhjit Singh Hara, 57, twice at the Southern bypass on Friday. Though Hara escaped unhurt, his Ford Endeavor SUV was badly damaged. Hara, who hails from Nandpur village, said it was a planned attack and he suspects the hand of drug peddlers who wanted to get back at him for starting a campaign against drug use in Sahnewal. Hara has not ruled out the possibility of his political rivals orchestrating the attack.In his complaint, the MC chief stated that he was going to Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar in his SUV on Friday night. When he reached the flyover at Southern bypass near Dugri, he found a stationary truck on the flyover. When he went closer, unidentified persons sitting inside the truck, opened attack with iron rods and sticks. He sped up his vehicle and escaped after dodging the assailants but a group of men on motorcycles again opened attack on him. Hara managed to escape and inform the police, but the assailants managed to escape.Hara further said that he suspects that it was a planned attack as the truck seems to have been stationed on the flyover to intercept him. “I had lodged cases against drug peddlers and helped the police in arresting them. It could be the handiwork of drug peddlers. As I am an aspirant for an assembly ticket from Sahnewal constituency, the attack could be an outcome of political rivalry also. Otherwise, I have no enmity with anyone,” said Hara.Police on Saturday scanned closed-circuit television cameras installed on Southern bypass under safe city project, but to no avail, as those were not functional.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Balvir Singh, the investigating officer, said a case under Sections 341(punishment for wrongful restrain), 427 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged against unidentified accused at Dugri police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sahnewal-mc-chief-hara-attacked-by-unidentified-persons-101638648378568.html
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Grief, love and redemption||The Northern goshawk, or the Baaz, Punjab’s State Bird, finds resonance not only in the history, culture and religion of the sub-continent but it is a bird that has held its own against the Peregrine falcon in the global practice of the art of falconry. No single individual in contemporary history has done more to popularise the goshawk than Helen Macdonald, who penned an account of her relationship with a female goshawk, Mabel, in H is for Hawk. Brutally honest, the memoir brimming with emotional richness stirred the souls of naturalists.Macdonald, an English woman, lost her father. To shake off sorrow’s throttling grip and grasp at healing, Macdonald took to training a difficult goshawk as she wanted to immerse herself in a creature that knew no remorse or emotion. “As she tries to navigate a deep, deep grief..With the hawks taming comes Helen’s untaming, in a book with a deep love at its heart,” is how her book was blurbed.Female goshawks may be enigmatic, charming and loyal to the trainer like a pet dog, flashing lemon yellow eyes that turn orange with age. But the avian hunter is sheer brutality when let loose on hares and pheasants. The goshawk pins the alive prey down with her talons and rips its chest out in the practice of a malevolent ‘open heart surgery’. Stalking the quaint English moors with Mabel, Macdonald wrote: “Everything was gone except this quiet Sylvan scene. Into which I intended to let slip havoc and murder.” Both Helen and Mabel would share the prey the latter slaughtered.The book bagged awards and was turned into a popular BBC series, Macdonald became a celebrity, featuring in Vogue. “Goshawks are the Christopher Walken of birds....not extraordinarily intelligent like dogs or parrots but they possess phenomenal tactical intelligence, such as the way in which they make use of the winds to attack, like a military operation,” Macdonald was quoted as saying.Gharials, free to flowThe critically-endangered species, Gharials, are all set to further the swim against the tide of extinction on the Punjab section of the Indus system. The Forests and Wildlife Preservation department will release 25 Gharials near village Miani in the Beas Conservation Reserve (BCR) on December 5, 2021. This will bring the number of Gharials released into the BCR to 95, and the fourth such batch of captive-bred Gharials freed since that historic day of December 25, 2017, when 10 Gharials were the first to taste the silvery ripples of the Beas. Village Miani falls under Dasuya tehsil of Hoshiarpur. The spot chosen for the impending release is considerably upstream of Harike barrage, at 104-112km as the Beas meanders. The release sites of the four batches have progressed upstream since 2017 as a few Gharials were swept into the Harike barrage and either died or were flushed down with the canals and reached the Abohar-Muktsar areas, 60-70 km downstream of the barrage. The lives of Gharials swept downstream of the barrage were placed in jeopardy. However, the department was able to effect their rescues from the canals and minor drains system. The other factor, which has occasioned the selection of the Kula Fattah forests on the banks of the Beas near village Miani, is that the section of the river here enjoys a relatively undisturbed habitat and situates a long island chain. Islands are essential for Gharial breeding and lend safety from turbulence in water levels. The litmus test for Punjab’s Gharial Reintroduction Programme will be met when freed Gharials commence breeding. Till the time the department first released Gharials in 2017 on the Beas, the species was extinct on the Indus system. Of the three river systems dominating the subcontinent, only the Brahmputra remains void of Gharials. The Ganges system was the first to support reintroductions. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-grief-love-and-redemption-101638648199016.html

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | When swords replaced ploughs in Punjab||The curtain rises on a pitch-dark stage and then a blood-red light appears highlighting the scattered swords. A sutradhar enters in dark robes with a turban on his head. He could be Sikh or Muslim, Nihang or Malang. Men carrying drums follow him as he chants of vicious times and hapless victims and together they start singing: In the year 1947, ploughs were to be found nowhere...Such is the tone set by Swarajbir Singh’s play: Pul Siraat (Bridge of Siraat), which the Quran says is the one to be crossed to reach paradise. Ironically, unfolds the story of a Muslim girl Fajjan who is swept away by the waves of violence and converted to Harnam Kaur. She goes on to become the village mad woman in her old age. This is one of the 16 plays included in the anthology, Plays from a Fractured Land: Punjabi Partition Drama In Translation.Atamjit says, “Going beyond Partition fiction available in different languages, the volume has dramas from both sides of the border. A collection of plays on the traumatic experience of Partition of Punjab ostensibly tells the fraught history of communal conflicts in Punjab.”He adds that the plays included in the collection employ irony, paradox, humour and pathos to underline that Partition was a failure of human ideals.Many stories, many sighsIn all, there are four full-length plays, four short plays, four excerpted and abridged plays and four one-act plays. An interesting inclusion is a one-act play by writer and film-maker Sagar Sarhadi of the Bazaar film fame. The writer, who passed away in March this year, spent his childhood years in Baffa village near Abbottabad, in the North-west Frontier Region in colonial times, and fondly had the second name of Sarhadi. His play, Messiah, is once again a woman’s story of those troubled times, in which she is unable to recognise her own lost brother. Atamjit points out, “Sita’s story is reminiscent in a way of Saadat Hasan Manto’s Khol Do. The irony is that the woman encountered so many beasts in the divisive violence that she could not recognise any other form of masculinity.”From across the border, in a more recent play the woman’s story is seen with difference in the saga of the two hostile countries. Dukh Darya (River of Sorrow) by playwright Shahid Nadeem, the husband of well known theatre artiste, late Madeeha Gauhar, has been staged many times on both sides of the border to wowed audiences. It was based on a real-life story of a Pakistani Kashmiri woman Kausar who jumps into the river as she is termed barren. She is rescued on the Indian side of the river and gives birth to a girl child in a jail as she is raped in custody. Thus, it becomes a tangled drama of a Pakistani woman with an Indian daughter. Atamjit comments thus on the play: “The River Of Sorrow is a quintessential Punjabi play that talks of oppression as well as the magnanimity of the Punjabis, it is history as well as myth, and it represents real politics and as well as cultural realities such as respect as well as disdain for women. The waters of our rivers drown us in sorrows. And the same waters also wash away the sorrows”.A galaxy of playwrightsThe volume includes a galaxy of Punjabi playwrights, and but for the pitfalls of language here and there and laxity in line editing, it is a book well worth the pride of place in the book shelf. The editor’s play ‘Rishtean Da ki Rakhiye Naa’ (No Man’s Land) inspired by Saadat Hasan Manto’s immortal story ‘Toba Tek Singh’ is there in a fine translation by Rana Nayar. From across the border we have a play based on a classic story by Ahmed Nadim Qazmi, Parmeshwar Singh, penned into a play by Aamir Nawaz. Like Kashmiri Lal Zakir’s story Karmanwali, adapted into a play by MK Raina, the play too is about a Sikh taking home the child, Akhtar, who gets separated from a group of Muslims migrating to Pakistan. It is a complex play because although for Parmeshwar, Akhtar is as dear to him as his son Kartara, who was separated from him in similar circumstances, yet other members of the family and the society as such refuse to accept a Muslim amid them. Parmeshwar takes him to the border so that he may cross over and so the boy starts following the sound of the Azan. But when a Pakistani soldier fires at Parmeshwar, Akhtar runs back with his hair flying in the wind.Plays by other playwrights in the book include Harsaran Singh, Gurdial Singh Khosla, Ajmer Singh Aulakh, Kewal Dhaliwal, Jagdish Sachdeva, Sahib Singh and Devinder Daman. The translators besides Nayar are Amena Z. Cheema, Swaraj Raj and Vivek Sachdeva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-when-swords-replaced-ploughs-in-punjab-101638647726260.html

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||50 years of 1971 war: Brig HS Lamba recalls the Dacca triumph||On December 16, 1971, while Bangladesh was celebrating the liberation in Dhaka, one of the fiercest battles of the Indo-Pak war was being fought in the Khulna sector. Fifty years later, sitting in the lawn at his bungalow in Chandigarh, a retired Brigadier’s eyes well up as he talks about his fellow soldiers who died while liberating Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. He talks about what went wrong and how lives were lost in large numbers during the Battle of Siramani. In Khulna sector, Pakistan’s 9 Infantry Division was pitted against 9 Infantry Division of the Indian Army commanded by Maj Gen Dalbir Singh. Brigadier Harbhajan Singh Lamba (retd), 84, was then a major commanding a company in the 13 Dogras, when the battalion was directed to capture Siramani. Siramani was Pakistan’s main strength, as they had placed mines and used heavy artillery to delay Indian troops’ advancement. “Three attempts by different battalions were made to capture Siramani but when they could not succeed, then 13 Dogras was ordered from the division to capture it,” recalls Brigadier Lamba, an Ati Vishisht Seva Medal recipient. “I knew it was going to be a decisive battle, and we were going to suffer casualties. I remember saying to my jawans: ‘If you don’t perform today, you will perish,’ and reciting a Guru Gobind’s quote,” the officer repeats the lines with heavy voice. It was a day light attack. “At 09:45 hours, we advanced in the enemy area in open to capture Siramani East. Now, despite being assured of support of the entire divisional artillery, not a single artillery shell landed on the objective,” he says. The officer said that the enemy was picking commanders and he was the first one to be hit. “I shouted at a Captain from the artillery, asking for fire but he got a bust and dropped dead,” he recalls. “The artillery got delayed by 30-35 minutes, which was a lot of time, especially when you are advancing towards the enemy in open. We suffered heavy casualties. Every step that we took forward, a man was either killed or wounded and dropped. That is how we advanced towards the enemy.” There were times when they thought that the assault would have to be abandoned due to heavy casualties, but at last artillery came and the operation was a success. It took about 1:45 hours to capture the Siramani East and by 3:30, they sent a success signal PHAKIAN (everything is fine). The officer’s battalion captured four Pakistani officers besides about a score of troops and seized a large quantity of arms and ammunition. It decimated a major portion of 15 frontier force rifles in a straight fight. The battalion was awarded Siramani as a battle honour. That was the time when Major General Dalbir Singh came on a jeep and reminded him that he was shot and sent him to hospital in his jeep. Brigadier’s wife, Dolly Lamba, recalls how she was handed over his clothes and ammunition boots soaked in blood. The officer was awarded a Mention in Dispatches. When someone asks about awards, I answer: “The one I got, I don’t put it on.” For Dolly Lamba, the biggest reward is the fact that her husband is sitting next to her sipping evening tea in their lawn, even 50 years after the war.

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC election: Rebel candidates a headache for parties||With a number of rebel candidates tossing their hat into the ring, an already multi-cornered contest has been thrown wide open as nominations for the Chandigarh municipal elections came to an end on Saturday. After being denied the ticket, many office-bearers and party workers of the three main contenders — Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — have entered the fray either as Independent candidates or as nominees of rival parties.Traditionally a two-cornered contest between the BJP and Congress, the Chandigarh municipal elections are seeing a multi-cornered contest this time with even the AAP and Shiromani Akali Dal-Bahujan Samaj Party (SAD-BSP) combine in the fray. In such a scenario, the presence of rebel candidates could make a major difference in the fortunes of these parties.“Even in the previous two-cornered fights, winning margins were in two digits at times. These rebel candidates are likely to hurt their parent parties, especially if the person has a strong track record in the ward. If they contest from the main rival party, it becomes all the more difficult for the parent party,” said a senior Congress leader, who didn’t want to be named. Even his wife was denied the party ticket.Kamal Kumar, a former Congress office-bearer, joined the AAP a couple of days back and filed his nomination papers from Ward No. 3 on Saturday. He will take on Congress’ Ravi Thakur and BJP’s sitting councillor Daleep Sharma. “It is very disappointing that in the Congress, everything else but merit gets you the ticket,” said Kumar.Hiral Lal, a former organisational secretary in the Congress, is contesting elections on the AAP ticket from Ward No. 24. He left his old party after his claim to the ticket was denied. Rajinder Kaur Panag, another Congress office-bearer and daughter of a former Mahila Congress president, joined the SAD on Friday and filed her nomination papers from Ward No. 18 on Saturday. Prem Pal Chauhan, another former organisational secretary, is contesting as an Independent candidate from Ward No. 15. “The ticket is not an issue. How the Congress is being run is what made me leave it. Till the last moment, I was assured that I would be given the ticket. There are 15 rebel candidates contesting as Independents. We will be supporting each other,” he said. Former Congress state general secretary Shashi Shankar Tewari, who resigned after his wife was denied ticket, said: “We will oppose Congress candidates in all wards. Tickets have not been distributed on merit and dedicated workers have been ignored. Many senior Congress functionaries are contesting as rebel candidates, and we will be holding a joint press conference on Sunday.” Not just these Independent candidates, the Congress is also facing a challenge from at least 20 former members who are contesting on the AAP ticket. “Most of these people left the Congress with former party president Pardeep Chhabra. They have been given tickets, and now will cut into the traditional voter base,” said Tewari. BJP, AAP face challenge too The ruling BJP is also facing challenge from its own former party functionaries. Narendra Pal Chaudhary, state coordinator, Swach Bharat Vibhag, and a former member of the SC Morcha national executive committee, has filed papers as an Independent candidate. “I have served the party dedicatedly for so many years, but the local unit totally ignored my efforts. The party has put up a candidate in Ward No. 26, who is not even popular there.”Manpreet Kaur, the wife of BJP national Kissan Morcha member and two-time Daria sarpanch Gurpreet Singh Happy, is also unhappy with ticket distribution and is contesting as an Independent from Ward No. 9. Another long-time party worker, Yashpal Singh Yadav, is contesting as a rebel candidate from Ward No. 27. Kripanand Thakur, a district secretary and party member of over two decades who enjoys strong support in Hallomajra, also filed his nomination from Ward No. 20 as a rebel candidate. Fighting its first municipal poll, even the AAP will face competition from its rebel candidates. Sahil Chawar, founder member of the party’s city unit and youth state general secretary, is contesting as an Independent candidate from Ward No. 4. Former party member Farman Ansari is in the fray from Ward No. 3. Reema Mahajan, who is the wife of former senior AAP functionary Jagdeep, filed nomination papers as a SAD candidate on Saturday. 
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Witerati | Omicron se darta kaun!||Tough to be treading through times where the Fear Curve shows nary a sign to flatten, mostly a propensity to fatten. Much in the manner of middle class India’s waistlines or secret Swiss bank account bottom lines.Post Unlock, barely had we heaved a sigh of relief that we were done with the Covid19 con, that there pops up Omicron. Barely were we getting acquainted to the Post New Normal’s sartorial statement – vanished masks -- when along come alerts of another return to masked living. What better testimony to this Fattening of the Fear Curve narrative than a recent public travel episode. The past many weeks had seen many a commuter on public transport, like the capital’s Metro, sport the new look of the Post New Normal – Dismantled Masks to Disappeared Masks.Social distancing on the Metro, as in most public places, had gone with the wind as commuters merrily threw caution to the wind. Faster than the Metro tore through the Capital’s smog-suffused wind.Until Omicron warnings spurred officialdom to pull up the socks. Getting a taste of this return to the cracking of the whip was a fellow lady commuter immersed in that National Olympic Idling Sport called Whatsapping. When she found a posse of paunchy constabulary peering down at her, she goggled up to realise that not only the coach she was commuting in was “Pink”, but that the slip she was being handed was pink, too.She went rather pink in the face at being served a challan for fashioning a style statement peculiar to Post New Normal – Dangled Mask.As one headed to the second leg of that day’s journey, another factor on the Fear Curve raised its head. Legging it to a shopping hub, one was engulfed in a surging sea of humanity pretending the Pandemic and its protocols were never part of its vocabulary. A madding crowd whose subtext spelt: “Omicron se darta kaun!”A stray voice rising over this madding crowd of shopaholics (yours truly included) struck a sudden chord. “Arre bhai, khoob saara khareed lo, phir se Lockdown lagega.”This brought one not only to a narrow alley clogged with shoppers who bore a rather un-poetic resemblance to jostling jailbirds out on parole, but also face to face with the fear of another “jail” term. Face to face also with a peculiar kind of shopaholicism.Pandemic’s Panic Shopaholics.This essentially entails lockdown hoarding tendencies of two types.Of essentials and essentially shopaholicsThe first type of Panic Shopaholicism entails building inventories of essentials. ‘Essentials’ defined by buying list lessons from Lockdown 1.0. Aloo Bhujia one didn’t mass order prior to the last Lockdown out of fear it would consolidate one’s status of Couch ‘Potato’. Maggi instant noodles and soup one didn’t stock up on because one didn’t foresee we’d be in such a soup. The curious case of Who Moved My Puffcorn Cheese.Of panic and pyjamasThe other type of Panic Shopaholicism is made of non-essentials. Stocking on extra hair color Brown or Auburn, in case of Lockdown Omicron. Remember, one doesn’t yet want to look a literal version of 50 Shades of Grey. Mass buying trendy Tees and boxers for the groom on Zoom. Remember, previous Pandemic pyjamas may not take too kindly to the gluttony and gorging one has indulged in Unlock, with the noble intention to egg on the Restarting India narrative.The curious case of Pyjamas Are Unforgiving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/witerati-omicron-se-darta-kaun-101638647178493.html

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays | Understanding the economy that thrives on our fears||I am not an economist by any stretch of imagination but I do feel strongly about people who prosper by propelling and igniting fear in the minds of the general populace.From small time crooks to big time companies, there is a significant section of the economy which basically thrives on the fear factor prevailing in society at the time. The pandemic has seen the worst of such tendencies to make a fast buck by inflaming rumours and instigating people to go in for panic buying. The virus and its avatars or variants have of course pushed the whole world onto the back foot and millions of lives have been lost.But there have been several deliberate spikes in the fortunes of some manufacturers, not necessarily based on facts, but because of hyper rumour mills which have resulted in fear ridden purchases by the millions of items which were never really needed.Some months ago, it was feared that fungi of many hues would attack us without warning and we were thus ‘advised’ to consume so and so potion, in order to ward them off! Many products and so called immunity boosters emerged from nowhere during the pandemic to reap in the moolah simply because people were justifiably scared of contracting the disease. Whether these ‘products’ or chemicals actually had the desired impact will never be known.Purported new variants of the dreaded virus are also regrettably causing the same fear among the masses. Whether or not they will actually find their way into our nostrils, God forbid, they will play with the minds of billions of people across the world. Drug manufacturers will undoubtedly benefit hugely since doctors will recommend a series of expensive curative measures if anyone starts sneezing in the coming weeks. Booster doses of all sorts will also boost the economy of their creators by gigantic scales.The cholesterol ‘myth’ as it is now known to be, and the resultant terror that it created, resulted in the sales of drugs known as statins worth billions of dollars all over the world for decades. Many a hale, hearty, man must have lost his life just by worrying himself to death about his cholesterol levels being high, even though his arteries were not half as clogged as the healthcare industry made him fear. Blood pressure and sugar levels are the real ‘variants’ that need to be kept in check, doctors now emphasise, while keeping rather quiet about cholesterol.‘Fear is the key’, was the title of the 1972 film directed by Michael Tuchner. Fear is indeed the key to the success of many other segments of the economy as well. The electronic media madness has already been pilloried enough by this writer over the years for playing up nonsensical issues, ad nauseum. And each new strain of the pandemic unfortunately gives these channels enough masala to ensure that their TRP ratings keep maintaining “healthy” heights.Prudence is really the key, after all. Following norms and guidelines to the hilt. But allowing ourselves to be befooled into thinking that Omicron or whatever is peering through a hole in the wall eager to enter into our system, is being paranoid without need.Godmen have befooled us for centuries too, shady ones that is. In many temples across India, the unfortunate trend is for visitors to be coerced into donating large amounts since they are made to fear divine penalties If they do not. Anyone who indulges in profiteering by feasting on the nerves of the people is bound to have an interest in the continuance of war, calamities, pandemics, confusion and chaos. Inflaming rumours of the worst kind is like second nature to them. Normalcy does not suit such vested inserests. Only a balanced collective mindset and cogent action by governments can deny fraudsters of these kinds their ill gotten wealth.Less hype and more factual awareness would lead to reduced uncertainty and enhance calmness in society. Mass hysteria is not the way to deal with national adversity. And those who perpetrate it especially with nefarious designs must be brought to book!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-understanding-the-economy-that-thrives-on-our-fears-101638646878190.html

They had made the last call to a friend asking him the directions towards Chamba.“We have launched a search and rescue operation to trace them. A foot search team from Dharamshala has been sent towards the Kundli Pass while another team is on its way from the Chamba side. Local trekkers are also helping the operation,” said the SP.So far, there is no trace of them, he added.He said the family members of one of the trekkers had arranged a private helicopter, but it couldn’t arrive on Saturday due to some problem. The district administration has also requested the Ministry of defence for an aerial survey.After back-to-back tragedies in Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts involving trekkers, the Kangra district administration had banned trekking on mountain passes of 3,000 m and above on November 11.Kangra has around a dozen mountain passes across the Dhauladhar, which are widely used by Gaddi shepherds to cross over to either side with their herds.In recent years, trekking activities through these passes have increased. As per local trekkers, Kundli is one of the trickiest passes and can only be crossed from June 15 to October 15.For first-timers, it is a hard climb as one has to manoeuvre up a steep glacier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dharamshala-2-trekkers-missing-in-dhauladhar-mountains-since-november-29-101638646638182.html
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sees no new Covid case among foreign returnees||Amid Omicron scare, the Chandigarh health department has not reported any new Covid-19 positive case among international travellers who have returned to the city from high-risk countries in the past 10 days. The only positive case is that of a South Africa returnee who resides in Sector 36 and had tested positive along with his wife and domestic help on November 29. Even their symptoms are stated to be mild.UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said on Saturday that after the central government mandated testing of all people arriving from such countries, over a dozen foreign returnees had arrived in Chandigarh. Of them, only one man has been tested positive for Covid-19, he said.“All those who were tested negative in Chandigarh after their arrival are under home quarantine while their repeat tests, which are scheduled on the eighth day of their arrival, are due. We are keeping a strict vigil on them and are monitoring their health,” said Garg, adding that the department is adopting every possible measure to control virus transmission amid Omicron concerns.The World Health Organisation has warned that the risk related to Omicron – a new variant of Covid-19 – is “very high”. The global health body said that the B.1.1.529 strain, first found in South Africa, is “highly divergent” and is likely to spread internationally at a very high speed and could possibly have severe consequences. On November 29, a 39-year-old South African returnee was tested positive for Covid-19 in Chandigarh, raising concerns about Omicron transmission in the UT. A resident of Sector 36, he had tested negative on his arrival at the airport on November 21 but was found to be infected during his retest.“The health department has already sent his samples for genome sequencing, results of which are still awaited. The man, his wife and the maid are isolated at hospital, their health condition is stable and they are not requiring oxygen support,” said Garg.Meanwhile, a woman who was booked on Friday for breaking the quarantine order after returning from South Africa was shifted to Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, after her oxygen level dipped. However, she again tested negative on Saturday.Highest vax numbers in a monthThe number of vaccine doses administered in Chandigarh has shown an improvement after concerns about the new variant emerged, the health department said.“Earlier, only 4,000-4,500 people were getting vaccinated daily, but on Saturday, over 6,000 got vaccinated in Chandigarh. This is the highest single-day tally in the past 30 days. People have realised the threat of the new Omicron variant,” said the health secretary.As on Saturday, 9,45,950 (113%) people have taken their first shot in Chandigarh, while 6,48,250 (77%) are fully vaccinated.Tricity’s daily tally drops below 10Meanwhile, the tricity’s daily case tally dropped down to single digit once again, as only eight people tested positive on Saturday. As many as 18 cases had surfaced on Friday, including 14 in Mohali alone.On Saturday, both Mohali and Chandigarh recorded three cases each while Panchkula reported two. No Covid-related death has been reported in the tricity for the past couple of weeks.Even the tricity’s active caseload dipped to 123 from 141 reported on Friday. There are 60 active cases in Chandigarh, followed by 48 in Mohali, and 15 in Panchkula. Chandigarh has so far reported 65,481 positive cases, of which 64,601 have been cured and 820 have died.

With a spell of rain likely on Sunday, the mercury is expected to fall again.At 28.1°C, the maximum temperature was also four notches above normal. Just two days ago, it had plunged to 19°C after the arrival of a western disturbance in the region. “After the western disturbance passed, there was a period of clear weather. As another western disturbance is approaching the region, so colder northerly winds remained absent, causing the temperature to shoot up,” said Manmohan Singh, director, IMD, Chandigarh. Singh said that due to the cloudy weather, Saturday night is expected to remain warm, though temperature is likely to plunge on Sunday with chances of light to moderate rain in the city. Weather will remain cloudy on Monday though clear skies are likely to return by Tuesday. Chances of moderate fog, which could drop visibility below 1 kilometre, are also present. Meanwhile, due to the skies clearing up, the minimum temperature went down from 14.1°C to 12.1°C, still five notches above normal. In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 21 and 23 degrees while the minimum temperature will remain between 9 and 11 degrees.Air quality back to satisfactoryEven the Air Quality Index (AQI), that had crossed 300 at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station in Sector 22 on Friday, dropped below 100, which is considered satisfactory. It was recorded at similar levels at the monitoring station in Sector 25 as well. Officials said that with the sky opening up and winds blowing in the city, pollutants were dispersed and the air quality improved on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-saturday-was-hottest-december-day-in-7-years-101638645859393.html

In the video captured by residents of Ram Nagar of Ward 27 on November 11, the trio was purportedly seen charging the residents ₹800, against the actual fee of ₹200, for regularising their water-sewer connections. They had fleeced at least eight residents but were made to return the money. The video also showed the residents surrounding the employees, prompting them to “apologise for their mistake”.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had marked an inquiry to additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal following which the suspension and termination orders were issued on late Friday evening. Action has been taken for fleecing residents, causing loss to the state exchequer and putting a blot on the image of the MC, the order stated. Sabharwal said, “The action taken against the three employees will serve as a warning for others too indulging in such acts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-takes-action-against-staff-found-fleecing-residents-101638645739442.html

In all 16,72,35,864 doses have been administered in the state including 11,42,81,008 first dose and 5,29,54,856 second dose, the data stated. The state government’s spokesperson on Saturday said statewide ‘cluster approach’ and door-to-door visits have resulted in a significant hike in the second dose coverage across Uttar Pradesh. While more than 77 per cent of the adult population has received at least the first dose of the Covid vaccine and over 35 per cent have received both doses. “Vaccine gives protection against the virus hence all eligible people should get both their doses when due. The new variant of Covid has been reported at some places in the country and we need to adhere to Covid protocol which is the same for any variant of Covid. We can remain safe from the new variant with the same preventive measures,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary of medical health at a press conference. The teams are going from village to village in Uttar Pradesh and giving call slips (containing information of place and date of vaccination) to the people. Before the arrival of the vaccination team in the cluster, the cluster mobilization teams are clearing out the misconceptions related to the Covid-19 vaccine among the people and motivating them to get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/over-35-of-uttar-pradesh-s-population-fully-vaxed-health-department-101638645738403.html
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Vegetable prices dip at apni mandis as supply improves||Improved supply at apni mandis in Chandigarh has resulted in a dip in vegetables prices. Tomatoes, which were priced at ₹90 per kg around 10 days ago, are now available for ₹60 per kg.“Earlier, supply of tomatoes was especially poor, due to which the price was high despite slashing of fuel prices. It has improved now, but locally grown tomatoes from Punjab have still not reached the market. Once they do, prices will drop further,” said Satbir Singh, a superviser with the Punjab Mandi Board. At the Sector-26 wholesale mandi, supply was earlier being received only from Himachal Pradesh, where the production was already low owing to the weather. “But now, we are getting the produce from Maharashtra as well,” said a market committee official. Even prices of onion have dropped from ₹35 to ₹30 per kg, as supply is now being received from Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Other veggies like capsicum and cauliflower have also gotten cheaper as weather conditions have improved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-vegetable-prices-dip-at-apni-mandis-dip-as-supply-improves-101638645559412.html

05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab health dept told to pay ₹5 lakh for Hepatitis C infected blood infusion||The Mansa district consumer dispute commission has ordered the Punjab health authorities to pay a compensation of ₹5 lakh to a patient for infecting him with the Hepatitis C virus (HVC) through the contaminated blood it used in transfusion in 2015.In an order passed on November 30, president RL Mittal and commission members Sharda Attri and Suraj Goyal held the health officials guilty for the deficient medical service.“For the wrongdoings of the staff, the complainant, Subhash Chand, would have to suffer from this lifelong disease which may require heavy medication and expensive treatment,” reads the decision.Owing to the seriousness of the issue, the forum enhanced the compensation from ₹2 lakh announced in December last year before hearing the matter again on the directions of the state commission.Besides the chief secretary, health, the commission has asked the health director and Mansa civil surgeon to pay the compensation within 45 days as the patient was given HVC infected blood at the civil hospital. No name was mentioned in the order.Overruling the health department’s objection, the forum stated since the patient had paid the prescribed fees for hospital admission and blood, the complainant comes under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act.A resident of Aggarwal Street in Mansa, the patient was admitted to the government hospital on December 2, 2015. He was there treated for four days for dengue and during treatment, he has infused two units of blood from the blood bank at the civil hospital.After being discharged, Aggarwal revisited the hospital with 3-4 months later certain health complications. After medical tests, he was diagnosed with HVC.Sensing something wrong, Aggarwal secured the blood bank’s record under Right to Information (RTI) to prove that he was given HVC-infected blood.Following complaints to the state authorities and media reports, then Mansa deputy commissioner tasked the assistant commissioner (public grievances) for an in-depth probe in June 2016.In his findings, the officer found serious discrepancies in the blood bank records and blood was not tested properly before issuing to the patient.The commission mentioned the district administration’s report that the blood issuing register had been cut and overwriting to conceal the fact that the patient was given contaminated blood.Health department had claimed that Aggarwal may have contracted HVC from another source after the treatment at the hospital. It tried to give a reason that the patient reported to the hospital after nearly four months of being discharged whereas he should have shown health complications within 1-2 days of being infected blood.But the commission rejected the arguments.“While examining the complainant at the time of admissions, the hospital had not reported/diagnosed any earlier history of HCV with respect to the patient complainant or his family members.”In its decision, it quoted the World Health Organisation (WHO) and union health department that “HCV is an asymptomatic disease, the symptoms of which may occur from 2-6 months. Hence, the objection that when infected blood is transfused, infection usually occurs within 1 or 2 days is also an out of place objection.”On December 2, 2016, the Mansa DC submitted the inquiry report and subsequently, the health department chargeshteed two heath officials of Mansa blood bank.On getting no feedback on further action taken in the case, the complainant approached the consumer forum in November 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-health-dept-told-to-pay-5-lakh-for-hepatitis-c-infected-blood-infusion-101638644717935.html

Renu was arrested along with her husband Rishi, the alleged kingpin of the Aligarh liquor tragedy and was in the district jail where her condition deteriorated. “As per the procedure, a judicial probe will be ordered” said Vipin Sharma, senior superintendent of Aligarh district Jail. A former block pramukh Renu was not keeping well and was shifted from district jail to hospital on November 16. She was brought back to district jail on Thursday morning where her health deteriorated again. She was rushed to the hospital where she died, jail officials said. Renu was arrested on May 29 and was sent to jail but was granted bail about a fortnight ago from High Court but was in jail because of delay in compliance of bail proceedings. Family members blamed that release of Renu Sharma was being delayed for no valid reasons. They claimed that the excuse given for delay was police verification of sureties. Renu’s family insisted on post mortem by doctors and officials from other districts. They said they would not allow post mortem till the husband and son of deceased were not released on parole. Political leaders gathered at post mortem house and the MP from Aligarh and BJP leader Satish Gautam had to face stiff opposition. Family members demanded fair probe for death of Renu Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wife-of-main-accused-in-aligarh-hooch-case-dies-101638644540201.html
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||BJP in talks with Capt, Dhindsa for alliance in Punjab: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said the BJP is in talks with former Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa to forge an alliance with their parties ahead of the state assembly polls.During an interaction followed by his keynote address at the HT Leadership Summit 2021, Shah also ruled out the possibility of farmers’ protests impacting elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, saying after the repeal of the agri laws, no other issue remains.He asserted that the BJP will once again form the government in Uttar Pradesh with a comfortable majority.Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh will be held early next year.“We are talking to Captain saab (Amarinder Singh) as well as (Sukhdev Singh) Dhindsa saab. It is possible that we will have an alliance with both (their) parties. We are talking to both parties with a positive mind,” Shah said.On the farmers’ agitation, Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed a big heart to repeal the three farm laws.“The prime minister showed a big heart to end the farmers’ protests, (saying) OK fine, if you think farm laws are not in favour of the farmers... repealed the three farm laws. Now I don’t think any issue is left in Punjab. The elections will be fought on merit,” he said.Asked if there had been any changes in the electoral atmosphere in western Uttar Pradesh, he said the impact of farmers’ protests was even less in the state.In Punjab, the BJP will be testing waters on its own after its decades-old ally Shiromani Akali Dal parted ways with it over the issue of farm laws last year. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will try to return to power.Responding to a question about former BJP allies joining the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, Shah said connecting coalitions with vote arithmetic is not the correct way of assessing elections.“Politics is not physics but chemistry. When two parties join hands, their votes will be added is not a correct assumption according to me. When two chemicals combine a third chemical is created.“We have seen in the past when the SP and the Congress joined hands and later all three (SP, BSP and Congress) came together, (but) the BJP won the elections. People are aware. Coalitions formed on the basis of vote banks cannot guide people now,” he said.The minister said the Uttar Pradesh elections are being fought under organisational in-charge and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and the political leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.“I have been to Uttar Pradesh. I can confidently say that the BJP will form a government in Uttar Pradesh with a thumping majority,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-in-talks-with-capt-dhindsa-for-alliance-in-punjab-amit-shah-101638644480579.html
05-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Pakhowal road ROB, RUBs’ completion pushed to March 2022||With construction far from over, authorities have extended the deadline for the rail overbridge (ROB) and two rail underbridges coming up on the Pakhowal road, from December 31 to March 2022. Initiated in December last year under the Smart City Mission, authorities had set August 31 as the deadline for the ₹120-crore project but later extended it to December 31. On Saturday, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, along with mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, conducted field inspections to review the progress of the project and directed officials to expedite the work.The project delay is set to antagonise shopkeepers on the stretch between Hero Bakery Chowk and Pakhowal road, which has been closed to facilitate construction work. Due to the closure, the shopkeepers have been struggling to make ends meet due to no or marginal footfall in the market. Over a dozen shopkeepers have also shifted their business to other areas.Commuters have also been facing a harrowing time as they have to take a detour to reach the diversion. For commuters moving towards the Pakhowal road canal bridge from Sarabha Nagar and Hero Bakery Chowk, closure of the stretch has meant taking a detour via the Shastri Nagar Railway Crossing, Model Town Extension, or Cremation Ground Road (Ishmeet Singh Road). The bad condition of Ishmeet Singh road adds to the woes of the commuters.Under the project, a ROB, 839.83 metres in length, is being constructed for the movement of traffic from Pakhowal road canal bridge to Hero Bakery Chowk. Besides, a RUB, 1,018.46 metres in length, is being constructed from the Pakhowal road canal bridge up to the Leisure Valley in Sarabha Nagar, and another RUB, 458.20 metres in length, is being constructed from Hero Bakery Chowk up to the Pakhowal Road canal bridge.One RUB will be opened by JanThe authorities stated that RUB from Pakhowal road canal bridge to Leisure Valley in Sarabha Nagar will be opened by January and the entire project will be complete by March next year.As per officials, the RUB would have been opened soon but work was disrupted for around three weeks in November due to a sewer line damage at the construction site. Earlier, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had assured that one of the RUBs being constructed from Pakhowal road towards Sarabha Nagar area, will be complete by July. The deadline was put forward to August 31 and then to Diwali. Now, the deadline has been further extended to January.December 25 new deadline for completing Malhar road project:Missing multiple deadlines in the past, the project to transform Malhar road into a smart road is now expected to be complete by Christmas (December 25). Ashu stated the work to lay underground electricity wires is going on and directions have been issued to expedite the work.With construction works going on at Ferozepur road and Pakhowal road railway crossing, traffic snarls have increased on Malhar road. The project, which started in July 2019 was to be complete by May 2022 but was delayed due to pandemic outbreak. Authorities then set September 2020 as the new deadline and subsequently moved it further.Ashu to take up matter with Railway ministerBlaming the railway authorities for the slow pace of the Pakhowal road rail overbridge and rail underbridge project, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Saturday said he will take up the issue with union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. Ashu said that deputy chief engineer (construction division) of the Northern Railways Williamjit Singh, during a meeting in August, had assured that their part of Pakhowal Road RUB-2 (from Pakhowal road canal bridge to Sarabha Nagar) will be complete by August 31, 2021. “Construction of ROB and RUBs at Pakhowal road railway crossing was a long-pending demand of residents due to traffic jams at the crossing. However, the work is going on at snail’s pace. I will take up the matter with union minister Vaishnaw so that work can be expedited. Residents have been suffering due to the delay,” said Ashu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-pakhowal-road-rob-rubs-completion-pushed-to-march-2022-101638644479533.html

Terming it an “expose”, the AAP leader also accused the ruling Congress of “patronising” the sand mafiaAddressing the media, Chadha said after becoming the chief minister, Channi had said that the sand mafia should not come to him and he was not the chief minister of sand mafia. “But now, the sand mafia is running its business under the protection of CM and that too in his area,” Chadha claimed.He said as per their estimates, 800 to 1,000 trucks (tippers), loaded with sand were being taken out from the site. “Right under the CM’s nose and in his own constituency, this illegal activity is going on,” he alleged.Chadha accused the CM of wrongly transferring a forest officer. “On November 22, forest officer Rajvansh Singh had written to the SHO and tehsildar of the area informing that the of Jindapur village falls under the Forest Conservation Act where no mining activity can be carried out. On November 23, a day after the letter, the Channi government ordered the transfer of the officer. This proves that the sand mafia is working under their protection,” the AAP leader said. “Channi says the entire Punjab gets sand at ₹5 per ft, whereas the truth is that due to the mafia, people have to buy sand at ₹25 to 40 per ft,” he alleged. When contacted, Rupnagar deputy commissioner Sonali Giri said: “It is a legal de-silting site.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-alleges-illegal-sand-mining-in-cm-s-constituency-chamkaur-sahib-101638644357854.html

A senior DPCC official said as per the orders of the CAQM, a proposal for forming the special task force has been moved and is pending approval from the Delhi government. “We have moved the file seeking approval for the formation of the special task force,” said the official, asking not to be named. The CAQM, in a December 2 order, directed the formation of such a task force in Delhi and all states of the National Capital Region (NCR) to ensure that the enforcement of pollution control directions, issued by the commission from time to time, is undertaken efficiently. It said in Delhi, the task force will be headed by principal secretary or secretary (environment) and comprise member secretary (DPCC), and three technical members. But a senior Delhi environment official privy to the matter said the pollution control task force will not just comprise the members suggested by the CAQM, but will also have representatives from all government agencies that are involved in pollution abatement such as the three municipal corporations (east, north and south), public works department (PWD), Delhi Cantonment Board, Delhi traffic police etc. “The CAQM order has made a provision to appoint additional members. So, we are going to have the heads of all the agencies involved in pollution management as members. The approval for the task force should come in a day or two,” confirmed the official, asking not to be named. Delhi has been going through its worst spell of pollution since 2015, when the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started maintaining pollution data.

Addressing party workers, after launching the campaign, Delhi environment minister and AAP’s Delhi unit convener Gopal Rai said as part of the new campaign, their cadre will hit every street, lane, booth and ward in Delhi to enlist people. “The last time we contested the MCD (municipal corporations of Delhi) elections, we were contesting for the very first time and had no experience at all — we were only learning. What we learnt was that, if we want Delhi to shine, and if we want it to be more beautiful and healthier, cleanliness is of utmost importance. Which is why we are launching this MCD Badlaav Campaign. We will go to every corner in Delhi and let people know that just the way they chose Arvind Kejriwal to eradicate corruption from the Delhi government, the time has now come for them to reform the MCD. We can improve everything in Delhi — we can give free water, free electricity, we can install CCTV cameras — but when people open their doors to step out, what they see is garbage littered on streets, and that it sours the mood. We have to take on this responsibility of making Delhi a better capital city,” he said. “We have to take the lead in this fight for change. We have three months left before the elections in March. Which is why, starting tomorrow, we will be setting up day-long membership camps at every booth and mandal in Delhi. Through these camps, we will do our campaigning and people can come to join the party. Our target is to make 50 lakh people members of the Aam Aadmi Party in the coming three months,” Rai told party workers. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said regardless of whether one considers themselves a state-level leader or national level, everyone has to work at the mandal level to strengthen this campaign.“If you don’t work in your area, you will have to answer to the entire mission. No one should think that they can get away by just marking their attendance and posting a few photos on Facebook. When you do actual work in your mandal, it will be apparent.”Terming the Aam Aadmi Party “a movement”, and not just a party, the deputy CM said, “We have to change the politics of this country. We had said that we will end VIP culture, and we will end red beacons. On its first day in office in 2015, this governmen became the first in the country to put an end to the red beacon culture. It was only when people started talking of Aam Aadmi Party’s politics, the movement they had created, how the red beacons had come off vehicles that even Modi ji remembered that he too had a beacon atop his car that he needed to remove. The one thing that all of us revolutionaries have to do, is change the way politics happen and is perceived in this country, and you have already begun the task.” “When people see one of our party workers, they say “you and your party have done amazing work; you did so much for the education facilities and even made electricity free of cost”. This is what the fight is about. When a BJP worker goes anywhere in the country, what would the people say to him/her? Congress, which has been in power for the past several decades, what questions would people ask them? Would they even have anything to say?” Sisodia said.

According to police, they received a complaint on Friday after the victims became fit to record their statements following which a case was registered against six employees of the petrol pump who were at large.Police said that on the night of the incident, Mukesh Sehra, a resident of Dwarka in Delhi, had taken his colleague to an ahata (open drinking place) on National Highway 8 near Sector 31 to celebrate the birth of his twin boys last month. Sehra said that he had lost his car’s keys and wanted to call a company for towing away the vehicle, but battery of his mobile phone as well as his friend’s was exhausted and they went to a nearby petrol pump and requested the staff to help them with the charger. “The staff refused and suddenly one of them started abusing us. When I objected, two more staff members came and asked us to get out of the area. When we said that we were in trouble, they became offensive and one of them got a wooden stick and an iron rod and started hitting me,” he told police.

He assured free availability of hepatitis drugs both in public and private sector hospitals and said all mohalla clinic staff will be trained in screening and treating hepatitis. “The Delhi government is planning to screening and treatment of hepatitis B and C mandatory and free for pregnant women so that early diagnoses and treatment prevents the child from getting infected. Apart from this, we will train the staff of mohalla clinics to treat this disease, along with screening, and make sure that free medicines are available there to treat the disease at the primary level. We will devise a mechanism to provide free medicines to patients of Hepatitis B in mohalla clinics,” Jain said at the ceremony. “We will also bring hepatitis under the list of notifiable diseases of Delhi within the next few months,” said the state health minister. Vector borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya, were recently added to the list of notifiable diseases in addition to Covid-19 and mucormycosis, which were notified in the course of the last two years. In addition, the minister said the government’s upcoming digital health cards, which will contain the complete health information of Delhi residents, will be used to ensure everyone in the city is screened for Hepatitis B and C at least once in their lives. “The Delhi government will integrate the test for hepatitis with its upcoming Health Management Information System, which will ensure every health card holder goes through a hepatitis test once in their lives,” he said. Jain said Hepatitis C is easily treatable with a 12 week medication course. Hepatitis B can also be prevented. The two ways by which Hepatitis B spreads is from expecting mother to a child and through blood transfusion. This can easily be prevented through early detection, he said.He assured that the government will work towards passing a law against discrimination of Hepatitis B and C patients in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-screening-treatment-for-pregnant-women-with-hepatitis-in-delhi-jain-101638643158005.html

Airport officials said passengers who pre-book their RT-PCR/rapid antigen tests, can simply approach the counters and proceed to get tested for Covid-19 and thus save time on the registration process.The counters have been set up at the arrival piers, with a dedicated queue for passengers pre-booking their tests, officials said. Tests can be pre-booked at Air Suvidha portal on www.newdelhiairport.in, said officials, asking fliers to book their test in advance to reduce waiting time for registration.“A significant number of international passengers arriving at Delhi airport are pre-booking their rapid antigen/RTPCR tests. The number of pre-bookings has gone up ever since the latest testing norms have come into place. The dedicated counters will help ease the process further for passengers,” said Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO of Dial. .Following new guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare on November 26, passengers from ‘high-risk’ countries, such as South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel and all European countries, are now required to take an RT-PCT test on arrival at the Delhi airport, even if they produce a negative test result before boarding, or are fully vaccinated.So far, around 80% of the international passengers arriving from high-risk countries have opted for a rapid PCR test, which generates results within 45-60 minutes as compared to three to four hours taken by an RT-PCR test. “Appropriate signage have been placed at strategic locations to guide passengers to these testing facilities” said a spokesperson of Dial.According to guidelines, Dial is also facilitating a random RT-PCR test for 2% of the international passengers arriving from non high-risk countries free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20-counters-at-delhi-airport-to-test-passengers-from-high-risk-countries-101638642857815.html
05-12-2021||Pune||Narendra Dabholkar murder: defence questions complainant’s version of events||The defence counsel in the murder trial of slain rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar on Saturday cross-examined the complainant in the case claiming that there are inconsistencies in his statement recorded during the complaint and to the probe agency. Dabholkar, a noted anti-superstition activist, was shot dead on the Omkareshwar bridge in the city on August 20, 2013, while on a morning walk.In his complaint to the Pune police, police officer Navnath Rangat had said that he saw a truck pass by and then witnessed 3-4 people gathered on Omkareshwar bridge around 7:20am and upon close inspection, he found a man (Dabholkar) in a pool of blood. This statement was recorded by police inspector (crime) S Kenjale.During cross-examination, defence lawyer Prakash Salsingikar pointed our that as per Rangat’s statement of July 4, 2014, to CBI deputy superintendent D S Chauhan, he was not present at the spot, but was taking rest at the Shaniwar peth police chowky. He even called his wife from the landline of the police chowky around 7.20 am. Sometime later an aged person approached him and informed him about a man lying on the bridge in a pool of blood, the lawyer said, citing the CBI statement.The hearing was held in the court of special judge SR Navander with Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi and defence lawyers advocates Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, Prakash Salsingikar, and Suvarna Vast. The accused, Vikram Bhave, Sachin Andure, Sharad Kalaskar, and Virendra Taware, were present in court while accused Advocate Sanjiv Punalekar was exempted from being present of the court. “There are serious lacunae in the version that he is narrating in court and the statement that he has given and is signed by a senior officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” said Advocate Vast and she was seconded by Salsingikar, who did major part of the cross-questioning, as well as Ichalkaranjikar. In another loophole pointed out by the defence team, Rangat mentioned that two of the four people named for morning naka bandi to curb chain snatching that day were present close to the spot at Shaniwar peth police outpost. The two people present, as per Rangat were himself and head constable Ankush More. However, in a statement recorded by CBI, Rangat mentions, “When I received the information of this incident, there was no naka bandi at the bridge. I was the first police officer who reached the spot.” However, in the statement recorded by the Pune police, API Rangat mentioned that HC More and him reached the spot to inspect the crowding. In another glaring loophole that was pointed out by the defence team during cross questioning, the FIR by Pune police shows the time of registration to be 9:30am. However, in his statement to the CBI, he says that his complaint statement was recorded much after 11am. API Rangat said that he reached the police outpost of Bal Gandharv from Sassoon hospital (after taking Dabholkar’s body) at 11am after receiving directions to do so by some officer. He was interrogated by crime PI and assistant commissioner of police of Deccan division under supervision of the then joint commissioner of police of Pune and they recorded his statement which later became the complaint statement. “After some time my statement was recorded by PI Jegle in the supervision of Joint CP Singhal at the chowky. After recording my statement I was allowed to go in the afternoon at about 14.30 hours. On being asked, I state that the FIR of this case was recorded on the basis of my statement recorded by the crime PI,” reads his statement to CBI. Such loopholes were also pointed out by the defence team in the statement of a panch witness identified as Shyam Nivrutti Marne. The panch denied multiple points made in the statement in his name recorded by CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/narendra-dabholkar-murder-defence-questions-complainant-s-version-of-events-101638642797975.html
05-12-2021||Other||Gurugram’s air quality slips into ‘very poor’ zone again||The air quality in the city on Saturday slipped back into the “very poor” zone as low wind speed did not allow the pollutants to disperse. The air quality had improved to “poor” on Friday after remaining in the “very poor” category for nine consecutive days. The air quality index (AQI) of Gurugram on Saturday was 334, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a rise from Friday’s reading of 296. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in “very poor” category on Sunday and Monday, but will improve from Tuesday onwards. “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from the northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 4kmph. The average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants,” the IMD said in a statement. The IMD on Saturday recorded the maximum temperature for Gurugram at 24 degrees Celsius (°C) while the minimum was recorded at 10°C, which is two degrees less than the season’s average. On Friday, the maximum and minimum temperatures in the city were 18.6°C and 11°C, respectively. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said, “Upper atmosphere is much cleaner due to the drizzling that happened two days ago, but the pollutants are again getting collected in lower atmosphere. The low wind speed is reason for high level of pollution on Saturday. On December 6 and 7, the western disturbance can bring more rains and winds to Delhi which will help improve air quality in the region for a couple of days.” Meanwhile, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board on Saturday issued a final notice to construction sites, diesel generator set operators and other related industries to strictly adhere to pollution norms. “Final notice and warning is hereby given to all concerned who shall have to bound to comply with all such directions, failing which stringent action under the provisions of relevant rules shall be taken, besides on spot sealing of DG sets and polluting units,” said the final notice issued by Kuldip Singh, regional officer (north), Haryana State Pollution Control Board. Singh further said that the final notice was being issued to send the message to the general public that an emergency situation is prevailing in the region as far as air pollution is concerned and no violation will be tolerated. “Any violation from now onward will lead to sealing of the premises and the machinery as the situation is serious,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugrams-air-quality-slips-into-very-poor-zone-again-101638642738888.html

She further said that because of all this she is facing a lot of problems in commuting and is not being able to go out for essential work,” the DCW said in a statement.DCW chief Swati Maliwal said she has given the transport department four days to resolve the case so that the student “doesn’t suffer anymore”.“It is very unfortunate that people can be so petty and abusive that the girl is having to face so much harassment,” Maliwal said.A senior Delhi transport department official said that “SEX” is an auto-generated series for vehicle registration, essentially for two-wheelers.“We have stopped registration on this series because of the sensitivity. All series for vehicles in Delhi are auto generated by the system” said the official.“If we receive requests, we can change the registration number on a case-to-case basis,” the official added after the commission took up the student’s case.The Maliwal-led commission has also asked the transport department to submit the total number of vehicles that have been registered under this series.

The nation has witnessed several debates about vaccines and inoculation mandates, with a section of people questioning the need for vaccines altogether.The report pointed out that the demand for vaccines grew from an average of under-a-million doses a day to an average of 1.5 million a day in recent weeks, citing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The report also highlighted that many among those queuing across vaccination centres are there for their first dose.“What the public needs to keep in mind is that we’ve got a stressed and strained healthcare delivery system,” Mitchel Rothholz, the head of immunisation policy at the American Pharmacists Association told the NYT.The Biden administration is planning to create hundreds of family-vaccination clinics, one-stop shops for first shots and boosters. The CDC also recommended booster shots in order to ensure that people in the US remain protected against Omicron and Delta variants.The US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci on Sunday said that early indications regarding the severity of the Omicron Covid-19 are ‘encouraging’. “Omicron has a transmission advantage. Though it's too early to really make any definitive statements about it, thus far, it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it. Thus far, the signals are a bit encouraging,” Fauci said while speaking to CNN.However, Moderna’s president Stephen Hoge told news agencies that there was concern regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine. “I think that there's a real risk that we're going to see a decrease in effectiveness of the vaccines. What I don't know is how substantial that is,” Hoge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-long-queues-in-vaccination-centres-following-omicron-scare-report-101638724820140.html

Villages and nearby towns were blanketed with falling ash and several hamlets were buried under tons of mud from volcanic debris.Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled the volcano’s wrath not to return during Sunday’s lull in volcanic activity, but some villagers were desperate to check on livestock and possessions left behind. In several areas, everything — from the thinnest tree branch to couches and chairs inside homes — was caked with ash.The debris and lava mixed with rainfall to form thick mud that destroyed the main bridge connecting Lumajang and the neighboring district of Malang, as well as a smaller bridge, said Thoriqul Haq, the district chief in Lumajang.The eruption eased pressure that had been building under a lave dome perched on the crater. But experts warned that the dome could still further collapse, causing an avalanche of the blistering gas and debris trapped beneath it.A thunderstorm and days of rain, which eroded and partly collapsed the dome atop the 3,676-meter (12,060-foot) Semeru, triggered the eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey center.He said flows of searing gas and lava traveled up to 800 meters (2,624 feet) to a nearby river at least twice on Saturday. People were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the crater’s mouth, the agency said.Television reports showed people screaming and running under a huge ash cloud, their faces wet from rain mixed with volcanic dust.Despite an increase in activity since Wednesday, Semeru’s alert status had remained at the third highest of four levels since it began erupting last year, and Indonesia’s Volcanology Center for Geological Hazard Mitigation did not raise it this week, Lelono said.Semeru, the stratovolcano, is also known as Mahameru, meaning “The Great Mountain” in Sanskrit. It has erupted many times over the last 200 years. Still, as with other volcanoes — it is one of 129 under watch in Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago — more than 62,000 people call Sumeru's fertile slopes home. The 3,676-meter (12,060-foot) volcano last erupted in January, with no casualties.Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines. Currently 54% of the country’s nearly 270 million people live on Java, the country’s most densely populated area.Officials said earlier they had hoped they could avoid casualties by closely monitoring the volcano, but the death toll quickly rose from one late Saturday to 13 on Sunday morning.National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said 57 people had been hospitalized, mostly with burns, respiratory problems and other injuries. He said rescuers were still searching for seven residents of Curah Kobokan village who were reported missing.More than 900 villagers streamed into makeshift emergency shelters after Saturday’s powerful eruption, but many others defied official warnings and chose to remain in their homes, saying they had to tend to their livestock and protect their property, said Haryadi Purnomo of East Java’s search and rescue agency.“We’ll do everything we can to evacuate them by preparing trucks and motorbikes for them to flee at any time,” Purnomo said.He said his teams were searching for survivors and victims on the southern slope of the mountain, but thick mud, smoldering debris and heavy rain have hampered the search. He described several formerly lush villages south of the crater as “death zones.”“There’s no life there... trees, farms, houses are scorched, everything is covered in heavy gray ash,” Purnomo said, adding that several other areas were virtually untouched. Search and rescue efforts were temporary suspended on Sunday afternoon amid fears that smoldering debris and hot ash could tumble down from the crater due to heavy rains.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Sunday that he instructed his Cabinet ministers and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-volcanic-eruption-smoldering-debris-from-semeru-hinders-rescue-ops-101638695830931.html

05-12-2021||World||Didi departure from NYSE marks end of Wall Street romance with Chinese big tech||The Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing's announcement that it will delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange marks the end of a cushy relationship between Wall Street and Chinese tech giants, who are under siege from authorities in Beijing and regulators in America.Only five months transpired between Didi's going public in New York in June and word Friday that it will prepare a Hong Kong listing. During that time its market value has fallen by 63 percent.Didi's move comes in the wake of a sweeping Chinese regulatory crackdown in the past year that has clipped the wings of major internet firms wielding huge influence on consumers' lives -- including Alibaba and Tencent.After Friday's announcement, heavyweight Chinese online retailers whose stocks are sold on the New York exchange, such as Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, dropped sharply.Shares in Alibaba -- whose arrival on Wall Street in 2014 to a loud fanfare kicked off the parade of Chinese firms listing in the Big Apple -- fell to their lowest level in nearly five years as rumors circulated that, after Didi leaves, Alibaba might be next.Technically, even as Didi Chuxing moves its listing to Hong Kong, holders of its shares in New York retain those stakes. Their investment does not simply vanish.But "people are very fearful about regulations and the Chinese government," said Kevin Carter, portfolio manager at EMQQ. "And that has really, really affected sentiment. People are scared."Coincidentally, on Thursday US market regulators announced the adoption of a rule allowing them to delist foreign companies if they fail to provide information to auditors.The move is aimed primarily at Chinese firms, and requires them to disclose whether they are "owned or controlled" by a government."While more than 50 jurisdictions have worked... to allow the required inspections, two historically have not: China and Hong Kong," Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler said.'Sensitive data'The Global Times, a newspaper close to the Chinese Communist Party, criticized the new US regulation in an opinion piece Friday."If the US sets unequal conditions on national security for competition between the two countries by demanding Chinese listed companies hand over audits for inspection so as to spy on China's internal situation and store huge amounts of sensitive data acquired by Chinese companies, China won't accept that," the unsigned piece said.Many of these New York-listed shares are held not by private citizens but rather by institutional investors."Some funds can only have shares that are traded on US markets," said Gregori Volokhine, president of Meeschaert Financial Services. "This is what is putting pressure on shares."And for many market watchers, Didi, described as China's answer to Uber, will not be the last Chinese tech giant to delist from New York."It is not specific to Didi because for months we have seen the communist party's grip on companies tighten," said Volokhine.Shortly after Didi went public in New York, the reservation platform Full Truck Alliance and the job-search site Kanzhun were investigated by China's cybersecurity watchdog.The Chinese government has also tightened regulations on companies that offer families private tutoring. This has hurt companies listed in New York.According to figures in May from a US government agency, a total of 248 Chinese companies are listed in the United States, with a combined market capitalization of 2.1 trillion dollars."After an active start to the year, Chinese companies have largely stopped tapping the US IPO market since June, due to regulatory and policy roadblocks in both countries," said Matthew Kennedy, a strategist with Renaissance Capital.This week Spark Education, a big Chinese online small-class teaching firm, withdrew its planned IPO in the US."The way things are, one can say there will be no more new Chinese IPOs and the ones in the pipeline will be withdrawn one by one," Volokhine said. Renaissance Capital says there are 35 companies in that pipeline.In leaving the US market, Chinese companies are giving up an investor base like no other in the world -- with $52.5 trillion in assets under management, compared to $7.1 trillion in China, according to a study last year by McKinsey and Company, a management consulting firm.Carter said this political pressure on Chinese companies creates an odd situation in which the stars of the Chinese tech world are plummeting on the stock market, but not because of their earnings reports."And these companies are still making profits. And then those profits are still growing," he said."The revenue growth for the year is over 30 percent. Not for every company, but a bit collectively. No matter where the stock is, no matter where the stocks trade, that's still the case," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/didi-departure-from-nyse-marks-end-of-wall-street-romance-with-chinese-big-tech-101638694551677.html

The doctors say it is necessary for the process to start immediately to "prevent the collapse of the healthcare system," the RDA said in a statement earlier."We request all stakeholders and administrative authorities to ensure that the process of induction of new doctors is completed at the earliest," it added.There have been repeated delays in conducting NEET-PG 2021 counselling despite multiple reminders and communications with the ministry and authorities concerned, the RDA of Safdarjung hospital said. "As the third wave of Covid is imminent, we wish to reiterate that we are grossly understaffed as the PG residents of the 2021 batch have not yet joined," it added.Resident doctors are exhausted and on the verge of a breakdown but have been patiently waiting and working with resilience for patients’ care, the association also said.Resident doctors at a few Delhi government-run facilities like the LNJP Hospital and the DDU Hospital have also refused to offer services in OPDs over the same issues.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neetpg-counselling-delay-rml-resident-doctors-to-boycott-emergency-services-from-monday-101638696034889.html

"It should be turned into a unified mosque where both Shiites and Sunnis can pray."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/incomplete-saddam-era-marquee-mosque-lays-bare-iraq-divisions-101638694640684.html
05-12-2021||World||'Metaverse' hype fuels booming digital property market||The idea of spending millions on non-existent land may sound ludicrous -- but feverish predictions of a virtual reality future are pushing investors to bet big on digital real estate.This week, New York-based company Republic Realm announced it had spent a record-breaking $4.3 million on digital land through The Sandbox, one of several "virtual world" websites where people can socialise, play games and even attend concerts.That came hot on the heels of a $2.4-million land purchase in late November on a rival platform, Decentraland, by Canadian crypto company Tokens.com. And days before that, Barbados announced plans to open a "metaverse embassy" in Decentraland.Such websites bill themselves as a prototype of the metaverse, a future internet where online experiences like chatting to a friend would eventually feel face-to-face thanks to virtual reality (VR) headsets."Metaverse" has been a Silicon Valley buzzword for months, but interest soared in October after Facebook's parent company renamed itself "Meta" as it shifts its focus towards VR.The Facebook rebrand "introduced the term 'metaverse' to millions of people a lot faster than I would have ever imagined," said Cathy Hackl, a tech consultant who advises companies on entering the metaverse.According to crypto data site Dapp, land worth more than $100 million has sold in the past week across the four largest metaverse sites, The Sandbox, Decentraland, CryptoVoxels, and Somnium Space.For Hackl, it's unsurprising that the market is booming, spawning an entire ecosystem around virtual real estate, from rents to land developers."We're trying to translate the way we understand physical goods into the virtual world," she told AFP.And while it may be some time before these sites operate as true metaverses, transporting us elsewhere with VR goggles, digital land is already functioning as an asset just like real land, said Hackl."They can build on it, they can rent it out, they can sell it," she said.'Fifth Avenue of the metaverse'Tokens.com has bought a prime patch in Decentraland's Fashion Street district, which the platform hopes to develop as a home for luxury brands' virtual stores."If I hadn't done the research and understood that this is valuable property, it would seem absolutely crazy," admitted Tokens.com CEO Andrew Kiguel.Kiguel spent 20 years as an investment banker focused on real estate. He insists the Decentraland plot makes exactly the same kind of business sense as it would in the real world: it's in a trendy area with high footfall."That is advertising and event space where people are going to congregate," he explained, pointing to a recent virtual musical festival in Decentraland which attracted 50,000 visitors.Luxury brands are already venturing into the metaverse -- a Gucci handbag sold on the Roblox platform in May for more than the real version -- and Kiguel hopes Fashion Street will become a shopping destination akin to New York's Fifth Avenue.As for how the land could be used to make money, "it can be as simple as having a billboard, or it can be as complex as having a storefront with an actual employee," he said."You could walk in with your avatar and have 3D digital representations of a shoe that you can hold, and ask questions."Second Life, rebootedAs far back as 2006, a real estate developer made headlines after making $1 million from land sold on the virtual world site Second Life.While Second Life remains active, proponents of its next-generation rivals point out a key difference.In Decentraland, everything from land to virtual artwork comes in the form of a non-fungible token, or NFT.Some people have spent tens of thousands of dollars on these digital items, and the concept has generated scepticism as well as excitement.But Kiguel predicts this form of digital ownership will become widespread in the coming years, because the blockchain technology behind it creates trust and transparency when making transactions."I can see the ownership history, what's been paid for it and how it's been transferred around," he said.But the investment is not without its risks -- particularly given the volatility of the cryptocurrencies used to buy NFTs.And while virtual concerts on sites like Roblox and Fortnite have drawn tens of millions of viewers, the sparse data available suggests traffic on metaverses like Decentraland lags far behind that of established social media sites like Facebook and Instagram.Ultimately the value of the land investments depends on whether people start flocking to these sites."I know it all sounds quite ludicrous," said Kiguel. "But there's a vision behind it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/metaverse-hype-fuels-booming-digital-property-market-101638694661663.html

Not Chancellor Angela Merkel.During 16 years in power, the veteran navigated Germany through the 2008 financial turmoil and ensuing eurozone debt crisis, the 2015 refugee influx and then the coronavirus pandemic.While largely admired at home and abroad even in the final days of her reign, the legacy she leaves behind is marked both by light and shadows.Party in crisisMerkel scraped to a narrow win in 2005 against incumbent chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of the Social Democrats, putting her conservative CDU-CSU alliance on the path of power for over a decade.At the zenith of her popularity, Merkel led the conservatives to a thumping win with 41.5 percent of the vote in 2013.With her track record, she was able to end a crucial TV election debate that year with the simple closing words "you know me".But her exit from politics was marred by a succession crisis in her party, culminating in a humiliating loss at September's general elections that sent it into the opposition for the next four years.Budget dogmaOnce dismissed as the sick man of Europe, Germany cemented its reputation as the continent's economic engine on Merkel's watch.Unemployment is at record lows -- 5.3 percent in November even as the economy is struggling with the impact of the pandemic.Budget surpluses chalked up from 2012 also allowed the ageing nation to pay down a huge debt mountain, giving it a buffer against the impact of the health emergency.But Germany's fixation with balanced budgets has left a sour taste, particularly among southern Europeans battered by the financial and eurozone debt crises.Merkel appeared to ignore pleas for debt relief when Greece was on the brink of economic collapse, triggering huge demonstrations in the country.While credited with securing huge European bailouts that saved Greece from crashing out of the euro, it was achieved at a heavy social cost including massive job losses.But it was Covid-19 that forced her to make a drastic U-turn on her resistance to mutualising European debt.Instead, Merkel spearheaded the 800-billion-euro ($950-billion) EU recovery fund, which sees the European Commission raising money by issuing bonds on behalf of all 27 members.Climate chancellor?Merkel made the startling decision to shut Germany's nuclear power plants in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, triggering the "Energiewende" -- the shift to sustainable energy.But the sudden policy shift forced greater reliance on coal energy in the transition period as the country battled to ramp up wind and biomass energy output.Merkel's government was accused of protecting Germany's vital automobile industry by watering down emissions regulation reforms, and its refusal to advance a 2038 deadline to quit coal energy also irked green activists.In a humiliating ruling against the government's flagship environmental protection plan, Germany's highest court in April ordered Merkel's coalition to draw up an improved plan.Her government subsequently brought forward targets to slash CO2 emissions by 65 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, from an earlier goal of 55 percent."When I look at the situation, no one can say that we have done enough" for the environment, admitted Merkel in June."Time is pressing. I can understand the impatience of young people."Business as usual?Merkel was lauded by human rights activists in 2015 for keeping Germany's borders open to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.But on China's mass incarceration of Uyghurs in the far western region of Xinjiang, Merkel was accused of lacking bite.Critics said she was hamstrung by huge economic interests in China.Likewise, while Merkel spoke out firmly against Russia over the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, she stuck to her guns on completing a controversial gas pipeline called Nord Stream 2.Far right, Europe fault linesThe arrival of more than a million asylum seekers in Germany further fractured the political landscape.Popular anger over the mass influx sent a far-right bloc, the anti-immigration AfD, to parliament in 2017 for the first time since World War II, making it the biggest opposition force.It also opened up a fault line with former Eastern bloc nations including Hungary and Poland, which have dug in their heels against the new arrivals.Six years on, the European Union has been unable to agree on unified migration policies.Legacy for womenAs Germany's first female chancellor, Merkel smashed the glass ceiling and became a role model for women politicians around the world.But it was only at the very end of her time in office that she declared herself a feminist, having long resisted the term -- too little, too late for some in Germany.Critics say her government failed to make structural changes to benefit women in German society, such as reforming Germany's tax system for married couples -- a long-standing feminist plea.The country's gender pay gap also remains among the highest in the European Union and stood at 19 percent in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austerity-far-right-feminism-merkel-s-ambivalent-legacy-101638694705757.html

President Joe Biden's administration has said this year it would proceed with the sale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-says-french-rafale-fighter-jets-not-a-substitute-for-us-f-35-warplanes-101638695080835.html

"I owe them all and will miss that group of special people who did really important work."Cuomo has spoken candidly of his strong bond with his older sibling."He's my brother. And if I can help my brother, I do. If he wants me to hear something, I will. If he wants me to weigh in on something, I'll try," he told investigators in July when asked about the counsel he had offered."He's my brother, and I love him to death no matter what."Democrat Andrew Cuomo was elected governor three times before resigning in August after New York's attorney general said an investigation concluded he had sexually harassed at least 11 women.In October, the former governor -- whose father Mario Cuomo had also been governor of New York -- was charged with a misdemeanor sex crime for forcible touching.At the start of the pandemic, the Cuomo brothers soared to new heights of popularity: Andrew, 63, earned praise for his frank daily briefings as the coronavirus ravaged New York, and his live exchanges with Chris on CNN were peppered with banter.The investigation into Chris Cuomo's conduct remains ongoing, CNN said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cnn-terminates-chris-cuomo-over-help-he-gave-to-governor-brother-andrew-101638694752795.html

They put us on a platter for everyone who can just come and take whatever they want," Vladislava Cvoric, a 56-year old economist, told AFP during the protest.Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic shared a photograph of the protest on Instagram and commented that "clean air, water and food are keys to health"."Without that, every word about 'health' is obsolete", Djokovic added.The protests followed similar demonstrations last week during which masked men attacked one gathering in western Serbia's Sabac -- sparking outrage on social media and accusations the government was using hooligans to suppress the movement.Substantial deposits of lithium -- a key component for electric car batteries -- are found around the western town of Loznica, where the Anglo-Australian company is buying up land but is still awaiting the final green light from the state to begin mining.Rio Tinto discovered lithium reserves in the Loznica region in 2006.The company intends to invest $2.4 billion (2.12 billion euros) in the project, according to Vesna Prodanovic, director of Rio Sava, Rio Tinto's sister company in Serbia.Critics have accused President Aleksandar Vucic's government of setting the stage for illegal land appropriations and ignoring environmental concerns.The demonstrations come months ahead of likely national elections next year, with critics of the protests accusing organisers of stirring controversy to undermine Vucic before the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-block-roads-in-serbia-to-protest-mining-project-101638694784674.html

Ninety-eight have been injured, including two pregnant women, and 902 have been evacuated, the statement said.Thoriqul Haq, a local official in Lumajang, said earlier that sand miners had been trapped around their work sites.BNPB said at least 35 people had been hospitalised, while Lumajang's deputy head said 41 people suffered burns.Semeru, more than 3,600 metres (12,000 feet) high, is one of Indonesia's nearly 130 active volcanoes. It erupted in January, causing no casualties.Indonesia straddles the "Pacific Ring of Fire", a highly seismically active zone, where different plates on the earth’s crust meet and create a large number of earthquakes and volcanoes.Separately, an earthquake of magnitude 6 struck north of Halmahera on Sunday, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said. Halmahera is about 2,000 km (1,200 miles) northeast of Semeru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-semeru-volcanic-eruption-kills-13-official-says-101638672290130.html

The United States has announced new testing rules for inbound travellers which will take effect from Monday amid global alarm over Omicron variant of coronavirus. The air passengers entering the US will have to obtain a negative Covid-19 test within one day of travel.The current requirement allows travellers to produce a negative Covid test within three days of boarding their flight. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky's order says all air travellers, “regardless of citizenship or vaccination status, will be required to show a negative pre-departure Covid-19 viral test taken the day before they board their flight to the United States."Britain has also tightened its travel guidelines, requiring all travellers, regardless of their vaccination status, to take a pre-flight Covid test within 48 hours prior to their flight. The new travel rules will take effect from Tuesday. UK health minister Sajid Javid said that the new travel requirement will be temporary and be reviewed as the omicron outbreak develops. Both the US and the UK have allowed travellers to take either an antigen test or a PCR test.4 Omicron cases in India: What their age, travel and vaccination history revealJapan will add India, Greece, Romania and four US states under strict quarantine vigilance in a bid to curb the spread of Omicron, Kyodo news reported. Foreigners, as well as Japanese nationals travelling from Colorado, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York, will have to mandatorily spend three days of their two-week quarantine at government-designated facilities.While most of the countries have reported infections in travellers from south African nations, the United States and Australia have confirmed local transmission as Omicron’s potential to evade immunity from vaccination and prior infections remains unclear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-alarm-what-are-the-new-testing-rules-for-inbound-us-uk-travellers-101638668337345.html

"It looks a lot like rehearsals."Some analysts have suggested Beijing may be testing Biden during his first year in office.China was the only power now capable of using its "economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system," Austin said.The world's two largest economic powers, he went on, have "real differences both over interests and values. But the way that you manage them counts."He said Chinese leaders had been increasingly vocal about their "dissatisfaction with the prevailing order -- and about their aim of displacing America from its global leadership role."But, Austin said: "We seek neither confrontation nor conflict.... We're not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs."In the face of the Chinese challenge, the retired four-star army general said, the US would be deepening its ties to friendly countries in the region, including through joint exercises."We remain steadfast to our One-China policy," Austin said, but also to "our commitments of the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan's ability to defend itself while also maintaining our capacity to resist any resort to force that would jeopardize the security of the people of Taiwan."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-military-operations-near-taiwan-resemble-rehearsals-pentagon-chief-101638667470162.html

The West, including the European Union, Canada and Britain said the alleged actions of the Taliban constitute “serious human rights abuses” and contradict the amnesty announced by the ruling Sunni Pashtun group in Afghanistan.“We call on the Taliban to effectively enforce the amnesty for former members of the Afghan security forces and former Government officials to ensure that it is upheld across the country and throughout their ranks,” the joint statement read.The statement comes days after Human Rights Watch, an international human rights advocacy group, released a 25-page report on executions and enforced disappearances in Afghanistan under the Taliban. The report has documented the killing or disappearance of 47 former members of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) who had surrendered to or were apprehended by the Taliban after it took control of Kabul on August 15.“Reported cases must be investigated promptly and in a transparent manner, those responsible must be held accountable, and these steps must be clearly publicized as an immediate deterrent to further killings and disappearances,” the countries said, adding that they will continue to measure the Taliban by their actions.Among several commitments aimed at getting recognition from the international community, the Taliban had promised amnesty for the members of the Afghan security forces. But the reports of executions and enforced disappearances have exposed the contradiction which could prove a setback to the Taliban in its attempt to get recognition.The joint statement on the reported summary killings and enforced disappearances has been released by the US, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-hits-out-at-taliban-over-summary-killings-enforced-disappearances-in-afghanistan-101638666459693.html

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes instructed the country’s top prosecutor, Augusto Aras, to look into the accusation raised by a pandemic inquiry conducted by Brazil’s Senate.Bolsonaro said in an October 24 broadcast that “official reports from the UK government suggest that fully vaccinated people... are developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome much faster than anticipated.”The future of any probe is uncertain, however. Aras rarely goes against the president and has not opened an investigation into Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic despite calls to do so by the Senate committeeIt’s just a cold, says BidenUS President Joe Biden has at least one thing in common with thousands of parents and grandparents this winter: He’s picked up a cold from his young grandson.The president has had a scratchy voice and an occasional cough all week, prompting questions from the press about his health on Friday.He assured reporters that he’s tested daily for Covid and is negative. “What I have is a one-and-a-half year old grandson who had a cold who likes to kiss his pop,” he said. “It’s just a cold.”UK PM reported to copsBritish PM Boris Johnson has been reported to the policy by a Labour MP for allegedly hosting two parties at Downing street despite Covid-related restrictions last year, according to a report by The Guardian.Labour MP Neil Coyle has written to Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick to investigate reports that Johnson attended two events, one in November and the other in December, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/probe-brazil-president-for-linking-jabs-to-aids-101638665514552.html
05-12-2021||World||China criticises US democracy ahead of Biden’s summit||Whether a country is democratic or not should be judged by the international community and not by a few “self-appointed judges”, China on Saturday said in an official document as it ramps up criticism against the upcoming US-organised Summit for Democracy.“There is no fixed model of democracy,” China said in the official document titled China: Democracy That Works, published on Saturday, which details its democratic endeavors.The document said whether a country is democratic “should be acknowledged by the international community, not arbitrarily decided by a few self-appointed judges”.“Over the past hundred years, the Party has led the people in realising people’s democracy in China. The Chinese people now truly hold in their hands their own future and that of society and the country,” the paper said, the official CGTN channel reported. China has termed its system “whole-process people’s democracy” after President Xi Jinping proposed the concept two years ago in Shanghai, according to official media.Ruled by the Communist Party of China (CPC) since 1949, China’s governance is firmly under the party’s control with all functions of the government – including the legislature and judiciary – fully compliant to rules laid down by the CPC.China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, is considered largely ceremonial and a rubber-stamp for decisions finalised by the CPC.Considered to have become increasingly authoritarian under Xi, the phrase “whole-process democracy” was enshrined in law this past March.Beijing has sharply criticised the Summit for Democracy to be held next week with Communist Party of China (CPC) officials calling it a “joke” at the release of the Chinese document on democracy on Saturday.“The US is a self-styled leader of democracy, but its so-called summit of democracy is only aimed at suppressing and containing countries with a different development model,” said Tian Peiyan, deputy director of the Policy Research Office of the CPC’s central committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-us-democracy-ahead-of-biden-s-summit-101638664395154.html

05-12-2021||World||‘Omicron could dent global economic growth’||The International Monetary Fund is likely to lower its global economic growth estimates due to the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the global lender’s chief said on Friday in another sign of the turmoil unleashed by the ever-changing pandemic.Omicron has spread rapidly to at least 40 countries since it was first reported in South Africa last week, officials say, and many governments have tightened travel rules to try to keep it out.“A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence, and in that sense, we are likely to see some downgrades of our October projections for global growth,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.Much remains unknown about Omicron. Researchers said it could have picked up genetic material from another virus, perhaps one that causes the common cold, which would allow it to more easily evade human immune system defences.By inserting this particular snippet into itself, Omicron might be making itself look “more human”, which would help it evade attack by the human immune system, said Venky Soundararajan of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data analytics firm nference, who led the study posted on Thursday on the website OSF Preprints.Parts of Europe and the US are grappling with a wave of infections of the more familiar Delta variant. The new strain could further destabilise economies that are still emerging from Covid-19 related lockdowns and disruptions.The variant has now reached at least 10 US states, and White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said there is “absolutely” community spread.The states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Maryland and Nebraska reported Omicron infections on Friday, and cases are guaranteed to keep on increasing in the coming days, according to Fauci.Covid-19 infections in the US are at the highest level in two months. Infections had been rising even before the discovery and arrival of Omicron. The seven-day average of cases in the US was 100,835 as of Thursday, the most since October 6, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.Cases of the Omicron in the Norwegian capital of Oslo linked to a corporate Christmas party may rise to as many as 100, public broadcaster NRK reported. So far it has resulted in at least 13 infections, making it the biggest outbreak outside of South Africa, officials said.England has identified 75 more infections caused by the Omicron variant, tripling the total caseload to 104.Separately, China reported 75 new infections of Covid-19, as an outbreak in a border town expanded. Inner Mongolia, where the flare-up is concentrated, added 61 cases, and a further three people without symptoms also tested positive, the National Health Commission said, without specifying if any infections were due to Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-could-dent-global-economic-growth-101638664469101.html

05-12-2021||India||Nagaland: 14 civilians die in Army firing, area tense||Kohima Protests erupted on Sunday after more than a dozen civilians were killed by Indian Army soldiers who appeared to have mistaken them for militants in Nagaland’s Mon district, according to officials.Thirteen civilians were killed in an ambush by the army late on Saturday and a jawan died in retaliation by locals in the district, a police officer said on condition of anonymity. On Sunday, angry villagers burned army vehicles and threw stones at a security camp in the district, about 300km from the state capital, Kohima. A civilian died and a few others were injured when security personnel opened fire at a mob that vandalised the 27th Assam Rifles camp.Union home minister Amit Shah expressed “deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives” and said a high-level special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the state government will probe the incident to ensure justice. Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio ordered the probe into the killings earlier and said the incident was “highly condemnable”.The Mon district administration imposed a curfew in the town and prohibited movement of all non-essential vehicles in the district. Entry into the district was also prohibited and mobile internet services were suspended in the region, a district official said.An Indian army statement said it “deeply regretted” the incident and its aftermath, adding that “the cause of the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated at the highest level and appropriate action will be taken as per the course of law.” It said “credible intelligence” on insurgent movements indicated that a “specific operation was planned” in Mon district in Nagaland.Indian Army personnel opened fired at a truck carrying local coal miners to Oting village from Tiru late on Saturday evening, a police officer said, asking not to be named. The army was conducting an operation in the area after receiving inputs on the possible movement of militants of Yung Aung faction of the proscribed outfit National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K), the officer said. Mon shares a porous international border with Myanmar, where the Yung Aung faction of the NSCN(K) is based.Another officer said the pick-up truck was ferrying Oting villagers who were working in a coal field near Tiru. Coal miners usually return home on Saturday and report back to work on Monday, the official added.An army officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said soldiers fired at the truck after receiving intelligence about the movement of militants, killing seven people.

05-12-2021||India||HT This Day: December 6, 1950 - Sri Aurobindo Ghosh passes||SAGE OF PONDICHERRY We regret to announce the death of Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. the Sage of Pondicherry, at 1-30 a.m. yesterday at Pondicherry. He was 78 years old. The Aurobindo Ashram and the entire town was in gloom on account of the passing away of the sage. He had been indifferent health keeping for the past fortnight, but the end was sudden and quite unexpected. Sri Aurobindo gave his last darshan to his disciples and devotees on November 24-the day he went in complete spiritual retirement. Thousands of Pondicherry citizens, young and old, besides the ashramites have been standing in long queues in front of the Ashram to have the last darshan of the sage. His body is lying in state on a cot in the same room in the first floor of the Ashram where he expired and where he had been in retirement since 1927. All activities of the Ashram have been suspended for 12 days and educational institutions in Pondicherry were closed for the day in his memory. Sri Aurobindo s body lay in state, and by 6 p.m. rnore than 60.000 people had filed past it in queues in absolute silence. A few attendants of Sri Aurobindo were squatting with their heads bent in the room where the body was lying in state. A painting of Buddha from Ajanta adorned the eastern walls of the room which was strewn with flowers. The body of the sage was clad in white silk and was lying in a cushion covered with a spotless white sheet spread over a wooden cot. His serene appearance suggested more of one in sleep than in death. A remarkable feature was the peace and calm prevailing in the Ashram. Among those who paid their homage to Sri Aurobindo today were India's Consul-General in Pondicherry, French India Ministers, French Indian officials and Aurobindo’s devotees from Madras and other parts of India. An Ashram spokesman said that Aurobindr had an attack of uraemia. The funeral will take place on Wednesday. His body will be placed in a coffin at 12 noon and will be interred in the main courtyard of the Ashram at 5 p.m. The Congress Working Committee at its meeting in Delhi yesterday adopted a condolence resolution on Sri Aurobindo’s death. The resolution described him as a pioneer in the struggle for India’s freedom and one of the greatest thinkers of the country.WHO can write about a man whose life has been more a communion with God than with man? "No one," Sri Aurobindo once wrote to his devoted disciple, Dilip Kumar, "can write about my life because it has not been on the surface for man to see." And yet one must .gather together the little bits of information available about him, and read the heart-beats of the great spirit in them. Parentage In the district of Hooghly-that cradle of Indian renaissance, and the birthplace of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Ramakrishna-was born, in a reputed Ghosh family of Konnager, Sri Krishnadhan, the father of Sri Aurobindo. While still a medico in Calcutta he married Swaralata of a noted Brahmo family. Krishnadhan went to England and returned an M.D., full of honours and plans for the future. A confirmed Westerner now, he wished India could transform herself overnight into another England. But "though perilously poised on the bleak slopes of agnosticism his innate humanity was as potent as ever." Refusing to perform penance for going abroad in contravention of the caste rules, he sold his property for a song and left Konnagar for good, moving from place to place as Government Civil Surgeon. Being, however, also a great admirer of Bankim, he was popular with Bengali society no less than with European. Childhood Aurobindo was born at about 5 a.m. in Calcutta on August 15. 1872. The completely Westernized Dr Krishnadhan sent five-year-old Aurobindo along with his two elder brothers to the Loretto Convent School at Darjeeling. Here in the shadow of the snow-capped Himalayas he was brought up. But for his two brothers, the rest of the students were all English. Aurobindo passed the brief period of his life here somewhat like a “careless beam." Two years later, the fond parents took Aurobindo and his two brothers to England and entrusted them to the Drewetts in Manchester, in order to keep them away from "oriental ways and ideas." The Drewetts grounded him well in Latin. In their garden he played cricket, though quite badly. In 1885, when the Drewetts left for Australia, Aurobindo was put to St. Paul s. London. The head-master impressed by the boy's intelligence and character, taught him Greek and then promoted him to a higher class in the school. Here he spent much of his time reading English poetry, French literature and European History. In 1880, having acquired proficiency in the classics, he proceeded to King's College. Cambridge, with a Senior Classical Scholarship. Here he was able to win all the prizes in one year for Greek and Latin verse, and passed the first part of the Classical Tripos examination in first class. He, however, did not care to apply for the B.A. degree. Aurobindo's early adventures in English verse had a Keatsian ring. The result, however, is '' invariably good verse and not seldom true poetry." In 1890, he passed the I.C.S. examination, scoring record marks in Greek and Latin. But he asked himself: "Is service to be the be-all and end-all of my life?" It helped him to get himself disqualified for riding. While at Cambridge, he made himself familiar with some other continental languages too. During the 14 years of his stay in England, he had been divorced from the culture of India. He, however, wanted a suitable job. James Cotton introduced him to the Maharaja of Baroda who drafted him into the Baroda State service. He left England with no regrets. Baroda was to be a stepping stone to the wider Indian scene. So he bade adieu to Europe and to her many-chamber culture and thought. Home-Return Before he arrived in India, the stout hearted Krishnadhan di ed of heart-failure on receiving wrong news of the ship-wreck of the steamer carrying Aurobindo home. The afflicted son proceeded to Baroda. He was appointed first in the Revenue and Stamps Department. Later, he became Vice-Principal of the Baroda College. Occasionally the Maharaja would send for him for writing for him important letters or for drafting his speeches. During the Maharaja’s Kashmir tour Aurobindo acted as his Private Secretary, though he was hardly an ideal servant for an Indian prince. In the earlier years of his stay in Baroda, he was not attracted to Metaphysics. He found the disputes of dialectical ratiocination "too abstract, abstruse and inconclusive." Only such philosophical ideas as could be made dynamic for purposes of life, interested him. He was initiated in spirituality by the sayings and writings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. But he would not practise Yoga. While still in England, he had some spiritual experiences. In India their frequency and intensity grew. But still he did not take to Yoga. It seemed to him a retreat from life. After marriage with Mrinalini Dev, he seemed to have settled down to normal householder’s life. He read incessantly, he pondered over what he read, and he often spent the live-long hours writing poems and essays which bore the mark of future distinction. His students (amongst them Mr K. M. Munshi) admired and loved him. All was not well with the younger generation. The state of affairs made him thoughtful-and sad. Reviewing the political situation in the country, he contributed a series of articles to Indu Prakash under the challenging caption. "New Lamps for Old." ....He felt that while our civilians were "badly educated hyena, devoid of culture, in instruction poor.......unmanly, uncultivated, unintelligent.' we as a nation were laying ' the foundations of social collapse like the British and of political incompetence like the French." Regretting that the Congress was swearing by false gods of British make, he declared: "The walls of Anglo-Indian Jericho stand yet without a breach and the dark spectacle of penury draws her robe over the land in greater volume and with an anger sweep.'......With a rare foresight and proper understanding of the Indian problem he felt it futile to appeal to the sense of justice of the British. For "our actual enemy is not any force exterior to ourselves, but our own crying weakness, our cowardice, our purblind sentimentalism." He would, therefore, appeal only to our reviving sense of manhood, to our own sincere fellow-feeling with the silent and suffering people of India.All this was too much for the stalwarts of the der. Even the great ranade warned the proprietor of Indu Prakas against the possibility of prosecution for sedition. Aurooindo withdrew into his own solitary cell, and decided to come out only at a more opportune time Light Through Yoga Sri Aurobindo was fast re-Indianizing himself. He was already a convinced follower of the Sanatan Dbarm. On the occasion of his wedding he observed the age-old Vedic rites. Hi decided to seek Light through Yoga. With Teufelsdrockh he realised that "Thought without reverence is barren, perhaps po sonous " He learnt Gujrati, Marathi, Bengali and Sanskrit. Sanskrit and Bengal literature simply thrilled him. Of Macihusudan's poetry be wrote: No human hands such notes ambrosial movedRather the god was voiceful in their birth And of his hero Bankim, he wrote: Thus moving in these iron times and drear Barren of bliss and robbed of golden cheerHe sowed the desert with ruddy-hearted roseThe sweetest voice that ever spoke m proseIn The Haunts Of Muses His Bengali and Sanskrit studies enabled him to revel in the raptures of Chandidas, Bhartrihari and Kalidas. His translations of the numerous works of these ancient Masters are "finished exercises in verse " and acquired a new name m the realm of English letters. During years of political activity he wrote two deeply patriotic poems inspired by his growing philosophical preoccupations. ' Baji Probhu and (Word unreadable) are " historic in content but patriotic in tone, spirit and object.’What is truly remarkable in all these ems of Sri Aurobindo is "their amazingly flawless metrical craftsmanship." Pauses To Ponder The question of how man should conduct himself on the "scaffold of life" agitated his mind. The spectacle of India, "drunk with the wine of Western civilization," and painfully writhing under the new dispensation, saddened his sweet soul. Strange aspirations shook his being. He must spend the greater part of his earnings on Dharmakarya. He must see God. Mother India which mental, moral and spiritual force-Brahma Teja. Curzon in 1905 provided hint the occasion. He took indefinite leave and left for Calcutta to help the students who had boycotted Government educational institutions. The Bengal leaders founded the Bengal National College. On just one-fifth of the salary he was drawing at Baroda, he became the Principal of the College. With Bankim and Tagore shining resplendent in the firmament, a new vision of rejuvenated India captivated the hearts of young and old alike. Anonymously, Aurobindo began to contribute to Bande Mataram, which soon became the spearhead of the nationalist movement in Bengal. "From the tutor of a few youths" he became "the teacher of a whole nation." He breathed "into the sinister spectre of anarchy, the vitalizing influence of religion," wrote the Earl of Ronaldshay.  The Bande Matarom rocked Bengal. There was an outcry against it. He received information of a warrant of arrest against him. He surrendered himself to the police, but the Government dared not try him for sedition. Even the charge of violating the copyright of some paper failed. And the crestfallen Government, to cover up its defeat, sentenced a poor, illiterate printer to jail. Meanwhile, the puzzle had been solved. The nation soon learned about the authorship of the articles that had roused it so much. Even while he was on trial, distant Punjab and Maharashtra bowed their heads in reverence to " the great Redeemer." Through Alipore Crucible When in a stray bomb-throwing incident in Alipore an English lady was injured, the Government, which had been lying in wait for suitable opportunity, pounced upon Aurobindo as the moving spirit of the whole terrorist Bengal. Though the outrage was denounced in the Bande Materam as having " no sanction in our ancient tradition and culture......," he was charged with having waged war against the King. A whole nation stirred itself to defend him. It was then that the poet-patriot Das came forward to toil and sweat to save " the poet of patriotism, the prophet of nationalism and the lover of humanity " He predicted to the judge: " Long after he is dead and gone, his words will be echoed and re-echoed, not only in India, but across distant seas and lands......." For full one year the Alipore case dragged on. In jail Aurobindo experienced a spiritual rapture. In that solitary cell, 45 square feet wide, he sensed " the splendours of the Infinite." and learned to lose himself in the " vasts of God." In jail came the light. He said, ' World-existence is the ecstatic dance of Shiva which multiplies the body of the God numberlessly to the view." He now baffled "the Everlasting No and affirmed the Everlasting Yes" he had ceased to be a " traveller between life and death." and become instead "a Pilgrim of Eternity." Keeps The Torch Burning Though he was acquitted the repressive policy of the government continued in full blast. And Aurobindo reflected “That policy did not work out brilliantly in Russia and did to: save Russia from a Durna, the very thing that the Trepoffs and the rest of the ‘offs’ deprecated and detested." In his view " Repression is nothing but the hammer of God that is beating us into shape so that we any be moulded in to a mighty nation and an Instrument of His Work in the world., ..Without suffering there can be no growth ' And he asserted: - Our object, our claim is that we shall not perish as a nation but live as a nation. Are authority that goes against this object will be broken into pieces ." A new awakening came to him. He felt that mere politics need no longer hold him from the pursuits of the spirit. And so be penned his " Open better to My Countrymen." This he characterized as his "last will and testament to his countrymen." The wave of terrorism was fast rising. He suspended his political activities. The country was not yet ripe for struggle. For the vital fountains of its life was dried up. The country must therefore wait for the man who is to come to move forward triumphantly.The Ascent Into The EmpyreanQuietly he went to Chandernagore and as that was too near Calcutta, he later moved to Pondicherry. Where he sat became a temple and soon he found an ashram grow around him.The unimaginative and unchaivalrous government charged him with sedition on the ground of the the objectionable nature of his 'Open Letter" penned eight months earlier. The High Court, however, held that it was not seditious. Unmoved through all this storm he lived here the even tenor of the sadhak's life ' The Arya" The Ashrama started the Arya, an English journal under the able and devout management of the “mother”  and Paul Richard to make a systematic study of the highest problems of life and form a vast synthesis of knowledge. The journal w-as named "Arya " not out of a sense of superiority of his own race but because  “Arya means an effort or an uprising. The Arya is he who strives.... Self-perfection is the aim of his self conquest. " And the completed Arya." Although consenting here to a mortal body He is the undying; limit and bond he knows not; For him the aeons are a playground.Life and its deeds are his splendid shadows." It was in The Arya that the most significant works of Aurobindo appeared serially-" A Defence of Indian Culture," " The Renaissance in India," " Isha Opanshid," " The Secret of the Vedas," " Essays on Gita," " The Life Divine," " The Synthesis of Yoga." and "'the Psychology of Social Development," When C. R Das invited him back to politics. Aurobindo said: " Man can never get out of the futile circle the race is always treading, until he has raised himself on to a new foundation.. . . . The true basis of work and life is the spiritual. I am determined not to work in the external world till I have the sure and complete possession of this new power of action not to build except on a perfect foundation....I may also say that I did not leave polities because li felt I could not do anything any more there. Such an idea was very far from me. I came away because I got a very I distinct adesh in the matter. I have cut connection entirely with politis.” To those who regretted his loss to politics he answered: “as imperative and take precedence over all other claims, intellectual, ethical, social that belong to the domain of ignorance....Nothing can be sufficient substitute for the spiritual change that can realize the true and integral good because through the spirit we come to the root of action and existence." In a similar vein he wrote to Romain Rolland: “India possesses in her past, a little rusty and out of use, the key to the progress of humanity. It is to this that I am turning my energies, rather than towards mediocre politics. I believe in the necessity of Tapasya, in silence for education and self-knowledge and for unloosing of spiritual energies." The Rishi Sri Aurobindo travelled far afield indeed, but only along the same road, and always towards the same goal. The urge towards self-revelation and self-fulfilment had taken him progressively from literature to nationalism, dharma and spiritual self-evolution. Rightly did Romain Rolland describe him as “ the completest synthesis that has been realized to this day of the genius of Asia and the genius of Europe." Rabindranath Tagore's testimony ran thus: " At the very first sight I could realize that he had been seeking for the soul and had gained it, and through this long process of realization had accumulated within him a silent power of inspiration....I felt that the utterance of the ancient Hindu Rishi spoke from him of that equanimity which gives the human soul its freedom of entrance into the All." GOVT. OFFICES CLOSED The West Bengal Government in a Press note has expressed its deep regret at the sad news -af the passing away of Sri Aurobindo and as a mark of respect to the memory of the departed saint all institutions under the Government of West Bengal remained closed yesterday. This has the concurrence of the High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-december-6-1950-sri-aurobindo-ghosh-passes-101638727805457.html
05-12-2021||India||Port town of Paradip sees cloudburst as Cyclone Jawad brushes Odisha coast||Slums in the port town of Paradip in Odisha’s Jagatsinghpur district on Monday saw waterlogging for hours together as a cloudburst almost threatened to inundate the town totally after the depression over the Bay of Bengal moved closer to the Odisha coast on Sunday afternoon.Cyclonic storm Jawad which threatened to hit the Odisha coast at Puri, weakened to a depression on Sunday afternoon before approaching the coast, but did not make landfall. Originally estimated to bring wind blowing at 90-100 kmph, the actual wind speed was less than half of it by Sunday afternoon. It then moved north-eastwards with a speed of 25 kmph and lay centred about 30 km southeast of Paradip over northwest Bay of Bengal by 5.30 pm. Moving in a north-north-eastwards direction, it will weaken further by Sunday midnight along the West Bengal coast.Though the system weakened, it led to a sudden downpour in Paradip. IMD officials said Paradip saw 109 mm of rain between 2.30 pm and 3,30 pm after the associated cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal led to intense rainfall triggered by huge difference of wind shear between upper and lower level of the atmosphere.“The clouds took a tornadic structure due to the atmospheric system. Nowhere in Odisha has cloudburst occurred in the last 5 years,” said Uma Shankar Das, senior scientist at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar. The city witnessed a total of 201 mm of rainfall since 8.30 am on Sunday, the highest in Odisha. A social media user from Paradip said the town suddenly became dark. “The town became almost dark like night. Heavy downpour...” tweeted a person from Paradip.Cloudbursts are short-duration, intense rainfall events over a small area and as per IMD when the amount of rainfall in a particular region exceeds 100 millimetres per hour, it is called cloudburst. As per IMD, only 30 such incidents have been recorded in India between 1970 and 2016. Cloudbursts generally occur in mountainous and desert regions, but are also experienced over continental landmasses due to strong vertical velocity with a continuous flow of moisture from nearby water bodies.Paradip Port Trust officials said no damage was caused to the port infrastructure and cleaning of choked drains is going on. Trees and branches have been cleared from the roads to make way for traffic, said a port official. There was no report of any casualties from the town due to the cloudburst.Coastal regions experienced heavy rainfall during the last 24 hours. According to the IMD, the highest amount of rainfall of 158 mm was recorded in Khallikote in Ganjam district during the last 24 hours (till 8:30 am Sunday). Similarly, 107.5 mm rainfall was reported from Nayagarh and 86 mm in Chhatrapur.Director, Bhubaneswar Meteorological Centre, HR Biswas said the rainfall activity will continue in Odisha during the next 24 hours as the deep depression moved along the Odisha coast. “The squally weather will continue with gusty winds along the coastal region. So, the warning for fishermen and Port warning will remain in force till Monday. There are chances that some flights from and to Bhubaneswar might be regulated depending on the impact on visibility due to heavy rains,” Biswas said.In West Bengal, the state government stopped ferry services on the Hooghly River and urged tourists not to visit seaside resorts, as rain lashed Kolkata and other southern parts of the state on Sunday. “With the system likely to move north-north-eastwards along the Odisha coast towards West Bengal and develop into a well-marked low pressure area, light to moderate rainfall has begun in Kolkata, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas, and Purba and Paschim Medinipur districts,” an official said.Heavy rain will occur in some isolated parts of south Bengal, including coastal areas of South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur districts, and parts of Purba Bardhhaman, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/port-town-of-paradip-sees-cloudburst-as-cyclone-jawad-brushes-odisha-coast-101638722734286.html
05-12-2021||India||Nagaland civilian deaths: Govt forms SIT to probe firing||The Nagaland government on Sunday formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the firing incident that took place on Saturday evening in Mon district leaving 13 civilians and jawan dead. An order in this regard was issued by the state home department and signed by chief secretary J Alam. The five-member SIT will be headed by inspector general of police, Nagaland, officials said.Tension continued to prevail in the area over three consecutive incidents of firing, the first of which was possibly a case of mistaken identity.Preliminary reports suggested the first firing led to the death of six civilians that occurred when the Army personnel mistook coal mine workers returning home in a pick-up van singing songs on Saturday evening, to be insurgents belonging to the Yung Aung faction of the banned outfit NSCN (K), about whose movements they had been tipped off.Also read | Nagaland civilian killings: After Rahul Gandhi, Mamata tweets about justiceAs workers failed to reach their homes, local youth and villagers went in search of them and surrounded the army vehicles.In the ensuing melee, a soldier was killed and Army vehicles were burnt down. Soldiers who fired in self-defence killed another seven civilians, said police officers.Rioting spilled over into Sunday afternoon when mobs vandalised the offices of the Konyak Union and an Assam Rifles camp in the area, setting fire to parts of the camp.At least one more person was killed and another two injured, as security forces fired back at attackers. The mob has been demanding immediate action against security force personnel involved in the firing.The Nagaland government through a notification has banned mobile, internet and data services as well as bulk SMS in the district to curb "circulation of inflammatory videos, pictures or text".Videos of a mob vandalising the Konyak Union office in Mon and the Assam Rifles camp are however circulating on social media despite the ban on internet services in the district.Chief minister Neiphiu Rio who rushed back from Delhi on Sunday will visit the affected district on Monday. Police said the post-mortem of those killed is being conducted in Mon and feared that the number of fatalities may increase as at least two of those injured were critical and had to be evacuated to hospitals in Assam while the rest were being treated in Nagaland.Ordering a Court of Inquiry into the incident, the Army said one of its personnel was killed and several others were seriously injured. It said the incident and its aftermath is "deeply regretted" and the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated at the highest level.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-civilian-deaths-govt-forms-sit-to-probe-firing-101638720973999.html

05-12-2021||India||ED summons 4 Bengal businessmen held earlier by CBI in coal smuggling case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned to Delhi the four businessmen who were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) two months ago in the Bengal coal smuggling case, officials aware of the development said. The suspects, Joydeb Mondal, Narayan Nanda, Nirad Mondal and Gurupada Majhi were arrested on September 27 from West Burdwan and Bankura districts. They were recently released on bail from judicial custody. Although the ED had earlier arrested three people, including a state police inspector, the CBI, which is conducting a parallel investigation, did not arrest anyone in the coal smuggling case before September 27, almost ten months after starting the probe. ED officials said the four have been asked to appear for questioning at the agency’s office in Delhi next week. The CBI suspects that they ran the operation on behalf of Anup Majhi alias Lala, the racket’s alleged kingpin named in the first information report (FIR) the agency registered in November 2020. Majhi, was however, granted immunity from arrest by the Supreme Court. He has appealed for extension of the court order. According to the CBI, illegally mined coal worth several thousand crores of rupees have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) runs a number of mines. “The four businessmen are suspected to have played a crucial role in transporting this coal to different parts of Bengal as well as adjacent states. They allegedly sent the sale proceeds to some influential people,” an ED official said on condition of anonymity. A senior West Bengal police officer, who did not want to be identified, said that among the four, Joydep Mondal was held on multiple charges even during the Left Front regime that ended when the Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power in 2011. The CBI and ED have questioned some Indian Police Service (IPS) officers posted in Bengal as well as a number of ECL officials. The ED summoned IPS officers, Shyam Singh, Gyanwant Singh and S Selvamurugan to Delhi in September. The coal smuggling case is a raging political issue in Bengal. On September 6, TMC national general secretary and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, was questioned by the ED in Delhi for almost nine hours. He was summoned for the second time on September 8 but Banerjee told the agency that he was unable to travel from Kolkata at such short notice. He was subsequently summoned on September 21. Before summoning Banerjee, the ED wanted to question his wife, Rujira Banerjee, in the first week of September. She however did not go to the ED’s office in Delhi saying travelling during the Covid pandemic would be risky for a mother of two infants. Rujira Banerjee was first questioned by the CBI in February. The CBI team visited Abhishek Banerjee’s residence. In March, the CBI also questioned Rujira’s sister Maneka Gambhir and the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and father-in-law Pawan Arora. Among the prime suspects in this case is former TMC youth front general secretary and businessman Vinay Mishra who renounced his Indian citizenship in December and became a citizen of Vanuatu, a small island country in the southwest Pacific. The agencies have sealed his assets in Kolkata and arrested his brother, Vikash. Incidentally, Abhishek Banerjee, a Lok Sabha member, will also be in Delhi next week to hold a meeting with the TMC’s Parliament members. Before facing the ED on September 6, Banerjee threw a challenge at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying using probe agencies against TMC leaders will not help the saffron camp gain any political ground in Bengal. “TMC will never bow before you (BJP). Do whatever you can. If the ED has any evidence against me, make it public. If anybody can prove that I have accepted even ten paisa from anyone I will voluntarily walk to the gallows and hang myself,” Banerjee had said before reaching the ED office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-summons-4-bengal-businessmen-held-earlier-by-cbi-in-coal-smuggling-case-101638718293796.html

The union government also sent another letter to the state asking it to ramp up its containment strategies. With this, samples of five persons were sent to the NIV to rule out the possibility of the new variant, a senior health ministry official said. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan sent another letter to the state on Saturday asking it to take strict measures to contain high caseload and death rate. In the letter, he pointed out that 13 out of 14 districts in the state still report a high quantum of cases.In the letter addressed to state health secretary Rajan Khobragade, Bhushan said in four districts (Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kozhikode and Thrissur) the average test positivity rate was more than 10 per cent. He reiterated the need for better compliance with the test, track and treat measures to bring down the infection rate.On Sunday, the state reported 4450 cases and 23 deaths but 138 backlog deaths were added to the bulging list as the death toll rose to 41,600, according to the state health ministry. In fatality rate, Kerala is second after Maharashtra now. The state has administered the first dose of vaccine to 96.5 per cent of the eligible population and the second dose to 67.6 per cent, it said.The low death rate has been one of the USPs of Kerala during the pandemic and its leaders often boasted of it but mounting addition of backlog dented its tall claims, statistics show. In the last two months, at least 5000 backlog cases - deaths that took place between March 2020 and June 2021 - were added to the fatality list. Many public health experts and opposition parties alleged that the government was not transparent with its data but the latter said technical issues led to the omission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russian-traveller-tests-positive-for-covid-19-in-kerala-samples-sent-to-niv-101638717335024.html

These have a combined valuation in excess of ₹1,400 crore, based on investment raised by these startups from angel investors or venture capital firms.According to data shared by the IIT Madras Incubation Cell (IITMIC), the number of faculty-founded startups rose sharply from 37 in April 2017 to 69 in June 2019 and 80 in 2020 before touching 94 by October 2021. These startups were incubated by the IIT Madras Incubation Cell, one of India's leading deep technology startup hub.As many as 77 faculty members from various departments of the institute were involved in setting up startups. This figure is nearly 13 per cent of the total institute faculty strength of around 600, which is considered on par with the best universities in the world, the IITMIC claimed.A startup is aiming to make a new breed of aircraft called hybrid aerial vehicles for vertical takeoff and landing as well as long-distance flight to carry goods and passengers, ultimately leading to air taxi operations.Another working on mini launch vehicles to launch micro- and nano-satellites into space orbits.A startup aiming to produce micro gas turbines for decentralized power generation and another aiming to convert any kind of waste -- from municipal solid waste to agri waste -- into crude oil are among the notable ones.Another enterprise aims to make earth observation satellites with multi-sensor fusion and edge-computing in space.Tamaswati Ghosh, Chief Executive Officer, IIT Madras Incubation Cell, said, "over 12 per cent of institute faculty are co-founders in our incubated startups working across a breadth of globally critical domains. This underlines our ability to translate cutting-edge scientific innovations to the field."The highest numbers of associated startups or spin-outs are from the Departments of Electrical, Mechanical and Civil Engineering, followed by Aeronautics and Applied Mechanics."Several faculty members are involved in more than one startup either as a founder or mentor," Ghosh said.These startups work primarily in deep technology areas, ranging from manufacturing, robotics, energy and renewables, e-mobility, space tech, Internet of Things, data sciences, biotechnology, healthcare, water treatment, waste to energy and waste management, and e-mobility, electric Vehicles, among other areas."Setting up a deep tech startup is a hard task, and the gestation time from idea to reaching the market can be as much as 4-5 years. Even getting from the Lab (post research stage) to an incubator can take 2-3 years. There is a 'valley of death' that a startup faces between the lab and the incubator and first investor. Most academicians find it difficult to make the jump from the lab to the incubator," said Raghuttama Rao, Chief Executive Officer, Gopalakrishnan-Deshpande Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (GDC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iitmadras-faculty-founded-at-least-94-startups-valued-at-rs-1-400-crore-report-101638716391816.html

Hence, vaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease and, vaccination with the available vaccines is crucial. If eligible, but not vaccinated, one should get vaccinated," the ministry said in a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs).It is important to highlight that Omicron has been declared ‘variant of concern’ (VoC) based on the observed mutations, their predicted features of increased transmission and immune evasion, and preliminary evidence of detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, such as increased reinfections.The definitive evidence for increased remission and immune evasion is awaited, according to the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ntagi-to-consider-giving-additional-dose-of-covid-vaccine-to-immunocompromised-101638715862868.html

No one was, however, explicitly named by the AIADMK in its pledge, that was read out by Panneerselvam, while others followed him. The AIADMK is a fortress that cannot be shaken by anyone, howsoever mighty and vowed to be united and protect the party, it said. The pledge event led by Sasikala at the memorial exhorted cadres to rally behind her and get united under her leadership so that the AIADMK could capture power again in the state. The oath, that was read out, hailed Sasikala as the AIADMK's "general secretary, the revolutionary mother, Chinnamma (younger mother)," and underscored that it was essential to join hands for the party to win future elections and trounce political opponents. To usher in the AIADMK regime, "let us join hands under her leadership and let us emerge victorious." The pledge ceremony, presided by AMMK general secretary Dhinakaran, apparently targeted the AIADMK leadership. The AMMK pledge said the 'selfishness' of a few people, has caused the movement, a reference to the AIADMK, losing its uniqueness and identity as well and vowed to retrieve the parent party through the 'democratic weapon' which is the outfit run by him. The 'selfishness' jibe is obviously aimed at Panneerselvam and Palaniswami and their supporters, though they were not named. The Dhinakaran led outfit also slammed the DMK as an 'evil force' and accused it of double standards in many issues including the Mullaiperiyar and NEET. The AMMK said it is marching ahead under the leadership of Dhinakaran with the wishes of 'Thiyaga Thalaivi (Leader of sacrifices) Chinnamma.' Jayalalithaa is hailed as Amma by her followers. The pledge taking ceremony by both the AIADMK and Dhinkaran-led outfit on the Jayalalithaa memorial premises targeted the ruling DMK. While the AIADMK alleged that the DMK won the recent rural civic polls through 'several conspiracies' and 'power,' the principal opposition also hit out at the TN's ruling party for trying to overwhelm them by foisting many false cases. Hailing the previous AIADMK governments steered by Jayalalithaa for its several initiatives, it slammed the DMK government for 'family rule' and vowed to "tear up the web of conspiracy to destroy the party." At Jayalalithaa's mausoleum, which is part of a larger, state of the art phoenix model memorial dedicated to the former Chief Minister's memory on the Marina beachfront, Pannneerselvam, Palaniswami and other AIADMK leaders, many of them in black shirts, were the first to lay wreaths and pay homage followed by Sasikala, Dhinakaran and a string of others. Sasikala looked teary when she placed the wreath while her supporters hailed her as 'Chinnamma.' Besides leaders, many ordinary workers, many of them women could be spotted at the memorial site. Jayalalithaa died on December 5, 2016. On the anniversary occasion, AIADMK workers paid floral tributes to her portraits across Tamil Nadu and distributed welfare assistance to beneficiaries and some organised community meal programmes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tussle-over-aiadmk-leadership-mars-jaya-s-death-anniversary-event-101638713502278.html

And Channi sahib declared it as legal, whereas the one visited by Raghav is a different site and is illegal. How can a CM be sooo blatant?” the AAP’s national convenor tweeted. Is it true that Channi sahib went to a different mining site today n not the one visited by Raghav yesterday? And Channi sahib declared it as legal, whereas the one visited by Raghav is a different site and is illegal. How can a CM be sooo blatant?Kejriwal’s tweet came after the Punjab chief minister, earlier in the day, visited a mining site at the Sutlej River bed. Speaking to the media, the Congress leader declared that the Kejriwal-led party’s allegations were a ‘bundle of lies,’ adding that all the work at different sites was being done as per the norms.On Saturday, Chadha made a surprise visit to Jindapur village in Channi’s assembly constituency, Chamkaur Sahib, and alleged that the ruling party was ‘patronising’ the sand mafia. “After becoming CM, Channi said that the sand mafia should not come to him and that he was not the chief minister of the sand mafia. However, now, they are running their business under his protection and that too in his area,” the AAP leader said.Ahead of Punjab assembly elections, which are likely to take place early next year, a war of words has erupted between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party. In 2017, the latter regained power by winning 77 seats in the 117-member assembly, the latter finished as the second-largest party despite only being formed in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-arvind-kejriwal-questions-charanjit-channi-on-visit-to-mining-site-101638713165184.html

The more they will interact with people, the more effective and meaningful their recommendations will be,” read the release issued by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.The Lok Sabha Speaker also suggested a committee of chairpersons for PAC who will hold comprehensive discussions on the working. The reports made by this committee could be discussed amongst the presiding officers for successful implementation. During these contemporary times, he also called for more use of information technology to ensure transparency in governance.Parliamentary committees have contributed significantly in making the government accountable and transparent to the people, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said. “In a developing country like India, the constructive suggestions of PAC not only promoted the optimal use of financial resources, but also helped in improving the policies and programs of the government,” Birla added.He also hailed the tradition of non-partisan functioning of PACs, which should work as a collective endeavour towards the public.

He said that in a globalised world it is vital to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded commerce are respected.“The consequences of China’s growing capabilities are particularly profound because of the extrapolation of its domestic seamlessness to the world outside. As a result, whether it is connectivity, technology or trade, there is now an ongoing debate on the changed nature of power and influence,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“We have also seen a sharpening of tensions on territorial issues across the breadth of Asia. Agreements and understandings of yesteryears now seem to have some question marks. Time will, of course, provide answers,” he further added. Earlier this week at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Jaishankar also highlighted a similar point with reference to the 2020 border clashes between Indian and Chinese forces at Eastern Ladakh. The Union minister said that two agreements with China which were not ambiguous stand violated despite the facts that the terms were laid out in ‘cold print’.“There were very, very clear-cut commitments not to mass forces on the border and those commitments stand violated as of 2020 spring,” Jaishankar said. “And as we have made clear: The state of the relationship, at the end of the day, will reflect the state of the border. You can’t have a tense, high friction border and have great relations in all other parts of life. It doesn’t work that way,” he explained further.The standoff between both forces began in June 2020 at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. At least 20 Indian soldiers and 4 Chinese troops died in the Galwan Valley clashes. The disengagements at all points have not ended and both sides have deployed at least 50,000 troops on either side of the border.Speaking of uncertainties in the Indian Ocean region, Jaishankar said that the US withdrawal from Afghanistan along with the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to uncertainties.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/territorial-tensions-sharpening-across-asia-following-china-s-rise-jaishankar-101638711828384.html

Due to the attack, his vital organs, liver, stomach and one of his kidneys, were affected. Barring one foot, every part of his body sustained severe injuries. His spinal cord was also broken at three different points.Earlier on Friday, the supporters of hardline Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) attacked a garment factory and lynched general manager of Rajko Industries Diyawadana and set his body on fire. Several among the irate mob also clicked selfies with them and videos shared on social media also showed some of the accused speaking to news channels even describing how they went about the killing. HT could not identify the veracity of these videos.Reports say that Diyawadana, who was in his 40s, opposed Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) stickers which bore Islamic verses and tore one of those and threw them in the dustbin. “A mob of over 800 men gathered at the factory at 10 am Friday on reports that Kumara had torn a sticker/poster (inscribed with Islamic verses) and committed blasphemy. They looked out for him and found him (from the rooftop). They dragged him, beat him severely and by 11.28 am he was dead and the body was set on fire by the violent mob,” inspector general of police of Punjab province Rao Sardar Ali Khan was quoted as saying by Geo News.Several video footage emerged where two people on separate occasions tried to save Diyawadana from the mob. One person was seen trying to save Diyawadana while the mob thrashed him. According to news agencies, he bore the brunt of the beating for a while but gave up after he could not tolerate the severity. Later another person pleaded to not set the dead body on fire but the mob tossed him aside.Diyawadana’s body will be sent to Lahore and handed over to the Sri Lankan consulate. The body will be sent to Sri Lanka via a special flight after completion of all legal formalities.The incident has seen widespread condemnation from Pakistan’s civil society with many accusing the government of being lackadaisical towards the TLP. Civilians protested in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore following the gruesome death with many concerned that the incident will bring international shame to the nation.The Imran Khan-led government, which is at loggerheads with the hardline Islamist group, gave in to its demands and removed it from a list of proscribed outfits. Pakistan earlier freed 2,000 extremists of the TLP in the last two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-bones-broken-99-body-charred-post-mortem-report-of-lynched-lankan-reveals-gruesome-details-101638705372771.html

Based in Mumbai, the Missile Vessel Squadron has participated in the Operation Vijay, Operation Parakram and most recently, during the heightened security state following the Pulwama attack, it was deployed within striking distance off the Pakistan coast. "The ships in this squadron have the ability to move swiftly and are missile-ready. Their deployment also acts as a deterrent,” said an official posted in the squadron. The Indian Navy was awarded the President's Colours on May 27, 1951 by the then President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad. The President's Standard is the same honour as the President's Colours, awarded to a relatively smaller military formation or unit, the Navy said in a statement. The 22nd Missile Vessel Squadron was formally established in Mumbai in October 1991 with 10 Veer Class and three Prabal Class missile boats. But, the genesis of the 'Killers' dates back to 1969, with the induction of OSA I Class missile boats from the erstwhile USSR to bolster the Indian Navy's strength, the official said. These missile boats were transported to India on heavy lift merchant ships and commissioned in early 1971 in Kolkata. They were deployed on a crucial mission in the very first year, during the Indo-Pak war in 1971 and they played a decisive role in its outcome, he said. On the intervening night of December 4-5, 1971, the youngest warriors of a young Indian Navy drew first blood when they launched a devastating offensive on the Pakistan Navy. Indian Navy ships Nirghat, Nipat and Veer fired their Styx missiles and sank Pakistan Navy ships Khyber and Muhafiz, the official said. Codenamed Op Trident, this operation is considered to be one of the most successful operations in modern naval history, with no casualties being sustained by the Indian forces, he said. The Indian Navy carried out another daring attack on the intervening night of December 8-9, when INS Vinash, along with two frigates, launched four Styx missiles, sinking the Pakistan naval fleet tanker Dacca and inflicting substantial damage to Keamari oil storage facility in Karachi. “There were no damages reported to the Indian forces. It is because of these heroic deeds of the ships and men of the squadron that they earned the title of 'Killers' and the Indian Navy celebrates December 4 as the Navy Day,” the official said. The squadron personnel have been awarded battle honours, including one Maha Vir Chakra, seven Vir Chakras and eight Nausena Medals (Gallantry), which are testimony to the gallant spirit of the 'Killers', the Navy said. The year 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of India's victory in the 1971 war and is being celebrated across the country as 'Swarnim Vijay Varsh'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-squadron-that-sunk-pak-warships-in-1971-war-to-get-rare-honour-101638697953951.html

Chaturvedi was among the MPs who were suspended from the house on the first day of the winter session which began on November 29 for “unruly behaviour” during the previous monsoon session. The other lawmakers who are suspended include Chaturvedi’s party colleague Anil Desai, and those from the Congress, Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), Congress and All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC).“It is with great anguish but with a sense of responsibility and having thought through this, I wish to inform you that I would like to step down as an anchor for Sansad TV’s show Meri Kahani,” wrote Chaturvedi, in the letter addressed to vice-president and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu with copies to speaker Om Birla and the Sansad TV chief executive officer (CEO).“After my arbitrary suspension, that has totally disregarded established Parliamentary norms and rules, to stifle my voice, my party’s voice inside the chamber, I am unwilling to continue taking space on Sansad TV when my primary oath to the constitution is being denied to me,” she added.Referring to her suspension, Chaturvedi said that “I believe injustice has been done, but as it is considered valid in the eyes of the chair, I must respect it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-protest-against-suspension-of-opposition-mps-sena-mp-steps-down-as-anchor-of-sansad-tv-101638698493506.html

Shivpal finished his degree in 2004.Speaking to ANI, Shivpal said: "People used to tease me because of my height and today I am nominated for The Limca book of records and many others. Many short people are contacting me for driving training."The highly ambitious man said that he has decided to start a driving school next year for physically handicapped people.Shivpal presently works at a private firm here and says that he came to Hyderabad in 2000. "I am the eldest sibling and the only dwarf in the family," he added.Narrating his struggles with finding a job to sustain himself in the city, Shivpal said that he featured in a movie and a daily soap initially but could not sustain in the industry for long."People were not ready to offer me a job as I was handicapped. Through a friend, I got a job in a private company and now I have been working here for the past 20 years," he said."To commute, whenever I booked cabs, they used to cancel the ride. When I used to go out with my wife, people passed bad comments. That's when I decided to own a car and ride it," he added.Enthusiastic to learn to drive, Shivpal surfed the internet and found a video uploaded by a man in the US. It explained to him the modifications required in a car to lift the seat and other equipment up to his height.After getting a car modified, Shivpal learnt car driving from a friend. However, his struggles did not end here, as getting a license posed another challenge as the transport department had certain guidelines for height.Shivpal said that after appealing to the authorities, he obtained a learner's license for three months and then received a driver license after giving a proper driving test with an official sitting beside him."Everybody has some fault in them, but finding your hidden talents and achieving them is what matters," he remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gattipally-shivpal-becomes-india-s-first-dwarf-to-obtain-driving-license-101638697198644.html

There is no UPA,” Banerjee was heard telling media persons shortly after her meeting with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on December 1.ALSO READ | Shiv Sena backs off from Mamata Banerjee’s ‘no UPA’ remark, says opposition needs UPASlamming Banerjee for her comments, Baghel also demanded from her to reveal the conversations that she had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting in New Delhi ahead of Parliament's Winter Session.Questioning the rationale behind attacking the Congress, Baghel also said that if Banerjee aims to become a “big leader”, she must sharpen her sword against the BJP-led government at the Centre.Banerjee faced criticisms from several quarters for her comments. The chief of Congress' West Bengal unit, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, alleged that Banerjee was “Modi's informer” and she “wants to break and weaken” the Congress as well as the opposition parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-upa-bjp-lok-sabha-elections-2024-opposition-unity-mamata-banerjee-101638696066499.html

05-12-2021||India||New variant can arise when animals catch Covid from humans: Study||The findings of a new study suggest that when animals catch Covid-19 from humans, new SARS-CoV-2 variants can arise.To evaluate this phenomenon, an interdisciplinary team at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences systematically analysed mutation types occurring in the virus after infection of cats, dogs, ferrets, and hamsters. The study was recently published in 'PNAS', the official journal of the National Academy of Sciences.Confirmed Covid-19 cases in a variety of wild, zoo, and household animals demonstrate cross-species transmission, which is a rare occurrence for most viruses."SARS-CoV-2, in the realm of coronaviruses, has a very broad species range," said Laura Bashor, one of the first authors and a doctoral student in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology. "Generally speaking, many types of viruses can't infect other species of animals, they evolved to be very specific.""Humans have so much exposure to many different animals which permitted this virus to have the opportunity to expose a variety of different species," said Erick Gagne, a first author and now an assistant professor of wildlife disease ecology at the University of Pennsylvania.The global reach and spillover of the virus have given researchers a unique opportunity to investigate the viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2, including in University Distinguished Professor Sue VandeWoude's laboratory at Colorado State University.These specialists in disease transmission in wild and domestic cats applied their experience in sequence analysis and studying a collection of genomes to SARS-CoV-2. Researchers in the VandeWoude lab worked with Assistant Professor Angela Bosco-Lauth and Professor Dick Bowen in the Department of Biomedical Sciences, who used their animal modelling expertise to develop a test for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of animal species.Also, the key to the findings was a newer sequencing technique of the virus at different stages of the study, now common to detect variants in the human population. Mark Stenglein, associate professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, provided computational skills in analyzing biological molecule sequences, known as bioinformatics, to the study."We found there was evolution, we saw the selection on the virus, and we saw a lot of variants emerge in the genome sequence of the virus," said Bashor.To provide ample viral material for the study, Bosco-Lauth and Bowen cultivated a SARS-CoV-2 human sample in cells grown in the lab. Bashor and Gagne determined that multiple mutations developed, and became a greater percentage of the genetic population, at each step of this process.Then the virus was introduced to the four household species, and samples of the virus were collected from their nasal passages after infection."In the animals, the cell culture variants reverted back to the initial human type, which indicates that likely there is adaption occurring in that cell culture and environment that was selected for those variants," said Gagne.Not all these mutations within the cell culture SARS-CoV-2 variant transferred in the new hosts. Instead, different mutations emerged within the virus shed by the live animals.The initial viral sample in the study was isolated in early 2020. The team observed mutations that have since formed widespread SARS-CoV-2 strains in the human population at an accelerated rate throughout the study."Among those were a number that we've since seen in humans in the alpha, beta, delta variants," said Dr Sue VandeWoude, senior author. "There were specific genetic code changes that mimicked what other scientists have reported in people."Contact exposure between two cats demonstrated the SARS-CoV-2 variant can be transmitted with the possibility of producing a new strain within the species."That's what we're seeing in people too," said Bosco-Lauth. "Hosts that are really well adapted to support SARS-CoV-2 infection are also very good at allowing these mutations to stick and to be passed on."Bashor did not anticipate studying SARS-CoV-2 when she came to CSU to begin her doctoral studies during the pandemic. However, it provided a unique opportunity to hit the ground running as a graduate student on a "really cool and viable project" in disease ecology and evolution.Gagne was completing his postdoctoral research on the cross-species transmission of feline retroviruses in the VandeWoude lab when the team launched the SARS-CoV-2 study. Now an assistant professor, he has continued to investigate SARS-CoV-2 spillover with the Wildlife Futures Program at the University of Pennsylvania.Graduate students and early-career scientists like Bashor and Gagne, have made meaningful contributions to SARS-CoV-2 research, said Vande Woude.The team has continued their investigations to focus on cats, as they have shown higher susceptibility for Covid-19 spillover from humans and can produce variants of the virus and spread to other cats.Bashor began analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from a large pool of cat species all over the world, including tigers, lions and snow leopards. The publicly available data of infected cats could provide additional insights on the adaptability and mutability of Covid-19 within and among cat species.There is no evidence of transmission from cats to humans. But cats continue to be susceptible to all variants of Covid-19 in the human population.By understanding viral evolution within cats, the research team may find answers to the question: what is the future of SARS-CoV-2 for humans and animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-variant-can-arise-when-animals-catch-covid-from-humans-study-101638693898682.html

Raut however said that the AITMC was not contemplating a political foray in Maharashtra as the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were effectively standing up to the might of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).In his weekly column Rokhthok on Sunday in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, of which he is the executive editor, Raut said that Banerjee, who had visited Mumbai last week and met Shiv Sena leader and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, wanted to expand beyond her state. The party had created a footprint in Goa, Meghalaya and Tripura.“It seems that she is thinking of doing something new minus the Congress,” wrote Raut, adding that however, the AITMC chief had said that they were not eager to make a foray into Maharashtra due to the strong presence of the Shiv Sena and the NCP. Raut also slammed the Maharashtra BJP for criticising Mamata by claiming that she had come here to snatch away local industries to West Bengal. “They criticised Mamata Banerjee but did not utter a word against Gujarat chief minister who met industrialists from Maharashtra for Vibrant Gujarat summit. This is hypocrisy,” he said.The Congress is a constituent of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, which is led by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. In her visit to Mumbai, Banerjee, while speaking to the press, even questioned the existence of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which is anchored by Congress.In a cryptic comment, Raut referred to how Banerjee had given the slogan ‘Jai Bangla, Jai Maharashtra,’ during her visit, and said “this cry is a symbol of how politics will shape up in the future.” He also likened Banerjee’s visit to that of a sister who had returned home.Raut added that like Banerjee’s resounding defeat of the BJP in Bengal, a similar set of events had played out in Maharashtra (through the formation of the MVA government) to “stand up to the overarching dominance of Delhi.” The people of Maharashtra and Bengal had defeated the “power, money and the extreme suppressive use of the central investigating agencies.” Referring to the clashes between the West Bengal government and the Centre, Raut quoted Banerjee as saying that “the Marathas and the Bengalis are martial people, they will not step down…”BJP had questioned the details of the meeting between Mamata Banerjee and Maharashtra tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray at the Trident hotel. Raut said that they discussed the exchange for tourism development between two states and the CM Banerjee demanded a plot in Mumbai for the accommodation of the cancer patients visiting Tata Hospital in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-trying-for-something-new-without-congress-sena-s-sanjay-raut-101638693272404.html

"You should first solve the issues in your state before you come to Punjab to lure people there," he said.Taking potshots at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi on Twitter, the PCC chief alleged that 45 per cent of the teacher posts in government schools are vacant and 22,000 guest teachers are on daily wages.Sidhu went on to criticise the Kejriwal-led party for failing their 2015 poll promise to give contractual teachers “equal wages as permanent staff”“In your 2015 manifesto you promised 8 lakh new jobs and 20 new colleges in Delhi, where are the jobs and colleges ? You have given only 440 Jobs in Delhi. On the contrary of your failed guarantees, unemployment rate of Delhi has increased by almost 5 times in last 5 years,” he alleged.The Punjab Congress chief went on to say that in 2015 there were 12,515 job vacancies for teachers in Delhi "but in 2021 there are 19,907 job vacancies of teachers in Delhi”.Last month, Kejriwal had joined the protest of contractual teachers in Punjab's Mohali who have been pressing for several demands including regularization of services of contractual teachers.He had also promised to implement a transfer policy for teachers and assured them cashless medical treatment facilities if the party comes to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solve-issues-in-delhi-first-sidhu-hits-out-at-kejriwal-at-teachers-protest-101638690375764.html
05-12-2021||India||Weakness, body ache: Common symptoms of 5 Omicron patients in India||As South African doctors who first dealt with Omicron patients said that this variant has been producing symptoms that are different from the previous infections, the five confirmed Omicron cases in India report mild symptoms. The Tanzania returnee who became the 5th Omicron patient of India and the first confirmed case of Delhi had a sore throat, weakness and body ache, LNJP MP Dr Suresh Kumar told news agency ANI. The other international travellers who have been admitted to LNJP after testing positive are stable and majorly asymptomatic.  The previous infections, caused by Delta or other variants of the SARS-CoV-2, triggered breathing trouble, loss of taste and smell. Though Omicron is at the stage of research and not much is known about the variant, the cases reported in India and other countries indicate that the symptoms are more like common cold and nothing like Covid-19 cases, caused by other variants.The unfamiliar symptoms of Omicron were first reported by South African doctor Angelique Coetzee, chairperson of the South African Medical Association, who first alerted the South Africa government about the new variant. Scientists said this new characteristic of Omicron might be a result of its mutation. The variant might have adopted a "more human" appearance by picking up a snippet of genetic material from another virus, probably a common cold virus.The first Omicron case of India, the South African national who already left the country, was completely asymptomatic and tested negative. The Bengaluru doctor with no international travel history, the Mumbai marine engineer who was not vaccinated, the Gujarat NRI -- all Omicron patients have reported mild symptoms.While these symptoms indicate that the variant is not causing severe illness, scientists are not yet sure about its increased transmissibility. Director of Tata Institute for Genetics and Society and former Chief of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Centre For Cellular And Molecular Biology, Dr Rakesh Mishra, said people are likely to confuse this with the common cold as there is no breathing trouble or loss of smell or taste, which may increase its spread.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weakness-body-ache-common-symptoms-of-5-omicron-patients-in-india-101638692407844.html

Most of these students are asymptomatic. "We are doing random sampling at many places and found out that few students, who came from different states at a private nursing school, contracted COVID. We have sealed the hostel premises. Around 29 students have turned positive from the institution," Shivamogga deputy commissioner KB Sivakumar said.In another cluster, around 40 students of a school in Karnataka's Chikkamagaluru district have tested positive. Reports said this new cluster has been identified at Jawahar Navodaya School at Seegodu.The cluster outbreak has come at a time the state has already reported the Omicron variant of Covid, first identified in South Africa.

Locals claimed that nine villagers were also injured in the second incident of firing. The injured and the dead were shifted to Mon district headquarters. “The security forces have suffered severe injuries in the incident [villagers’ retaliatory action] including one soldier who succumbed to his injuries,” the headquarters of 3 Corps confirmed.Also Read | Nagaland civilian deaths: What we know so farNagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio announced a high level special investigation team (SIT) probe into the incident on Sunday morning. “The unfortunate incident leading to killing of civilians at Oting, Mon is highly condemnable.

05-12-2021||India||Why Omicron is likely to affect major Indian cities, ex-CSIR scientist explains||Omicron, the new variant of Covid, will primarily affect the major cities in India because people are travelling, director of Tata Institute for Genetics and Society and former Chief of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Centre For Cellular And Molecular Biology, Dr Rakesh Mishra, told news agency ANI in an exclusive interview.Dr Mishra said vaccines, including Indian vaccines, will remain effective against this variant, but the concern is the high rate of spreading. Since most Omicron cases are asymptomatic, there is a fear that the variant will be spreading faster than Delta as people will ignore this as a common cold.India detects third Omicron case. What we know so far"We have detected two and a few more and all that in the past few days, but how many are we sequencing? If we sequence 100 per cent, then you can be sure that how many people have this or not. Since we cannot sequence all, we can't even list all. Many people are believed to be asymptomatic and spreading. So that is the problem of this infection that most people 70-80 per cent will not have any symptoms when there is spreading and confusion with the common cold. Symptoms are less severe. So people will mistake it as a common cold because there is no smell loss or oxygen problem. The infection will be there in all major cities where people have been travelling…" he told ANI.India has four confirmed cases of the Omicron variant so far. Out of these cases, three have come from outside. The first Omicron case was a 66-year-old South African national who has left India after testing Covid negative. A 72-year-old NRI who has been living in Zimbabwe for many years and has now come to Gujarat's Jamnagar to meet his father-in-law has tested positive for Omicron. The 33-year-old unvaccinated marine engineer has also come from South Africa.

The state has received many international travellers in the last few days the samples of which have been sent for genome sequencing. Bypassing lockdown, the government has mandated full vaccination for many activities, like visiting malls etc.Here are new restrictions imposed in the state:1. Instead of 10 cases, a Covid cluster will be declared if there are three cases in an area.2. If an apartment has been declared a cluster, no outsider will be allowed to enter the apartment.3. Full vaccination is mandatory for parents of the students who are attending physical classes.4. Full vaccination has also been made mandatory to visit any apartment complex.5. If residential associations have to conduct meetings, they should only call people who have taken two doses of the vaccines.Karnataka has been the first state in India to have reported two confirmed Omicron cases. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the infection is believed to be fast-spreading, but the effect will not be severe. The government has already made full vaccination mandatory for visiting shopping malls, for employees working in hotels, restaurants, cinemas, swimming pools, public libraries, zoos and botanical gardens.The state has seen several Covid clusters appearing in educational institutions for which the government has urged all institutions to cancel any event as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/area-with-3-cases-cluster-jabs-must-for-parents-5-new-karnataka-omicron-rules-101638674079389.html
05-12-2021||India||After favouring booster dose for 40+, INSACOG says ‘more experiments required’||Amid the Omicron scare and a rising demand for booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, the country's top genome sequencing body on Saturday went back on its recommendation for booster shots for people above 40 years and said many more scientific experiments are required to assess its impact.In its latest health bulletin, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) said that the mention of the booster dose was merely a “discussion about the potential role of additional dose of Covid-19 vaccines in high-risk populations” and the recommendation was not for the India's immunisation programme,In its previous bulletin dated November 29, the INSACOG had said that a booster dose for those 40 years of age and over, first targeting the most high-risk / high-exposure “may be considered”."Many more scientific experiments are needed to assess the impacts of booster dose, which are being guided and monitored by National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC),” said the INSACOG.It also made it clear that the recommendations and suggestions regarding vaccines, schedule, and roll-out came under the expressed mandate of NTAGI and NEGVAC.INSACOG's statement comes a day after Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya told the Lok Sabha during the Parliament Winter Session that a decision on booster doses and vaccines for kids would be taken on the basis of scientific advice. He said that the focus of the vaccination drive would be to expand the coverage of the second dose.During the debate in the Lok Sabha on the Covid pandemic, several lawmakers had suggested a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccines for the elderly, immunocompromised and health workers who work in high-risk environments.Notably, NTAGI is expected to meet next week to assess about the need for a booster jab – whether there is adequate data on waning immunity, where the effects of the vaccine wear off over a period of time.NITI Aayog member (health) Dr V K Paul had also said that despite the new challenge of Omicron variant, a full vaccination with two doses remained the most critical tool against Covid-19.Meanwhile, the INSACOG said that genomic surveillance will be critical for the early detection of the presence of Omicron variant, to enable necessary public health measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-favouring-booster-dose-for-40-insacog-says-more-experiments-required-101638670265501.html

The Indian Force lost a total of 11 aircraft, six in West Pakistan and five over Bangla Desh. This, according to a Defence Ministry spokesman, is “moderate” considering that the IAF attached heavily defended targets in daylight. No IAF aircraft was lost on the ground. The Pakistani day-light attacks on our air fields have been comparatively light and the damage caused to installations and the runways has been negligible. All our airports are operational whereas the bulk of the Pakistan Air Force in Bangla Desh has been “decimated” with only two or three aircraft left. The Indian Navy, whose Eastern and Western Fleet, were ordered to seek and destroy all enemy warships and to cut the maritime line of communications between West Pakistan and Bangla Desh, struck at Cox’s Bazar destroying the airfield, Power house and wireless stations there. Its carrier-borne aircraft attacked Chittagong and demolished some port installations, a hangar and fuel dumps besides sinking two gunboats and damaging two Pakistani merchant ships in the harbour. Invoking the contraband control, the Indian Navy intercepted and seized a Pakistani merchant ship “Pasni” which was on its way to Karachi and ordered it to proceed to Cochin. The Indian Army which marched into Bangla Desh at several points to act in concert with the Mukti Bahini, made several significant gains by capturing Shamshernagar including the airfield in the Tripura and Cachar sector as well as Thakurgaon, Darsana and Gazipur. It is engaged in fierce fighting near Akhaura and Jessore. In the Western sector, the enemy supported by armour mounted massive attacks on Indian positions in Chhamb sad Hussainwala, but all the attacks were repulsed with heavy losses to the invaders. Pakistan lost six Patton tanks in Chhamb and another six near Hunssainwala. Radio Pakistan reports that Chhamb, Fazilka and Khem Karan had been captured by Pakistani troops were described as “absolutely false” by a Defence Ministry spokesman here. Indian troops captured a Pakistan picket five miles south-east of Tithwal and a hill feature between URI and Hajipir in Kashmir. The Indian Army has taken 61 Pakistani prisoners - 19 In Western sector sad 42 In Bangla Desh near Phulbari. The spokesman said that -after Pakistan’s wanton aggression on India “no holds are barred” and the Indian Security Forces would take whatever action they thought fit to meet any threat to the country’s territorial integrity. The Defence Minister, Mr Jagjivan Ram, told Parliament that Pakistan had thrust war upon India. Pakistan’s objective of inflicting substantial damage through a pre-meditated preemptive attack had been frustrated. Referring to the fighting in the Ferozepore sector, he said that all Pakistani attacks have been repulsed. “We have also had casualties and lost some ground.” Of the 33 Pakistani aircraft destroyed, 19 were in the western sector and 14 in Bangla Desh. So far Pakistan has lost 19 Sabre jets and Mig-19’s. five B-57 medium bombers, three Mirages - regarded as the pride of Pakistan’s Air Force - two F-104 Star Fighters, three light aircraft and one transport aircraft. Nine of the 19 aircraft in the western sector were destroyed in a daring day-light raid by IAF Hunters on Masrur airfield near Karachi. These included one B-57 bomber, and eight Sabre jets and Chinese supplied Mig-19 aircraft. All the IAF Hunters returned to their bases. The other 10 aircraft, either shot down or destroyed on the ground, were four B-57 bombers, three Mirage III-E fighter bombers, two F-10$ Star Fighters and one F 86 Sabre jet. In the Eastern sector of the 14 PAF aircraft destroyed. 10 were Sabres, three light aircraft and one transport plane. The transport plane was set ablaze by the attacking IAF planes on the airfields. These enemy losses are in addition to the three Sabre lets shot down over Boyra by Gnats last week. The Indian aircraft lost included two Hunters, one HF-24 and one Su-7. The crew of the Indian aircraft reported that they have achieved good results. They hit a number of Pakistani aircraft on the ground and set petrol tanks ablaze. In retaliation against the raid on the Amritsar radar station-which has been only slightly damaged but is fully operational-the IAF damaged the Pakistan radar station near Badin (Kutch). UNI, PTI add: Fierce fighting was raging around several Pakistani pickets in the Ferozepore and Gurdaspur sectors today and the enemy had suffered heavy losses in men and material, official sources said in Jullundur. All attacks by the enemy had been repulsed by the BSF and | regular troops fighting shoulder to shoulder to defend the country’s borders. In the Amritsar sector, while a bitter battle was on near the Indian post of Rania. Pakistani positions along Hudiara Drain had been under seige since last night. Pakistan, which attacked the Indian positions around the Hussainiwala, Ullaka, Rajoke and Khanpur areas of the Ferozepore sector last night in brigade strength, had Introduced a fair sprinkling of its armour to influence the results of the fighting. Indian pickets all along the Punjab-West Pakistan border from Sulaimanki, near Fazilka to Khem Karan, Dera Baba Nanak and other places were subjected to heavy shelling by medium and heavy artillery used for providing cover to the enemy troops attempting to intrude into Indian territory.

It is likely to move northwards and then north-northeastwards along Odisha’s coast, weakening gradually.Meanwhile, a fresh wet spell is likely to impact western Himalayas and northwest India from Saturday to Monday, the weather bureau said on Saturday.On Saturday afternoon, Jawad was about 210km east-southeast of Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), 320 km south of Gopalpur (Odisha), 390 km south-southwest of Puri (Odisha) and 470 km south-southwest of Paradip (Odisha). By evening, it had weakened in to a deep depression (55 to 65 kmph gusting to 75 kmph). It is likely to move northwards on Saturday and then north-northeastwards along the coast, weakening gradually, and reaching near Puri on Sunday around noon depression. It is expected to weaken further and continue to move north-northeastwards along the Odisha coast towards West Bengal.“Heavy and widespread rain has started over parts of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. By the time it (Jawad) reaches Puri, it is likely to weaken in to a depression,” said Sunitha Devi, head of the cyclones department at the weather office. “Though cyclones have moved towards Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in December in the past, Jawad is the first December cyclone in 130 years to have a track towards Odisha coast.”Extremely heavy rain is expected over Odisha on Saturday, and very heavy rain over West Bengal and Odisha on Sunday.Meanwhile, a western disturbance is expected to affect northwest India on Sunday. It would lead to thunderstorms accompanied by rain and snow over Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand till December 6. Isolated, light rainfall is likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi on Sunday., the weather bureau predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-jawad-to-weaken-before-hitting-puri-but-states-prepare-for-heavy-rainfall-101638643639289.html

The contribution of the private sector in this has increased to ₹18,000 crore,” he said in his speech at the MSME conclave of the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM).Singh urged the MSMEs to invest more in research and development as it would help strengthen the nation’s security. “You should bring new technologies, new products. You should not think that just because of your small, you cannot do great innovation,” he added.Around 12,000 MSMEs have joined the defence industry due to the government’s initiatives, he added. “Defence exports from India during the last seven years have been of more than ₹38,000 crore due to the government’s initiatives,” he noted. Innovation, research and development and the number of startups have increased in the defence industry due to these initiatives, Singh said.Reiterating the government’s focus on encouraging exports, the minister expressed hopes that India will soon become a net exporter from a net importer. “The government aims to achieve the export target of ₹35,000 crore by 2024-25. Presently, India is exporting defence equipment to around 70 countries. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 2020 report, India is in the list of top 25 countries in defence exports,” he said.The Indian armed forces have completely supported the self-reliance initiative of the government, he stated.“Therefore, the number of contracts given to indigenous defence industry has increased,” he said.Singh accepted that the big companies have a major role to play in defence manufacturing but the reality is that the work of numerous small companies is hidden behind that of big companies.“Big defence platforms are assembled from numerous small parts and most of them are provided by the MSMEs,” he noted.“Therefore, I believe that the term ‘industry’ really means MSMEs as they are not only responsible for economic activities but also for societal progress,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-urges-msmes-to-invest-in-defence-sector-101638643457897.html
05-12-2021||India||President Kovind hails PAC for ensuring accountability at centenary event||The Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Parliament’s audit watchdog, has ensured more paise out of every rupee of public spending reach the people, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday.Parliamentary committees, especially the PAC, are crucial to ensure “administrative accountability of the executive towards the legislature,” the President said.The PAC, which had been chaired by stalwarts such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Murali Manohar Joshi and PV Narsimha Rao, is now led by Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury.“If more paise out of every rupee coming from honest taxpayers are reaching those in need, and also for nation-building initiatives, the PAC and its members have played a large role in the process,” Kovind said in his speech at the centenary celebrations of the PAC in the Central Hall of Parliament.Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had once said that out of every rupee, only 16 paise goes to the people, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu recalled at the event.“The Public Accounts Committee, along with the Public Estimates Committee and the Public Undertakings Committee constitute the triad of permanent vigilance over a wide range of governmental activities and the attendant expenditure,” Naidu said.Without these panels, “parliamentary democracy would be rendered incomplete,” Kovind said. His address assume importance as opposition parties have accused the government in the past two years of trying to push legislation bypassing the review of House panels.While the President maintained that at the heart of PAC’s functioning is “this aspect of holding the executive to account on behalf of the people”, Naidu suggested the panel should be redesignated as Public Accounts and Audit Committee (PA&AC).It should reinvent itself to more effectively “handle the complexity of scrutinizing the accounts and audit of expenditure through capacity building, accessing the inputs of experts and information exchanges,” the Vice President said.Parliamentary committees have contributed significantly in making the government accountable and transparent to the people, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said. “In a developing country like India, the constructive suggestions of PAC not only promoted the optimal use of financial resources, but also helped in improving the policies and programs of the government,” Birla said.PAC, working on non-party lines, contributes towards maintaining the standard of efficiency and financial propriety in the running of the administration, PAC chairman Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-ram-nath-kovind-hails-pac-for-ensuring-accountability-at-centenary-event-101638643341402.html
05-12-2021||India||Vaccination mandatory to visit apartments, says Karnataka CM||Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday announced that only those with two coronavirus vaccine doses will be allowed to enter apartment complexes as part of safety protocols following detection of Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the state. Similarly, the government has told residential associations to conduct meetings only with people who have taken two doses of the vaccine. After two Omicron cases detected in the state, the government has changed protocols to declare any place with three or more cases of Covid-19 as a cluster. As per the government guidelines, the earlier the limit was 10 cases. As for cluster management, two types of clusters had been planned. One for places such as schools, colleges and hostels, and other for apartment complexes in Bengaluru where cases have been reported. Everyone in the clusters would be tested and treated. The double dose had been made mandatory for parents of the students who attend classes off-line mode, testing is compulsory for all the inmates and staff of student hostels. Testing has been made mandatory for those with comorbidities, too. Officials had been instructed to make foolproof measures, Bommai said. “Preliminary report on Omicron cases had been received. The health department had been instructed to obtain comprehensive reports and treatment protocols being followed in various countries. According to available information, at present, the protocol being followed for the Delta variant is being followed for Omicron too. I want a scientific system to be followed,” said the chief minister. He further said expert opinion is that Omicron was a fast-spreading variant but has not shown severe implications. However, instructions had been issued to intensify tracing and treatment, Bommai said. Replying to a question about a statement of union health minister Mansukh Mandavia that none of the states except Punjab had submitted a report on deaths caused by oxygen shortage, Bommai said: “I have no information as to in what context the statement has been made.” Bommai said the winter session of the state legislature would be held from December 13 to 24 in Belagavi by strictly following COVID-19 norms. The secretariat would undertake the task of sanitising the building and seating arrangements in both Houses of the legislature. The district administration has been given instructions to allow only people with two doses of vaccination to the Suvarna Soudha. Missing South Africans tracked: BBMP When asked about Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar’s statement about 10 passengers from South Africa went missing in the state, Bommai said he has not received official information about it. “I will speak to the health minister about it,” he said. However, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Saturday said all South African travellers and those from other high-risk countries who had come to the city over the last two weeks have been traced. They have been isolated and their samples have been taken for COVID-19 tests as a precautionary measure and to rule out all doubts. Gupta said all these people came from South Africa to Bengaluru two to three weeks back when the requirement of a negative RT-PCR report was not made mandatory along with a re-test on arrival at Kempegowda International Airport. Karnataka and Bengaluru reported 397 and 207 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the active caseload to 7,012 and 5,096, respectively. While the state reported seven deaths due to the infections, taking the toll to 38,224, its capital city saw one Covid-19 related fatalities on the day, pushing its toll to 891, according to the daily health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-mandatory-to-visit-apartments-says-karnataka-cm-101638643337876.html

05-12-2021||India||Authorities test over 100 people who attended conference with infected man||In an attempt to track the source of new Covid variant Omicron in a 46-year-old Bengaluru doctor, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials are conducting contact tracing of medical professionals who attended an international conference here on November 20. Officials have been unable to trace the source of the new variant in the patient, who doesn’t have any international travel history. HT had reported that the doctor had attended an international conference in Bengaluru a day before he tested positive for Covid-19. The 28th annual conference of the Indian College of Cardiology was conducted in a hotel in Bengaluru and it was attended by around 60 medical professionals, including the infected person. The organisers of the events said all participants were from Bengaluru and all international participants attended the conference over the video conferencing. So far three persons, including the doctor, who attended the event, have tested positive for Covid-19. “We are currently tracing all participants and their contacts to identify if anyone has contacted the virus. More than 100 people including the hotel staff have been tested. The contract tracing will continue. As we have said earlier, to identify the source of the variant the patient number two, we will trace his contacts for as long as required,” said KV Trilok Chandra, special commissioner (health) of BBMP. The official said with the contract tracing, the government will be able to identify all those who had come in contact with the patients and isolate them at the earliest. A doctor, who attended the conference, pointed out that the doctor (patient number two) tested positive for the new variant just a day after attending the event. “The incubation period for the virus is 5-10 days, so it is possible that he got the virus before the event itself. As for the event, we had taken all precautions including wearing of the masks,” said the doctor, who didn’t want to be named. Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar had said patient number two had developed fever and body ache on November 21 and tested positive the next day. Since he had a low CT value (which indicates a high viral load), his sample was sent for genomic sequencing. This patient had 13 primary contacts and 205 secondary contacts. Out of which three primary contacts and two secondary contacts, have tested positive for Covid. They are currently at a government hospital and not showing any severe symptoms. The patient number two, who has mild symptoms, is currently under isolation at a hospital in Bengaluru as a precaution. His oxygen saturation levels are satisfactory and he didn’t report any breathing problems. The doctor is in good health and doesn’t have any symptoms at present, said BBMP officials. The Karnataka government on Friday ordered a probe into how a South African national obtained a negative RT-PCR report from a Bengaluru lab, enabling him to leave the country despite his swab results testing positive for Omicron variant. A senior police officer on Saturday said: “We have been asked if there have been any malpractice in issuing the negative certificate to the patient. We will submit a report to the government at the earliest.” The South African national was kept in isolation at a five-star hotel following his positive report at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru. After his samples were detected with a new strain, it was sent for a genomic sequencing test. Authorities have maintained that the infected person had taken a test in another lab and tested negative. He was allowed to go to Dubai through Bengaluru airport. From Dubai, he had reached South Africa. However, revenue minister R Ashok said there was some suspicion of malpractice, so a probe has been ordered. 
05-12-2021||India||Assam journalist booked under sedition charges over article on lawyer’s arrest||A journalist was charged with sedition on Saturday in Assam’s Silchar district, allegedly for writing an article on the arrest of lawyer Pradip Dutta Roy in a local news website, police said.Journalist Anirban Roy Choudhury was booked at Silchar Sadar police station under sections 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups) and 124 (A) (sedition), along with other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), police said. The action was taken based on a first information report (FIR) lodged by Santanu Sutradhar, a businessman.“He has been summoned under Section 41(A) (notice of appearance before police officer) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to the police station on December 6,” police said.Choudhary on November 28 wrote an article in local news portal Barak Bulletin on the arrest of Dutta Roy after sedition charges were pressed against the senior advocate. The article – Welcome To The Paradise Of The Spineless — We Are Assamese, ‘Bhasha Shaheeds’ Are Dead And So Are Their Descendants – questioned the role of local socio-cultural organisations in protection of the Assam Official Language (Amendment) Act, 1961.The article criticised local Bengali residents for not extending support to Roy while he was “getting harassed” during arrest on November 27.The law allows use of local languages in the three districts of Barak Valley (Bengali), besides Bodoland (Bodo), for all official communication.The editorial written by Roy Choudhury has no potential for sedition charges, according to Soumen Choudhary, a lawyer. “We’ll move for bail soon,” he said.Journalists from Barak Valley condemned the incident and threatened of a mass protest. Silchar-based journalist Abhijit Bhattacharjee said, “We won’t let these attacks on journalists to continue. We have called all the journalists across Barak Valley to gather in Silchar on Sunday afternoon. We’ll plan for mass protest if the case is not withdrawn soon.”Earlier, a controversy erupted in Silchar last month after removal of a central government’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign poster written in Assamese.Dutta Roy, who recently founded a political party called the Barak Democratic Front, had objected to using only Assamese in the government poster and claimed it was a violation of the Assam language law. The poster was replaced by a bilingual one last week that included Bengali.Dutta Roy, a former lawyer practising at the Gauhati high court, was questioned by police twice before being arrested on November 27 on sedition charges based on complaints lodged by two local organisations. He was denied bail and sent to jail till December 10, but was later sent in medical custody.Police on its own also registered a case against Dutta Roy for allegedly harassing journalists. On Friday, Silchar-based journalists wrote to Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi to withdraw the case.“Our government is trying to create bridges of harmony between linguistic communities of Assam. But few people are spitting venom because they want to divide the commons on linguistic grounds,” Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said just before of Dutta Roy’s arrest. “We won’t allow people like Pradip Dutta Roy to divide people.”Last month, two Delhi-based women journalists — Samriddhi K Sakunia and Swarna Jha — were arrested in Assam’s Karimganj district while returning from Tripura after reporting on alleged vandalism of religious structures there. However, a local court in Tripura granted them bail on November 16, within two days of arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-journalist-booked-under-sedition-charges-over-article-on-lawyer-s-arrest-101638643040486.html
05-12-2021||India||Extortion case: Police file charge sheet against Param Bir Singh, Sachin Vaze||The crime branch on Saturday pressed charges against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and two others in an extortion case filed by an hotelier.This is the first charge sheet filed against Singh, who has five first information reports registered against him in Mumbai and Thane police stations between April 28 and August 20, 2021.“We have collected evidence and recorded statements of many witnesses to establish how Singh and Vaze were running an extortion racket,” said special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap. Singh had recorded his statement in the case last week.Also Read| Param Bir Singh suspended for dereliction of dutyThe crime branch collected 69 audio clips of conversations between Vaze, complainant Bimal Agarwal and the witness from whom Vaze allegedly extorted ₹35 lakh. The transcript of the clips forms part of the charge sheet.The witness stated that Vaze threatened to arrest him in a case registered by the Property Cell of Mumbai Police against cricket bookies though he claimed to have nothing to do with it, according to the charge sheet.The witness said Vaze sent him a message, asking him to pay ₹2 crore if he wanted to avoid being arrested. The witness said he was forced to pay the amount, which he gave to Alpesh Patel, an accused in the case.During the course of its investigation, Mumbai crime branch recorded statements of several bar owners, many of whom said Vaze collected monthly “protection amounts” from them at the behest of Param Bir Singh, whom Vaze referred to as “number one.”This assumes importance in view of the fact that in his statements to the Enforcement Directorate, which investigates financial crimes, Vaze had claimed he collected money from bar owners in Mumbai based on instructions of former home minister Anil Deshmukh of the Nationalist Congress Party.The 1,895 pages long charge sheet against Singh and others contained statements of dozens of witnesses and was filed before the Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court, crime branch officials said.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 in connection with his alleged role in planting explosives (gelatine sticks without a timer or detonator) in an SUV outside the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani in February, and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran to whom the car belonged.On August 25, Goregaon police registered an extortion case against Singh, Vaze and others based on a complaint by hotelier Bimal Agarwal, who alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against two bars he owned in partnership with others.Also Read| Transfers scam: Jagtap gets bail, court stays clear of phone-tapping legalityThe offence had reportedly taken place between January 2020 and March 2021, police had said. The case was later transferred to Unit 11 of the crime branch for investigation.Besides Singh and Vaze, others charge-sheeted in the case include Alpesh Patel and Sumit Singh, alias Chintu. While Vaze is in judicial custody, Patel and Sumit Singh are out on bail. Police are yet to file a charge sheet against two others accused in the case, Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati.Singh, who was recently suspended by the state government from his post as the director general of Maharashtra Home Guard. He showed up before investigators last week after the Supreme Court granted him protection from arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extortion-case-police-file-charge-sheet-against-param-bir-singh-sachin-vaze-101638642737708.html

The owner of the house was arrested after he admitted to sexually assaulting and murdering the girl, they added. Hapur assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Sarvesh Mishra said the girl had stepped out of her house for some purchases on Thursday when the accused, Amjad, 38, lured her to his house which is located barely 50 metres away.“The accused, a labourer, sexually assaulted her and then killed her. His wife and two children were not at home when the incident occured,” Mishra said.The girl’s family, meanwhile, began a search and lodged a complaint on Friday after they failed to locate her, he said. It was only after neighbours complained of some unpleasant smells from one of the houses on Saturday morning that a police team visited the spot. “The main gate was found locked by police. They broke the lock and upon searching the house, found the body of the girl stuffed in a trunk,” Mishra said. The accused was later arrested fromTrilokipuram locality, under Hapur Nagar police station, following which he confessed to the crime, the ASP said. Police claimed that the labourer is a drug addict. The body was sent for post-examination and a report is awaited, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-girl-killed-after-sexual-assault-body-stuffed-in-trunk-police-101638642264929.html
05-12-2021||India||Centre clears plan to make AK-203 assault rifles with Russia||New Delhi India and Russia are putting the finishing touches to agreements in defence, trade, space, technology and energy that are expected to be signed during the annual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin on December 6. Ahead of Putin’s day-long visit, the Indian government cleared a plan for the joint production of more than 500,000 AK-203 assault rifles with Russia to boost self-reliance in defence manufacturing, officials familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The annual summit – which has been held since 2000 – will be preceded by meetings between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoigu and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, and the inaugural 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers. The two sides are looking forward to intense engagement on issues ranging from ways to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, connectivity and energy to regional security concerns, such as the situation in Afghanistan, people familiar with planning for the summit said on condition of anonymity. Several agreements to deepen cooperation in defence, trade, space, technology, energy and culture are expected to be inked during the summit, the people said. The two sides are expected to renew their military-technical cooperation arrangement for 2021-31. A key pact that could be signed is the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), which will allow militaries of the two nations to access logistics and support facilities at each other’s bases. The joint statement to be issued after the summit is expected to reflect India’s concerns over cross-border terror and the fallout of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the people said. Modi and Putin had decided in August to have close consultations on Afghanistan and the two sides are coordinating on common concerns, the people added. Days before the summit, the government approved the plan to manufacture AK-203 rifles at a factory at Amethi in Uttar Pradesh under a joint venture called Indo-Russian Rifles Private Limited that was formed by Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited and Munitions India Limited and Russia’s Rosoboronexport and Kalashnikov. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday took up the ₹5,100-crore project. The AK-203 rifles will replace INSAS rifles inducted more than three decades ago. “The approval reflects the paradigm shift in defence acquisition from buy (global) to Make in India. The endeavour also reflects the deepening partnership between the two countries,” said an official. “The project will provide business opportunities to various MSMEs and other defence firms for supply of raw material and components, which will lead to a generation of new employment opportunities,” he said. Last month, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) – India’s apex military procurement body – granted key approvals to accelerate the acquisition of AK-203 rifles to be made in India with transfer of Russian technology. Putin’s visit will have a major defence and security overhang. The delivery of the first squadron of S-400 air defence systems – part of a $5.4-billion contract with Russia for five systems – is coinciding with the visit. Russian officials have said that the delivery of components for the air defence systems has already begun. Against the backdrop of US threats to impose secondary sanctions on the S-400 deal under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), the people cited above said India follows a policy of strategic autonomy when it comes to defence procurements and national security interests. The people said Russia was a “natural fit” for a 2+2 dialogue as the two countries work closely on defence and political issues. India currently has such mechanisms only with Australia, Japan and the US, but the people said the new 2+2 dialogue with Russia wasn’t an afterthought or a balancing act. At least 15 groups focused on economic cooperation between India and Russia have met virtually over the past two years amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the two sides have increased the target for two-way investments to $50 billion by 2025 as the earlier target of $30 billion had been achieved in 2018. India is also focusing on trade and investment opportunities in Russia’s Far East, including in coal and diamonds and meeting manpower needs. As part of these efforts, 11 governors from the Far East have been invited to the Vibrant Gujarat meet of 2022. Modi and Putin are expected to have restricted one-on-one talks during the summit, which will begin at 5.30pm, and the Russian leader will emplane from Delhi at 9.30pm. Their talks are expected to provide guidance for strengthening the bilateral strategic partnership. This will only be Putin’s second foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak – he travelled to Geneva in June for his first meeting with US President Joe Biden. Putin’s decision to travel to New Delhi reflects the importance attached by Russia to its special and privileged strategic partnership with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-plan-to-make-ak-203-assault-rifles-with-russia-101638642197770.html
05-12-2021||India||Must not repeat past mistakes in EV market: Niti Aayog CEO||India must learn from its mistakes made in the field of electronics manufacturing to avoid committing them in the field of electric mobility, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Friday. Making India a global leader in electric vehicle manufacturing would facilitate the shift from a sunset to a sunrise area of industry, Kant said in a speech to the Round Table Conference organised by the ministry of heavy industries. “In the last 70 years, India has always been getting into the sunset areas of industry. And by the time you get into the sunrise areas of industry, it is too late. By that time, the Chinese and other countries have already taken the market and they have the size and scale. And once they have the size and scale, you’ll never be able to penetrate global markets,” Kant said. “Therefore, we say that you get into the sunrise areas of the future and if you get into these areas, you will become a global champion.”“Those countries that go digital and go green will attract valuation and investment, and those that do not go green and digital will go dead. There will be no future for those countries. This disruption is absolutely clear. ...by 2025, there will be no combustion two-three wheelers left,” he added. Urging industries to make India the centre of manufacturing for both the Indian and global markets, Kant said: “One of the lessons we learnt was that in the case of mobile phones, where the market grew in India, but we became import-dependent. What we learned in solar is that the market grew in India, but we became import-dependent. Let us not make that mistake in the world of mobility. We must make India the centre of manufacturing, both for the Indian market and for the rest of the world. And that is now dependent on all of you… to make the states of India the centre of manufacturing.” “Our vision is battery storage, green hydrogen and renewables. And we are not talking about India. We are talking about making India the biggest player in the world. India must become the biggest manufacturer of battery storage, of green hydrogen, the biggest exporter of green hydrogen, the biggest exporter of battery storage… Don’t look at India. Look at the world as your market,” he told the gathering.“Therefore, my belief is that... if you do not bring in technology or you do not go green, India will lose out.” The ongoing round table is being organised to bring together all stakeholders from central government, state governments and Union territories, leaders of auto equipment makers and automotive component manufacturers, battery storage entrepreneurs, start-ups and technical experts, and work out strategies to promote adoption of electric vehicles, and attract investment in manufacturing of electric vehicles, batteries and high technology automotive components in the country. Transport ministers of most states and representatives of private automobile industries were among those who attended the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-not-repeat-past-mistakes-in-ev-market-niti-aayog-ceo-101638642077715.html
05-12-2021||India||SKM forms 5-member panel to talk with Centre on pending demands||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Saturday formed a five-member panel for talks with the government on their pending demands, even as the group, which was spearheading the protest against the now repealed farm laws, announced it will continue its agitation until all demands are met .On November 29, the Centre repealed the three agricultural laws farmers had been protesting against for over a year.With the latest move, crucial talks between the Union government and protesting farm unions could resume in a few weeks after nearly a year of pause. “Talks are possible soon but it all depends on when the government sends its invitation,” Hannan Mollah, who is on the SKM’s committee for presumptive negotiations, said.Farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ashok Dhawle, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Yudhvir Singh were named the members of the committee after a meeting was held by the SKM. The SKM panel will focus on pending demands including on minimum support price, compensation to the kin of farmers who died during the movement against the agriculture laws and withdrawal of cases against the protesters, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said.He said that the next meeting of the morcha will take place on December 7 to decide the future course of the movement. The SKM has decided they will not move from the Delhi border protest site until all their demands are met.The Union government is indirectly talking to some farm leaders to prepare the ground for a dialogue over a slew of remaining demands by cultivators, according to a person aware of the matter.Mollah said the farmers’ platform set up the five-member panel after a request by the Centre to keep the team of negotiators small. He said Union home minister Amit Shah held telephonic conversations with farm leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal and Yudhvir Singh. “This not good enough. We need a formal dialogue to start soon,” he said.Farmer leader Dhawle said the issues of compensation to be given for the farmers who died, “false cases” lodged against farmers and the Lakhimpur Kheri incident were discussed at the meeting on Saturday.The Union government hasn’t announced a date for the two sides to get back on the table and the SKM said it will respond only when an official invitation is extended to the farmers by the Centre.After 11 rounds of talks, the Centre withdrew from the dialogue process on January 22 this year after a deadlock. At the time, the Union government viewed as sweeping calls by farm unions to scrap the laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 said his government would abandon the legislation at the heart of massive protests by tens of thousands of farmers.The farmers said the government would have to cancel all criminal cases registered against protesting farmers in various states, especially Haryana, a major arena of the farm protests.In separate talks with Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday by a team of farm leaders that included Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Inderjit Singh, the Haryana government for the first time acknowledged that it was prepared to take back cases.“The Haryana chief minister said cases would be withdrawn but he did not even in principle accept our demand that families of martyred farmers be compensated monetarily,” Inderjit said.The two sides – the Haryana government and the farm leaders led by Chaduni – could not agree on the number of cases to be withdrawn. Farm unions say 45,000 protesting farmers had been named as accused in various police complaints, while the government put the figure at 32,000.“(The) Samyukt Kisan Morcha held a crucial meeting today to discuss about pending demands of the farmers’ movement and the lack of a formal response from the Government of India. It was decided unanimously that the farmers’ agitation will continue as is, until formal and satisfactory responses are obtained from the Government of India,” the SKM said in a release.Bringing a law to guarantee minimum prices for farm produce is a top pending demand. Besides, farm unions also want the cancelling of the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020/2021, which proposes to replace subsidised agricultural power with direct cash benefits.The SKM also wants a section of a law on pollution in the National Capital Region deleted. The section empowers authorities to fine farmers for burning crop residue, a major cause of air pollution.The farmers also want withdrawal of all cases slapped on protesting farmers in states such as Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chandigarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.They also want a parcel of land to erect a memorial for 702 farmers who have died during the course of their year-long agitation and their families rehabilitated with compensation.

05-12-2021||Today's||The shift in PM Modi’s strategy||With Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, expect the unexpected: Unpredictability is an offensive armour for a crafty leader who likes to keep his opponents constantly guessing. This is why, two weeks since he rather dramatically announced on Guru Nanak Jayanti that he was withdrawing the contentious farm laws, laced with an apology, no one is still quite sure yet just why the PM finally relented.
05-12-2021||Today's||Omicron: The nature of poll campaigns must change||Preliminary research shows that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is potentially several times more infectious than the other variants. Even as the new virus spreads, large election rallies are being held in five states. Shouldn’t we take measures to see that these do not become superspreader events?Many experts are seeking more restrictions now. Figures suggest that some of the world’s richest countries have so far been unable to overcome Covid-19. In India, fortunately, there are less than 10,000 new cases being reported daily while in the United States (US), this figure is over 80,000 per day.Greece has imposed a fine of $113 a month on those who have not been vaccinated. It has proposed to cut one-third of the pension of those above 60 years of age who are unvaccinated. In Britain, masks have been made mandatory again in public places. New Zealand and Taiwan, which were praised for handling the situation in the previous phases of the pandemic, are on the ropes now.Recently, when journalists asked US President Joe Biden about the possibility of a return of earlier restrictions amid news of this new variant, his reply was that there is no need for any panic right now. However, his administration later announced some new measures to tackle the new variant. It may be recalled how the lax policies of former president Donald Trump contributed to the virus spreading as was the case in the United Kingdom where Prime Minister (PM) Boris Johnson too did not take the virus seriously enough.In this time of apprehension and panic, what is India’s position?Due to the efforts of the Union and state governments, we have controlled the pandemic to a great extent. But no one knows the trajectory of the Omicron variant. The government machinery is on high alert but, at the same time, election campaigns have begun for the forthcoming assembly elections. Crowds are turning up in large numbers for the election rallies held by PM Narendra Modi and those of state leaders. The events which followed the Bengal elections and the kumbh mela in Haridwar should serve as a wake-up call.The Election Commission (EC) was criticised then for overlooking necessary precautions while managing the elections. The Union government, all the political parties and the EC should jointly try and find an appropriate solution. PM Modi set an example earlier by making calls for a symbolic kumbh which was accepted by most of the sants. If the kumbh can be symbolic, why should this not be so for election campaigns?This is the age of social media and communication. India has over 500 million smartphone users. Around 770 million Indians have internet connections. The PM himself used these tools effectively well before the 2014 general elections. From Ahmedabad, he held various chai pe charcha events across the country. The results showed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) reaped rich dividends from this.The time has come for political parties, which always claim to act in the public interest, to come together and institute safe campaigning methods. If they use technology correctly, their messages will reach voters in real-time and the resources which would have been spent on mobilising crowds can be put to better use. In any case, crowds at rallies are no longer any guarantee of victory in the elections.If election campaigning is in virtual mode, the use of black money for elections can also be reduced. The EC should ban large rallies and relax the limits on the amount of money which can be spent on the use of media platforms so as to ensure transparency. The tax collected from this will boost the finances of the exchequer. Politicians can use the media to make their message long lasting and reach as many people as possible. Election campaigns often fuel conflicts at the local level, which spills over into violence. This and similar problems can be obviated through the judicious use of the media.The question now is how a mindset change can be effected and how well politicians will accept this. Let me give you an example of the social reform movement that started in Bengal during the 19th century. It was not an easy task at that time. Social evils such as sati, child marriage, untouchability and the zamindari system had wreaked havoc on society over the centuries. But the reforms slowly took root and, today, we are largely free of those debilitating social evils. We should not forget that elections are being held in only five states and the number of people involved is far less than the numbers involved in the social reforms.Will the EC be able to muster the courage to make changes in the way the assembly election campaigns are conducted in the larger common good?Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/omicron-the-nature-of-poll-campaigns-must-change-101638716496090.html
05-12-2021||Today's||Amid great power competition, what Delhi and Moscow mean to each other||Even as India gets ready to participate in the Summit for Democracy convened by United States (US) President Joe Biden, New Delhi is hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin for the 21st India-Russia annual summit with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. This will be Putin’s first visit abroad for a bilateral meeting in-person ever since the onset of the pandemic, underscoring the importance he attaches to maintaining robust ties with India.
