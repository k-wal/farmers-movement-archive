22-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi launches projects worth over ₹500 cr, lays foundation of medical college in Sonbhadra||VARANASI Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday launched 79 development projects worth over ₹500 crore in Sonbhadra district (foundation laying and inauguration) and laid the foundation stone of a 500-bed medical college, which would be built at a cost of ₹300 crore. Accusing the non-BJP governments of depriving Sonbhdra of basic facilities, Adityanath said the BJP government was ensuring development and equipping the district with facilities for locals. “Sonbhadra district is full of natural resources, but the previous government kept locals deprived of basic facilities. Before 2017, the district, which supplies electricity to the entire state, used to remain in darkness itself,” said the chief minister, welcoming the Jan Vishwas Yatra in Sonbhadra. The Jan Vishwas Yatra is being taken out in UP, covering all assembly constituencies, to apprise people of various schemes started by the BJP government at the centre and in the state. While addressing a public meeting, Adityanath said, “This yatra has brought the gift of a medical college to Sonbhadra so that locals get quality treatment here. Foundation for a medical college has been laid and now poor people of the district will not have to go elsewhere to avail medical treatment.”“‘The Har Ghar Nal Yojana’ has already been launched to make drinking water available in every village. By 2022, potable water supply to every house in each village of Sonbhadra and surrounding districts will be ensured under this scheme,” he added. The previous government used to ban Kanwar Yatra, but Modiji gave the gift of Vishwanath Dham, said Adityanath, adding that his government ensured action against mafias (mining and land mafias) and sent them to jail.The CM said his government also took a number of steps for the welfare of the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-launches-projects-worth-over-rs-500-cr-lays-foundation-of-medical-college-in-sonbhadra-101640182383156.html
22-12-2021||Lucknow||Chhattisgarh model, not the Gujarat one, will suit people of Uttar Pradesh: Bhupesh Baghel||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Wednesday said the Chhattisgarh model of governance, not the Gujarat one, would suit the interests of Uttar Pradesh. Baghel said people now knew the reality of the Gujarat model.Baghel, who is a senior observer of the Congress for the Uttar Pradesh polls, was speaking at the party’s Pratigya rally at Kevalpurwa village in Nakha block, about 14 km from the Lakhimpur Kheri district headquarters.He accused the BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh of shielding Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, in which eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed on October 3.The minister’s son Ashish Mishra, the main accused in the case, was arrested on October 9 and has been in jail since then.Baghel alleged that the party rally in Nakha was allowed on the condition that silence would be observed on the case.However, he added that he called on the kin of the victims of violence and raised the issue. He asked officials to discharge their duties as per the constitution.Elaborating on the Chhattisgarh model while attacking the Yogi government, Bhupesh Baghel said after coming to power in Chhattisgarh in 2018, he waived farmers’ loans worth ₹18000 crore.“In UP, farmers were demanding minimum support price while in Chhattisgarh, farmers were given ₹2500 per quintal for their paddy and wheat crops,” he added.He said UP farmers faced stray cattle menace while in Chhattisgarh, his government had built 8000 “gau-sadans” ( cow shelters) and purchased cow dung at ₹2 per kg.Urging the people to be cautious during the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, Bhupesh Baghel said, “In UP, one party has resorted to the politics of religion while others of caste.”“It is the Congress which was doing politics for development, employment to youths, empowerment of women and uplift of farmers,” Bhupesh Baghel said. Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu was with Baghel at the rally. He sharply attacked the BJP governments for the “plight of UP farmers”.The state Congress chief said farmers relied upon their crop income for their livelihood, education and marriage of their children, but the BJP government, which had claimed it would double farmers income by 2022, had failed to pay them even the cost incurred on the crops. Lallu said farmers had the power to change the scenario.In Lakhimpur, cane farmers had agitated over their dues which forced the government and mill owners to come to an agreement, he said.Once in power in UP, the Congress would ensure permanent jobs to youths in place of contract services, scholarships and scooties to girl students, besides promoting indigenous cottage industries like brass, carpet and Lucknow’s chikankari, Ajay Kumar Lallu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/chhattisgarh-model-not-the-gujarat-one-will-suit-people-of-uttar-pradesh-bhupesh-baghel-101640181767594.html

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||A visit that opened our eyes, moved us, left us speechless||Mid-career conferences are normally mundane affairs, but certain meets leave long-lasting impressions. In May 2001, a regional conference to update certain aspects of disability evaluation and newer standard operating guidelines to take care of persons who were challenged physically, visually, mentally or hearing impaired was organised by the Rehabilitation Council of India at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh. The conference was attended by 100-odd participants, comprising doctors and administrators of the region. The first two days were reserved for lectures on the theme of the conference, while the third and final day was reserved for a field visit. On the final day, our first stop was at the institute of the visually challenged, where we were received and ushered in by the principal. The students were being imparted vocational training so as to learn requisite skills to become self-sufficient. Their skilful mastery over Braille impressed one and all. The visit ended with a musical rendition by the students. As we were walking out, I was overwhelmed by the grit of the ‘enlightened’ minds. For them, life was all black but it was not dark as they had ‘illuminated’ it by cultivating ‘extra’ sensory perceptions and skills to pave the way for their day to day living. Instead of getting discouraged by their difficulties, they had triumphed over it with hope and determination. After that we were taken to the Nevedac Prosthetic Centre, where the physically challenged, amputees or post poliotic patients were being rehabilitated. There were two youngsters who had recently lost their limbs in accidents and were being tested with prosthetic fits. Their world had come crashing down on their ‘feet’ literally. They were to gather all their determination to overcome the loss and be up and about. The centre had employees who were physically challenged and they were contributing in their own limited way and getting remuneration in return, to have some financial independence. The next stop was at the institute of the hearing impaired. The conversation there was with sign language and that singular acquisition was now giving direction to the lives of the inmates there. Finally, at the valedictory function in the evening, representatives of sub groups were to speak and they went on to cite the content of the lectures to arrangements to logistics etc. Our sub group representative’s turn came last and his brief remarks were, “Today’s visit to various centres opened our eyes, moved us and left us speechless.” This was received with pin drop silence for a minute after he had finished as everyone felt thankful to the Almighty. The single-day experience of myriad emotions taught us to be kind, empathetic and to have an attitude of gratitude. We hardly count our blessings and constantly complain about what we don’t possess. US radio host Woodrow M Kroll rightly said: “Concentrate on counting your blessings and you’ll have little time to count anything else.” The Covid-19 pandemic has literally brought us to our knees and has re-emphasised that every breath is a blessing and we need to stay optimistic. We can complain because rose bushes have thorns, or rejoice because thorns have roses. The choice is ours. narin58@gmail.com The writer is a Panchkula-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-visit-that-opened-our-eyes-moved-us-left-us-speechless-101640180927571.html

Tripathi said police have received massive help in identifying culprits and miscreants and cracking even blind cases due to available footages. “However, markets and shops in rural areas still lack adequate numbers of CCTV cameras due to which police often remains clueless about cracking cases,” he said. To solve this issue, the initiative ‘pahal’ was launched a few months back and after extensive campaigning over 150 traders in rural areas of trans-Yamuna and trans-Ganga have installed CCTV cameras with help of local cops.On Wednesday, Industrial Area police helped installation of CCTV cameras at customer service centre at Rampur while on Tuesday such gadgets were installed at two bank franchise in Manda area. Moreover, during the last few days many CCTV cameras were installed at hospitals, garment showrooms and even small business establishments in Koraon, Khiri, Tharwai and other areas of the district. Tripathi said with people showing interest in installation of CCTV cameras in rural areas, police is receiving immense help in identifying suspects and miscreants who create trouble. “Installation of CCTVs in rural areas will help in maintaining law and order and identification of trouble makers during upcoming assembly polls. The target of the drive is installation of maximum number of CCTV cameras in the district. The CCTV installation will help in evidence based policing and prosecution of culprits,” the SSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-police-pahal-bears-fruit-large-number-of-cctvs-installed-in-rural-areas-101640180807826.html

On Wednesday, the folk and tribal art and food festival-cum-fair Bhimthadi Jatra was held with over 200 exhibitors. Similarly in various areas, local corporators have organised huge exhibitions. However, residents sounded the alarm, cautioning about a possible surge in Covid cases on the backdrop of the new Omicron variant, due to large crowds gathering. People do not wear masks, no social distancing and organisers do not seem to be taking all the safety precautions, allege the citizens’ association.Atul Namekar, secretary of Sinhgad road-Warje residents’ association said, “We are already under the fear of new Covid-19 Omicron variant and daily cases of this variant are coming up in Pune. With the municipal elections nearing, several corporators and other party aspirants are organising fun fairs and exhibitions.With large crowds gathering at these events, Covid cases will certainly rise. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should take strict action against the organisers of these events for the safety of people and to stop the spread of virus.”As per the state Covid guidelines, currently to organise any event the minimum capacity of the public should be 50 per cent of the total capacity of the hall or the space available. Also the other Covid-19 basic rules like keeping social distancing, compulsory wearing of face masks, giving sanitisers should be followed strictly. However, some Punekars have gotten over the Covid fear. Seema Kalantri a resident said, “It is time to celebrate the new year and now even the Covid cases have gone down, so we have nothing to worry about. We have taken both doses of Covid vaccines and we are aware of our own safety. Celebrations give positive energy to people and we are going to enjoy the events,”While talking about these events and action taken on the violators, one of the PMC’s senior officials on anonymity said, “Currently we are not taking much action on the events or programs organised for public, as Covid cases are low and its time for year-end celebrations. But if needed and where there is large crowd gathering, PMC workers will go and penalise the organisers,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/events-in-pune-buzzing-again-with-covid-norms-the-casualty-101640180447709.html

22-12-2021||Pune||Pune Metro on the way, but roadblocks remain as Dec 2021 deadline ends||PUNE First mooted in 2002, the foundation stone of the much-delayed Pune Metro project was laid five years ago on December 18, 2016, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But since then, the project has had a few hurdles while trying to navigate its various routes. Five years on, the two lines of the metro is nowhere near completion as the December 2021 deadline approaches. Covid-induced restrictions which led to a massive exodus of workers, delayed the work, said officials. From politicking among parties to land acquisition problems, the project has been on and off the track often. The latest to be added to the long list of hurdles is the work being halted at Sambhaji bridge also known as Lakdi Pul. The three Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners- the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena have opposed the height of the viaduct at Lakdi pul as it will obstruct Ganesh emersion process.  Maha-Metro (Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) executive director Atul Gadgil said, “The of Sambhaji bridge is five-ana-a-half metres, which is same throughout Karve road. All PMC flyovers are also at the same level. We have asked for police protection to restart the work of installing viaduct at Sambhaji bridge at Deccan. Once the bandobast is confirmed, we will execute the work within a night.”The Maha-Metro is executing two metro corridors -Vanaz to Ramwadi and Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate. The first hurdle was that of elevated or underground metro, it was only when union minister Nitin Gadkari got involved, that the authorities reached the conclusion of an elevated metro. Another hurdle was the Pataleshwar caves on JM road, while there was demand to construct it parallel to city area, the metro was diverted from Karve road to riverside road instead of JM road. Later the project was challenged at the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but the project managed to get a green signal.The metro route was challenged yet again at Aga Khan Palace, considering it as a monument, the court ordered Maha-Metro to change the route,and then the corridor was shifted to Kalyaninagar. A controversy for land acquisation also emerged at Kamgar Putala and Budhear peth.Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The metro is not the issue only related to Pune Municipal Corporation but various organisations are related to it.

22-12-2021||Mumbai||Policy on travel on local train restriction as per Constitution: State tells HC||Mumbai: While responding to a query of the Bombay high court (HC) on the discriminatory policy of allowing only fully vaccinated persons to use public transport like trains, the state government has stated in its affidavit that such preventive measures were necessary to ward off the likelihood of the third wave of Covid. The affidavit states that it has done reasonable classification and imposed reasonable restrictions as per the Articles of the Constitution of India for non-vaccinated persons so that they do not endanger their own lives and of their families as well as those who are vaccinated while commuting on public transport. In light of the above, the challenge of the petitioners to the notification which restricts public transport usage by non-vaccinated persons was not valid and hence the public interest litigations should be dismissed. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik while hearing the PILs filed by activists Yohan Tengra and Firoze Mithiborewala was informed that the travel restrictions through public transport for non-vaccinated persons imposed by the state government was unconstitutional and violated the rights of the citizens. The court in the previous hearing last week had asked the state government to justify its stand on such discriminatory practices. In response, the state filed and submitted an affidavit on Wednesday. The affidavit filed by Debashish Chakrabarty, chief secretary, the government of Maharashtra states that the claim of the petitioners of their fundamental rights being violated was not valid. The affidavit states that as per article 14 (a) the distinction between vaccinated and non-vaccinated persons was ‘reasonable classification’ as there is a rational nexus to the objective to be achieved, the objective being protection of concerned persons. The affidavit further stated that article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution permits ‘reasonable restriction’ in the interest of the general public. An unvaccinated person will endanger his own life and that of his family as well as others hence the notification restraining non-vaccinated persons from using any form of public transport was valid. The affidavit also adds under article 21 the right to life and liberty was not an absolute right so as to endanger his life or the life of others by non-vaccination. The affidavit concludes that as vaccines are easily available and nearly 7.9 crore citizens have taken one dose and 4.9 crore two doses the petitioners should not raise objections on behalf of others and the PILs should be dismissed. Another affidavit filed by the health department through Dr Sadhana Tayade, director of Health Services states that the Covid cases have reduced in the state due to vaccination and there is some evidence that vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the same. In light of this, the affidavit stated that by not allowing usage of public transport for non-vaccinated persons is only to secure the right to life of vaccinated people. After the petitioners informed the bench that they wanted to file responses to the affidavits, the court posted a hearing of the PIL’s to January 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/policy-on-travel-on-local-train-restriction-as-per-constitution-state-tells-hc-101640173486336.html

Also read: Lookout notice for former Punjab minister Majithia in drugs case“Those who didn’t understand two months ago why I resigned, are now getting it,” Sidhu said at a press conference at his Amritsar residence on Wednesday. Sidhu had resigned as the Punjab Congress chief in September, demanding the removal of the then DGP Sahota and then advocate general APS Deol besides seeking justice in the drug case and 2015 sacrilege incidents. The Amritsar-East MLA said he hoped for a bigger role so that “everything can be changed with a roadmap. I will support Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi for life and will not budge from my word. I’ll stay loyal to Punjab. I don’t believe in lollipops or false promises to attain power. I’ll fight for Punjab’s revival.” Criticising former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, he said, “We (Congress) had 70 MLAs, but a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief minister (Captain) was running the government. Forty MLAs were demanding action against the drug mafia, but he (Captain) did nothing. Punjab could have been a surplus state, but the money of the state is in the pocket of a few. The politics of the mafia should end.” Targeting the Shiromani Akali Dal leadership of the Badals, Sidhu said, “I’ve been fighting against the partnership of the Captain and the Badals. Both have been protecting each other’s interests. The people of Punjab should understand that if they vote for the Badals, their vote will go to Captain, and if they vote for Captain, their vote will go to the Badals. Both are together. They have no moral authority.” Terming the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) statement that the drug case against Majithia was an election stunt, Sidhu said, “(AAP national convener Arvind) Kejriwal had started his campaign against drugs but he had himself sought an apology from the accused (Majithia). This is the same man who allows Badals to run their buses to Delhi airport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-politics-stand-vindicated-says-sidhu-after-majithia-booked-101640172466072.html

The highest deaths were reported in 2019-20... 14,759,” Chaudhary said in response to Congress lawmaker Jitu Patwari’s question.Patwari said the hospital’s SNCU is most unsafe in Madhya Pradesh. “The state government should fix responsibility for deaths of infants because deaths of 13% of infants are really a matter of concern. The condition of health facilities is getting worse by the day, but the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government has not shown any concern over it.”According to the Sample Registration Survey of 2018, the infant mortality rate in Madhya Pradesh was the highest in India with 48 per 1,000 live births.Chaudhary maintained most of the infants referred to the Hamidia Hospital’s SNCU are in serious condition. “Prematurely born are also admitted to the Hamidia Hospital. I cannot say survival rate is good but doctors do their best to save infants.”In November, 40 infants were admitted to the hospital when a fire broke out and claimed four lives. Later, 10 infants also died within 48 hours.
22-12-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: 12 men of Barbhai conspiracy safeguard the Maratha empire||Murder of Narayanrao Peshwa was a particularly difficult episode in the reign of Maratha Empire, second only to the Panipat debacle. All the diplomats and powerful noblemen and ministers in Pune were perplexed at sheer cruelty and blatancy of the gruesome incidence. As a safe position, all of them accepted the authority of Raghunathrao Peshwa as acting peshwa till he was reinstated by Chhatrapati. But, the doubt about Raghobadada’s involvement in Narayanrao’s murder had taken root in everyone’s mind. This eventually led to the great conspiracy by “Barbhai” (12 brothers!) in the efforts to save the Maratha state from moral and political downfall. There existed two camps in Peshwa courts, one belonging to old timers such as Purandare, Rajebahaddar, Vinchurkar, Gangadhar Chandrachud and Chinto Vitthal Rayarikar headed by Sakharam Bapu Bokil. All these ministers had old association with peshwas and some acted in capacity of their money lenders. Sakharam Bapu had played crucial roles in dealing with neighbours such as Hyder, Nizam, Karvirkar and Nagpurkar Bhonsales. Other camp was led by relatively new but able finance minister of Marathas, Nana Phadnis! Sardar families such as Patwardhans, Rastes, Pethes, Phadkes who had risen to a level under guidance of Madhavrao Peshwa I and were part of newer camp under Nana. Nana Phadnis had important forts such as Sinhagad, Lohagad, Purandare in his custody and was looking after Peshwa family’s private affairs. He was known for carrying out the operations of Maratha state from Satara, too. Political heavyweights and able commanders such as Mahadji Scindia and Holkars were more favourable towards Nana than Sakharam Bapur Bokil. However, both the camps were in agreement about sacking Raghoba from Peshwa position. They fear utter loss of control and damage to pride and moral foundation of Maratha state caused by this gruesome act. Each of them was hesitant before but finally Sakharam Bapu Bokil took the lead to bring all the ministers together. Ramshastri Prabhune had already pronounced Raghobadada guilty of the crime, thereby taking away his moral authority of occupying Peshwa position for Marathas. “Barbhai” gathered under Sakharam Bapu Bokil and Nana Phadnis to take pledge to oppose Raghunathrao’s appointment and give their best to displace him. When Narayanrao was murdered, his wife Gangabai was pregnant with one and a half month old child. Many conspiracies were hatched to kill her or at least miscarry her unborn child, who could have been the heir to the Peshwa position, by Anandibai Peshwa, wife of Raghunathrao Peshwa. These actions further angered the ministers of Barbhai conspiracy. All of them consented to saving the Narayanrao’s unborn child. If it would have been a boy, he would automatically inherit the Peshwa robes. If it was not the case, Gangabai would adopt and the collective of ministers would act as heir regent till the son comes of age. It was mutually agreed that Sakharam Bapu would work as primary incharge while Nana Phadnis would occupy second position and execute the plans. The opportunity to act in this direction presented itself in a short period. Raghobadada aka Raghunathrao Peshwa launched a campaign towards Nagpur in the 1773 to support Mudhoji Bhosale against his brother Sabaji Bhosale who were undergoing a family feud over inheritance of commanding position. Sabaji Bhonsale was a close confidant of Hyderabad Nizam. Raghobadada envisaged a grand plan of subjugating Sabaji and Nizam, demanding ransom from Nizam and then to attack Arkot Nawab Mohammad Ali and Madras under British with Nizam’s military assistance. This grand plan would have been successfully with generous aid, exemplary bravery and sharp intellect. Raghobadada did not lack in commandership, but definitely felt short of finances and wisdom. He was heavily dependent on his subordinates for crucial decision-making who only presented him false impressions of his capabilities. Sakharam Bapu and Nana left the marching camp under pretext of illness and returned to Pune. From Pune, Nana dispatched several letters to form secret political alliance against Raghobadada. Patwardhan, Raste, Pethe, Dhaygude and Purandare who were part of the marching camp were intimated about execution of the plan. Nizam and Sabaji Bhosale happily participated in the grand conspiracy! As Raghobadada divided troops ordering sardar Trimbak Pethe to attack Sabaji at Nagpur, he took the remaining troops to tackle Nizam and later attack Hyder Ali in Karnataka. As soon as Raghobadada turned his back, Pethe, Sabaji and Nizam joined hands thus, cornering Raghobadada from all sides. Raghoba quickly entered into “Kalyandurg treaty” where territory worth revenue of ₹1 crore was given to Hyder Ali. Meanwhile in Pune, the plot to hurt Gangabai was uncovered and she was quickly shifted to fort Purandar under supervision of sardar Haripant Phadke for safety. The Peshwa administration for a while was, hence, shifted to fort Purandar and was conducted under name of Gangabai and deceased Narayanrao. Trimbak Pethe died fighting Raghobadada at Pandharpur and was replaced by Haripant Phadke, a close associate of Nana Phadnis. To escape Barbhai joint front, Nizam and Sabaji, Raghobadada sought shelter in north with Mahadji Scindia and Holkars. Scindias and Holkar were hesitant to take direct action against Raghobadada and suggested dialogue. Haripant Phadke entered dialogue with Raghobadada which only dragged as the time passed. Meanwhile, Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa was born at Purandar on April 18, 1774 and was officially gifted with “Peshwa robes” on 40th day of his birth. It was mutually agreed and Nana Phadnis was appointed as chief regent. Ministers such as Moroba Dada Phadnis who were not involved in the “Barbhai” conspiracy were bitter and planned unsuccessful attack on the newly born child and Gangabai which was luckily throttled. The negotiations of Barbhai and Raghobadada did not bear fruit and suffering neglect from Scindias and Holkars, Raghobadada went to plead support with British at Surat to support his claim to Peshwa hood. In return, he promised the British island of Salsette and Vasai and Thane territory worth ₹19 lakh revenue and ₹1 lakh for the military expense on March 6, 1775. Sly British company was not ready for a full-fledged war with Marathas, ended up signing Purandar treaty in 1776. This treaty helped in losing Company’s support for Raghobadada. But, it brought the cunning British East India Company to doorstep of Maratha centre. Raghobadada could never return to Pune. Nana Phadnis and “Barbhai’ collective brought the poetic justice to widow and legitimate heir of Narayanrao Peshwa by acting judiciously in face of imminent threat!

Therefore, he should hand over the charge to somebody else without any hesitation,” Patil said, speaking to the media ahead of the commencement of the winter session.This ‘someone else’ should preferably be a person from the Thackeray-headed Shiv Sena, or the chief minister's own son, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, the Maharashtra BJP president further said. “This is because there is a possibility that the CM doesn't trust the Congress and the NCP,” Patil remarked. मुख्यमंत्री आजारी असल्याने गैरहजर असणे स्वाभाविक आहे. त्यामुळे मुख्यमंत्र्यांनी उगाच हट्ट न करता चार्ज दुसऱ्या कुणाकडेतरी द्यायला हवा. काँग्रेस आणि राष्ट्रवादी काँग्रेसकडून चार्ज परत मिळणार नाही, अशी शक्यता असल्याने किमान आदित्य ठाकरेंकडे तरी तो चार्ज द्यावा. pic.twitter.com/MYrVFSWzEcThe Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress together govern the western state as constituents of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).Patil, meanwhile, also said that the BJP ‘will not accept’ Thackeray's absence from the legislature session.However, responding to the BJP leader, state water resources minister and NCP leader Jayant Patil said that the chief minister is in 'good health,' and can come to the legislature anytime, though he is currently working from home.The BJP and the Sena together governed Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019, and were victorious in the assembly elections held in November two years ago. The two went separate ways after an impasse over the chief minister's post, with the Sena joining hands with the NCP and Congress to form the MVA.Recently, Union home minister Amit Shah described the MVA as a ‘punctured autorickshaw,’ adding that the alliance represents the culture of ‘dealer, broker and transfer.’Last month, Union minister Narayan Rane said that by March next year, the BJP will have regained power in Maharashtra.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-ailing-should-hand-over-charge-to-someone-else-bjp-on-uddhav-thackeray-101640165491419.html
22-12-2021||Mumbai||‘Reasonable restriction’: Maharashtra defends public transport bar on unvaccinated||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday defended the policy of disallowing unvaccinated people from using public transport, saying preventive measures were necessary amid the likelihood of a third Covid-19 wave. In an affidavit filed in the Bombay high court, it cited reasonable restrictions as per the Constitution and said the restriction has been imposed to ensure unvaccinated people do not endanger their lives, those of their families as well as vaccinated people while commuting.The Maharashtra government late last month issued Covid-related guidelines saying only fully vaccinated people would be allowed to access public transport. In the affidavit, it called the challenge to its notification in this regard invalid and urged the court to dismiss public interest litigations filed against it.The petitioners, activists Yohan Tengra and Firoze Mithiborewala, argued the travel restrictions were unconstitutional and violated the people’s rights.Also Read: Maharashtra to spend bulk of clean air funds on electrifying public transportThe court last week asked the state government to justify its stand on such discriminatory practices.In response, Debashish Chakrabarty, chief secretary, filed the affidavit citing the Constitution and added the distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons was “reasonable classification” to protect people. It referred to Constitution’s Article 19 (1) (d) and said it permits “reasonable restriction” in the interest of the public.The affidavit said Constitution’s Article 21, which relates to the right to life and liberty, was not absolute so as to endanger lives. It added vaccines are easily available and over 70 million citizens have taken one dose and over 40 million two doses.In a separate affidavit, the state health department said the Covid-19 cases dipped in the state due to vaccination. It cited evidence that vaccinated people are less likely to transmit the virus. The affidavit said by preventing unvaccinated people from using public transport, the right to life of vaccinated people was being secured.The court has posted the hearing in the matter next on January 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reasonable-restriction-maharashtra-defends-public-transport-bar-on-unvaccinated-101640167605614.html
22-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiites, is there enough alcohol for your Christmas dessert?||It’s the time to order plum cakes, puddings, ginger breads, stollens, and everything Christmassy. But, just when it’s time for the home bakers in the Capital to bake these treats, it’s also time for them to struggle with procuring a crucial ingredient for Xmas baking, that is alcohol. The liquor shortage in Delhi seems to have found its way to the shops of home bakers who are ruing about the hard times they are facing to find wine, brandy and rum to make Christmas desserts. Some are sourcing it from areas around Delhi, some are opting for expensive variants to be able to stick to their original recipes, and some are altering their recipes to make do with whatever is available. So will your Christmas cake and desserts be enough gooey this year? Rum, wine and whineGaurri Gupta from As Simple As Pie says that she faced a major issue in sourcing rum, and had to bring some changes in her recipe to avoid using alcohol. “This liquor shortage in Delhi is a big problem. A few days back, I could not find something as normal as one specific brand of rum, and ultimately had to alter my recipes. In fact, it became so bad that I was forced to turn back customers who came with high hopes to indulge in delicacies. With wine there’s a similar,” she says.Gurugram, Noida come to the rescue!With empty shelves at liquor shops in almost every part of the city, home bakers have started exploring shops outside the city, to meet the high demand for bakes at this time of the year. “Be it rum, brandy or red wine, nothing is available readily for professional bakers like us in Delhi. In fact, I couldn’t just sit and do nothing so at one point decided to source my stock from Gurugram. But that too was possible with great difficulty. It’s quite a challenge to bake to perfection the Christmas delights, if an important ingredient is missing,” says Shikha Sachdeva from The Culinary Courtyard.Supply low, Price highWith only a few selective brands available in the liquor shops, some home bakers are being forced to use high end, expensive brands to bake the Christmas cakes. “We use the regular rum, which is not available at all. Only the gold version is available, which gets expensive when we need it in higher quantity. And we can’t increase the cost of the desserts we make since the market is already so competitive,” shares Sachdeva. And Deeksha Dhingra, from Zana Patisserie, adds, “Being a small home baker it’s really difficult for me to manage this because it’s costing me double of what it was earlier! Sometimes I have to bear the excess cost because when I confirm an order for a cake, I have to quote the price to them at that very moment. And having already quoted the price, I can’t change it later else people will feat cheated. And I have tried to increase the price as well, but it has only lead to some cancellations, which is sad. It’s a tricky situation to be in.”The essence of it allWith limited quantity of alcohol available, using rum essence is another option that some home bakers have taken to exploring, in the need to deliver their Christmas orders in time. Ritu Dutt from Essenzaa, says, “For the rum cakes, I am using essence. A lot of other home bakers are also doing this to deal with this crises. So, either you use a less quantity of rum and use these essences instead or you could also just use the essence; like how we do it for those customers who don’t want alcohol in their cake.

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Lookout notice for former Punjab minister Majithia in drugs case||A day after Punjab Police booked Shiromani Akali Dal MLA and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a drugs case, the Union home ministry issued a lookout circular against him on the request of the state police. Also read: AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria’s fresh warning amid Omicron rise in IndiaThe lookout notice was issued on Tuesday by the Bureau of Immigration, a wing of the Union home ministry, on the request of Punjab Police that is trying to arrest the 46-year-old Majitha MLA booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on Monday following a report submitted by the special task force (STF) chief and additional director general of police Harpreet Singh Sidhu. The Bureau of Immigration has sent the copy of the notice to the additional director general of police (ADGP), counter intelligence. “The lookout circular shall remain in force until and unless a deletion request is received by the Bureau of Immigration from the originator itself,” the notice said. The lookout circular is a letter used by the authorities to check if a travelling person is wanted by the police. According to the 49-page FIR registered at the State Crime Police Station in Mohali, Majithia has been booked for cognisable offences under Sections 25 (Punishment for allowing premises, etc. to be used for commission of an offence), 27 (A) ( whoever is financing any activities indulging in production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, use or consumption, import and export or deal in any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of NDPS Act. These sections have the provision of imprisonment up to 10 years along with a fine as decided by the court. Sufficient evidence against Majithia: FIR “According to the findings of the STF report, prima facie there is sufficient evidence to further investigate the role of Majithia as regards the allegations made in application under scrutiny,” the FIR read, mentioning the STF chief’s report prepared on the basis of analysis of investigation done by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the Jagdish Bhola drug case. In 2018, the STF chief was given the task to analyse the former Akali minister’s role. His report, based on the statements of drug case accused Jagjit Singh Chahal and Maninder Singh Bittu Aulakh to the ED, has been made part of the FIR. The drug case revolving around Arjuna awardee wrestler and dismissed DSP Jagdish Bhola involved a drug network that was busted by Punjab Police in 2013. On February 1, 2018, the STF had submitted its status report in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which later sought comments from the Punjab DGP and then home secretary. Since then, the report is lying in a sealed cover in the court. AG pushed for action on STF chief’s report The FIR also mentions Punjab’s advocate general DS Patwalia’s legal opinion which has strongly pushed for action on the STF chief’s report. “In my considered opinion which has been formed after having gone through the proceedings of the court, there is no impediment/embargo for the STF or any state agency to act upon the report submitted in the court. In fact, the court has made it categorically clear that law enforcement agencies must act upon the said reports in accordance with the law.” Patwalia’s opinion is different from that of his predecessor who advised against acting on the report without the consent of the high court. The process to register the case was initiated after DGP Sidharth Chattopadhyaya wrote to the director, Bureau of Investigation (BoI), on December 20, two days after he took charge as officiating Punjab DGP. The FIR has been registered on the complaint of the station house officer (SHO), state crime police station, inspector Kailash Bahadur. A special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted to investigate the case. The act invited immediate accusations that the ruling Congress in Punjab is trying to settle political scores ahead of assembly elections early next year. Majithia, the brother of former Union minister and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, is a high-profile Akali leader.

He will criss-cross the state before concluding the tour at Nalanda on January 15. This will be Kumar’s 13th yatra since he first became the chief minister in 2005.Kumar has said he seeks to create awareness, particularly among the women about social ills such as those related to liquor, and to inspect the implementation of development works during the tour. The yatra is seen as part of his efforts to ensure strict implementation of the prohibition, widely considered as one reason for Kumar’s popularity among women voters.Also Read: Bihar is alert and ready to counter Omicron, says Nitish KumarNitish Kumar is also expected to focus on raising awareness against child marriages, dowry, the Jal-Jeevan Haryali scheme related to water and greenery, and get feedback on the implementation of piped water programme. He will also address public meetings during the outreach.Leaders of the ruling Janata Dal (United) or JD (U) said the yatra will also help revitalise the party’s workers and gauge the people’s mood. JD (U) leader Ajay Alok said Kumar’s yatras have always started from Champaran, which is associated with Gandhi. “This has been a land of change. Kumar is greatly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and that is why he too prefers to start all his yatras from Champaran.”Also Read: ‘Who let the booze in’, asks Tejashwi; alleges Nitish’s ‘liquor mafia nexus’In June 2005, Kumar first organised Nyaya Yatra and toured the state to seek people’s support after the Centre imposed President’s rule in the state. He organised the Vikas Yatra in January 2009 and Sewa Yatra in 2011 after getting re-elected. A Dhanyavad Yatra was also undertaken to thank people. In 2013, he undertook Adhikar Yatra to press for Bihar’s special status. His Sampark Yatra in 2014 sought to energise his party cadres after he briefly ended his alliance with the BJP. Jal Jeevan Haryali Yatra was his last in 2019.

The AQI is classified as “severe” when it crosses the 400-mark. The city recorded “severe” air quality on Tuesday for the first time since December 2.Delhi’s air quality is expected to remain in a similar range for the next three days because of calm winds. There will be a slight improvement as the temperatures begin to rise later this week. Very calm winds, low boundary layer height, and very low temperatures are leading to such a condition and this will continue, said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research.Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded a minimum temperature of 4.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday morning, while it was 4.2 degrees at the Lodhi Road station, compared to 4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, as the cold wave continued.Also Read: Rainfall expected in parts of northwest India; minimum temperatures may riseA cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below the normal, or it falls to 4 degrees or lower in an area.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the cold wave conditions will abate in the region from Wednesday onwards and the mercury is expected to rise to around 6-7 degrees Celsius by Thursday because of an active western disturbance.RK Jenamani, an IMD scientist, said while the western disturbance will be feeble, it will still lead to a cloudy day and increase in both day and night time temperatures by around 2 degrees.The IMD has said another western disturbance will impact Delhi from Friday onwards.

After December 29, a special drive will be conducted to issue caste certificates to students across private and public schools. Going beyond this, the government will soon also start issuing caste certificate at birth itself,” Soren told the Jharkhand assembly on Tuesday. He was responding to complaints that people including tribal groups and backward groups such as Lohar, Lohra and Baraik are facing problem in getting caste certificate.“This government claims to be well wisher of tribals. However, these groups are facing problem in even getting a caste certificate issued. On the other hand, minority (religious) groups are allowed to claim their entitlements just by providing self-declared documents. I have nothing against the community, but there are chances that in guise of minority, even Bangladeshi infiltrators could get the benefits,” said former minister and BJP legislator Neelkanth Singh Munda.The chief minister objected to the BJP lawmaker bringing in religion of people into this. “The opposition BJP always tries to disturb peace. Everyone knows that our government works for all citizens of the state including tribals, dalits and minorities. We too are not working for Bangladeshis or Pakistanis but for 3.25 crore people of Jharkhand,” Soren said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-to-issue-caste-certificates-in-schools-says-hemant-soren-101640146302609.html

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Congress will make Chandigarh safe for women: Netta D’Souza||Netta D’Souza, acting president of the All India Mahila Congress, on Tuesday called upon women in Chandigarh to put the city in safe hands by voting for Congress in the upcoming municipal corporation elections.While addressing a press conference at Congress Bhawan in Sector 35, she said that Chandigarh, which used to be known for its beautiful landscape and learned populace, is now leading the country in crime against women. “As per National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) data, the crime rate against women has gone up disturbingly in recent years, with NCRB-2020 report stating that Chandigarh has the highest number of rape cases in the country, with 75% victims being minors,” she said.She also said that a victory for Congress will lead to reduction in taxes. “Residents of the city are reeling under heavy burden of taxes, with water taxes having increased three-fold. After winning the MC polls, the party will provide relief of about ₹150 crore.”Subhash Chawla, president of Chandigarh Congress, said that if Congress wins MC elections, the party will give 100% relief in water tariff and property tax charged from them during the entire duration of lockdown. “The relief applies to all sections of Chandigarh residents. The amount charged during the lockdown shall be adjusted in the next bill and a resolution to this effect shall be passed in the very first meeting of the next corporation,” he said.Selja slams BJP for ‘pro-rich policies’“Congress has always prioritised interests and welfare of the people, especially the lower strata of the society. It was the Congress party who bestowed ownership rights to thousands of people living in slum areas, as a result of which they are living in safe and beautiful houses in Chandigarh,” Himachal Pradesh Congress committee chief Kumari Selja said on Tuesday.Selja was canvassing for Congress candidate of ward number 16, Sonia, at a rally in Sector 25, ahead of the upcoming municipal corporation elections on December 24.Slamming the BJP for unleashing high inflation on the people of the country, she said that the pro-rich policies of the central government have ruined the economy. “BJP is on its mission to sell the country to big business houses, but Congress will not allow it and keep fighting for rights of the common people. Residents should elect a young leader like Sonia, who has passion and dedication to serve residents,” She added.Congress alleges model code of conduct violations by BJP, AAPThe Chandigarh Congress has filed a written complaint to the State Election Commission, alleging violation of the model code of conduct by the BJP and the AAP.The complaint filed by Congress spokesperson Rajesh Sharma said despite clear directions to stop election campaigning by 5pm on Tuesday, banners and posters seeking votes in favour of the respective political parties were still in place at many public toilets in markets and cycle stands, a clear violation of the model code of conduct.The complaint requested that such illegal boards or materials be immediately removed, the expenses borne on such publicity material be added in the election expenses of the individual candidates and appropriate criminal legal action be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-will-make-chandigarh-safe-for-women-netta-dsouza-101640122056735.html

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Untreated sewage in N-Choe: PPCB to summon GMADA for not replying to notice||Acting on GMADA’s failure to reply to a show-cause notice over discharge of untreated sewage into the N-Choe passing through IT City, near Airport Road, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has decided to issue a summons to the development authority.In October this year, the pollution board had issued a notice to GMADA, asking them to file a reply within two weeks. The notice was issued under Section 25/26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, under which no industry, operator process or any treatment and disposal system can be established without the previous consent of the state pollution board, and no industry or process can discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer or land in excess of the standards.Violation of any order under the Water Act, for which no penalty has been provided elsewhere in its framework, is punishable with imprisonment up to three months with/or fine of up to ₹10,000. “As per our records, GMADA never applied for a no-objection certificate (NOC) or even PPCB’s consent before setting up IT City. They only have environment clearance for the project,” said Kuldeep Singh, executive engineer, PPCB. PPCB superintending engineer Paramjeet Singh said, “We will be summoning GMADA as they failed to file a reply to our notice. The file for the summoning date is with the chairman for approval.” When contacted, GMADA’s executive engineer Ranjiv Mankatalasaid, “I need to check the record for whether we filed a reply or not. Also, work on the STP will start soon.”In September, Hindustan Times had highlighted how despite the directions of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, GMADA had not constructed two sewage treatment plants (STPs) with 10 million litres per day (MLD) capacity. As a result, untreated sewage is being discharged into the N-Choe passing through IT City. In 2019, the development authority had built a portable STP of 500 KLD, but it has been lying defunct since then.A seasonal stream, N-Choe originates in the north of Chandigarh and runs across the city, before meeting the Jagatpura drain at Manauli village in Mohali. The water finally drains into Ghaggar river.Residents allege that untreated sewage in the water is leading to harmful waterborne pathogens and bacteria, which pose high risk to human and animal health. IT City is spread over 1,722 acres across Sectors 66B, 82A, 83A and 101A near the Airport Road, and has major IT companies, industrial and commercial units, residential areas and a private school, besides campuses of two major private universities. The first housing scheme in IT City was launched in February 2014 with 325 residential plots, the second scheme in July 2016 with 750 plots, and the last scheme in April 2018.

Today the inflation is rising at more than 14%. Such high inflation was not seen by the country in the last 30 years,” he said.While campaigning on the Panjab University (PU) campus for party candidate Sachin Galav, Kumar appealed to residents and stakeholders of the university to support the young candidates of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mcpollshelp-bring-back-chandigarh-s-lost-glory-kanhaiya-appeals-to-voters-101640121035333.html

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Curtains on campaigning, stage set for three-cornered contest||The pulsating campaign for the 2021 Chandigarh municipal corporation elections ended on Tuesday, making way for the 72-hour “silence period”, which will end at 5pm on December 24.Voting is scheduled for December 24 and results will be out on December 27. The State Election Commission will complete the election process by December 30.In a departure from previously established two-party battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, Chandigarh is set to see a three-cornered contest, with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also entering the fray from all 35 wards. While the AAP was first off the blocks by announcing a slew of “guarantees”, the BJP closely followed up with the release of its “achievements” list. The Congress, which entered the campaign mode rather slowly, made good of the lost ground quickly as the canvassing window neared its end.The last day saw the candidates taking out “padyatras” and door-to-door campaigning, though a few also organised public rallies.With no major untoward incident or grave personal mudslinging, the one-month campaign went off peacefully.But despite the election commission setting strict Covid guidelines in place, most candidates flouted the safety protocols unabashedly.Even in the backdrop of rising Covid cases in the city, political parties continued to gather large crowds as they went for show of strength over public health.Issues-based campaignThe BJP, striving to retain the MC House majority, made “development” and its “achievements” in the last six years as its main campaign planks. The grand old party, having lost three successive elections to the BJP, based its campaign on anti-incumbency factors, stressing how the saffron party “failed” the City Beautiful.Meanwhile, the AAP, after getting a drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and contesting its first MC polls in Chandigarh, centered its campaign around the “Delhi Model”.The bluntest attack on the ruling party came on the issue of the city slipping sharply in the Swachh Survekshan rankings. Both the Congress and the AAP targeted the BJP for not resolving the issue of Dadumajra dumping ground, poor running of solid waste processing plant and ill-managed door-to-door garbage collection in the city. In turn, the BJP blamed the Congress for the city’s garbage woes, particularly, the dysfunctional garbage processing plant. It also questioned AAP’s track record in cleaning up Delhi’s garbage mounds.General inflation, hike in water tariff and “high” garbage collection charges were other issues that opposition parties prominently raised.On Congress’s poll promise of “no new taxes”, the BJP countered stating that “such financial indiscipline by the Congress during its multiple terms” led to MC financial issues and forced it to hike some levies. The AAP was attacked on the freebies it announced. Both the Congress and the BJP dismissed these as either unworkable or unsubstantial. For instance, on AAP’s guarantee of “free water supply up to 20,000 litres per month”, the parties contended that this cost only around ₹40 per bill cycle in the city. “In Delhi after the free slab, the next slab is ₹24 per kilo litre,” claimed leaders of both the parties.After AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s rally, Congress and BJP’s attack on the “Delhi Model” and “guarantees” became shriller.Big guns for big pushAll three parties roped in “star campaigners” during the last one month.AAP’s campaign was kick-started with Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s interaction with city residents and peaked with Kejriwal’s public rally in Sector 43. Party’s Punjab chief and MP Bhagwant Mann, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and eight party MLAs also campaigned for it.Congress’s star campaigners included Kanhaiya Kumar, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Kumari Selja and Randeep Singh Surjewala. Manpreet Badal, Raj Kumar Verka and Mohinder Singh Kaypee were party’s prominent Punjab faces who pushed its campaign in the city. Delhi’s Alka Lamba and Himachal Pradesh’s Rajinder Rana also played key roles in campaigning.Twelve star campaigners through their 56 public rallies canvassed for the BJP candidates, in addition to door-to-door campaigns. Union ministers, including Som Prakash, Piyush Goyal, Ajay Bhatt, Nityanand Rai and Anurag Thakur held multiple public rallies. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari were also in the city to back the saffron fold’s candidates.

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||PU yet to grant extension of affiliation to colleges||Amid delays caused by the pandemic, Panjab University (PU) is yet to grant extension of affiliation to colleges for 2021-22 academic session, with almost half of the session already over.Although inspections have been conducted by the varsity’s committees at around 60 affiliated colleges this year, the matter is yet to be taken up for approval. PU has more than 190 affiliated colleges and nearly half of them are granted temporary affiliation every year. Usually, the inspection committees visit the colleges in April and May, following which reports are submitted.The reports, which may include the discrepancies pointed out by the committees and the compliance reports of the colleges, are taken up by the affiliation committee. The committee is constituted by the syndicate and in absence of the syndicate, it hasn’t been formed so far. Usually, the extension of affiliation is granted till September.The then syndicate in its meeting in May last year, had resolved that since physical inspections were not possible during the pandemic, information from the colleges will be sought online. Last year, no such visits were conducted. However, due to the improved situation, physical checks were carried out this time.As per sources, the varsity is in the process of forming a committee, which will take up extension of affiliation to the colleges for approval. A proposal in this regard has been submitted by the college branch to the varsity. Anju Suri, who has recently taken charge as the dean college development council (DCDC), said, “The inspections are almost over and they will be taken up by the approval committee shortly. We are doing our doing our best for the fast disposal of all colleges related matters.”
22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu got its rightful share for the first time, says BJP on delimitation proposal||Even as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have welcomed the draft proposal of the delimitation commission, granting six of the seven additional assembly seats in the union territory to Jammu, leaders of other political parties have termed it as an unbalanced act which will further aggravate divisions among the people of J&K.The commission redrawing poll constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir had on Monday proposed adding six assembly seats in the Jammu region and one in Kashmir. The three-member delimitation commission also proposed reserving nine seats for scheduled tribes and seven for scheduled castes, a first in the Union Territory. The panel presented the draft to five associate members, who belong to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Conference, and asked for their responses by December 31. If the proposal is cleared, the total number of poll constituencies will rise from 83 to 90, with 43 in the Jammu region and 47 in Kashmir. 24 seats will be kept aside for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. In the current state House, Jammu has 37 members and Kashmir has 46.Former J&K deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader Kavinder Gupta said draft proposal of the delimitation commission has done justice with the people of Jammu division. “Our region (Jammu) has more area and population. This is for the first time that people of Jammu have got their due share. The 2011 census was manipulated by those in power; now all wrong things have been set right by the delimitation commission. We are happy with the creation of new seats in the UT.”J&K state Congress president Raman Bhalla said they have asked for the draft of the proposal issued by the delimitation commission. “Only after going through the draft can we express our views. But one thing is clear; this will create divisions within the people of the two provinces. BJP is doing this to just satisfy its ego. Otherwise, there are proper guidelines on how such things should be done.”National Panthers Party chairman Harsh Dev Singh said the delimitation commission is working at the behest of BJP. “They just want to create a misunderstanding between the people of J&K. This delimitation should be done on merit. The aim of the delimitation commission is only to give BJP an opportunity for proxy rule in J&K. The commission should have told all the associate members which seats and regions they are carving out fresh in J&K. So, they (commission) has failed to accomplish anything during these 21 months. They want people to fight with each other so that elections get delayed and the BJP gets to rule J&K through its proxies.”Labha Gandhi, president, West Pakistan Refugee Action Committee, said that delimitation should be done as per the population and census criteria. “People in Kashmir are protesting because they think that by giving more seats to Jammu, the region will have closer seats to Kashmir.” Gandhi said after decades, they got the voting rights and the Commission should reserve some seats for West Pakistan refugees.PAGD spokesman and CPI(M) general secretary, Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, said on Monday night that a draft recommendation of the Delimitation Commission is divisive, and unacceptable. “It is another step to further disempower Kashmiris politically. It will increase gaps between regions and communities.”He said the constitution of Delimitation Commission under J&K Reorganisation Act-2019 in itself is questionable as the Reorganisation Act has been challenged in the Supreme Court. “The constitution of Delimitation Commission was akin to contempt of the court as how can the government of India do so when the matter is sub-judice.”He said they will continue with their legal and political fight against the arbitrary, unconstitutional and undemocratic decisions of the BJP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-got-its-rightful-share-for-the-first-time-says-bjp-on-delimitation-proposal-101640120614118.html

Krantikari Kisan Union leader Darshan Pal said, “In my personal opinion, the SKM should not take a plunge into politics as it would be injustice with the sentiments of farmers who supported the agitation for over a year.” Pal and Balbir Rajewal, among others, were honoured by students and employees of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in the university campus on Tuesday.Pal added, “Each farm leader and union has the right to take the path of their choice, but in my opinion, the SKM should not take a plunge into politics. The farmer across the country have faith in SKM that the Morcha will fight for betterment of the farming in the country as there are many other issues including debt waiver etc. Also, the agitation against the Union government has not ended, but has only been suspended. If the SKM leaders got involved in politics, then it will be injustice with the farmers.”Pal also thanked the students and faculty of PAU for imparting them the skill needed to find out the flaws in the now revoked farm laws.

22-12-2021||Gurugram||Auto driver tries to ‘kidnap’ woman in Gurugram’s Sector 22||An autorickshaw driver allegedly tried to ‘kidnap’ a woman, who was on her way home from the Sector 22 market on Sunday, forcing the woman to jump off the vehicle, which led to a minor injury, police said. The incident came to light after the woman, a resident of Sector 22, took to Twitter on Monday to explain her ordeal. Instead of driving the woman home, the auto driver allegedly drove in another direction and paid no heed to her requests, said the woman in the her tweet. After sharing her horrific experience on social media, Gurugram police took notice and approached her. Police said the woman, a communication specialist, took an auto from the auto stand of Sector 22 market around 12.20pm on Sunday for her home, which was just seven minutes away from the market. “I told the auto driver that I will pay through digital platform as I don’t have cash and looking at his setup which looked like he drives for cab aggregator, I thought he will be pretty much okay with that. He agreed and I sat in the auto. He was listening to devotional music at a reasonable volume,” said the woman in her tweet. After reaching the T-point from where the auto was supposed to take a right to reach the woman’s residence, the auto driver took left and started going in the opposite direction. “I asked him why he is taking a left. He didn’t listen, instead he started shouting,” she tweeted. The auto driver allegedly ignored her request and kept on blurting religious names. The woman hit the auto driver several times on his shoulder but he continued to drive. “The only thought that came to my mind was to jump out. The speed was between 35-40 km/Ph before he sped up, jumping out was the only option. I thought broken bones are better than getting lost. And I jumped out of the moving auto. I don’t know how I got that courage,” she said. After jumping from the auto, the woman started walking towards her home and kept on looking back to check if the auto driver was following her. She boarded an e-rickshaw on the way and reached her home safely. She was not able to note down the registration number of the auto. “I was in a different zone at the time of the incident and not able to note down the registration number,” she said. The woman tweeted about the incident on Twitter, where people reacted and asked her to approach police. She visited Palam Vihar police station on Tuesday. Meanwhile, police had approached her after coming across her tweet. “Visited Palam Vihar police station.

The teachers have been on strike for the past 49 days, after the government started recruitment process of assistant professors on a regular basis. Harminder Singh, president, Punjab Guest Faculty Assistant Professors’ Association, said, “The Punjab government is not serious about their demands. It is just wasting time by making lame assurances that our demand of regularisation is under consideration.”“In case, the government fails to fulfil our demand, we are going to launch door-to-door campaign against the Congress, asking people not to vote for them in upcoming assembly elections,” he said, adding that they had not even been allowed to pitch up tents for the protest, citing security reasons. “We have been left to brave the chilly weather,” he claimed. The state has 1,873 sanctioned posts of lecturers, of which 1,292 are vacant. Government colleges have 581 regular lecturers only. To deal with staff shortage, 882 guest faculty members and 251 part-time lecturers have been providing their services for nearly 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-college-guest-faculty-start-sit-in-outside-pargat-s-residence-101640118033773.html
22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: How BoI built its case for FIR against Akali leader Majithia||The Bureau of Investigation (BoI) built the case against former Shiromani Akali Dal minister Bikram Singh Majithia keeping as base the report prepared by ADGP Harpreet Singh Sidhu, chief of the special task force (STF) against drugs. The FIR was finally registered on the directions of Punjab DGP Sidharth Chattopadhyaya, after getting the backing of the advocate general’s opinion on December 1.The report by the STF chief which till now was in “sealed cover” has been made part of the FIR and is officially in public domain now. Earlier, there was confusion whether the government could act on it as the probe was done on the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court.The report reveals that while analysing the record given by the enforcement directorate, the STF chief had identified four issues: Whether Majithia had an association with drug accused Satpreet Satta, Maninder Singh Bittu Aulakh, Parminder Singh Pindi and Jagjit Chahal? Whether Satta, Chahal, Aulakh, Pindi and Laddi were involved in drug trade? Whether Majithia played a role in supply of pseudoephedrine to Satta and others? Whether there are any links regarding monetary transaction between Majithia and others?Association with SattaThe STF chief’s report says that as Majithia told the ED that Satta may have stayed with him a few times, the allegations of providing vehicles and security to Satta and Satta’s involvement in Majithia’s elections are believable. “On this, the report has recommended that Pindi and Laddi be questioned by the investigating agency,” the report said. Involvement in drug tradeOn involvement of Satta, Pindi, Laddi, Aulakh, and Chahal in the drug trade, the STF chief said as per the statements recorded by the ED, it is clear that all are allegedly involved in offences relating to smuggling of drugs and money laundering related to profits from drugs. Supply of pseudoephedrineOn allegations of Majithia’s role in supply of pseudoephedrine to Satta and others, the report says: “Analysing all statements (by Chahal and Aulakh), it is evident that Majithia had a role in facilitating supply of pseudoephedrine to Satta and Pindi.”It further states that knowledge and intention on the part of Majithia to facilitate supply of pseudoephedrine to Satta and Pindi is clear. “However, as Majithia has denied these allegations, the degree and support and facilitation provided by Majithia and consideration for which such support was provided is to be clarified by further investigation of parties involved,” reads the report. Monetary transactionsOn Majithia’s monetary transactions with other accused, the STF chief had relied on Chahal’s statement to the ED claiming that a payment of ₹35 lakh was allegedly made to the then minister in about seven to eight instalments between 2007 and 2012. “At this time, Chahal was allegedly involved in manufacturing/supply of illegal drugs. As Majithia has denied receiving any funds from Chahal, they need to be investigated further,” reads the report. The investigation will involve examining financial transactions made by persons who are close associates and partners of family members of all those involved in the case to uncover whether their assets and investments generated from genuine earnings or are from “benami,” the report said. “It is based on the these findings that the report concluded that prima facie there is sufficient evidence on record to further investigated the role of Majithia as regards the allegations made in the application under inquiry,” the STF chief concluded. Majithia has repeatedly termed STF chief biasedMajithia, however, has repeatedly termed findings by the STF chief as biased, claiming that Harpreet Singh Sidhu was his estranged cousin and has a personal family grudges. When this report was leaked in a section of media in 2018, Majithia had accusedthe STF chief of colluding with Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu against him. Even BoI head SK Asthana has raised doubt over the STF chief’s probe. “In all fairness, Sidhu should have recused himself from carrying out any probe against Majithia, which less submit his opinion-cum-status report before the high court,” Asthana had written. The letter of the Punjab DGP, which is also part of the FIR, reveals that the orders over invoking sections of the NDPS Act were also directed by the DGP office to the BoI. “On the basis of the STF status report and opinion of AG, a cognisable offence is made out and therefore a case be registered,” stated the DGP in the letter. In cases mentioned in the report and associated cases of drug trafficking, it is essential that offences under Section 24, 27A and 29 of the NDPS Act, apart from additional offences which are indicated or emerge later, need to be investigated, stated the letter.Notable, the ED has not taken any action against Majithia even after statements of Aulakh and Chahal. Even Asthana had pointed it out in the leaked letter that when the agency that originally probed the case did not file any challan against Majithia, how could the Punjab Police do so. Bikram Singh Majithia: He became a minister in the SAD government in 2007 after getting elected for the first time from Majithia constituency, and won in 2012 and 2017 too. Brother-in-law of SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, he overshadowed many senior leaders, but found himself in the eye of controversy after drug lord Jagdish Bhola pointed to his involvement in the illegal trade in Punjab. Jagdish Bhola: A former international wrestler and sacked DSP, he was the kingpin of drug racket that was busted by Punjab Police in 2013. An Arjuna awardee, Bhola has properties worth crores. He was the first one to name Bikram Singh Majithia in the drug case, before the media while being produced in court in Mohali in January 2014. He was convicted in 2018. Jagjit Singh Chahal: A pharmaceutical businessman based in Amritsar, he was named by Bhola as the drug supplier. Police made huge recoveries from his firms in Baddi in 2013. He alleged involvement of three NRIs — Satpreet Satta, Pindi, Laddi — and told ED that Satta used to stay at Majithia’s official residence. He has been convicted. The three NRIs have not been apprehended yet. Maninder Singh Bittu Aulakh: An Amritsar-based Akali leader, who is into tyres business, he was arrested for supplying drugs in 2013. He told the ED in 2015 that Satta, Pindi and Laddi were doing business dealings with Chahal, which was in Majithia’s knowledge. In 2018, he got bail from the Punjab and Haryana high court. KNOW THE RACKET BUSTERS Niranjan Singh: Former deputy director in the enforcement directorate, Niranjan questioned Majithia, ex-minister Sarwan Singh Phillaur and other politicians in the case. He alleged political pressure a number of times, and was transferred to Kolkata in the middle of investigation, but it was stayed by the high court. He retired in June this year. Harpreet Singh Sidhu: A 1992-batch IPS officer, he was serving on deputation in CRPF before being brought back by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to head the special task force against drugs in 2017. Due to his aggressive style, the ADGP locked horns with senior police functionaries. He was tasked with analysing the ED probe on Majithia and give the status report. Navkiran Singh: A Chandigarh-based lawyer and general secretary of Lawyers For Human Rights International, he got associated with the drugs case in 2014 as an “intervener” and has followed it up since then. He filed fresh application seeking opening of 2018 sealed reports of STF in April this year. He has doggedly pursued the legal battle on the drug issue.

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||After bypoll defeat, BJP trying to regain its lost ground in Himachal with PM Modi rally||In a bid to reconsolidate its position in the hill state after a major drubbing in the recently conducted bypolls, the Himachal government, led by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, has marked mega celebrations, which include a rally by the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, to mark the completion of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s four-year rule in the state. The PM will address a rally in Mandi’s Paddal ground on December 27. He is also scheduled to lay foundation stones and inaugurate different developmental projects to the tune of ₹11,279 crore. This is the PM’s first visit to Himachal after the party’s debacle in the bypolls. Recently, the party’s national president Jagat Parkash Nadda had visited Bilaspur to inaugurate the outpatient department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Modi will lay the foundation stone of the ₹6,946-crore Multipurpose Renuka Dam to be constructed on a tributary of Yamuna river. It is meant to supply 23 cusecs of water to Delhi and also generate 40 MW of electricity for Himachal Pradesh. The project will also supply water to Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand. “The proposed dam will be built across the Giri tributary of Yamuna. He will also inaugurate Sawra-Kuddu Hydle project and lay the foundation stone for ₹210 megawatt Luhri stage and Dhaulasidh hydel power project,” said chief minister Jai Ram Thakur while briefing the media on the four-year celebration. Thakur admitted that the party’s defeat in the bypoll was a learning experience for him. He had been laying low after his party loss in the three assemblies, Arki, Fatehpur, Jubbal and Kotkhai, and the prestigious Mandi Lok Sabha seat. Party claimed that the sympathy wave after former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s death worked in his widow Pratibha Singh’s favour.“The defeat in the byelection will lead to the door of victory in the 2022 assembly polls as BJP has been alerted by the defeat. The public doesn’t vote in the name of tribute, and the sympathy factor doesn’t always work. The situation will be altogether different in 2022, and BJP will repeat the government.” BJP had organised a rally to mark its first-year rule in Dharamshala and Union home minister Amit Shah and national President Jagat Parkash Nadda had attended its second year’s celebration on a historic ridge in Shimla. Responding to claims of the CM not having a grip on the bureaucracy of the state, Thakur said, “Even CMs who supposedly had a grip on the bureaucracy could not repeat their government in Himachal Pradesh.” He added that he did not work with the motive of vendetta or vengeance and has made efforts to rise above the politics of regionalism to ensure the equal development of state.
22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Political action should not be taken to satisfy ego: Punjab BJP chief on Majithia drug case||Political action should not be taken to satisfy one’s ego or for political vendetta, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Punjab chief Ashwani Sharma said on Tuesday while reacting to a drug case registered against former cabinet minister and senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia.“The guilty should be punished at all costs... However, questions will be raised on the timing, as to why action is being taken after over four-and-a-half years,” said Sharma, questioning the Congress government’s failure to “work seriously” towards making Punjab a drug-free state.“The BJP has a clear stand that action should not be taken with political motive, but the drug accused should not be spared, whether one is a big man or anyone else. Eventually, the court will decide who is guilty,” said the BJP leader, who was in Sangrur to hold a meeting with party workers ahead of the assembly elections.Sharma said the BJP has given the slogan of “Nawa Punjab” (New Punjab), as the Congress and Akali governments had failed to address decades old issues of corruption, drug and illegal mining. “We will make a corruption-free and drug-free Punjab. Those who want to be part of this journey will be welcomed,” he said.Questioned about some tainted Congress leaders joining the saffron party, he said: “The BJP is working with its philosophy. Every person who believes in the party’s ideology and has a clean image will be inducted.”

The submissions was made during the resumed hearing of a plea from Dera Sacha Sauda head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who has approached the HC, seeking that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should be asked to continue with the probe into sacrilege FIRs of 2015. The plea was filed on December 13 and seeks quashing of the notification of September 6, 2018 by Punjab government wide which the consent given to CBI to investigate three FIRs of sacrilege cases has been withdrawn. It has also sought directions that CBI be tasked with to continue the probe into these FIRs. It also prays that the probe by the special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab police be stayed. Ram Rahim is lodged in the Sunaria jail in Rohtak following his conviction in two rape cases and two murder cases, all of 2002. Punjab Police have questioned him twice this year, in its probe into sacrilege cases. Recently, many other dera functionaries have also been quizzed by the SIT. According to the Punjab Police, the dera head has emerged as a main “conspirator”. As per the dera head, the statement which is being cited as basis for launching this probe against him was obtained in July 2020. But now suddenly, SIT has swung into action. The SIT probe is for the sole purpose of “implicating” the petitioner and members of the Dera Sacha Sauda and gain electoral benefit in February 2022 polls in Punjab, he claims. The plea also says that Vidhan Sabha has no power to enter into working of the executive and the resolution of August 2018 on withdrawal of cases from the CBI and entrusting it to state police SIT is hit by the separation of powers between legislators and executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-to-file-status-report-on-probe-in-sacrilege-cases-by-jan-21-101640117501891.html
22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab AAP on drug case: Also book those who shielded Majithia||Aam Aadmi Party leader Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday blamed Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for the “mess” created by drugs and sacrilege incidents in Punjab.Addressing political rallies at Jandiala Guru and Bholath assembly segments in Amritsar and Kapurthala districts, respectively, the Punjab AAP chief and Sangrur MP said that the Charanjit Singh Channi government should not just register a drug case against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia but also against those who had been “protecting” him for four-and-a-half years. “During the SAD-BJP government, many youths had succumbed to drug addiction and the situation continued even during the Congress government. The Congress has not done anything against Bikram Majithia in the drug case for the last five years, and has now registered an FIR. But who is responsible for drug-related deaths during the last five years?” said Mann. Mann said that after forming the Congress government, Amarinder had sworn on Gutka Sahib that he would wipe out the drug problem and provide employment to every household, but he “continued to rest at his palace in Siswan”. Criticising the present government, Mann said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu and other leaders were always fighting among themselves. He said the CM should have a vision or a policy for his people and baseless announcements will not suffice. “People of Punjab had sought resolution of all their issues from the Congress and Akalis for 70 years, but the diseases of debt, corruption, unemployment and drug addiction had not been cured. It is time to change the regime,” said Mann, adding that AAP supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had proved that everything can be improved when the common man comes to power. ‘An election stunt’Meanwhile, AAP’s Punjab co-in-charge Raghav Chadha termed the FIR against Majithia an “election stunt” of the ruling Congress. Chadha said the Channi government had only one week left as the election code of conduct would be implemented by the end of December. “The Congress government is trying to make fool out of the people of Punjab by doing the drama of FIR,” he claimed at a press conference here. Chadha said the Congress government did not take any action or conduct any major investigation for almost five years, but had now registered the FIR with just days left for the elections. “If the Congress government really wanted to bring justice to the people in the drug case, then why no major investigation or action has been taken since March 16, 2017, the day the Congress came in power in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-aap-on-drug-case-also-book-those-who-shielded-majithia-101640117500431.html
22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drug case against Majithia an act of vendetta, abuse of power: Badals||Reacting to the registration of a drug case against former Shiromani Akali Dal minister Bikram Singh Majithia, party patriarch Parkash Singh Badal said on Tuesday that he was apprehending such an action by the Congress government in Punjab. Talking to media persons at his native village Badal in Muktsar, the former chief minister called the case “false, shameful and an act of vendetta”. Badal alleged that the government had transferred three directors general of police as “none was willing to register a false case”. “Generally, DGPs are not transferred in a quick succession. Finally, the government deputed him (S. Chattopadhyaya) to send the Badals and Majithia into the jail,” said Badal. Asking the state government to stop making futile efforts, Badal said that he was ready to face arrest and would reach wherever the government asks him to. “Congress governments have always tried to weaken Punjab and Akali Dal. However, when I was the chief minister, I never troubled any Congress leader. Because when in government, parties work for the entire state,” said Badal.Sukhbir warns those ‘abusing official positions’Meanwhile, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who was in Amritsar on Tuesday, lashed out the Congress government for ”falsely implicating” his brother-in-law in the drug case and warned “those abusing their official positions and playing havoc with the rule of law to be ready to face legal consequences”.“The case has long been decided by competent courts and the guilty are already serving terms of the sentence. The Congress government and its hand-picked instruments have flouted all legal and administrative norms and thrown the rule of law to the winds just to play politics on one of the most sensitive issues facing Punjab today,” said Sukhbir. ‘Trying to divert attention from sacrilege cases’The party also held a press conference in Chandigarh, where leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema said that at a time when the state wants peace and harmony, the Congress government had filed a “fabricated” case against Majithia after failing to implicate top Akali leadership in sacrilege cases. Terming the Congress government move “an unsuccessful attempt to divert attention from its failure in taking action in the case of Golden Temple sacrilege, Grewal said the FIR in the drug case relates to an incident that had occurred in 2004 during a time when the Congress was in power in the state. “The report of the special task force (STF) led by Harpreet Sidhu has been reproduced in the FIR. The Congress government should explain how it has reproduced a report which is lying in a sealed envelope in the high court in the FIR,” Grewal added. He also asked the state government to disclose the contents of the report of the two-member committee of the ACS and the state DGP, which superseded the report of the STF, and was also kept in a sealed envelope with Punjab and Haryana high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drug-case-against-majithia-an-act-of-vendetta-abuse-of-power-badals-101640117498860.html

This will cause a fresh spell of snow in the higher reaches and rains in the middle hills, said Surender Paul, head of Shimla MeT Centre.The weather will be relatively dry in the plains, he said.He said the weather was dry across the state on Tuesday. Minimum temperatures have increased by 1-2°C.

However, over the next four days, the minimum temperature is likely to rise and will be around 8°C, the IMD said.On Monday, the city had reported a minimum temperature of 7°C. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 21.4°C in Gurugram, which was one degree below normal, the IMD said. “Over the next four days, a gradual rise in minimum temperature by 3-5°C is very likely over most parts of Punjab and Haryana, and no significant change thereafter. On December 23-24, dense fog is likely in the districts of south and south-east Haryana which include Gurugram and Faridabad. A yellow alert asking authorities to be prepared has been issued for these two days,” said Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre Chandigarh, a regional centre of IMD. According to the weekly forecast of the IMD, the city will witness partly cloudy sky till December 26 and there is a possibility of rain or thunderstorm on December 27. Over the next four days, the maximum temperature will be around 22°C, the forecast said. Weather experts said that temperatures will rise over the next few days due to the impact of two back-to-back western disturbances in the Himalayan region, which will increase humidity and moisture in the plains. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “On Tuesday, Gurugram recorded a sharp drop in minimum temperature, which was the result of dry and cold northerly winds. But from Wednesday, we are expecting that temperatures will increase and the prevailing cold wave conditions will cease. This is because with western disturbance, the northernly flow of icy cold winds get obstructed and wind direction changes to south-easterly, which is relatively warmer and humid.” He further said with increase in temperature and high moisture content in the air, pollution levels will also start increasing due to comparatively lesser wind speed which is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Gurugram recorded ‘very poor’ quality of air with an air quality index of 314, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. On Monday, the city had recorded an AQI of 284 which was in the ‘poor’ category. According to the weather bulletin issued on Tuesday by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR, the air quality over the national capital territory is likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday and Thursday also owing to slow or calm winds and poor ventilation conditions. The air quality is likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category till December 25 and improve thereafter and significant improvement may be seen from December 27 onwards, the weather bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-4-8-degrees-gurugram-records-season-s-lowest-temperature-101640116474977.html

On Tuesday, 7,723 people were vaccinated in the district, according to data shared by the health department. Till now, over 4.13 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in Gurugram. “Gurugram has become the first district in Haryana, and perhaps in the National Capital Region also, to successfully vaccinate 100% of its eligible population with both doses of vaccine against Covid-19. This is a milestone for us, as Gurugram was one of the worst affected districts during the second wave of the pandemic. But our focus will still remain on vaccinating more people. More than 128% of the eligible population have been given the first dose while second dose coverage stood at around 101% as of Tuesday,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram while addressing the media. In Gurugram, 1,803,656 people were eligible for Covid-19 vaccination.

What helped achieve 100% vaccinationYadav further said that different initiatives -- drive-through vaccination sessions in malls, special vaccination camps for the third gender and specially abled, vaccination camps on the 9th of every month for pregnant women, vaccination at religious places, offices, and condominiums -- helped achieve this feat within 11 months, since the vaccination campaign was rolled out in the country on January 16. What’s next The district health department has decided to start conducting surveys of 1,000 people at random in different localities and identify those who are yet to take either dose of vaccine and then vaccinate them. “We will be conducting surveys in different localities, both rural and urban, where 1,000 people at random will be identified who are yet to take their Covid-19 vaccine. This will help in planning how to proceed with the vaccination campaign further. We have not decided when this survey will start,” said the CMO. The officials also said that the data of children between 0 to 6 years and 6 to 18 years of age is being collected. This will be used in future when guidelines are issued to start vaccination among children, they said. Gurugram reports highest single-day cases since June Meanwhile, with 23 fresh Covid-19 cases, Gurugram on Tuesday reported the highest number of positive cases in a single day in the past six months, said the officials, adding that 10 recoveries were also reported from the district on Tuesday.

Earlier, Congress MLA Mamman Khan (Ferozepur Jhirka), of Nuh district, had also raised the matter, objecting to Khattar’s recent remarks over ‘namaaz’ being held in public places.Both Ahmed and Khan demanded that the CM should withdraw his statement.However, the CM said it is the responsibility of all to ensure there is no social confrontation and a peaceful atmosphere is maintained. He said people of all faiths hold prayers at designated religious places such as temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras and that permissions are given to organise big festivals and programmes in the open.“Gurugram is a symbol of development. What message is being sent out from Gurugram when one cannot offer prayers as per one’s choice?” the Congress MLA said, adding some elements are repeatedly disrupting Friday prayers.“The Constitution gives the right to practice one’s religion. No one has the right to disrupt prayers,” the Congress legislator said.On the other hand, Khattar said people have agreed to hold Friday prayers at certain places in Gurugram till new arrangements are made. “The good thing is that some places have been identified as per a consensus till new arrangements are made. When consensus is breached and some people hold prayers outside the agreed upon spots, it leads to confrontation,” Khattar said, advising the Opposition MLAs not to flare up this issue as this can spoil communal harmony.Khattar said there are annual events of all faiths be it Dussehra, Ram Lila, Urs, and these are held with due permission.“But in routine, daily or weekly (prayers), there are designated places,” he said, even as Ahmed demanded that ‘eidgahs’ and mosques should be freed from illegal encroachments in Gurugram so that Muslims are not forced to offer prayers in open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/converting-prayer-meetings-into-show-of-strength-is-not-good-says-khattar-101640115454088.html

The government is in denial over shortage of DAP.Congress’ Kalanwali MLA Shishpal Singh Keharwala said the government is denying DAP shortage the same way it denied oxygen shortage during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Responding to the notice, state agriculture minister JP Dalal said there is no shortage of fertilisers in state. “For sowing of wheat and mustard, the state government has sufficient quantity of fertilisers available. Till now, about 6.93 lakh metric tonne (MT) urea, 2.82 lakh metric tonne DAP, more than 1 lakh tonne SSP, and more than 41,000 NPK is available, of which, 6.24 lakh MT urea, 2.60 lakh MT DAP, 79,000 MT SSP, and 38,661 MT NPK have been provided to farmers,” Dalal said.The minister said strict action has been taken against black marketing of fertilisers. He said in 22 districts, 61 complaints were received, 157 show-cause notices were issued, 88 licenses were suspended, and 20 FIRs were registered. Besides this, 1,685 teams have conducted continuous raids to curb black marketing.Dalal said consumption of DAP in the last rabi season was 2.58 lakh MT whereas during the current season, 2.57 lakh MT has been made available up to December 15, which is at par with last year’s consumption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/opposition-draws-attention-towards-fertiliser-shortage-in-haryana-101640115033611.html

To a pointed query, he retorted by saying that it was not clear that on what basis had the government registered the case against Majithia, since the report on drug trafficking was still lying with the Punjab and Haryana high court in a sealed cover.“After all, there is rule of law in the country and I am sure it will not stand legal scrutiny in a court of law,” he said, adding, “Just because you don’t like someone, you can’t put him behind bars.”‘No justification for lynching’On the lynching incidents that followed the two sacrilege bids, the former CM condemned the killings. “The accused should have been handed over to the police,” he said, in town to attend a meeting of his party, the Punjab Lok Congress. At the meeting, senior Congress leader Jagdish Kumar Jagga joined Amarinder’s party. “No civilised society can and should approve of such killings,” he added, when asked for his view on the lynching incidents, adding, “Overall, there is no justification for mob lynching, whatsoever.”On the issue of people’s anger boiling over due to the delay in justice in Behbal Kalan sacrilege case, Capt said, “My government had pursued the case from Day 1. First, the state had to fight a long legal battle to get back the inquiry from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Investigation then began and 22 persons, including police officials and civilians, were arrested. They are out on bail now.”He added that national security and the welfare of Punjab was on the top of his priorities, and hoped that next PLC-BJP government will be voted to power and set thins right.

22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Rice fortification: Procurement agencies asks food and supplies dept to follow central guidelines||Two Haryana government agencies involvement in the procurement of fortified rice kernels (FRK) have raised a red flag citing delays by five companies empanelled by the Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department in supplying the fortified rice kernels.This comes close on the heels of allegations of anomalies and cartelisation in allotment of tenders for supply of FRK to three Maharashtra-based companies. The allegations were levelled by Haryana FRK Manufacturers’ Association.Under the central government’s fortification drive, rice fortified with micronutrients will be made available at ration shops for mid-day meal and every scheme by 2024. Rice fortification, a process of adding micronutrients such as iron, folic acid and Vitamin B12, is aimed at combating anaemia due to malnutrition and is regarded as an effective and preventive measure to address the nutrition problem.The two state agencies – HAFED and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (HSWC), while quoting the guidelines of the central government have written to the director general of Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, asking it to allow rice millers to take FRK from all FRK manufacturers holding Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license instead of restricting them to obtain supply from of FRK from empanelled manufacturers.Director general of Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, Vijay Dahiya, however, said HAFED has been supplied about 600 metric tonne (MT) FRK and HSWC has been supplied about 380 MT.“Further, 13,093 MT fortified CMR has been supplied by the millers of our department, HAFED and HSWC till date. We are taking up the matter with HAFED,” he said.‘Non-delivery viewed seriously by Centre’However, a December 20 communication from HAFED said most district managers have informed that the shortlisted firms for the supply of FRK have not supplied even a single bag of FRK to rice mills allotted to HAFED due to which delivery of custom milled rice (CMR) is suffering badly.The Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (HSWC), in a December 17 communication to the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, said the central government is very particular regarding procurement of fortified rice in a time-bound manner to meet the requirement of targeted customers.“The present status of non-delivery of fortified rice has been viewed seriously by the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution. The Union ministry had, on November 16, clarified that there is no need to separately empanel FRK manufacturers by the state government. Instead, all FSSAI license holders should be asked for FRK supplies,” the communication said.‘Delay by empanelled manufacturers hampering delivery’The HSWC further said five FRK manufacturers empanelled by the Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department for supply of FRK to all procuring agencies in the state were not supplying FRK to the state warehousing corporation as per its requirement.“This has seriously hampered the delivery of fortified rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI). There is a possibility of not achieving the target of FRK delivery within the given time frame,” the HSWC said.The corporation also wrote that non-supply by empanelled manufacturers is causing severe resentment among the rice millers as they will not be able to achieve the month-wise schedule of the CMR delivery and may have to pay holding charges due to the delays.“Under the circumstances, rice millers should be given liberty to take FRK from all FSSAI licensed manufacturers at the rate of their choice but not above ₹59.85 per kg plus taxes finalised by the Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department so that pace of supply is accelerated and the target of delivery of 3.78 lakh metric tonne is achieved by the HSWC within the given time frame,” the communication said.

The state government, according to them, is all set to make an amendment in this regard, besides making some other amendments to the School Bus Rules, 2019 very soon for greater safety of school children who travel by buses. “The proposed amendments will be put before the Cabinet within a week or two,” they said. One amendment proposal seeks to fix the age limit for all school buses at 15 years after which they would not be deemed fit to ply on the road. The present rules cap life of buses owned and operated by schools (educational institutions) at 15 years and those that are owned by individuals/private operators and used to transport school children on a contract permit, at 10 years. “The idea behind keeping lower age limit for school buses owned by those other than school managements was that such buses become unfit sooner because they ply more than school-owned buses that operate only for the limited purpose of ferrying children,” said a senior transport official. “But transporters had been demanding an increase in the school bus age limit for long,” he added. The second amendment proposal is for increasing the number of fire extinguisher cylinders to two from one in school buses. Under the current rules, each school bus is supposed to have one 5kg cylinder installed inside it. “There is a proposal for installing two such cylinders of 2 kg each at two different places in every school bus for greater safety,” the official said. The government will also adopt Automotive Industry Standards (AIS) for windows and gates of school buses through yet another amendment and also insert a fresh provision, allowing school buses to carry children one and a half time their seating capacity . “As per a Supreme Court ruling, a school bus can ferry children up to one and a half times its seating capacity, considering the fact that many children travelling in a school bus may be less than 12 years and now we are putting this provision in school bus rules also for clarity,” the official said. He said school buses rules were framed and notified in 2019 and some amendments were being made after a lot of discussion with stakeholders.

All the girls whose videos were found were students of a leading dance school in Kanpur,” said a police official. Station house officer (SHO) of Govind Nagar, Rohit Tiwari said, “The accused Aryan Soni, a resident of F Block Dabauli, used to rape the minor and teenage girls, and make videos of the criminal act to blackmail them.

The protesters, majority of whom are women who work as beauticians, said that they came on Monday to discuss the matter with the company but their concerns were not heard by the management. So, they decided to sit on indefinite protest till the matter is resolved, the protesters said. Sitting outside the company gate on a freezing evening, Seema Singh, a Delhi resident who has been working with the company for the past four years, said that the web-based platform is planning to introduce a subscription system whereby ₹3,000 will be charged from prime partners and ₹2,000 will be charged from classic partners under the garb of ‘minimum guarantee’ plan. “Why should we be forced to pay money to the company to get work. We closed our salons and shops to work flexibly and now we are being asked to pay for getting the same work. We want the previous system with no such subscriptions,” said Singh, who also got a legal notice from the company on Tuesday. The protesters claimed that workers from across Delhi-NCR are supporting them. “All the workers want is a fair relationship, with both sides making money, but this is not happening. The things are getting worse, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a protester, who wished anonymity. Gunjan Choudhary, another partner, said that this entire subscription model is skewed heavily in favour of the company and would make life very difficult for the salon partners. “We are paying 25 to 30% of our earnings as commission to the company. We are buying products from the company, despite that the management is not ready to listen to our problems,” she said. The protesting women also said that workers in ‘Flexi’ category are denied work from Monday to Thursday. Rikta Kumaraswamy, NCR coordinator, All India Gig Workers Union, said that the company is also asking better performing partners to provide 10% discount from their own income to customers. “The partners use their skills to earn, spend on commuting, and buy products of the company, but they are being fleeced. This matter must be probed by the labour department,” she said. Usha Saroha, a city-based trade union activist, alleged that women on protest were denied access to washrooms by the company on Tuesday and they were also being intimidated. “We are with the workers and will continue the protest till justice is meted out,” she said.Representatives of the Urban Company did not reply to phone calls, messages and emails from HT seeking a response on the matter. The protesting partners also revealed that the company management has issued a legal notice to four employees. The notice, a copy of which is with HT, states “That the plaintiff premises in Gurugram are under threat of violence and the plaintiff is deeply concerned that once again a mass mob may gather. Given the extent of illegal activities by the defendants and other unknown accomplices this may result in riots at the premises and in other parts of Gurugram.”In view of the emerging situation, the company has also sought appropriate directions from the court seeking police assistance to disperse the protesters from the premises. “We have received this legal notice and we will take appropriate steps,” said Singh.

He not only asked us about our experiences but also motivated us to do better in our lives and also make efforts to change lives of those around us,” said Yashoda of Sultanpur, a newly appointed banking correspondent-Sakhi. “Earlier, people in the village knew me because of my husband and father-in-law. But now I have an identity of my own. I told Modiji how I feel empowered and how people approach me for help,” said Reema Maurya, BC-Sakhi of Pratapagrah. Poonam of Gautam Buddh Nagar, who is also a BC Sakhi, said people in her village now call her ‘Bank Didi’. Under the BC Sakhi scheme, the government had decided to deploy banking correspondent women in rural areas so that people of rural areas do not face any problem in doing money transactions and at the same time these women could also get certain employment.“The scheme is bringing a lot of change in our lives. Not only women, men also approach us for their work. Though the commission is less than expected, we are getting the honour that we deserved,” shared Poonam. Beneficiaries of Kanya Sumangala Yojna also shared similar views. Among others who got a chance to meet the PM was Ishika Verma, 14, one of the beneficiaries of Kanya Sumangala Yojna, who lost her father a few years ago and had come to attend the event with her mother. “I had a chance to meet the PM and even got photographs clicked with him and the chief minister,” said Palak Mishra, 13, of Pratapgarh. “The PM asked how I was doing in studies and if I was facing any difficulties.

We have decided to organise the lucky draw and live telecast the procedures... After Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the Noida international airport in Jewar, the demand for these plots have increased manifold,” said Singh.The Yeida has 67 plots within the range of ₹4,000 square metres, and six plots for a cost of above ₹4,000 square metres... The old rule for allotting smaller plots within the range of ₹4,000 square metres through a lucky draw is still in place, but that of allotting bigger sized industrial plots through a lucky draw has changed after the increase in the number of applications against one plot.“There were hardly one or two applicants for bigger sized plots earlier. It was easy to take an interview of the applicant(s), after scrutinising the documents. But now, inquiries against these six plots for a cost of above ₹4,000 square metres are such that we are expecting a large number of applicants, and selecting one out of all the applicants would not be easy. A lucky draw will be the best way to end discretion in decision making,” said Singh.The Yeida said that lucky draws for allotment of bigger plots will continue in the future, too. It is likely to bring another industrial plot scheme in Sector 10, just near the airport, where the plots will be allotted through a lucky draw.

According to the order dated December 13, following serious complaints of financial and mental harassment faced by government school teachers working in the district, a committee was constituted under the basic education department in September and a preliminary inquiry report was submitted to the government on October 12. “The inquiry report revealed that the BSA first rejected the child care leave of a female teacher without any reason and approved it later. Saxena has also been found guilty of mentally harassing teachers in name of surprise inspection,” the order states. It further says that in view of being found guilty of irregularities and inappropriate behaviour, disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against the BSA. “It has been decided to designate the Divisional Joint Director of Education, Meerut Division, as ex-officio inquiry officer for the completion of the said disciplinary proceedings,” said the order by the secretary of the basic education department, Anamika Singh. The BSA has been ordered to cooperate with the investigation, so that if found guilty, appropriate action can be taken at the earliest.Saxena refuted the allegations. “All allegations levelled against me are baseless. In the investigation that was carried out between September and October this year, I had cooperated with the officials and also proved the allegations wrong. Still, I have been found guilty. This is a conspiracy of the teachers against me. I am sure the inquiry report will acquit me from the allegations,” said the basic education officer. 
22-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man found dead at GK-1 home was not murdered, say police||A day after a 36-year-old man was found dead at his Greater Kailash flat, police said that according to the autopsy surgeon, he was not smothered to death. They added the possible reason for his death could be 70-80% heart blockage, which may have been caused by substance abuse.The deceased man, identified as Rahul Thakur, was found dead at home by his landlord, who informed the police. Soon after, a police team rushed to the spot and took the man to the hospital, where he was formally declared dead on arrival.“After the post-mortem examination, the autopsy surgeon informed us verbally that there was no evidence of smothering. Further, the possible reason for death could be due to 70-80% heart blockage, which could have been due to substance abuse. The final report is expected in two or three days. No arrests have been made yet. There is no official confirmation from doctors about the post-mortem examination. All things will be clear once the report is received. All the people the deceased was in touch with are being interrogated to get clarity about the possible sequence of events on that day,” DCP (south) Benita Mary Jaiker said.Thakur had been living at the GK house with his mother, but she was not home at the time of the incident, police said. Police said Thakur was from Jammu & Kashmir and worked at the Delhi Haat Art Gallery. “He had rented the house just one month ago and his mother had gone to their hometown in J&K a few days ago. We found three mobile phones in the house as well. We are enquiring into the matter,” the DCP said on Monday.Another police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that they scanned CCTV camera footage from the vicinity and saw a person entering Thakur’s house with him and leaving after some time. He was also one of the few people questioned after the incident. Police said on Monday that they registered a case of murder after the incident was reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-found-dead-at-gk-1-home-was-not-murdered-say-police-101640110233085.html
22-12-2021||Delhi||Cold wave persists in Delhi, but IMD says mercury may rise soon||Parts of the national capital recorded cold wave conditions for the third consecutive day on Tuesday, with Safdarjung, Delhi’s base observatory, recording a minimum of 4 degrees Celsius (°C) – four notches below normal. Mercury dipped even further at Ayanagar and Lodhi Road weather stations, dropping down to 3.8°C and 3.7°C, respectively. Delhi had recorded its coldest morning of the season so far on Monday, when Safdarjung recorded a low of 3.2°C. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the impact of three successive active western disturbances may cause cold wave conditions to abate across northern India from Wednesday onwards, with the minimum temperature expected to rise to 7°C in Delhi by Thursday. IMD has also forecast a spell of rain on December 27. “We had been forecasting that the spell between December 18 and 21 will be the most severe so far this winter season and cold wave conditions will come to an end due to a series of western disturbances. The western disturbance on December 22 will be feeble and may raise minimum and maximum temperatures by a degree or so. We will then see another weak western disturbance from December 24 onwards which could lead to cloudy skies over Delhi. However, a third western disturbance from December 26 onwards will be the most active and is likely to bring rain to Delhi on December 27,” said R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD. On Tuesday, Delhi’s saw a maximum temperature of 22.4°C, a degree above normal. This is expected to touch 23°C by Wednesday and 24°C on Thursday, but Jenamani said it could drop sharply from December 26-28. “The minimum temperature will start rising and could touch 10°C by December 27, but rain and cloudy conditions could lead to a cold day. The third western disturbance is likely to influence Delhi-NCR from December 26-29,” he addedThe weather department declares a cold day if the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees below normal. It announces a cold wave if the day’s low is either 4.5 degrees below normal, or below 4°C . IMD said the criteria for a cold wave was satisfied at Lodhi road, Safdarjung and Ayanagar stations on Tuesday as per the IMD. IMD has predicted shallow fog in the early hours of Wednesday, with the minimum and maximum temperatures hovering between 5°C and 23°C. Last December, the lowest minimum recorded during the month was 3.3°C -- recorded on the last day of the month. In 2019, it fell down to 2.4°C on December 28, while in 2018, it fell down to 2.6°C on December 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cold-wave-persists-in-delhi-but-imd-says-mercury-may-rise-soon-101640109875335.html
22-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi air turns ‘severe’ day after easing of pollution curbs||A day after the Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas lifted the ban on construction and demolition activities in the region, and the ban on entry of petrol and diesel trucks into Delhi citing an improvement in air quality, the Capital’s pollution levels spiked into the severe range again. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recording showed that on Tuesday the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of Delhi deteriorated to 402, in the severe zone. On Monday, the Capital’s average AQI reading was 332, considered very poor on CPCB’s air quality scale. An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is considered poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.Senior India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said that with a western disturbance expected to impact Delhi and its neighbouring states from December 22, the wind speeds on Tuesday slowed down, causing pollutants to get trapped closer to the surface. The cold, frigid conditions all across north India, further led to pollution particles becoming heavier, making dispersion all the more difficult. A western disturbance refers to an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India.“The winds were largely calm on Tuesday, which caused pollution to accumulate. From Tuesday night, Delhi will start receiving easterly winds because of a passing western disturbance. The wind speed will be around 4-6kmph on December 22 and December 23. By December 24-25, the wind speed will improve to around 10-15kmph,” said a senior Met official. After recording the worst pollution for the month of November since 2015, with 11 “severe” air days as opposed to the 10 “severe” days recorded in 2016, the national Capital this December recorded two “severe” air days. Before Tuesday, the AQI had peaked to the “severe” category on December 2, with a reading of 429. Considering the unprecedented pollution levels last month, on the directions of the Supreme Court, the CAQM on November 16 imposed a series of restrictions, including a ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR, scheduled operations for thermal power plants, and allowed only those industrial units that have switched to piped natural gas (PNG) to operate, and banned the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items into Delhi. Over the last one week, the commission has lifted these restrictions in a phased manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-turns-severe-day-after-easing-of-pollution-curbs-101640109693242.html
22-12-2021||Delhi||NCR resolved 50% pollution-related complaints: CPCB||Nearly half of the pollution-related complaints made to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or logged by its monitoring teams across the National Capital Region (NCR) between October 15 and December 19 are yet to be resolved, with data from the pollution watchdog showing that only 1,100 of the 2,207 complaints have been addressed so far.However, among the NCR states, Delhi is faring best, having resolved nearly 63% (761) of the 1,214 complaints filed during this period.In comparison, UP (134 of 370 complaints) and Haryana (184 of 509 complaints) have resolved 36% complaints, and Rajasthan (nine of 53 complaints) resolved only 17% complaints.A senior CPCB official, on the condition of anonymity, said most complaints were related to dust violations, construction and demolition waste and instances of open waste burning. “Data is collected each day from each agency and is being updated in real time. Agencies have been asked to ensure no complaints remain pending and are being asked to prioritise those complaints in particular which can be dealt with quickly,” the official said.CPCB data showed that in Delhi, most complaints (403) were recorded in areas under the jurisdiction of North Delhi Municipal Corporation but the civic body has addressed only 189 complaints (47%).South MCD received 359 complaints and resolved 232 (65%), whereas East MCD got 87 complaints, of which they have resolved 79 (91%).In comparison, other agencies with a high pendency rate include the Delhi government’s flood control department, which has only resolved four of its 17 complaints (24%), and the Delhi Police, which has addressed only 10 of its 24 complaints (42%).The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the Delhi Cantonment Board and the Delhi transport department have meanwhile resolved all the complaints received so far.Among agencies in NCR which failed to solve a single complaint are the Central Public Works Department (56 complaints), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (40 complaints), Haryana Urban Development Authority (21 complaints) and the UP state pollution control board (56 complaints).Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said it is important to act swiftly on all such complaints during the winter to somewhat halt the spike in air pollution. “In winters, you cannot carry out infrastructure-based intervention and therefore strict enforcement is essential. The CPCB may also need to carry out a system audit and assign accountability to agencies failing to solve complaints,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ncr-resolved-50-pollution-related-complaints-cpcb-101640109094538.html
22-12-2021||Delhi||Holding namaz as show of strength wrong, says Haryana CM Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said it was “inappropriate” to hold Friday prayers in open spaces as a “show of strength”, advising all communities to avoid organising such routine religious programmes in public places.“No member of any community should hold regular religious programmes in open public spaces,” Khattar said in the Vidhan Sabha after Congress member from Nuh assembly Aftab Ahmed raised the issue of Hindu groups opposing Friday prayers in open places in Gurugram.The chief minister said whenever people want to organise such routine religious activities, they should hold them in temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras,“Displaying a show of strength is not good as this provokes the sentiments of another community,” Khattar said even as the Congress MLA reminded the chief minister that latter was the custodian of the state, and the protector of the people of all faiths.This was the second time that the issue was raised in the House after the winter session of the Vidhan Sabha began last Friday. Earlier, Congress MLA Mamman Khan from Ferozepur Jhirka of Nuh district also raised the matter, objecting to Khattar’s recent remarks over namaaz being held in public places. Both Ahmed and Khan demanded that chief minister should withdraw his statement.However, the chief minister said it was the responsibility of all to ensure that there was no social confrontation and the peace was maintained. He said people of all faiths hold prayers at designated religious places such as temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras, and that permissions are given to organise big festivals and programmes in open public places.“Gurugram is a symbol of development. What message is being sent out from Gurugram when one cannot offer prayers as per one’s choice?,” the Congress MLA said, adding that “some elements” were repeatedly disrupting Friday prayers.“The Constitution gives the right to practise one’s religion. No one has the right to disrupt prayers,” the Congress legislator said.The chief minister said people have agreed to hold Friday prayers at certain places in Gurugram, till new arrangements are made. “The good thing is that some places have been identified as per a consensus till new arrangements are made. When consensus is breached and some people hold prayers outside the agreed upon spots, it leads to confrontation,” Khattar said, advising the opposition MLAs not to flare up this issue as this can breach communal harmony.In a press statement on Tuesday, the Gurgaon Muslim Council, that is leading the demand for namaz sites, said, “Muslims of Gurugram are extremely pained to hear that our CM in Haryana Assembly has said that Muslims offering their obligatory weekly prayers is a show of strength. Instead of stopping such horrifying attacks on Muslims by far-right wing groups, CM has put the blame squarely on us.”On December 10, Khattar, when he was in Gurugram, said that performing namaz in open spaces cannot be tolerated, and asked the Hindu and Muslim groups and the district administration to discuss and resolve the issue. Following Khattar’s remarks the district administration withdrew permission for Friday prayers at 20 designated sites. Fresh sites were yet to be assigned.Hindu right-wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram for the last three years. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, the number of sites were cut down to 20 in November after members of the right-wing groups and locals continued to protest and disrupt prayers. Muslims have maintained that they were forced to use public spaces since there were not enough number of mosques in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/holding-namaz-as-show-of-strength-wrong-says-haryana-cm-khattar-101640108855111.html
22-12-2021||Delhi||Centre spent so much on Covid shots, unfair to ask for funds: SDMC||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday countered the opposition attack over the three civic bodies not being provided central funds, saying since the BJP-ruled Union government has spent “crores on Covid vaccination in MCD areas”, it will not be fair to demand more money. The BJP was responding to allegations by the opposition that instead of seeking funds from the Delhi government, the MCDs should seek funds from the party ruled Centre, and the dues that the central agencies owe to the municipalities. “Since the AAP government in Delhi has always released funds less than our allotment, their leaders have no job other than to raise insignificant issues. The Centre has always extended its best possible help to all the MCDs. It has spent many crore of rupees for Covid-19 vaccination in the MCD areas. Therefore, it will not be fair to ask for more financial aid from them,” South MCD mayor Mukesh Suryan said on Tuesday.When asked whether the municipal bodies have sent a requisition to the Centre seeking funds, SDMC standing committee chairman BK Oberoi said the aid is extended only to municipalities in states, and not to those in Union territories such as Delhi.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the Delhi government owes no dues to the three municipal corporations, and added that despite the government disbursing ₹2,588 crore this year, the civic bodies failed to pay salaries to their employees, many of whom are currently either protesting or on a strike demanding their wages. Addressing a digital press briefing, Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said since chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took charge of the government in Delhi, the administration has not only given MCDs their share of the budget, but also a loan of ₹6,889 crore. “The Delhi government is supposed to provide ₹3,488 crore to the MCDs in the fiscal 2021-22, according to the budget. So far, the Delhi government has given the MCDs 75% of the funds in three instalments, totalling ₹2,588 crore. In addition, the remaining 25% will be disbursed in January. Despite knowing this well, BJP leaders ruling the MCD are crying that the Delhi government did not give money to us. The question that must be asked is, where did all of this money go.” The SDMC mayor on Tuesday, however, said the Delhi government was yet to clear over Rs2,000 crore pending under the 2016-17 budget, and alleged that the AAP was trying to malign their image. “The Kejriwal-led Delhi government has no other business but to spread lies to malign our image. The fact is that Delhi government was yet not clear outstanding dues of ₹1,482.19 crore in plan head, and ₹708.63 crore in non-plan head, from fiscal 2016-17 fiscal,” he said. Oberoi, who supervises the financial matters of the South corporation, alleged the AAP government was trying paralyse the functioning of the three civic bodies in Delhi. “Can the opposition name a single municipal body in UTs, which is getting this (central) fund? And, moreover it’s credited to the state government’s exchequer and doesn’t come directly to us. At present, all the three MCDs are facing a financial crunch and are not in a position to pay salaries to their employees. The Delhi government is trying to paralyse us,” he said. A senior Union finance ministry official explained that the Centre extends an aid of Rs488 per person of the population to municipal corporations in states “But, there are few exceptions such as Chandigarh and Puducherry also. The fund goes to the account of state or UT governments, but the requisition has to come from the municipal bodies. After that, we discuss the feasibility of allotment, and then the funds are released to the governments concerned,” he said asking not to be named. Senior AAP leader and party’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the BJP-ruled MCDs have no other business than to accuse the AAP for their failures. “Who will write the letter to the Centre on their behalf? Why can’t they raise these pertinent questions with the Centre. If it (Centre) can extend support to municipal bodies in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Jammu, how it can ignore Delhi,” Pathak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-spent-so-much-on-covid-shots-unfair-to-ask-for-funds-sdmc-101640107532976.html
22-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Rana Gurmit Sodhi quits Congress to join BJP||In a setback to the ruling Congress, senior Punjab leader and former minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi quit the party and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday with just weeks to go for the assembly elections in the state. The four-time legislator joined the BJP in the presence of central ministers Bhupender Yadav, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is also the party’s Punjab election in-charge, and Som Prakash, and state affairs in-charge Dushyant Gautam at a press conference at the national headquarters of the party in Delhi. Before joining the BJP, Sodhi shot off a letter to the Congress to resign from all posts and primary membership of the party with immediate effect. “I am deeply hurt by the bickering and infighting within the Punjab Congress. This is harming the party and causing serious problems for the state and the government. I feel suffocated and helpless in the present situation, especially when the party has put the state’s security and communal harmony at stake,” he wrote. He said that rather than taking action to restore peace in Punjab, the senior Congress leadership was hell bent on destroying the border state for its personal gains. The former minister also wrote that he was handpicked by Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi to contest his first election in 1985. Known to be close to former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Sodhi was a minister in his government. He was dropped from the cabinet by the new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi after the Congress effected the change of guard in the state in September. After his unceremonious replacement, Capt Amarinder Singh quit the Congress to float his separate political party, the Punjab Lok Congress, and announced a pre-poll alliance with the BJP. Sodhi is the first sitting MLA to quit the Congress since the two-time former chief minister’s exit from the party. Shekhawat, while welcoming the Guru Harsahai MLA into the party, said his joining the BJP will help the party in its endeavour for a new Punjab. Sodhi said the BJP was needed to save Punjab from heading into a dangerous situation. “I was in the Congress for 40 years, starting from the Youth Congress. The party was known for secularism, but not any longer as they are playing divisive politics for votes,” the former international trap shooter said, hitting out at his former party. Sodhi has won four consecutive elections from the Guru Harsahai assembly seat since 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-rana-gurmit-sodhi-quits-congress-to-join-bjp-101640078851433.html
22-12-2021||World||Flight passengers at least twice more likely to catch Covid amid Omicron spread||Aircraft passengers are twice or even three times more likely to catch Covid-19 during a flight since the emergence of the omicron variant, according to the top medical adviser to the world’s airlines. The new strain is highly transmissible and has become dominant in a matter of weeks, accounting for more than 70% of all new cases in the US alone. While hospital-grade air filters on modern passenger jets make the risk of infection much lower on planes than in crowded places on the ground such as shopping malls, omicron is rapidly spreading just as more travelers take to the skies for year-end holidays and family reunions.Business class may be safer than more densely packed economy cabins, said David Powell, physician and medical adviser to the International Air Transport Association, which represents almost 300 carriers worldwide. As before, passengers should avoid face-to-face contact and surfaces that are frequently touched, and people sitting near to each other should try not to be unmasked at the same time during meals, he said.Powell, former chief medical officer at Air New Zealand Ltd., spoke with Bloomberg News on Tuesday about flying during the pandemic. Here’s an edited transcript.What are the risks of infection during a flight?Whatever the risk was with delta, we would have to assume the risk would be two to three times greater with omicron, just as we’ve seen in other environments. Whatever that low risk -- we don’t know what it is -- on the airplane, it must be increased by a similar amount.What should passengers do to minimise the risks?Avoid common-touch surfaces, hand hygiene wherever possible, masks, distancing, controlled-boarding procedures, try to avoid face-to-face contact with other customers, try to avoid being unmasked in flight, for meal and drink services, apart from when really necessary. The advice is the same, it’s just that the relative risk has probably increased, just as the relative risk of going to the supermarket or catching a bus has increased with omicron.What about masks at meal times?For a two-hour flight, it’s pretty easy to say, ‘just keep your mask on the whole time.’ But if it’s a 10-hour flight, it becomes pretty unreasonable to ask people not to eat and drink. What most airlines have been doing is encouraging, but not insisting, on customers trying to stagger their mask-off periods a little bit.In simple terms, two people masked have minimal transmission from one to the other. If one of you removes your mask, then that person’s at greater risk of transmitting and at slightly greater risk of receiving. But if both of you remove then obviously, there’s no barrier there and you can freely transmit one to the other.Would it be safest not to fly at all?The greatest protection you can give yourself is to be vaccinated and boosted. The protection that you give yourself from an extra mask or a different type of mask, or not flying at all, frankly, is probably less than the benefit you would get from just being fully boosted. There’s a sort of a rule of thumb starting to appear, that essentially omicron loses you one vaccine dose of benefit. So, two doses against omicron is about similar protection to one dose against delta. That’s not established in hard science, but it roughly seems to correlate with what’s coming out in studies.Is it safe for healthy passengers if an omicron case is sitting on the plane?It’s an enclosed space, but it’s a leaky box, and we pressurize it by putting a huge airflow on one end of it, and then having an exhaust valve out the other end. So you’re sitting in a very high-flow airflow environment. It is an enclosed space, but that doesn’t shout ‘risk’ to me. An Irish pub with a fan in the corner shouts ‘risk’ to me, or a gymnasium with a whole lot of people shouting and grunting and sweating. But any flight you take does involve airports as well, which are a little bit less controlled. So, there is risk there. What can you do? Vaccination, testing, mask-wearing, distancing. Are surgical masks better than cloth masks? Yes, probably. On average, maybe 10-20%.Most of the documented cases of spread in flight are from way back in March 2020 -- before we had testing, before we had masks, before we had organized boarding procedures, before there was a high degree of awareness about not flying if you were unwell.What about leaving middle seats on rows empty?It’s incredibly appealing, intuitively. It does give a greater physical distance between you and the next person. But we haven’t seen that actually deliver a whole lot of benefit. But if there’s some cross airflow from the aisle to the window, or the window to the aisle, and you remove the person from the middle seat, you’ve helped the person who would have been in the middle seat. You probably haven’t helped the person in the next seat a whole lot, because it’s likely to drift across without the obstruction of that first person.Should cabin crew wear full protective clothing, such as body suits and face shields?Probably not. There hasn’t been a lot of passenger-to-crew transmission throughout Covid-19. There has been some, but it’s very, very small numbers. It’s tended to be passenger-to-passenger or crew-to-crew. And again, very small numbers of crew-to-passenger. Let’s just be stringent about the measures already in place, and wait until we have a bit more data on omicron.What are the risks of infection at the airport?The requirements for airflows on board are much more stringent than they are for airport buildings generally. The protections for the airline cabin are: everybody stays seated, facing the same direction, there are these physical barriers that are in the way, you have a high degree of airflow that’s by and large from ceiling to floor, minimal drift along the airplane, a little bit more drift across the airplane. Roughly 50% of the airflow is fresh from outside, 50% is recirculated, but when it’s recirculated, it’s HEPA-filtered, so it’s clean. Most of those aren’t present in the airport phase. You’ve got much more random movement, much more potential for face-to-face contact, you’ve got generally reduced airflows. Airport ventilation rates are a 10th, maybe, of what they are on the airplane.What about children on the flight? How should families manage them?The risk of severe illness to small children themselves from traveling is low, just because the risk of severe Covid is so low for children. It’s one of the unanswered questions with omicron. The risk is not so much to them. The risk is that they may be mildly infected, not know it, and potentially be spreading whilst they’re traveling. And so that is a risk. Getting them to keep a mask on is hard. The smaller they are, the harder that’s going to be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flight-passengers-at-least-twice-more-likely-to-catch-covid-amid-omicron-spread-101640190036222.html
22-12-2021||World||US diplomat arrested in Turkey for allegedly selling fake passports||Turkish authorities have arrested an American diplomat working for the U.S. Consulate in Lebanon for allegedly providing a fake passport to a Syrian national, Turkey’s state-run news agency reported on Wednesday.The Anadolu Agency said the suspect, identified by his initials D.J.K., was detained at Istanbul Airport on Nov. 11, and was later formally arrested on suspicion of selling the forged passport to the Syrian national for $10,000.Anadolu said the Syrian was detained for questioning after he attempted to travel to Germany on the false passport, which was in D.J.K.’s name.Police later determined through an examination of security camera footage, that D.J.K. gave him the passport at the airport and the two also exchanged clothes. Police also seized an envelope containing $10,000 from the diplomat, the report said.The American was jailed while the Syrian was released pending possible proceedings for falsifying documents, Anadolu reported.The U.S. Embassy in Ankara would not comment on the report.

22-12-2021||World||Amid Omicron scare, WHO chief says no nation can ‘boost its way out’ of pandemic||World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday said that “no country can boost its way out” of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Ahead of the festive week of Christmas and New Year, the WHO chief told a media briefing that vaccine booster doses cannot be seen “as a ticket to go ahead with planned celebrations."Citing a report of Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) on Immunization, the WHO chief stressed that the focus of vaccination must remain on decreasing death and severe disease. He said about 20% of all vaccine doses administered every day are currently being given as boosters or additional doses, expressing concern that blanket booster programmes will exacerbate vaccine inequity.“Blanket booster programmes are likely to prolong the pandemic, rather than ending it, by diverting supply to countries that already have high levels of vaccination coverage, giving the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate," he told the briefing.Western countries have expanded their booster programme for the majority of the eligible adult population while many countries are yet to fully vaccinate half of their population. Tedros highlighted that the vast majority of hospitalisations and deaths are being in “unvaccinated people, not un-boosted people.”“And we must be very clear that the vaccines we have, remain effective against both the Delta and Omicron variants," he said, adding that global priority must be to support all countries to reach the 40% target as quickly as possible, and the 70% target by the middle of 2022.The WHO also issued updated guidance for health workers, recommending the use of either a respirator or a medical mask, in addition to other personal protective equipment, when entering a room on suspected or confirmed case Omicron patient.

Hirofumi Yoshimura said.The three are the first known cases of community transmission of the highly infectious omicron variant in Japan, Yoshimura said. “I believe they only happened to be detected and we must take steps on the assumption that there already are other cases of community transmission,” he said.Yoshimura said current restrictions on eateries in Osaka will remain in place, including a limit of four people per table for a maximum of two hours, to minimize risks during the yearend holiday season, when coronavirus infections surged last year.More than 100 omicron cases have been identified in mainland Japan, but all involved people who tested positive upon entry at airports or those linked to them, government officials have said.Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto, responding to the confirmation of the Osaka cases, said the government will do its utmost to prevent a further spread of the variant.Concerns are also growing on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, where a large virus cluster has developed at a U.S. military base. Several Japanese employees at the base have tested positive for the omicron variant, raising suspicion they might be linked to the cluster on the base.As of Wednesday, 215 Marines recently transferred from the U.S. to Camp Hansen on Okinawa have tested positive for the coronavirus, but it is not known if they are omicron cases, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said.Hayashi said he urged the commander of U.S. Forces Japan, Lt. Gen. Ricky Rupp, to conduct genomic analyses of the samples, step up anti-virus tests and other measures and prohibit troops from leaving the base to prevent the spread of the virus into the community.Hayashi said the U.S. military has agreed to cooperate with Japan in testing cases for the omicron variant and share results with Japanese authorities.Japan eased its border controls in November, but quickly reinstated a ban on most new foreign entrants after omicron was first identified in South Africa.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that he plans to keep the border controls, among the world's most stringent, in place until more details about the omicron variant are known.Kishida said Japan is also tightening quarantine rules for those who come in close contact with omicron patients, requiring 14 days of isolation at designated facilities instead of the previous self-isolation at home.He also announced plans to accelerate booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines, which started with medical workers in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-confirms-first-known-local-omicron-transmissions-101640189637170.html

The tabloid, Global Times, quoted Lam appreciating that Xi acknowledged the work of the HKSAR government over the past year.“She described the year 2021 as very unusual, particularly as it was the year to fully implement the ‘one country, two systems’’ policy. She said she is glad to come to Beijing in person as it’s the last annual duty trip in her 5-year term,” the Global Times report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-hails-hong-kong-vote-in-meeting-with-carrie-lam-101640182203200.html
22-12-2021||World||US secret service says nearly $100 billion stolen from Covid-19 relief funds||Nearly $100 billion at minimum has been stolen from Covid-19 relief programmes set up to help businesses and people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, the US Secret Service said on Tuesday.The estimate is based on Secret Service cases and data from the Labor Department and the Small Business Administration, said Roy Dotson, the agency's national pandemic fraud recovery coordinator, in an interview.The Secret Service didn't include Covid-19 fraud cases prosecuted by the Justice Department.While roughly 3% of the $3.4 trillion dispersed, the amount stolen from pandemic benefits programmes shows “the sheer size of the pot is enticing to the criminals,” Dotson said.Most of that figure comes from unemployment fraud.The Labor Department reported about $87 billion in unemployment benefits could have been paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud.The Secret Service said it has seized more than $1.2 billion while investigating unemployment insurance and loan fraud and has returned more than $2.3 billion of fraudulently obtained funds by working with financial partners and states to reverse transactions.The Secret Service says it has more than 900 active criminal investigations into pandemic fraud, with cases in every state, and 100 people have been arrested so far.The Justice Department said last week that its fraud section had prosecuted over 150 defendants in more than 95 criminal cases and had seized over $75 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Programme funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with the proceeds.One of the best-known programmes created through the March 2020 CARES Act, PPP offered low-interest, forgivable loans to small businesses struggling to meet payroll and other expenses during pandemic-related shutdowns.Law enforcement early in the pandemic focused on fraud related to personal protective equipment, the Secret Service said.Authorities have now prioritised the exploitation of pandemic-related relief because the federal funding through the CARES Act attracted the attention of individuals and organised criminal networks worldwide.“Can we stop fraud? Will we? No, but I think we can definitely prosecute those that need to be prosecuted and we can do our best to recover as much fraudulent pandemic funds that we can," said Dotson, who is the Secret Service's assistant special agent in charge of the agency's field office in Jacksonville, Florida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secret-service-says-nearly-100-billion-stolen-from-covid-19-relief-funds-101640165747407.html

And most Chinese metaverse-related stocks rose on Wednesday following the Xinhua announcement.Augmented reality firm Goertek jumped 6% while online gaming company Perfect World gained nearly 4%. Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings said last month it expects Beijing to allow the metaverse to operate in China, provided it fall into line with Chinese rules.Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are seen as the natural means of payment in the metaverse, but Beijing has clamped down on them as possible conduits for illegal capital flows and money laundering, and ordered a blanket ban of trading and mining of digital currencies in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boost-for-blockchain-in-china-as-xinhua-to-issue-photos-as-nfts-101640162683063.html

With Isreal, now there are three countries that have recorded fatalities from Omicron, the variant which is spreading faster than Delta, but causing apparently milder illness.Here is all you need to know about Omicron deaths in 3 countries.IsraelThe Israeli hospital, where the death was reported, said the patient was a male in his sixties with a number of serious pre-existing conditions. "His morbidity stemmed mainly from pre-existing sicknesses and not from respiratory infection arising from the coronavirus,” the hospital said.United StatesThe first Omicron death in the United States was recorded on Monday. The patient was aged between 50 and 60 years and was believed to be unvaccinated.United KingdomBritain said 12 people who have been infected with the Omicron variant have died in the country. In the UK, the new variant is spreading faster with the number of hospitalisation also increasing. Fresh restrictions ahead of the Christmas and New Year celebrations are also on the cards.The first case of Omicron was reported by South Africa on November 24. Within weeks, the variant spread to the maximum number of countries. Experts said the variant is spreading faster than Delta, which caused the second wave of the pandemic, but is not causing severe illness. Almost all Omicron cases across the world have zero to mild symptoms. The virus is also not affecting the lungs, as scientists believe that the variant is multiplying in the throat making scratchy throat a symptom of the variant. For weeks, there was no death attributed to Omicron. The deaths reported from these three countries -- though details of all cases are not known -- indicate people above the age of 50 with comorbidities are at a greater risk. More so, if they are not vaccinated. Omicron is known to be capable of evading immunity, but experts have said that present vaccines can still guard against the severity of Covid caused by Omicron – to some extent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-omicron-is-milder-than-delta-what-covid-deaths-in-uk-us-israel-indicate-101640156554361.html

This is the second consecutive year that Christmas holidays will be held in the shadow of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Also Read | Amid Omicron threat in India, Covid R-value has gone up in these statesBut the World Health Organization (WHO) said the governments across the world should work towards ending the pandemic. "2022 must be the year we end the pandemic," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing on Tuesday."If we are to end the pandemic in the coming year, we must end inequity, by ensuring 70 per cent of the population of every country is vaccinated by the middle of next year," he added."Last week, WHO issued Emergency Use Listing for a ninth vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India under license from Novavax. This new vaccine is part of the COVAX portfolio, and we hope that it will play an important role in achieving our global vaccination targets," the WHO chief added further.Tedros, however, painted a grim picture saying that a pall of gloom has descended on the world because of Covid-19.He said that that more than 3.3 million people have lost their lives to the pandemic this year - more deaths than from HIV, malaria and tuberculosis combined in 2020, and still continues to claim around 50,000 lives every week."That's not to mention the unreported deaths, and the millions of excess deaths caused by disruptions to essential health services," the WHO chief added.The ferocity with which Covid-19 is spreading once again has been attributed to the Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa on November 24 and has spread to more than 100 countries since then."There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant. And it is more likely that people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 could be infected or reinfected," said Tedros.From reporting its lowest number of cases in 18 months, Africa recorded fourth-largest number of cases in a single week, said the WHO chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-must-end-covid-19-in-2022-says-who-chief-explains-how-101640149665463.html

22-12-2021||World||Harvard professor found guilty of hiding ties to China||A Harvard University professor charged with hiding his ties to a Chinese-run recruitment programme was found guilty on all counts Tuesday.Charles Lieber, 62, the former chair of Harvard's department of chemistry and chemical biology, had pleaded not guilty to two counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of making false statements, and two counts of failing to file reports for a foreign bank account in China.The jury deliberated for about two hours and 45 minutes before announcing the verdict following five days of testimony in Boston federal court.Lieber's defense attorney Marc Mukasey had argued that prosecutors lacked proof of the charges. He maintained that investigators didn't keep any record of their interviews with Lieber prior to his arrest.He argued that prosecutors would be unable to prove that Lieber acted "knowingly, intentionally, or willfully, or that he made any material false statement." Mukasey also stressed Lieber wasn't charged with illegally transferring any technology or proprietary information to China.Prosecutors argued that Lieber, who was arrested in January, knowingly hid his involvement in China's Thousand Talents Plan — a programme designed to recruit people with knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property to China — to protect his career and reputation.Lieber denied his involvement during inquiries from US authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, which had provided him with millions of dollars in research funding, prosecutors said.Lieber also concealed his income from the Chinese program, including USD 50,000 a month from the Wuhan University of Technology, up to USD 158,000 in living expenses and more than USD 1.5 million in grants, according to prosecutors.In exchange, they say, Lieber agreed to publish articles, organize international conferences and apply for patents on behalf of the Chinese university.The case is among the highest profile to come from the US Department of Justice's so-called "China Initiative."The effort launched in 2018 to curb economic espionage from China has faced criticism that it harms academic research and amounts to racial profiling of Chinese researchers.Hundreds of faculty members at Stanford, Yale, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple and other prominent colleges have signed onto letters to US Attorney General Merrick Garland calling on him to end the initiative.The academics say the effort compromises the nation's competitiveness in research and technology and has had a chilling effect on recruiting foreign scholars. The letters also complain the investigations have disproportionally targeted researchers of Chinese origin.Lieber has been on paid administrative leave from Harvard since being arrested in January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-professor-found-guilty-of-hiding-ties-to-china-101640144058232.html

AJ Webber posted the tour of the apartment on popular video-sharing app TikTok.In the 46-second clip, Webber is seen opening the door to give a small tour of his Manhattan pad in the much sought-after West Village neighbourhood. The video went viral overnight.It was among the top 25 of most expensive New York City neighbourhoods in 2020, according to a study from Property Club.The apartment is really tiny – about 75 square feet – which looks like a walk-in closet.“Here is what it’s like living in the smallest apartment in New York,” Webber said. “Whatever your expectations are, lower them,” he added for people who plan to move to the Big Apple.“As soon as you walk in the door, you have the sink,” Webber said in the video. “Right next to the sink is, conveniently located, the kitchen.”In the visuals shown by Webber, the kitchen seems to be consisting only of a microwave and a tiny fridge, without any stove.In his “living quarters”, Webber has two beds – one of them is a bunk bed – with a queen-sized mattress on top on one of them.“I lowered my expectations and still, they were too high,” one user said in the comments section.“My dorm room is bigger than that,” another user added.News agency Bloomberg reported in October that Manhattan apartment sales surged to a record in the third quarter as buyers grabbed what they could while inventory remains high.Closed purchases totaled 4,523, the most for any quarter in data going back to 1989, Bloomberg said quoting a report by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

"Within weeks, Omicron will dominate in more countries of the region, pushing already stretched health systems further to the brink."The WHO's Europe region includes Russia and other former Soviet republics, as well as Turkey.WHO data shows the region has in recent weeks reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases compared to the population size anywhere. Even before Omicron, officials had warned of a further 700,000 deaths from the disease by March.WHO headquarters in Geneva has advised that vaccine boosters be saved for the most vulnerable, but Kluge urged people to "boost, boost, boost.""The booster is the single most important defence against Omicron," he said.A WHO spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request to comment on Kluge's remarks.So far, 89% of the early Omicron cases in Europe were associated with common Covid-19 symptoms such as cough, sore throat and fever, Kluge said. Most cases had been reported among adults in their 20s and 30s, spreading initially in cities at social and workplace gatherings, he added."The sheer volume of new Covid-19 infections could lead to more hospitalizations and widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services," he said."Governments and authorities need to prepare our response systems for a significant surge."The WHO said on Monday that Omicron is spreading faster than the Delta variant, causing infections in people already vaccinated or recovered from the disease. Its chief scientist has called it "unwise" to conclude from early evidence it is a milder variant than previous ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/significant-surge-in-european-cases-expected-as-omicron-spreads-says-who-101640131858684.html

Burgess Owens, the Congressman from Utah's Fourth Congressional District, was speaking at Turning Point USA’s America First in Phoenix.He asked the women to keep their standards high so that real men “strive to achieve your respect”.“When evil steps up to the doorstep, a real man does not get on his knees and beg for mercy with a wife and kids. Just like he knows how to use an iPhone, he knows how to use a gun,” the Republican said in his remarks on Sunday, telling women how to recognise “real men”. “He shows up and takes care of business.”“He’s determined to never, never allow his wife and kids to look at him as a whiner, weenie and wimp,” the Congressman said drawing applause and cheers from the crowd.He also lashed out at the Pfizer and BioNTech’s plan to test coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine on children.“Real men do not stand silent as their kids are being used as guinea pigs. Pfizer and BioNTech is testing a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on children aged six months to under five years,” Owens said. “A father who allows that is a coward who lets little babies get the vaccine.”The remarks were made amid a surge in Covid-19 infection in the United States as the Omicron variant wreaks havoc. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday appealed to all Americans to get vaccinated to fight the Omicron variant sweeping the world days before the second Christmas of the pandemic."If you're not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned," Biden said at the White House, where he unveiled plans to buy 500 million rapid Covid-19 tests to be distributed for free to Americans who request them starting in January.Omicron infections are multiplying across Europe, the United States and Asia, including in Japan, where a single cluster cases at a military base has grown to at least 180.It is now the dominant strain in the US, accounting for 73 per cent of all new cases, up from less than 1 per cent at the beginning of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-on-real-men-they-know-how-to-use-a-gun-just-like-an-iphone-101640132635507.html

As of Tuesday, the authorities have confirmed 90,629 new cases and 172 fatalities.In this regard, the government announced earlier in the day an allocation of $1.3 billion to assist businesses hit by a new wave of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-says-no-new-restrictions-before-christmas-despite-omicron-surge-in-uk-101640126695178.html

He said his health advisers had suggested he reconsider the ban.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday that omicron now accounts for more than 70% of new US cases of Covid-19.The US government imposed restrictions on people traveling from South Africa and seven other nearby nations on Nov. 29 after the discovery of the new variant. The CDC the next day notified airlines they must provide the names of passengers who had traveled in southern Africa in recent days so that local health agencies could conduct contact tracing. However successful the travel restrictions may have been in stopping people infected with the omicron variant from entering the US, it hasn’t prevented the Covid-19 mutation from rapidly becoming the dominant strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-he-s-considering-lifting-us-omicron-travel-ban-101640120491548.html

Almost 6,000 employees work at Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s headquarters in Hawthorne, near Los Angeles International Airport, according to the Los Angeles Times.The cases come during a busy stretch for the company, which has completed four Falcon 9 launches since Dec. 9, including a cargo supply mission to the International Space Station early Tuesday.The US is grappling with a renewed surge amid the spread of the omicron variant. Daily coronavirus infections nationwide jumped to the highest level since September, with almost 254,000 cases reported Monday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.Musk ChallengeIn March 2020, SpaceX founder Elon Musk challenged officials in California’s Alameda County, the site of a Tesla Inc. factory, over pandemic restrictions that closed the auto plant in Fremont. Musk also sued the county before later dropping that lawsuit.L.A. county’s public health office requires that all employees wear a face mask while working indoors, regardless of vaccination status, except when eating, drinking or alone in a room. For the most part, private employers like SpaceX aren’t included in the county’s strict policy on showing proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test to enter some public venues such as restaurants, bars and gyms.SpaceX’s workplace testing in Hawthorne prompted the company to report the cases to the county, according to the memo. L.A. county health officials didn’t immediately comment on the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-headquarters-hit-by-covid-19-outbreak-with-132-infected-101640116186073.html
22-12-2021||World||Germany clamps down on New Year's parties to tame Omicron||Germany announced new restrictions Tuesday that will begin after Christmas to slow the spread of the new omicron variant, rules that will fall short of a full lockdown but will include contact restrictions even for vaccinated people.“I can understand anyone who doesn’t want to hear about the coronavirus, mutations and new virus variants,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a press conference Tuesday evening. “But we cannot and must not turn a blind eye to this next wave.”Among the new rules are limiting private gatherings to 10 people, closing nightclubs nationwide and having large events like soccer matches held without an in-person audience. The restrictions will go into effect nationwide on Dec. 28, although states can implement the measures sooner.Scholz said the government decided to wait until after Christmas to implement new national restrictions because family-focused holidays such as Christmas and Easter “have not proven to be major drivers of the pandemic." But he said restrictions on New Year's celebrations are necessary to keep Germany's health system from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.“This is no longer the time for parties and social evenings in big groups,” Scholz said.Scholz and Germany's 16 state governors agreed on the new restrictions at a meeting Tuesday, after the government's new panel of experts called for action to be taken within days nationwide because the omicron variant is racing across Europe.Scholz and the state governors will meet again on Jan. 7 to discuss whether the measures should be continued or even tightened.Hours before the meeting, the national disease control center called on Twitter for “maximum contact restrictions” starting immediately and lasting until mid-January, and for Germans to reduce their holiday travel “to the absolutely necessary.”One state, Hamburg, already moved Tuesday to impose restrictions starting on Christmas Eve. There will be a 10-person limit on private meetings and dance events will be banned, effectively closing nightclubs. Restaurants and bars in the state will have to close at 11 p.m. — except on New Year's Eve, when they can stay open until 1 a.m.Restrictions already in place in Germany target mainly the unvaccinated, with proof of vaccination or recovery required to enter nonessential stores. Also, the sale of New Year fireworks has been banned nationwide.Scholz said the German government is also trying to speed up its booster vaccine campaign, aiming to give out an additional 30 million shots by the end of January by keeping some vaccination centers open over the holidays.“Vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate remains our goal,” Scholz said. “The coronavirus doesn’t take a Christmas break.”But authorities remain dissatisfied that only 70.4% of Germany's population has been fully vaccinated and 32.6% have received boosters.Germany's infection rate is, for now, drifting downward slowly. On Tuesday, the disease control center recorded 306.4 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, down from 375 a week earlier, with 23,428 new daily cases.However, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has warned that Germany faces “a massive fifth wave” of infections because of omicron, which he says can't realistically be prevented.The disease control center said Monday that people who have recovered or have been fully vaccinated now face a “high” risk of infection, while it is “moderate” for those who have received a booster. It said the risk of getting COVID-19 is “very high” for the unvaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-clamps-down-on-new-year-s-parties-to-tame-omicron-101640115574130.html
22-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 23, 2000 - Lashkar men storm Army camp in Red Fort, 3 killed||HT Correspondent New Delhi- Even as a function of the Army's Seven Rajputana Rifles was on, Lashkar-e- Tayyeba militants stormed the Red Fort at 9.30 tonight (December 22) and opened fire with AK-47s, killing at least three soldiers. This is the first such strike in the national capital and agency sources say a two-member Lashkar fidyaeen (suicide squad) was involved.The attack comes two days after the Centre extended the Ramzan ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir.Two members of the Rajputana Rifles were killed on the spot, while another was wounded and succumbed en route to hospital.The militants had switched off the lighting system inside the Mughal fort before launching the attack, apparently targeting the garrison inside.Lashkar is reported to have contacted the BBC and claimed responsibility for the attack.They also claimed that one of the militants was still inside the Fort. Army and police sources also did not rule out the possibility of militants holding out inside.The militants are supposed to have entered through the Saleem Gate of the Fort, outside which there are 400-500 slum dwellings. Police sources said the militants had carried out ambush at three separate places in the Fort.The attack was said to have been carried out near the residential quarters where hundreds of Armymen stay with their families. The Army has surrounded the Red Fort complex.Significantly, another function of the Rajputana Rifles was slated for tomorrow, which was to be attended by senior Army officials. Officials pointed out that both the Inter State Bus Terminus and the Old Delhi Railway Station are near the Red Fort and that it was possible that militants might have escaped from there.Several members of a family including women and children were trapped inside the Red Fort when the shootout occurred. They, however, reportedly escaped unhurt.There are two entry posts to the Red Fort, the Lahori Gate Khas and the Lahori Gate. There are at least four armed security guards on duty always at both these entry points.What is surprising is that the armed militants apparently managed to walk up to the cantonment area inside the Fort, where the function was going on, without being challenged.Clearly, the militant attack at the heavily-guarded Red Fort indicates a grave security lapse. The Red Fort is guarded by the 7th battalion of the Rajputana Rifles, the military police and Army headquarters post unit.The military intelligence was clueless about the attack and the shootout caught them napping.However, military intelligence officials are not ruling out the possibility of it being an insider's job.This evening's attack comes in the wake of several suicide attacks carried out recently by the mercenaries of the Lashkar on Army camps in the Kashmir valley.The Army cordoned off a huge area around the fort and, assisted by anti-terrorism squad personnel, launched combing operations in the entire walled city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-dec-23-2000-lashkar-men-storm-army-camp-in-red-fort-3-killed-101640197362700.html

22-12-2021||India||In Bengal BJP rejig, veterans dropped, former TMC leaders make it||The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced its new state committee on Wednesday evening, replacing several veterans and triggering rumblings in the organisation by retaining many who came from the Trinamool Congress (TMC).  The party announced the names of 11 new vice-presidents, five general secretaries and 12 secretaries alongside seven new morcha (front) presidents and those who will head departments such as media, information technology and social media. New spokespersons and television show panelists were also appointed. Some among the latter had been seen criticizing the BJP in the past.     Although infighting was witnessed in several district units in recent years because of the importance given to ex-TMC leaders and workers, BJP veterans such as Pratap Banerjee, Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury, Union minister of state Dr Subhas Sarkar, Raj Kamal Pathak, Debasish Mitra, Ritesh Tiwari, Raju Banerjee and Jay Prakash Majumdar were dropped from the panel of vice-presidents. Majumdar was made a spokesperson.    Pathak was among the most vocal critics of the party’s policies while Roy Chowdhury was a known hardliner. Another hardliner, general secretary Sayantan Basu, was dropped as well.   Coming a day after the BJP was trounced in the Kolkata municipal polls and six months after the saffron camp secured only 77 of the state’s 294 assembly seats against the TMC’s 213, the strategic changes were made by state leaders in consultation with the central leadership in Delhi, said senior BJP leaders who did not want to be identified.  “There was no visible effort to project people who have worked with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which used to be the old practice, and keep out former TMC leaders,” a leader said.  Bengal’s projected population in 2021 stands at 101.9 million. During   the 2011 census, Christians comprised only 0.72% of the population against 70.54% Hindus and 27.01% Muslims.  In the assembly polls, the BJP fielded nine Muslim candidates but none could win. There was no Christian in the fray. However, the sole Buddhist candidate, Bishal Lama, won the Kalchini seat in north Bengal’s Alipurduar district.  In north Bengal’s eight districts -- where members of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe have a sizeable population - the BJP captured 30 of the 54 assembly seats six months ago. The TMC, on the other hand, bagged most of the seats in south Bengal where Muslims live in larger numbers.  In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, too, the BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats, creating a record. In north Bengal, it secured seven of the eight seats.       On Wednesday, several members of the SC and ST communities made it to the upper tiers but Ali Hossain, who was state minority morcha president, was replaced by Charles Nandi, a former journalist and member of the Christian community who used to handle the social media page of former state president Dilip Ghosh.     Legislator Joyel Murmu was made the ST Morcha president while Sudip Das was appointed head of the SC morcha.  The selections were made after discussions with BJP national president J P Nadda and other central leaders. Though the talks were carried out by BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar and general secretary (organisation) Amitava Chakravorty, some state leaders had a say in the decision-making process, a party old-timer from Bengal said.    The recent poll results also showed that BJP did not get any noticeable support from women and young voters in south Bengal.  Saumitra Khan, a two-time Lok Sabha member from Bankura district who left the TMC and became the yuva morcha (youth front) president was replaced on Wednesday by Indranil Khan, a Kolkata-based oncologist who unsuccessfully contested the assembly polls.  Saumitra Khan, whose strong differences with Dilip Ghosh became public several times in recent months, was made a state vice-president.    Tanuja Chakraborty replaced fashion designer-turned politician Agnimitra Paul as the mahila morcha (women’s front) president. Paul, who won the Asansol South assembly seat in the March-April polls, was made a general secretary along with Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee    No BJP leader was willing to comment on record on the reshuffle.  Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “It appears from the list that former TMC minister Suvendu Adhikri, who is now leader of the opposition in the assembly, will have no problem working with the new committee members.”  Adhikari joined the BJP in December last year.

He also talked about feeling his “hands and feet” being tied up and that he thought of taking rest.Uttarakhand assembly elections are scheduled next year.

Also, there was a dearth of a total of 180 scientists in the Defence Research and Development Scientists (DRDS) cadre between the same timeline.The national auditor said the DRDO does not have the standard to review the requirement of guest houses (GH) similar to that of the defence services in which the construction of officers' mess is taken up on the basis of the authorised strength of officers at a certain unit."Audit observed that occupancy in 53 (41.40 per cent) out of 128 GHs under the jurisdiction of DRDO, was less than 20 per cent during the period from 2014-15 to 2018-19," the PTI quoted the report.The CAG further found that two additional guest houses were constructed at one of its stations, which already had three of the houses with a yearly occupancy between 11 to 42 per cent only.The report came in the wake of the DRDO successfully test-firing a number of missiles, including the surface-to-surface guided, short-range Pralay ballistic missile off the Odisha coast on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdos-58-construction-work-not-completed-on-time-between-2014-19-cag-report-101640179797499.html

22-12-2021||India||Goa polls: TMC says Kejriwal’s ‘not in race’ comments show political immaturity||The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal showed political immaturity as well as ‘desperation’ when he said that the Mamata Banerjee-led party is not in contention in the upcoming elections in Goa.Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener declined to attach much importance to the TMC, which is seeking to expand its base in the coastal state, and said that ‘any party cannot win elections on the basis of posters’ without naming anyone.He said there are more than 1,300 political parties and he cannot name every single one of them.It was when he was asked about a pre-poll alliance between the AAP and TMC, Kejriwal said he said the latter is “not in the race”. “There are 1,350 parties in the country, should I start mentioning everyone,” he said when questioned regarding his silence regarding the presence of the regional party.“We firmly believe in working for people and standing beside them through thick and thin. Those indulging in election forecasting and vote share predictions are simply reflecting their political immaturity and desperation. Let the people of Goa decide who should be taken seriously,” the TMC tweeted.While both the parties share cordial ties at the national level, they are vying to take the lead to be the prime opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the polls.Senior TMC leader and state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said Kejriwal’s comments are borne out of “local compulsion”. “We don't attach much importance to it,” he said. The TMC is contesting all the assembly seats of the Goa polls. The coastal state will witness a multi-party contest as TMC, AAP and the Congress try to wrest power from the BJP. The elections will be held next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-polls-tmc-says-kejriwal-s-not-in-race-comments-show-political-immaturity-101640186221917.html

Last week, 18 students from a school in the Ghansoli area of Navi Mumbai tested positive for the virus leading to shutting down of the school.Meanwhile, the Omicron variant has so far infected more than 200 people in the country. The new strain, first detected in South Africa last month, is responsible for most of the new cases being reported across Europe and has also led to imposition of strict restrictions ahead of Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve.The variant also has led to speculations over the need to administer booster shots in India and elsewhere.

22-12-2021||India||Accused of stealing by cop, 8-yr-old moves Kerala court; gets relief of ₹1.5 lakh||In a setback to the state government the Kerala High Court on Wednesday ordered a compensation of ₹1.50 lakh to a minor girl and her father who were accused by a woman police officer of stealing her mobile phone. The single judge bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran also imposed ₹25,000 as the cost of the legal expenses and directed the government to take disciplinary action against the police officer. The petitioners, an 8-year-old girl and her father, had moved the court two months ago seeking compensation of ₹50 lakh from the government for humiliating them in public in Attingal (Thiruvananthapuram) on August 27. “We cannot let our daughters grow up in anger; immediate remedial steps should be taken. No one can dispute her Fundamental Right under Article 21 to lead a dignified life,” the judge observed while delivering the verdict. Earlier the state government had opposed their plea and insisted that there was no need to pay any compensation to them. The court also recorded that it expected the State to rise in defence of the petitioner since she was ‘its daughter’ as well. It expressed its disappointment at the refusal of the Kerala government to acknowledge the trauma she had gone through and ordered relief for her. The court also said disciplinary action should be taken against the officer. The incident occurred on August 27. The little girl along with her father had gone to see a gigantic cargo being shifted by road to Vikram Sarabhai Research Centre in the state capital. The pink police was part of the police deployment to control the public. When the pink police officer misplaced her mobile phone she accused the little girl and her father, who were standing near the police vehicle, of stealing it. Both were questioned in public by the officer and the girl broke down while she was being frisked. But a few minutes later, the phone was recovered from the police jeep and the police team left the scene immediately without tendering an apology to the petrified girl. Later the video of the police officer questioning the duo went viral. After the video went viral the police officer was transferred and asked to undergo a short stint of behavioural training. Later both moved court seeking compensation. Though the police officer tendered an apology both the girl and her father refused to accept it. Earlier while hearing the petition, the court asked the state government what it proposes to do to assuage feelings of an 8-year-old girl and her father who were accused of theft by a woman police officer in public so as to ensure her faith in humanity and police. The court made many such observations and even pulled up the state police chief for trying to defend a fellow officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-of-stealing-by-cop-8-yr-old-moves-kerala-court-gets-relief-of-rs-1-5-lakh-101640180867510.html

22-12-2021||India||Former BJP MLA joins Congress, party not the same after Parrikar, he says||Two-time BJP MLA and party’s representative from Vasco da Gama, Carlos Almeida joined the Congress on Wednesday along with several supporters claiming that the BJP is no longer the party that it was under former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. Almeida, who was first elected in 2012 on a BJP ticket, accused the party of shunning him claiming that it was unfit to continue in public life while simultaneously promoting people of dubious character in the party. Almeida is the seventh MLA in recent days to resign as a member of the Goa Legislative Assembly bringing the strength of the 40-member house down to 33. With this, 23 of the 40 legislators (53%) elected in 2017 find themselves in a different party from the one they were elected in back in 2017. That number can rise further with several others including some from the BJP reported to be considering walking away from the party in the hope of better prospects elsewhere. Almeida is the second BJP MLA to quit the party after Alina Saldanha put in her papers and subsequently joined the Aam Aadmi Party claiming that the party was working against the interests of the people. “The party is not the same as it was during the days of Manohar Parrikar. They have tried to backstab me and blame me for their failures. But the people have stood firmly behind me and have urged me to take this step,” Almeida said after being welcomed into the party by AICC in charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. Almeida’s entry is a shot in the arm for the Congress which has recently lost MLAs to the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bjp-mla-joins-congress-party-not-the-same-after-parrikar-he-says-101640176066760.html

The party accused the Centre of purposely suspending vocal MPs.“We came prepared to raise numerous issues in the Parliament, but the day the session began the Centre suspended our 12 opinionated MPs who would have spoken against the government,” said Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha. “To have a majority in the Upper House, the ruling party blacklisted the members....” He called this an unconstitutional act.Kharge said the Centre knew the Opposition would raise up the mowing down of protesting farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri and the alleged involvement of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son in it. “So, they intentionally delayed daily proceedings and eventually ended the Winter Session one day earlier,” he said. “They gave us a bad name by saying that the Opposition does not allow the House to run smoothly.”Other Congress leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Jairam Ramesh echoed Kharge and said the Centre did not want the issues related to China, inflation, unemployment, and Teni to be raised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-slams-govt-for-disallowing-discussions-during-parliament-s-winter-session-101640175166549.html

Maoist’s Venkatapuram-Vajedu Area Committee secretary Shantha purportedly wrote the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Ramesh’s widow, Korsa Rajitha, earlier told local reporters her husband worked as a driver while appealing to Maoists to release him unharmed.In the letter, Shantha claimed Ramesh worked for the Maoists pretending to be their sympathiser but passed on information about them to the police. “Ramesh was in touch with the Venkatapuram police and was passing on vital information about the movements of the Maoists...he was being paid money... At the behest of the police, he supplied milk powder laced with poison to the Maoists, who fell sick after consuming the same. One of the Maoists, M Bhikshapathi alias Vijender, died of poisoning,” Shanta wrote.He blamed Ramesh for tipping off police about Maoist presence that triggered a gunbattle. Shantha claimed Ramesh collected ₹two lakh from the police for this. “We are killing him as per the people’s wish as he betrayed the people and the party.”

A team of senior IOC officials from Delhi reached the refinery. A three-member expert committee started a probe into the accident, IOC officials said. As a few hundred contractual workers assembled outside the plant, demanding compensation for the affected families and treatment for the injured men, state irrigation minister Soumen Mahapatra, who hails from the region, visited the spot and held a meeting with IOC officials. The minister said he demanded upgradation of safety measures inside the plant and adequate compensation for the families of the deceased. “IOC has agreed to give a compensation of ₹5 lakh each to the three families. A similar amount will be given by the private firm that employed these workers,” Mahapatra said after the meeting on Wednesday afternoon. According to IOC, shutdown and maintenance work is going on at some of the major units in the refinery. The accident happened around 2.40 pm on Tuesday at the MSQ unit during a shutdown-related work. “The preliminary cause of the accident seems to be a flash fire leading to burn injuries to 44 people and three persons unfortunately succumbed to the injuries. The fire was immediately extinguished and the situation is now under control,” the IOC said in a statement. IOC officials said the injured employees were initially admitted to the Haldia Refinery Hospital from where 38 men were rushed to two private hospitals in Kolkata late on Tuesday. “The family members of the three workers who unfortunately lost their lives during yesterday’s incident have been contacted for extending all possible support in this hour of grief. Among those with injuries, three contract workers have been discharged after preliminary treatment and 38 others have been admitted at multi-speciality hospitals in Kolkata for advanced medical care,” the IOC said in a statement. “Indian Oil is extending the best medical treatment to the 38 injured and no effort or cost will be spared to ensure their speedy recovery. Their family members are also being contacted for extending all necessary support. The senior management of “Indian Oil is continuously monitoring the situation. Indian Oil shall provide all necessary assistance, relief and adequate compensation to the affected workers. A high-level committee from Delhi is already on site for inquiring into the cause of the incident,” the statement added. On Tuesday, the state police set up a green corridor so that the ambulances could reach Kolkata without having to stop at traffic signals along the 118-kilometer route. In a tweet, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said: “Deeply anguished by the fire in IOC, Haldia. Three precious lives were lost and my thoughts are with the bereaved families in this hour of grief. Those injured are being brought to Kolkata through a green corridor. GoWB will extend all assistance to ensure their speedy recovery.” A doctor at one of the private hospitals in Kolkata said some of the men undergoing treatment not only suffered burns but also inhaled toxic gas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-deaths-injuries-at-bengal-ioc-refinery-trigger-agitation-govt-announces-aid-101640173786248.html

Opposition members also protested on issues such as price rise and the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.However, Leader of Opposition in the Upper House Mallikarjun Kharge said the Narendra Modi government had deliberately suspended the 12 MPs so that the bill could be passed easily. “This winter session started with the suspension of 12 MPs. The decision to suspend them in the winter session on the incident that happened in the monsoon session was absolutely wrong. We wanted to discuss issues of unemployment, inflation and others,” he said.Their (BJP) intention was to pass bills immediately without any discussion. Since they were not in majority, they did not want voting on the bills so they decided to reduce some opposition members.

Kharge further said Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu who is also Chairman of the House, had informed him that the winter session might be adjourned indefinitely today.Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Opposition wanted the House to run smoothly, but the government refused to talk on Mishra's issue. “As the Union minister's name came up (in the violence case), we felt the need to talk to the government. We had demanded that the minister be sacked. If the government does not answer the Opposition, they are responsible for the adjournment of Parliament,” he said.The session saw multiple disruptions by the Opposition members, including trooping into the Well of the House and carrying placards, over the suspension of the 12 MPs and the sacking of Mishra over his jailed son Ashish's involvement in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-union-minister-s-2019-mandate-jibe-kharge-cites-rajya-sabha-numbers-101640169636913.html

A lot of efforts have been made across the country including provisioning more than 1,500 PSA plants. Most of them are now functional. In order to improve coordination and facilitation, a comprehensive data system Oxycare has been launched. Things are being monitored regularly. We are prepared for any eventuality,” Paul said.The government has asked citizens to ensure that they do not miss out or delay the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. India vaccinated at least 87% of its eligible population with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while 51% of the population have been fully vaccinated with both doses. The government also urged state governments and governments of Union Territories to utilise the remaining vaccine stocks and vaccinate the unvaccinated.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also warned states and Union Territories on Tuesday saying that the Omicron variant is three times more transmissible than the Delta variant. The Omicron variant, which has been categorised as a ‘variant of concern’, by the World Health Organization, is the primary strain causing infections in most European countries and also leading to stricter regulations in those regions.The variant, first discovered in South Africa and its neighbouring countries, has infected more than 200 people in the country. The government also ramped up genomic sequencing to check if Omicron is the driving force behind new cases or if it is leading to a surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niti-aayog-s-vk-paul-says-call-on-booster-will-be-based-on-scientific-decisions-101640168130439.html

These residents have been casting their votes in Assam. We’ve [even] given them Covid-19 vaccines,” Bora said, adding that Assam police personnel have been deployed to those areas. The Assam minister was responding to a discussion in the assembly started by Congress MLA from Boko, Nandita Das, who alleged that some people from her constituency who reside along the border were being “encouraged” by Meghalaya police to pick their side in the dispute.Bora and Das are members of one of multiple regional committees formed to defuse the border crisis in Kamrup district. They have made visits to the disputed areas and met with the residents. Das also claimed that some people from Meghalaya were preventing pro-Assam residents from the border areas from attending joint meetings of the panels that are tackling the disputes. She called on the Assam government to provide security to the residents.Also Read: On Manipur visit, Conrad Sangma vows to continue fight to repeal AFSPAMeghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma, however, has firmly denied the claim, saying no such pressure was being applied on people living in the disputed zones. “I don’t think it’s possible to pressurise anyone in any way,” Sangma told reporters in Shillong on Tuesday. “People will make their choice. We’ve left it to the people to express their concerns. They will decide what’s best for them.”“There may be some concerns from Assam’s side, but I’m constantly in touch with the Assam chief minister. It’s not possible for us to influence anyone. They (the residents) will make their own choice,” the Meghalaya CM said. The two chief ministers were expected to meet in Guwahati later on Wednesday to discuss the border issues.Assam and Meghalaya share a 733km boundary. Border disputes between the two sides were commonplace since 1972 when Meghalaya was carved out of Assam.Earlier this year, the two state governments agreed to resolve by the end of 2021 six of 12 identified border disputes. An update on that is expected to be announced on December 31.

The woman claimed to have met Sheena Bora, murdered in 2012, on June 24, near Dal Lake, the lawyer told news agency ANI. "We will file an application to direct CBI to conduct a fair probe," the lawyer said.The six-year-old case in connection with which Indrani Mukerjea was arrested in 2015 for killing her daughter Sheena Bora created a ripple once again as Indrani Mukerjea wrote to the CBI that Sheena is alive. In her letter, she claimed that a woman government official told her that she had seen Sheena. CBI took over the case in 2015 and has completed its investigation. The CBI is not taking Indrani Mukerjea's letter seriously, as they are seeing it only as an attempt to prolong the case. The CBI has already concluded its probe and concluded that Indrani Mukerjea had murdered her daughter Sheena Bora in 2012 with the help of her driver Shyamvar Rai and second husband Sanjeev Khanna. Indrani did not approve of Sheena's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea, the son of Peter Mukerjea, who was Indrani's third husband. Sheena had threatened Indrani that she will reveal to everyone that she was Indrani's daughter and not her sister, as Indrani used to tell people.The heinous murder came to the surface three years after in 2015 when Indrani Mukerjea's former driver was interrogated by the Mumbai Police in connection with some other case. Three years after Sheena Bora was killed, burnt and buried, the skeleton was exhumed and sent for forensic, which confirmed that the death took place because of strangulation and there was no fracture in the bone structure. Indrani, however, claimed that it was not Sheena's skeleton as Sheena was alive and was abroad for studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-who-met-sheena-bora-ready-to-record-statement-indrani-mukerjea-s-lawyer-101640166183529.html

Tweeting an exclusive interview with a news channel, the Congress leader on Wednesday said sisters will bring change in politics.In the video, a smiling Priyanka can be seen invoking a reference of Shashi Kapoor in the 1975 film, Deewar. "Have you heard that dialogue? Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor were brothers in the movie. Amitabh Bachchan tells Shashi Kapoor ‘mere paas gaadhi hai, bunglow hai, yeh hai, woh hai’. Then Shashi Kapoor says, 'mere paas maa hai'. So, I am also saying ‘mere paas behen hai’," Priyanka Gandhi said to the television channel.मेरे पास बहनें हैं…बहनें राजनीति में बदलाव लाएंगी।#लड़की_हूं_लड़_सकती_हूं pic.twitter.com/v2uVpsO1wAMaking women voters a priority, Congress this time rolled out a women's manifesto for Uttar Pradesh, promising 40% quota in government jobs if the party is voted to power. The party has promised tax rebates and other sops for women, including free bus travel. Before releasing the women's manifesto, the party promised smartphones for 12 pass girls and scooty for all graduate girls.Dissing Congress's slogan, Union minister Smriti Irani had earlier said, “Ghar pad ladka hai par lad nahin sakta (There is a boy at home who can't fight').”Congress's focus on women empowerment has made other parties talk about women, Priyanka recently said. "The impact of my initiative was so much that now all political parties are talking about women.

22-12-2021||India||Lakshadweep: Move to change weekly holiday from Friday to Sunday triggers row||The move to change the weekly holiday for schools from Friday to Sunday has triggered a fresh backlash against the administration in Muslim-majority Lakshadweep months after protests over alleged attempts to change its unique culture and traditions rocked the archipelago.The administration issued a circular on December 17 modifying school timings, saying changes were in tune with national norms and to ensure maximum utilisation of resources. Around 96% of the archipelago’s 66,000 residents are Muslims. Schools remained closed on Fridays in Lakshadweep to facilitate the all-important afternoon congregational prayers.The Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body of political and religious bodies, said this is the latest move to “destroy the region’s cultural identity” and that it would oppose the move fiercely. “This is another move to spoil the identity of the island. Administrator Praful Khoda Patel is unnecessarily provoking poor residents. We will not allow this to happen,” said the forum in a statement.A draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation to develop the islands as a major tourist destination triggered protests in the region earlier this year. Residents alleged the regulation will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the Scheduled Tribe category. Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats, and artists described the regulation as arbitrary and aimed against the community of the islands.The Kerala assembly passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of Patel over it. As many as 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising Patel’s “partisan attitude”. They urged him to protect the region’s unique culture and tradition.Also Read: ‘Fire on stranded ship off Lakshadweep brought down, all passengers & crew safe’Lakshadweep collector Asgar Ali said the change in the holiday was in line with a long-pending demand of teachers and a section of parents. “It is nothing to do with the religion. We are providing a one-hour break to students to offer Friday prayers. The administration is following the national system where Sunday is designated as a holiday. This will help streamline things.”B Hassan, the local district panchayat president, said the administration never consulted anyone before announcing a sweeping change like this. “The majority community should have been consulted before taking such a decision. You cannot take decisions like this which will antagonise the majority of the people,” he said. He said there will be a practical difficulty for students in completing prayers and lunch during the one-hour break.The region’s residents have also opposed a move to ban cattle slaughter, implementation of a two-child norm for local body members, issuance of liquor licenses, and other new rules.In August, the Kerala high court, which has jurisdiction over Lakshadweep, rejected a petition questioning the Lakshadweep administration’s decision to close dairy farms and remove meat from the midday meals in schools. The court said it cannot interfere in policy matters of the administration. An appeal against this is pending before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-move-to-change-weekly-holiday-from-friday-to-sunday-triggers-row-101640158844646.html
22-12-2021||India||AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria's fresh warning amid Omicron rise in India||A day after the Centre wrote to all states and Union Territories to prepare for the battle against Omicron on a war footing, AIIMS Delhi director Dr Randeep Guleria said vaccine and Covid-appropriate behaviour are the only two ways to counter the increasing spread of the new variant. As of Wednesday, India has reported 213 Omicron cases starting from December 2, when the first Omicron cases in the country were detected."Omicron is a more transmissible variant. We need to do two things to protect ourselves, first one is to take vaccines and the second is to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour," Dr Guleria said.Omicron spread: PM Modi to hold Covid-19 review meeting on ThursdayEarlier, Dr Guleria said existing vaccines can be tweaked for protection against Omicron. "We will have second-generation vaccines. This is something which we need to keep in mind. The current vaccines are effective but with new variants, they will decrease immunity. However, vaccines can be tweaked...There are also studies going on about if we can have a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Let's say the Delta variant and Beta variant combined into one vaccine that makes a bivalent vaccine."The Omicron cases reported in India are mostly from foreign-origin which means either the patients have been to foreign countries or they have come into contact with someone who has been to a foreign country. All cases have been mild with no major symptoms reported so far. Though most patients are recovering in home isolation, state governments are getting Omicron patients admitted to facilities as there is a chance of transmission in home isolation.In its letter to the states and UTs in which the Centre pressed the emergency button, it said, "Based on current scientific evidence, the VOC Omicron is at least three times more transmissible than the Delta VOC. Besides, the Delta VOC is still present in different parts of the country. Hence, even greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision making and strict and prompt containment action is required at the local and district level. The decision making at the State/UTs and district level must be very prompt and focussed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-director-dr-randeep-guleria-s-fresh-warning-amid-omicron-rise-in-india-101640158265117.html

The nomination process for the first phase has begun.On Friday last, the Supreme Court stayed the election process on seats reserved for OBC in the local body polls and told the state to renotify OBC category seats as general due to a lack of empirical data.During the discussion in the assembly on the top court’s verdict on Tuesday, Chouhan also blamed Congress leaders for approaching the Supreme Court in the first place that led to what he described as an injustice to the OBC population. “They were adamant about the cancellation of reservation which resulted in OBC reservation was struck down by the apex court,” the chief minister said.“But we will not allow this injustice. We will not allow panchayat elections without OBC reservation. The central government will move the court and we will also go to ensure OBC reservation in panchayat elections,” he added.The chief minister was referring to a petition filed by some Congress leaders - senior advocate and Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha appeared for them in court - against the state ordinance in November to conduct panchayat elections as per rotation of reservation and delimitation in 2014. The Congress insisted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was wrong to have annulled the delimitation and reservation notification of 2019 issued when Kamal Nath was the chief minister. Nath, now leader of opposition in the state assembly, sought to blunt Chouhan’s attacks, wondering why the advocate general was not able to persuade the court that OBC quota wasn’t an issue in Madhya Pradesh. “The state government also had the option of filing a review petition but BJP leaders are more interested in doing politics. But I urge the state government to move to the court to resolve this issue.”
22-12-2021||India||Modi govt working to develop full ecosystem for semiconductor chip manufacturing||India expects at least a dozen semiconductor manufacturers to start setting up local factories in the next 2-3 years after the South Asian nation offered incentives for the sector, the country’s information and technology minister said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is working on developing a full ecosystem for the chip manufacturing industry and will start taking applications under its incentive scheme from Jan. 1, Ashwini Vaishnaw, who also holds the railways and telecom portfolio, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin and Rishaad Salamat.“The response has been very good. All the big players are in talks with Indian partners and many want to come directly to set up their units here. Almost all big ones are talking to us,” Vaishnaw said.The country intends to get involved in several stages of chipmaking, including silicon and display fabs and semiconductor packaging. It will start with fabrication of mature 28nm to 45nm parts and will request a road map from candidate companies for moving to more advanced production techniques over time, the minister said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., the leading producers of the world’s most advanced chips, have shown themselves willing to expand internationally with recent announcements of new fabs in the US and Japan, aided by local government support.Last week, the Modi government approved sops worth 760 billion rupees ($10 billion) spread over six years to boost local chip production, a move which is likely to help the South Asian nation reduce its reliance on expensive imports of the material used in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles amid a global shortage. Currently, India relies on overseas manufacturers for almost all of its semiconductor requirement.  India joins a growing list of nations from Japan to Europe and the U.S. in setting aside multibillion-dollar subsidies for domestic chipmaking, after a global shortage of the vital components walloped a plethora of important industries and exposed economic vulnerabilities.The government has already notified the plan and expects compound semiconductor units and design and packaging companies to get approval within the next 3-4 months, Vaishnaw said. “In next 2-3 years time frame, we see at least 10-12 semiconductors going into production, we see display fab going into production or may be finalizing completion,” the minister, who has an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and attended the Indian Institute of Technology, said. “At least 50-60 designing companies would have started designing the products in the next 2-3 years”.On the proposed 5G auctions, Vaishnaw said the telecoms regulator is holding consultations with industry and is likely to submit its recommendations by March next year and the spectrum pricing is expected to be “reasonable”. The government aims to start 5G services by Oct.-Dec. 2022. After offering a rescue package for embattled mobile phone operators earlier in Sept., the government is also looking at a complete overhaul of the sector, exploring ways to allow companies to merge, expand and operate without multiple bureaucratic approvals, Bloomberg News had earlier reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-working-to-develop-full-ecosystem-for-semiconductor-chip-manufacturing-101640156216535.html

22-12-2021||India||Amid Omicron threat, Covid R-value has gone up in these states. What does this mean?||In the last one month, the R-value of Covid infection has gone up considerably in several states. In some states, the value went down and then again picked up from the last week of November. R-value of the infection is of much importance for scientists and epidemiologists. It indicated the transmissibility of the virus. If the R-value in a state is 1, it means one Covid infected person can spread the infection to another person. A value less than 1 means one infected person can spread the infection to less than one person, and a value greater than 1 indicated that one infected person can spread the infection to more than one person, which is of great concern.Omicron: 'Activate war rooms, consider night lockdowns', Centre asks statesThe increase in the R-value comes amid the Omicron threat in India. Believed to be more contagious than Delta and other previous variants, Omicron is spreading rapidly, though the new variant is not causing severe diseases. At present, there are 213 Omicron cases in India, with Delhi topping the chart with 57 cases. Delhi is followed by Maharashtra with 54 cases and Telangana with 24 cases.Here is the state-wise status of Omicron cases in India Here is the comparison of R value in states Analysing the R-value chart, epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu tweeted that states that have recorded an increase in the R-value are Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Odisha, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Manipur and Nagaland. States with an increase in the RT values on December 19th as compared to Dec 13th are Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Odisha, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Manipur & Nagaland. India’s effective RT is 0.89 as on Dec 19. pic.twitter.com/P2Vh5IviM4As on December 19, India's effective R-value was 0.89. On November 2, India's R-value was 0.8 which increased to 0.97 on November 29.Eight states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Telangana, have an R-value of 1 and above. This indicates that the infection is spreading rapidly in these states.The Centre has warned all states and Union territories to start preparing to fight Omicron on a war footing as Omicron is at least thrice more transmissible than Delta. According to experts, the variant is unlikely to lead to any oxygen crisis like what happened during the second wave, but because of its high transmissibility, infections will spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-omciron-threat-covid-r-value-has-gone-up-in-these-states-101640148520228.html
22-12-2021||India||India: Will Covid pose more problems in 2022?||India battled a devastating second coronavirus wave earlier this year and is now seeing a rise in omicron cases. Experts hope the new variant will prove less lethal, but warn against complacency.India's devastating second wave of COVID-19 earlier this year brought the nation's health care system to its knees.At the height of the wave in April and May, the daily number of new infections often exceeded 400,000, overwhelming the country's health care infrastructure, which struggled with acute shortages of hospital beds, critical medicines and equipment.Many patients died outside hospitals because of the lack of beds and medical oxygen."It was almost like Dante's inferno. A numbed population watched in horror for more than a month at the shortage of hospital beds, the fires of crematoria burning day and night, doctors begging for oxygen, patients suffocating outside hospital gates, and decomposing bodies floating in the River Ganges," Aman Lal, a crematorium caretaker, told DW.Rising concerns over omicronOver the past couple of weeks, concerns over the prospect of a third wave of infections have grown, with the detection and spread of the new omicron variant worldwide.India has so far recorded about 200 omicron cases across 12 states, mostly in the western state of Maharashtra and the nation's capital New Delhi, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.The country's tally of omicron cases has nearly doubled within a week, but there have been no deaths reported so far. In less than 40% of cases, patients either fully recovered or were discharged, the data showed.Virologists and scientists say there will be an increase in infections in India over the coming weeks and months. Nevertheless, they believe the new variant could be less lethal than the last delta wave because of widespread previous infections and vaccinations in the South Asian nation.No room for complacencyVineeta Bal, an immunologist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, believes another serious COVID-related crisis may not come India's way even though infections could go up."Vaccination, some improvements in health infrastructure, partial but continued use of masking and omicron as a possibly more infectious but less virulent strain will contribute to a less devastating situation than what we saw in 2021," Bal told DW.Still, experts warn that there is no room for complacency. "A small percentage of a large number can be huge. However, the pre-existing immunity due to vaccination and prior infection should help reduce the impact. Unvaccinated and older people could still be affected more severely," Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, told DW."What we should be looking towards is making this another manageable respiratory infection which does not disrupt our lives," she added."Rather than focusing on the absolute number of cases reported daily, we need to track severe cases, hospitalizations and deaths closely. And we need to analyze breakthrough infections by age and by vaccination status to look for waning immunity," Swaminathan underlined.Mask-wearing declines as infections dropThe number of new infections recorded in India has been on the decline over the past few weeks.The South Asian country registered 5,326 new COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours, the lowest such tally in the country in more than one and a half years.Overall, the country has reported 34.75 million cases, the second-highest in the world after the United States.Government surveys have estimated that nearly 70% of Indians had been naturally infected by July, following a record rise in infections and deaths in April and May.With the drop in new infections, mask-wearing in public has fallen to levels last seen in March, before the second wave of cases, data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation shows.Current mask-wearing is estimated at 59%, nearly the same as in March, having peaked at 81% in May.But amid growing fears of potential surges in infections, health authorities have been urging people to use face coverings in public.No booster shots yetAuthorities have also been accelerating the vaccination campaign, with at least one vaccine shot given to about 87% of the nation's eligible 944 million adults while around 58% have received two doses.India has not considered authorizing booster doses yet, as many in the country have been naturally infected and the government believes two vaccine doses offer sufficient protection for now, Reuters news agency reported late last month."A booster protects a person further from symptomatic infection. While we await local data, let us not delay preparing for boosters and vaccinating children as global data shows that people with prior infection with other variants have minimal capacity to neutralize omicron," virologist Shahid Jameel told DW.India better prepared now than during the second wave?Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, believes India is better prepared overall to face a new wave of infections, in terms of knowing where its deficiencies lie and what to address first."The positive is that, compared to the second wave, any third wave will hit a population that is expected to have substantial hybrid immunity, from infections during the delta wave and vaccinations," Menon said.The expert added that the government should make the relevant epidemiological data available widely, particularly with regard to testing, disease severity and patients' prior medical conditions, among other things."Data is a public good and measures can be made faster and better if more integrated data is made available. We will be flying blind into the storm otherwise," Menon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-covid-pose-more-problems-in-2022-101640147485125.html
22-12-2021||India||Delhi's 1st Omicron patient talks about symptoms, treatment, past Covid case||Delhi's first case of Omicron, a 37-year-old man from Ranchi, Sahil Thakur has been discharged from the hospital as he is on his way to recovery. At present, he is under home isolation following which he will be under 14-day observation at home. A couple of security personnel have been posted outside his house to keep a watch, ensuring that there is no movement. "I have been told that I will be under 14-day observation at home, and doctors will check on me intermittently," Sahil Thakur told news agency PTI. He was detected with this latest variant of SARS-CoV-2 on December 5, three days after India's first Omicron cases were reported. He had travelled to Dubai for some business work and flew back to Delhi on December 4.Delhi doctor gives insight into health of Omicron patients, oxygen and ICU need"We were asked to fill out e-Suvidha forms, and passengers were being randomly tested then, unlike everyone being tested now. And, I was not tested on arrival at the airport, so I walked out. Plus, I had no symptoms, cough, sore throat or temperature. So, I just went home and isolated myself in a room as a precaution," he said."But, I had to fly to Bombay on December 7, so, I got myself tested for Covid before undertaking my journey. I tested positive for Covid on December 6, so my travel plan was cancelled, and two days later, I was informed by authorities that I was positive with Omicron variant," Thakur told PTI.Thakur was allowed to stay under home isolation till December 11 and then an ambulance came to take him to LNJP Hospital.Like most of the Omicron cases across the world, Thakur did not have any symptoms. In fact, this is not the first time that he got Covid. During the first wave too, he was infected, he said. "I really got lucky. This is a highly transmissible variant, but my parents got tested and they came negative, plus a few other people I had come in contact with, also got themselves tested, and came negative. And, right now, we all have to be very careful," he said.The businessman stays in Rohini with his parents and domestic help. There are three to four police personnel keeping a watch outside his house, he said. "They are very courteous, and also provide us with daily essential items, as none of us can go out till the restrictions are in place. Even after the home isolation restrictions are lifted, maybe after 3-4 days, I have been told, I will be under observation for 14 days, at home, and doctors will check on me intermittently," he said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-1st-omicron-patient-talks-about-symptoms-treatment-past-covid-case-101640144358020.html

22-12-2021||India||Online gaming: Karnataka high court to hear case today for disposal. All you need to know||The Karnataka high court on Wednesday is expected to dispose of the petitions filed against the state’s new law, which seeks to regulate all formats of online gaming. Six companies and industry bodies have moved the high court against the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Compliance Act, 2021, which makes all forms of gambling, including online, a cognisable and non-bailable offenceThe petitioners are: All Indian Gaming Federation (AIGF), Mobile Premier League, Games24x7, Gameskraft, Head Digital Works Private Ltd, and Junglee Games.The case will be heard by a bench of Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Krishna S Dixit.What is the issue?A number of companies, which hold online fantasy sports and rummy, argue that the games which require skills have been clubbed along with games of chance in the definition of gaming.Their arguments have been successfully accepted by the high courts in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where the companies cited a law laid down by the Supreme Court in 1957 that competitive games of skill are business activities protected under the sub-sections of Article 19 of the Constitution.When was the law passed by Karnataka?The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Compliance Act, 2021, was passed by the state legislature in September this year and notified on October 5.Which other states have banned online gaming?Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Odisha, Nagaland and Sikkim have banned online rummy. However, the Madras high court, in August this year, quashed the state government’s ban on online rummy, holding that it requires skills and cannot be considered as gambling.The Kerala high court too, in September, struck down an amendment which imposed a ban on online rummy.How big is the online gaming industry?According to the All-India Gaming Federation Report, the sector touched $1 billion in 2020. The report was prepared along with Ernst and Young.It is expected to reach $2 billion by 2023, the report further said.Concerns around online gamingEarlier this month, Rajya Sabha member and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Kumar Modi demanded on the floor of the House that the government should regulate the online gaming industry and impose a uniform tax on it.Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Modi said that these online games have now given way to gambling and betting.During the pre-Covid period, the BJP leader said, the weekly time spent on mobile gaming was 2.5 hours, while 11 per cent of total smartphone time was spent on gaming. However, during lockdown, the gaming time has increased to four hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-gaming-karnataka-high-court-to-hear-case-today-for-disposal-101640130320592.html

22-12-2021||India||National Mathematics Day: Celebrating Srinivasa Ramanujan's birthday||India is celebrating the birthday of legendary mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar on Wednesday (December 22). The day is celebrated as National Mathematics Day or Maths Day.Ramanujan was a prodigious Indian mathematician who, despite having no formal training in advanced mathematical concepts, mastered trigonometry at the age of 12 and went on to make great contributions to mathematical concepts such as number theory, infinite series and continued fractions.He was born on December 22, 1887, in Tamil Nadu’s Erode. Ramanujan had enrolled in Madras’ Pachaiyappa College at the age of 14.Ramanujan was working at Madras Port Trust in 1912 where his prowess was recognised by some of his co-workers, one of whom referred him to professor GH Hardy of Trinity College, Cambridge University. He met Hardy in 1913, a year after which he went to Trinity College where he honed his craft under the Englishman’s tutelage.He received his degree from Cambridge in 1916 and went on to publish several brilliant papers on his subject with Hardy’s help.Last year, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ wrote a piece in Hindustan Times in which he called Ramanujan the “epitome of mathematical excellence”.History of National Mathematics DayFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had in 2012 announced December 22 as National Mathematics Day, while paying tribute to Ramanujan in Chennai.Since then, the day is celebrated as National Mathematics Day every year.Ramanujan’s influence on popular cultureThe mathematician has always fascinated the world by his theorems and other achievements.The life of this exceptionally gifted mathematician was portrayed by British-Indian actor Dev Patel in 2015 film ‘The Man Who Knew Infinity’.

22-12-2021||India||India has ‘holy cows’ grazing everywhere, says Madras HC, calls for 'duty to laugh'||India has “holy cows” grazing from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to Vadipatti in Tamil Nadu and one dare not poke fun at them, the Madras High Court has said, adding that the Constitution would probably do with an amendment for “duty to laugh”.All over the country, national security happens to be the “ultimate holy cow,” a bench comprising Justice G R Swaminathan said.The court’s observation came while quashing a first information report (FIR) filed by Tamil Nadu Police against one Mathivanan over a Facebook post of photos with an accompanying caption “Trip to Sirumalai for shooting practice,” apparently written in a lighter vein.Invoking well-known satirists, cartoonists and journalists like Jug Suraiya, Bachi Karkaria, E P Unny and G Sampath in his judgment, Justice Swaminathan said: “They would have proposed a momentous amendment to the Constitution of India to incorporate sub-clause (l) in Article 51-A.” The section deals with duties related to abiding by the Constitution and uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India among others.“To this, the hypothetical author would have added one more fundamental duty- duty to laugh. The correlative right to be funny can be mined in Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India (the use of crypto vocabulary to be forgiven),” the judge noted. The judge noted that the petitioner “tried to be funny” but “Vadipatty Police did not find it to be a joke”. “Any normal and reasonable person coming across the Facebook post would have laughed it off,” he said. The court also observed that being funny is one thing and poking fun at another is different altogether. “Laugh at what is a serious question. This is because we have holy cows grazing all over from Varanasi to Vadipatty. One dare not poke fun at them. There is however no single catalogue of holy cows. It varies from person to person and from region to region,” the judge said.“A real cow, even if terribly underfed and emaciated, shall be holy in Yogi’s terrain. In West Bengal, Tagore is such an iconic figure that Khushwant Singh learnt the lesson at some cost. Coming to my own Tamil Desh, the all-time iconoclast ‘Periyar’ Shri E V Ramasamy is a super-holy cow. In today’s Kerala, Marx and Lenin are beyond the bounds of criticism or satire. Chhatrapati Shivaji and Veer Savarkar enjoy a similar immunity in Maharashtra. But all over India, there is one ultimate holy cow and that is national security,” he added. Petitioner Mathivanan, an office-bearer of CPI (ML), had sought quashing the FIR registered by Vadipatti police in Madurai over his Facebook post that carried his pictures of a visit to Siruamalai with the caption in Tamil-- “Thuppakki Payirchikaga Sirumalai Payanam,” translating to “Trip to Sirumalai for shooting practice.” “The petitioner herein is an important office-bearer of a not-so-important political party. CPI (ML) is now an over-ground organization which contests elections also. Paper warriors are also entitled to fantasise that they are swadeshi Che Guevaras,” the judge said. “Revolutionaries, whether real or phoney, are not usually credited with any sense of humour (or at least this is the stereotype). For a change, the petitioner tried to be funny. Perhaps it was his maiden attempt at humour,” the judge said.But the police did not “find it to be a joke” and booked him under different sections of IPC, including collecting arms with intention of waging war against the Government of India and criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication (IPC 507), the judge pointed out.He said invoking IPC Section 507 “makes me laugh.” “Section 507 IPC can be invoked only if the person sending the communication had concealed his identity. The communication must be anonymous. In this case, the petitioner had posted the photographs along with the caption in his Facebook page. He has not concealed his identity. There is nothing anonymous about the act in question,” he said.In fact, none of the ingredients set out in the sections under which he was booked were present in the case, the court said.“The very registration of the impugned FIR is absurd and an abuse of legal process. It stands quashed,” the judge ruled.
22-12-2021||India||Gujarat woman set on fire over her puppy’s name||A woman was seriously injured after she was set on fire allegedly by one of her neighbours who was angry over the similarity between the name of her puppy and the nickname of the wife of one of the attackers in Gujarat, police said on Tuesday.The incident was reported from Palitana town in the Bhavnagar district on Monday afternoon. The victim, Neetaben Sarvaiya (35), suffered severe burn injuries. She is currently undergoing treatment at the government hospital in Bhavnagar, a Palitana town police station official said.

In her statement to the police, Sarvaiya said that Bharwad abused her but she tried to avoid him and others. As she entered the kitchen, three persons followed her. One of them poured kerosene from the container on Sarvaiya and set her on fire lighting a matchstick, the police said.Police registered an FIR against six persons under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for the attempt to murder, house trespassing, insult etc.Nobody is arrested so far, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-woman-set-on-fire-over-her-puppy-s-name-101640113773757.html
22-12-2021||India||4 bills sent to Parliament panels, winter session set to end today||The Narendra Modi government referred four out of six contentious bills to parliamentary panels, stalled one but passed another quickly in the politically-charged winter session that saw major protests, limited debates and a prolonged stand-off between the government and the Opposition.The winter session of Parliament that started on November 29, is set to end on Wednesday after completing the debate on the Appropriation Bill in the Upper House, said people aware of developments.The Lok Sabha is likely to end early even as it has two debates on price rise and climate change in its agenda, said the people quoted above, requesting anonymity. There was speculation that the session might be adjourned in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday itself after Speaker Om Birla tried to stop Opposition-sponsored disruptions and said he was appealing to lawmakers “on this last day” to go back to their seats.This will be the fifth time in a row when a Parliament session got adjourned sine die ahead of schedule. The first one was the 2020 budget session that was wrapped up 13 days ahead of schedule. The winter session of 2020 and this year’s budget as well as monsoon sessions also faced early closure due to Covid-19.This time, the session will end a day before its planned fixture amid fears of an aggressive spread of the new Omicron variant.The session that started with the repeal of three contentious farm laws found a cautious government sending as many as four key bills to House panels for reviews. On Tuesday, women and child development minister Smriti Irani announced in the Lok Sabha that the legislation to increasing the minimum age for a woman to marry at 21, at par with men, should be sent to the standing committee related to the ministry.While a section of the political spectrum was in favour of the legislation as it could control birth rates, Opposition parties were skeptical about the “political objective” of the bill and wanted a detailed review.Two days ago, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav proposed to send the bill to amend the biodiversity laws to a select panel. The mediation bill, which sets up an alternative dispute redressal system at pre-litigation stage of civil or commercial disputes, was also referred to a panel.Two Opposition leaders claimed that the government reached an agreement to refer the amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act to a committee for review -- this will allow stakeholders to give their opinion on the bill.The hotly contested electricity bill amendments that aim to de-license the power distribution sector and allow private sector players to compete with discoms, was halted as per the agreement with protesting farm unions.“This is not a change of heart of the Modi government. They are simply referring these contentious bills to panel to avoid the mistake they made by bulldozing the farm laws,” claimed Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh.The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which proposes linking electoral rolls to the Aadhaar database on a voluntary basis and make the language of India’s election law gender-neutral, was approved by the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. It was passed by the Lok Sabha a day ago.As on Tuesday, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha utilised 85% and 44% of their allotted time, respectively. Seven bills have been already cleared by both Houses in this session.
22-12-2021||India||Akali leader Majithia booked by Punjab Police in drugs case||Former Punjab minister and senior Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia (46) has been booked by the Punjab Police in a drugs case, prompting immediate accusations that the ruling Congress is trying to settle political scores ahead of assembly election early next year. The case against the three-time MLA was registered on Monday night under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on the basis of a report submitted by the special task force (STF) chief and additional director general of police Harpreet Singh Sidhu. Majithia, who could not be reached for comment, now faces imminent arrest. Majithia, brother of former Union minister and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, is an aggressive and prominent Akali leader. He was among the most powerful ministers in the Parkash Singh Badal government that ruled the state till 2017. The police action against him has raised the political temperature in the poll-bound state at a time when the Shiromani Akali Dal, which took a battering in the 2017 election, is looking to improve its performance. Former chief minister Badal said it was expected. “The Congress government changed three state police chiefs to book and arrest the Badals and Majithia. Any government which indulges in such vendetta has to face the consequences,” the five-time former chief minister said. Majithia, who has not been seen in public for the past few days, could not be contacted. Badal’s reference is also to investigations into his and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal’s role in the so-called sacrilege incident, when pages from the holy book of the Sikhs were found torn in 2015, resulting in violence and police action that left two people dead. The Congress has blamed the then government of the SAD for the deaths. According to the 49-page FIR registered at the State Crime Police Station in Mohali, Majithia has been booked for cognizable offenses under Sections 25 (Punishment for allowing premises, etc. to be used for commission of an offence), 27 (A) ( whoever is financing any activities indulging in production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, use or consumption, import and export or deal in any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of NDPS Act. These sections have the provision of imprisonment up to 10 years along with fine as decided by the court. “As per the findings of the STF report, prima facie there is sufficient evidence to record to further investigate the role of Majithia as regards the allegations made in application under scrutiny,” reads the FIR while mentioning the STF chief’s report prepared on the basis of analysis of investigation done by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the Bhola drug case. In 2018, the STF chief was given the task to analyze the former Akali minister’s role. His report, based on the statements of drug case accused Jagjit Singh Chahal and Maninder Singh Bittu Aulakh to the ED, has been made part of the FIR.In 2013, Arjuna Award-winning international wrestler and dismissed DSP of Punjab Police, Jagdish Bhola, was accused of amassing properties worth crores by smuggling drugs. In 2018, the STF had submitted its report in the Punjab and Haryana high court which later sought the Punjab DGP and then home secretary’s response. Since then, the report has been lying in a sealed cover in the court. The FIR also mentions Punjab’s advocate general DS Patwalia’s legal opinion which has strongly pushed for action on the STF chief’s report. “In my considered opinion which has been formed after having gone through the proceedings of the honourable court, there is no impediment/embargo for the STF or any state agency to act upon the report submitted in the court. In fact, the court has made it categorically clear that law enforcement agencies must act upon the said reports in accordance with the law.” Notably, Patwalia’s opinion is different from that of his predecessor who advised against acting on the report without the consent of the high court. The process to register the case was initiated after DGP SidharthChattopadhyaya wrote the director, Bureau of Investigation (BoI), on December 20, two days after he took charge. The FIR has been registered on the complaint of the station house officer (SHO), state crime police station, inspector Kailash Bahadur. A special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted to investigate the case. Home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa told news channels that special teams have been sent to certain locations to arrest the former minister. Earlier, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, a known detractor of the Badals and Majithia, tweeted: “After 5.5 years of fight against the corrupt system run by the Badal Family & Captain and delay of 4 years without action taken on ED & STF reports against Majithia. Finally now, after pushing for credible officers in positions of power and influence first step has been taken”. Sidhu has long alleged that former Congress chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who has now set up his own political party, was soft on the Badals. Sidhu also said the FIR was a slap on the face of all those powerful people who went slow on the issue. “Justice will not be served until main culprits behind drug mafia are given exemplary punishment; this is merely a first step. Will fight till punishment is given which acts as deterrent for generations.” The Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government’s efforts to book Majithia in the drug case ahead of the Punjab assembly elections has seen several twists and turns. Last Monday, a letter purportedly written by the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) chief AS Asthana surfaced on social media in which he said he was against booking Majithia on the basis of the 2018 special task force (STF) report lying in a sealed cover with the Punjab and Haryana high court. 
22-12-2021||India||Amit Shah chairs meeting on cybercrime awareness||Home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday chaired the consultative committee of the ministry to address the progress made in responding to cybercrime threats over the last seven years with a focus on the initiatives launched to spread awareness against the rising number of cases, the government said in a press statement.Ministers of state for home Nityanand Rai, Ajay Kumar Mishra and Nishith Pramanik and several senior officials of the home ministry, including the Union home secretary, also attended the meeting.“The Government of India is committed to deal with every aspect of this new menace and as public representatives, it is the responsibility of all of us to try to spread awareness about cybercrimes,” Shah told the attendees, according to the statement.The statement added that the work of setting up the infrastructure to deal with cybercrimes in the country had been completed up to the police post level. “The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) has now been implemented in all 16,347 police stations of the country. In 99 per cent of the police stations, 100 per cent FIRs are being registered directly in the CCTNS. This also includes the newly established police stations,” the statement said.Shah also highlighted that 40% of the work to make analytical tools against cybercrimes has been completed and efforts are being made to train police and lawyers to prevent cybercrimes. The press statement added that so far, more than 6 lakh complaints have been received on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) and 12,776 FIRs have been registered, while the National Cybercrime Threat Analysis Unit (NCTAU) has issued 142 cybercrime prevention advisories and has blocked 266 mobile apps.According to the statement, members gave suggestions for further strengthening the response mechanism to deal with cybercrimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-chairs-meeting-on-cybercrime-awareness-101640113235505.html
22-12-2021||India||‘Anti-national’ not defined in Statutes, Govt tells Parliament||The home ministry told Parliament on Tuesday that there is no legal definition for the term “anti-national”, though there is criminal legislation and various judicial pronouncements to deal with activities that are a threat to the country.The ministry said this in the Lok Sabha in response to a question by All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Asaduddin Owaisi seeking to know whether the government had defined the meaning of “anti-national” under any legislation or rules or other legal enactment enforced in the country.“The word ‘anti-national’ has not been defined in Statutes. However, there are criminal legislations and various judicial pronouncements to sternly deal with unlawful and subversive activities which are detrimental to the unity and integrity of the country,” minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai said in a written statement.He noted that it is relevant that the Constitution (Forty–Second Amendment) Act, 1976 in Article 31D, inserted during the Emergency, defined “anti-national activity” and this Article (31D) was subsequently omitted via the Constitution (Forty-third Amendment) Act, 1977.Owaisi also sought to know the number of people arrested for engaging in “anti national” activities during the last three years. Rai maintained that public order and police are state subjects and the data about the number of people arrested for such activities is not maintained centrally.To be sure, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in its latest report identified four “anti-national” elements: Northeast insurgents, Left-wing extremists, jihadi extremists, and other terrorists. According to the report, these four elements were responsible for 398 violent attacks that took place in 2020. Of theSE 398 violent attacks, 240 were triggered by Left-wing extremists, 76 by jihadi extremists, 47 by Northeast insurgents and 37 by other terrorists.Earlier this month, Parliament’s standing committee on communication and information technology, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, in its report on “ethical standards in media coverage” recommended that the government properly define terms such as “anti-national attitude” to remove any ambiguity in interpretation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antinational-not-defined-in-statutes-govt-tells-parliament-101640113233605.html
22-12-2021||India||Foreign secy to visit Myanmar; security situation on agenda||Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will visit Myanmar on Wednesday for talks with the military junta and political parties against the backdrop of growing concern in New Delhi over the fallout of the humanitarian and security situation in the neighbouring country.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday announced Shringla’s two-day working visit between December 22 and 23 – the first such trip from the Indian side since Myanmar’s military assumed power through a coup on February 1 – in a brief statement.During the visit, the statement said, Shringla will “hold discussions with the State Administration Council, political parties and members of civil society”. Issues related to “humanitarian support to Myanmar, security and India-Myanmar border concerns, and the political situation in Myanmar” will be discussed, it said.Shringla last visited Myanmar in October 2020, when he was accompanied by Indian Army chief General MM Naravane – the first time an Indian delegation to the neighbouring country included both officials. At the time, the two sides had discussed cooperation in areas ranging from security to connectivity.There has been mounting concern in India over the Myanmar junta’s crackdown on nationwide protests against the coup, which has left more than 1,300 people dead and some 11,000 arrested, and a spike in activities of armed resistance groups in areas bordering the strategic northeastern region.More than 15,000 people who fled Myanmar have taken shelter in the northeastern states of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, and there are fears that members of armed pro-democracy groups could sneak into India in growing numbers. Indian officials also fear that the instability in Myanmar’s border regions could boost the activities of anti-India militant groups, which have had bases in these areas for long.In keeping with India’s long-standing stance of striking a balance between Myanmar’s military and political parties, New Delhi has pushed for dialogue between all stakeholders in the neighbouring country to settle their differences. India has also backed democratic transition and restoration of the democratic process in Myanmar since the coup.On December 7, India expressed concern at the conviction of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi on charges of incitement and breaching coronavirus restrictions in what was widely described as a “sham trial”.India has also backed a central role for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in tackling the situation in Myanmar, though the 10-member bloc’s efforts to forge consensus on the issue have been affected by a move by the current chair, Cambodia, to directly engage with the military junta.In response to a call by Asean’s secretary general to provide humanitarian aid to Myanmar, India said it had delivered Covid-19-related relief to the Myanmar Red Cross Society on November 27. This support was in addition to the contribution of $1 million to the Covid-19 Asean Response Fund.
22-12-2021||India||Derek O’Brien throws rule book at Rajya Sabha chair, suspended||Trinamool Congress (TMC) floor leader Derek O’Brien was suspended from the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday for the remaining part of the winter session after he threw the house rule book at the Chair.The suspension, however, will be in place only for a few hours as the ongoing winter session of Parliament is set to conclude on Wednesday. Last month, the Upper House had suspended 12 Opposition lawmakers, including two lawmakers from the TMC, for unruly scenes in the house during the monsoon session. The suspension touched off a heated confrontation between the government and the Opposition.O’Brien hurled the rule book during a discussion on Election Laws (Amendment Bill) 2021 on Tuesday in the Rajya Sabha. As the house passed the bill, opposition parties demanded a division of votes on their motion for sending it to a select committee. However, the demand was rejected by a voice vote.O’Brien cited rules for a division of votes and when denied, he threw the rule book on the table where officials sit and walked out. He was joined by members of other opposition parties. “The rule book could have hit the chair or secretary general or other officials. Derek O’Brien thereby resorted to grave misconduct and gross violation of rules and norms and etiquette,” Rajya Sabha vice chairman Sasmit Patra said.“Being a floor leader, O’Brien, instead of setting high standards of conduct in the House, set a bad example and denigrated the dignity and stature of the House,” he added.“The last time I got suspended from RS was when the government was bulldozing farm laws. We all know what happened after that. Today, suspended while protesting against BJP making a mockery of parliament and bulldozing the Election Laws Bill 2021. Hope this bill too will be repealed soon,” he tweeted, referring to the November withdrawal of three controversial farm laws. Leader of the House Piyush Goyal and Union minister Bhupender Yadav demanded that the TMC leader apologise for his behavior. “The way he threw the rule book, he just did not insult the chair or secretary general or table office, but the entire nation,” Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/derek-o-brien-throws-rule-book-at-rajya-sabha-chair-suspended-101640112994961.html
22-12-2021||India||Bill to raise marriage age for women sent to Parliamentary panel after protests||The government on Tuesday tabled a draft legislation in the Lok Sabha that seeks to raise the legal age for marriage of women from 18 to 21 years, at par with men, amid protests from opposition parties on the manner in which the bill was introduced.The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was later referred by the Lower House to a parliamentary panel for further scrutiny by a voice vote. After examining the bill, the panel will present its recommendations before Parliament.“I would like to present that women’s equality in our country needs to be seen in (terms of) age of marriage,” women and child development minister Smriti Irani said while introducing the bill in Parliament.Existing laws do not adequately secure the constitutional mandate of gender equality in marriageable age among men and women, the draft legislation says. “Women are often put in a disadvantageous position in regard to higher education, vocational instruction, attainment of psychological maturity and skill-sets, etc. Entering into the employment sphere and being part of the workforce to make themselves self dependent ... is a critical area,” the bill adds. “These disadvantages perpetuate the dependence of women on men.”Increasing the marriageable age of women to 21 years would help in lowering maternal and infant mortality rates while improving nutrition and sex ratio at birth, the proposed legislation says. The central government will offer a grace period of two years from the date the legislation receives presidential assent.Some opposition members criticised the government for listing the bill in the supplementary business list, which was circulated minutes before the house reconvened at 2 pm on Tuesday. Others protested that the proposed law limits rights under several personal laws in violation of fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution.“I want to tell the government that they will make mistakes if they hurry. They didn’t consult any of the stakeholders,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury of the Congress party. “Why does the government keep doing this?”Stating that this was the second or third time that the government was aggressively bringing in a draft law without consulting the opposition, Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule alleged that it is not sticking to the agenda as discussed by the business advisory committee, a group of MPs across parties that meets under the chairmanship of the Speaker.The raising of marriageable age also came in for criticism. “This is against fundamental rights. An 18-year-old can vote but can’t get married?” said Asaduddin Owaisi of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. “What is your beti bachao programme about?” The central government has been running a beti bachao, beti padhao campaign to prevent female feticide and improve efficiency of welfare services for girls.“After so many years of Independence, men and women need equal rights in matrimony. This amendment gives equality to men and women in allowing both to marry at 21. Our research shows that 21 lakh (2.1 million) child marriages had to be stopped and many underage girls were found pregnant,” minister Irani said, countering the opposition’s objections. “You are stopping women from their right to equality.”The bill seeks to modify the definition of a child, staing that it means a male or female who has not completed 21 years of age. It also seeks to make consequential changes to various personal laws relating to the marriage of different communities to ensure a uniform marriage age.The draft legislation seeks to amend seven personal laws – the Indian Christian Marriage Act; the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act; the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act; the Special Marriage Act; the Hindu Marriage Act; Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act and the Foreign Marriage Act.It further seeks to prohibits child marriage, irrespective of any law, custom, usage or practice governing the parties. “(It) declares that provisions of the Act shall have an overriding effect over every other law, custom, usage or practice governing the parties. (It) makes consequential amendments to the other laws relating to marriage,” the bill stated.The Union Cabinet on December 15 cleared the proposal to raise the minimum age of marriage for women. The Cabinet’s approval came after a NITI Aayog committee headed by Jaya Jaitly, former president of the Samata Party, suggested raising the marriageable age in its December 2020 report. The report was prepared after conducting a survey among students of 16 universities, where 70% of the respondents agreed that the marriageable age for women should be increased to 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-raise-marriage-age-for-women-sent-to-parliamentary-panel-after-protests-101640112816677.html
22-12-2021||India||More engineers join police force in Karnataka, but officials say not much help in probe||Nearly 35% of sub-inspectors who joined the Karnataka police this year are engineering graduates, officials say. This should have been good news since Karnataka reported, according to the NCRB report, the highest number of cybercrimes in the country in 2019, but senior police officers in the state disagree. They say the quality of the engineering degrees has been a matter of concern and most importantly the department doesn’t require high technical knowledge either, since their basic job remains the maintenance of law and order. Vipul Kumar, the commandant of the Karnataka Police Academy, the premier police training institute in the state, said that out of the 181 civil police sub-inspectors and 15 sub-inspectors who passed out in February this year, 78 of them held a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree and three had master’s degree in engineering. “They have been given the basic training that is provided to every police officer for a period of nine months. This also includes some amount of technical training. Any role-specific training will be provided once they join the respective units,” Kumar said. Similarly for the Police Training College in Kalburgi, 28 of the 108 graduates were engineers. In 2015, only 10.4% (24 out of 229) graduate sub-inspectors were engineering graduates. In the last five years, there has been a 20 percentage point increase in these figures. Having technically sound police officers is an advantage, said MN Anuchet, deputy commissioner of police, central, who was part of the special investigation team that probed the murder of activist Gauri Lankesh. “A police officer with technical education will be able to understand the CDR (Call Details Records), data recovery and other technical aspects of the investigation quickly. There have been some officers who have shown some excellence in technical investigation, but the requirement for such knowledge is really limited,” said the officer who studied engineering. Praveen Sood, Director General and Inspector General of Karnataka police and alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, said engineering graduates joining the police department is not surprising. “Even in the constabulary, there are many engineers. Considering the number of engineering colleges there are in the state and how saturated the software and related industries in Bengaluru are, such a move was expected. A sub-inspector gets a starting salary of over ₹55,000, which is more than the average salary in an IT firm in the city,” he said. According to Sood, having a large number of graduates is not a big boon for the police department. “The constabulary or mid-level officers having technical knowledge is good, but the technical investigation is only part of the policing job, and those jobs already have dedicated units. Our primary responsibility still remains law and order maintenance which is a boots on the ground job. For this, police training is more important than technical knowledge,” said Sood. He, however, added that the new recruits are given training on cybercrime, which includes sessions on the dark web, which is a new area of concern for the police. Another senior officer, on the condition of anonymity, said that even the technical capability of joining the department is not the best either. “We have heard about the unemployability of engineering graduates in the country, so the increase in the engineers joining the department is one aspect of this problem. There are several engineering colleges in the state, where the quality of education is not great. This was even spoken about by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. So, police department getting more engineers doesn’t mean we have got the cream of engineers,” the officer said. “For us, the technical knowledge of the officer is of little importance. In a way, we are also following the training format followed by big multinationals like Infosys, where they recruit graduates from all streams of engineering and train them to be software engineers. Just like that, regardless of their background, we train them to be policemen,” he added.The officer also pointed out that the increase in higher educated mid-ranks and constabulary has been affecting the discipline within the department. “The educational hierarchy changing over the years has led to traditional discipline and respect for the chain of command getting affected,” he added.

They directed the CB-CID wing of the police to register a case and hold a thorough probe on the issue and file a report on December 23.The judges also directed the Tamil Nadu Bar Council to take appropriate disciplinary proceedings against the lawyer and accordingly, it prohibited Santhana Krishnan from practising, by adopting the resolution today.The video purportedly showed the lawyer in an intimate posture with a woman, while a judge was hearing a case through video-conferencing on Monday. It went viral on Tuesday. The bench on Tuesday said the “Court cannot afford to be a mute spectator and turn a Nelson’s eye when such brazen vulgarity is publicly displayed amidst Court proceedings.” It directed the the City Police Commissioner to take steps to block the circulation of the impugned video clipping in social media.“Superadded, we are of the considered view that it is high time that we revisit the procedure of conducting court proceedings in hybrid mode, especially in the light of the fact that advocates, in large numbers, have started appearing in person in our High Court as well in the district Courts.” “However, a decision in this regard has to be taken by the Hon’ble Acting Chief Justice before whom this matter may be placed,” the judges said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-suspends-lawyer-from-practising-for-improper-behaviour-101640112754131.html

Stalin sought the Central government’s intervention for the release of the fishermen.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was “concerned at the detention of Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu by Sri Lankan authorities” during December 18-20. “As per our information, 68 fishermen and 10 boats have been taken into custody,” he said.“Our high commission in Colombo has taken up the issue of early release of the Indian fishermen and boats with the government of Sri Lanka,” Bagchi added.Officials from India’s consulate in Jaffna have met the detained fishermen and are “providing all necessary support”. This includes providing clothes, toiletries, snacks, dry essentials and masks to the fishermen, and facilitating phone calls to their relatives.Indian officials are also arranging legal representation. “In the case of one fisherman who was indisposed, the Indian consular officer has visited him in hospital to check on his welfare,” Bagchi said.He said Jaishankar had received representations on the issue from various political parties and was also called on the matter by Stalin.The external affairs minister “has apprised them all of the current situation and underlined government of India’s efforts to secure early release” of the fishermen, Bagchi said.The Sri Lankan Navy detained the fishermen, most of them from Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, on charges of alleged poaching in the island nation’s waters. Fishermen’s associations in Tamil Nadu have contended the Union government has not done enough to address the issue of such detentions by Sri Lankan authorities.The associations also contended that the detained fishermen had not violated the maritime boundary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issue-of-68-fishermen-s-detention-taken-up-with-sri-lanka-mea-101640112752777.html
22-12-2021||India||Stalin urges Jaishankar to act for release of 60 fishermen held in Lanka||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday sought external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s immediate intervention to secure release of 68 fishermen and 75 boats from Sri Lankan Navy and Coast Guard’s custody.This is the second time that Stalin has reached out to Jaishankar in the past two days over the issue. “I had written to you about the unfortunate incidents involving the Sri Lankan Navy and our fishermen a couple of days ago,” Stalin’s letter on Tuesday read. “Yet again, there has been an incident of apprehension of fishermen, this time by Sri Lankan Coast Guard.”He said two boats with 13 fishermen aboard who set sail from Tamil Nadu’s Pudukkottai district have been apprehended by the Lankan coast guard. “The alarming frequency at which these incidents of apprehension and attacks are happening warrant urgent attention. Lives and livelihood of our fishermen must be protected when they fish in the traditional waters of Palk Bay,” the chief minister said.A copy of Stalin’s letter was handed over to Jaishankar in Delhi by DMK MPs led by parliamentary party leader TR Baalu. Tamil Nadu has requested the Indian government to use diplomatic channels with the Lankan government to put an end to what the state describes as “intimidatory tactics” of the island nation.Union minister of state for fisheries and former president of Tamil Nadu’s BJP unit L Murugan also urged Jaishankar for immediate release of these fishermen.Earlier on Sunday, Stalin had written to Jaishankar about two incidents of fishermen being detained by the Sri Lankan Navy in a span of 24 hours. In one episode on December 12, as many as 43 fishermen from Rameswaram in Ramanathapuram District who were fishing in the waters of Palk Bay, in six mechanized fishing boats were arrested and taken to Mylatti, a naval base in Sri Lanka. On December 19, 12 fishermen in two mechanized fishing boats from Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district were arrested and taken to Kalpatti Naval base in Lanka. “I am saddened to point out that the incidents of arrest and harassment of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy continue with alarming frequency despite several letters sent by the Government of Tamil Nadu,” Stalin had said on Sunday. “I would also like to point out that, in the year 2021 itself there were 19 incidents of apprehension and attack of Tamil Nadu fishermen. Though the fishermen were released, fishing boats, the source of livelihood are still detained by Sri Lankan authorities. Further, during the same period, there were two instances of attacks and five fishermen were killed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-urges-jaishankar-to-act-for-release-of-60-fishermen-held-in-lanka-101640112694730.html
22-12-2021||India||Telugu NRI comes up with new OTT platform||A US-based Telugu non-resident Indian has come up with a new digital Over-The-Top (OTT) platform to stream the choicest movies with audiences not requiring to subscribe to it and producers not requiring to sell their digital rights.Kollu Ranjit, a Vijayawada-born and Boston-based technocrat, in collaboration with his childhood friend Venkat Yeleti from Hyderabad, is getting ready to launch this new OTT platform – Hit.movie, which will enable the audiences to watch the movies of their choice at the click of the mouse.“It is a simple platform, whereon one can buy a ticket and watch a movie of his choice – on mobile or tablet or laptop or television or a home theatre. All that one has to have is an internet connection. One doesn’t have to subscribe to the platform, unlike in the case of other OTTs like Netflix, Amazon or Zee-5, wherein one has to take subscriptions monthly, half-yearly or annually,” Ranjit told HT.He said it is essentially a producer-friendly OTT platform, as they don’t have to sell their digital rights, as they have been doing with other OTTs, “They don’t need to give up their ownership rights and there are no middlemen,” he said.All that the producers have to do is upload the master files of their films on the site, after filling up the movie details, paying the listing fees, adding necessary Know Your Customer (KYC) documents. “After verifying the content, to ensure that it does not have any offensive content or porn, the film would be thrown open for streaming for the viewers within 72 hours,” he said.Stating that Hit.movie itself would take up the digital marketing and publicity for the films uploaded on the site, Ranjit said the movie could be streamed in over 150 countries. “It is for the producers to decide whether he wants the film to be streamed across the world, or a select few countries or only the native country,” he said.Ranjit said the ticket prices on this platform would be decided by the producers themselves. “The revenue is shared between the producers and the OTT on 70:30 basis. The producers will get real time audit log of all ticket sales with country-wise and date-wise breakup. We handle the tax payments and compliance on ticket sales in every country,” he said.The producers can also opt for pre-booking feature of their films on Hit.movie platform, so that they could get part of their investments in advance before the films hit the screens.Ranjit said the platform also promises content security, so that there would be no copyright issues. “We adopt a combination of active and futuristic measures like domain based restrictions, content security policies (CSP), signed URL’s, Digital Rights Management (DRM), country/location based restrictions, watermarking, File encryptions in transit and at rest,” he said.The platform also promises to ensure high quality streaming of films – up to 4K HDR cinematic quality. “Hit.Movie works on all major browsers and apps are available for Google TV (Android TV), Apple TV, and Firestick,” he claimed.Ranjit says his platform is ideally suitable for small budget films which do not find theatres for direct release. “Moreover, big OTT platforms do not buy these small budget films for screening but prefer mostly big films. At the same time, in overseas market, too, the Indian audiences do not find Indian movies of their choice on their local OTT platforms. We provide a platform for such producers and audiences,” he added.
22-12-2021||India||Four arrested for BJP leader’s murder in Kerala||A special investigation team (SIT) of Kerala police probing the double political murder in Alappuzha on Tuesday arrested four workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in connection with killing of BJP OBC Morcha state secretary Renjith Sreenivasan, said additional director general of police (ADGP) Vijay Sakhre.On Saturday, police had arrested two workers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in connection with the murder of SDPI secretary KS Shan. Two back to back political murders in relatively peaceful district shocked the state and also exposed alertness of law-enforcement agencies.Amid uneasy calm a peace meeting was held in the city on Tuesday and participants supported all initiatives to bring back peace in the district. “All parties agreed to work towards a lasting peace in the district and decided to isolate troublemakers. Police will be given a free hand to conduct an independent probe and arrest all accused at the earliest,” said culture minister Saji Cherian.In the meeting, BJP, RSS leaders insisted for a central agency probe while the SDPI said police were harassing its leaders “to please the Sangh Parivar”. The identities of arrested SDPI leaders were not revealed and two arrested RSS workers were identified as Rajendra Prasad and Ratheesh alias Kuttan.“We have identified 18 people who directly participated in two murders. Investigation is on right track and there will be more arrests in coming days. We will also arrest those who planned these murders. We will leave no stone unturned,” said the ADGP, who is overseeing the SIT probe.“We have seized the vehicles used in both murders. Both are well planned and executed killings. There were also plan to foment communal trouble in the district. We will also book those who raised provocative slogans during the last rites,” said another senior officer of the SIT, who wished not to be named.“Swift retaliation clearly shows both sides were well prepared. Only a foolproof investigation can isolate such forces,” he said, adding that detained include a municipal councilor of the SDPI. He said more than 250 houses of both were raided in last two days.The opposition Congress has asked the Left government to give a free hand to police. “Of late police stations turned to party cells. Party intervention demoralised the force,” opposition leader V D Satheesan said in Kannur, northen Kerala.The SDPI has asked police to book RSS leader Valsan Thillankeri in connection with the murder of Shan. “We reiterate that he was part of the conspiracy to kill our leader,” said SDPI leader Ashraf Moulavi.He also justified the provocative statement that “Shan had attained much-awaited martyrdom” and “it was not an occasion to wail, but an occasion for jubilation since he entered the heaven.”Many RSS-BJP leaders have sought action against the leader saying “he was talking the language of Islamic State fighters”. But Thillankeri, state-level leader of the RSS, said he was in the district to participate in a function announced much earlier.Meanwhile, widow of S Sanjith, a RSS worker who was stabbed to death in Palakkad on Nov 15 allegedly SDPI activists, moved the high court on Tuesday seeking a central agency probe. In her plea, S Arshika said she was not happy with the ongoing investigation and more than one month after her husband’s murder main culprits are still at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-arrested-for-bjp-leader-s-murder-in-kerala-101640112634771.html
22-12-2021||India||Election Law Amendment bill: Centre rejects concerns, says reforms need of hour||The government on Tuesday defended the Election Law Amendment bill, rejected various concerns surrounding it, and pointed to the demand, in the past, by various political parties, including the Congress, for linking Aadhaar to the Voter ID, even as opposition parties argued that the decision would disenfranchise electors, put critical data at risk of breach by non-state actors and lead to voter profiling.The bill proposes to voluntarily link Aadhaar data to electoral rolls and make the language of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (the RP Act, 1950) gender neutral, with the former provision being particularly controversial, with opposition leaders saying it will lead to “mass disenfranchisement”. It was passed by the Rajya Sabha a day after it cleared the Lok Sabha amidst loud protests and demands for a division, and will come into effect as law once it gets the President’s approval.Government officials asserted that the Election Laws (Amendment) bill 2021 incorporates various electoral reforms which have been discussed for a long time. “Registration in electoral roll is done based on an application by a person who is eligible to be registered as a voter. This bill has a provision whereby the new applicant may voluntarily provide Aadhaar number along with the application for the purpose of identity. No application will be rejected on the grounds that Aadhaar number has not been provided,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “Aadhaar linking with electoral roll will solve one of the major problems in electoral database management which is multiple enrolment of the same person at different places.”The official added that the decision will help clean up electoral rolls and facilitate elector registration in the location at which they are “ordinarily resident”.The official also referenced an Election Commission press release from 27 August, 2018, which said that “political parties urged the Commission to link Aadhaar numbers with electors’ detail for better electoral roll management”.A second official pointed to news reports , also from 2018, that said that representatives from the Congress’ unit in Madhya Pradesh met the chief election commissioner and sought a re-verification of the electoral roll in the state by linking Aadhaar numbers to Voter IDs. That demand came months before the state went to polls.While the government pointed to the phrasing of the bill, which said the linking would be voluntary, privacy activists said that exceptions to not providing an Aadhaar number would only be clear when the government framed the rules under the law.Potential for data breachLeader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury told HT that when the government couldn’t keep the account of the Prime Minister from being hacked, it couldn’t be expected to protect the data of all the citizens, a reference to the PM’s Twitter account being temporarily compromised, although it isn’t clear whether this was caused by hacking or a security lapse. “There are so many issues with the bill in its current format and we wanted it to be scrutinized further by a standing committee. India does not have a data protection law yet, how can one introduce such legislation? Even the Twitter account of the Prime Minister isn’t safe . How will the government ensure the privacy of such critical data?”He added that the linkage would open the ecosystem to a possibility of a data breach by any agency or non-state actors, a contention that Biju Janata Dal MP Amar Patnaik concurred with.“Linking of Aadhaar identification at time of new or revision of electoral rolls for the stated purpose of removing duplication is good legislative intent and is welcome.” Patnaik told HT. “But the method of achieving it by linking it to the entire Aadhaar ecosystem system is problematic. The government first needs to make the system more robust.”If citizens’ data is breached, Patnaik added, they would have no recourse to their right to privacy in the absence of a data privacy law.No stakeholder consultationSenior leaders from across opposition parties on Tuesday slammed the government for having held no stakeholder consultation before introducing the bill.Chowdhury said that the government held no consultations regarding the contentious provision of the bill.“Congress was not called by the government for any consultation,” he said.Patnaik too said that no consultation was held by the government before the draft was introduced before the House. He, however, added that in a consultation with the Election Commission, political parties had agreed to link Aadhaar numbers with voter ID cards.“Based on this consultation, when ECI moved ahead, SC struck it down saying that a law needed to be brought in Parliament,” he said. “The problem can be solved by linking Aadhaar numbers, why the need to link the entire ecosystem?”Voter profiling, disenfranchisementShiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi highlighted how the linkage could lead to profiling of voters. “In 26 minutes an election law was passed in the LS to connect Aadhar with Voter ID. Aadhar data has address,mobile numbers&financial details. Can help map political preferences through social media connected to phone number, disenfranchise those in opposition from voter roll,” she tweeted.AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi told HT that the decision would adversely impact both universal adult franchise and the secret ballot. “The secret ballot will suffer because of the government’s decision,” he said. “Empirical studies show that there 1.5 times more mistakes in Aadhaar than in the voter list. Moreover, if the government’s argument rests on ending bogus voting, then they casting doubts over the fairness of elections in the country. Let EC answer that.”Using the example of Telangana, Owaisi added that Aadhaar details were used to systematically eliminate voters from the electoral roll.According to Jagdeep Chokkar of the Association of Democratic Reforms, no consultations were done with the government on the issue. “If the government did stakeholder consultation, let them say with whom,” he said. “There are so many mistakes with the Aadhaar system itself, how will it correct mistakes of voter ids? The SC specifically as the EC to stop the linking forthwith because Aadhaar was meant for benefits and services. Even in the national capital, oftentimes, Aadhaar system doesn’t match my fingerprints, how will poor people use it to vote in rural areas? This decision rather creates the potential of depriving people in remote areas from voting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-law-amendment-bill-centre-rejects-concerns-says-reforms-need-of-the-hour-101640112576393.html
22-12-2021||India||Shah asks BJP to step up fight against KCR govt||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday asked the party leaders from Telangana to step up their fight against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government in the state led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and expose his “corrupt rule”, a BJP leader said. Shah held a meeting with senior Telangana BJP leaders including state BJP president Bandi Sanjay, union minister G Kishan Reddy and MPs Dharmapuri Arvind and Soyam Bapu Rao, besides BJP national vice president DK Aruna at his residence in New Delhi. “The union home minister enquired about prevailing political situation in Telangana. We brought to his notice how the TRS government is indulging in witch-hunt of political rivals and suppression of voices of dissent,” Sanjay told reporters. Shah took serious note of the burning of effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by TRS leaders and cadre as part of their protest against the Centre’s alleged indifferent attitude in purchasing paddy from the state. Sanjay said the Centre has repeatedly assured that it will purchase the entire raw rice produced during the Kharif season, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was misleading the people by making false allegations against the Centre. “When there is no such issue in other states, including the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, why is KCR creating so much fuss? He has promised that the state government would purchase every grain of paddy, but now he is passing the buck to the Centre,” he said. The state BJP chief said Shah had appreciated Eatala Rajender for winning the by-election to Huzurabad assembly seat with a big margin. “He also appreciated the first phase of Praja Sangrama Yatra taken out by the state BJP leaders to expose the corruption in the TRS government. He asked us to intensify our fight against the KCR government,” Sanjay said. Asking the state BJP leaders to start the second phase of the yatra soon, Shah said he will also participate in the yatra for two days. “The state should continue your fight against the TRS government and the central leadership will step in as and when it is required,” Sanjay quoted the union home minister as saying. The BJP central leadership has also asked the state BJP leaders to raise issues like unemployment, suicides of students, housing schemes and land sales. “Since the assembly election is less than two years away, the BJP will go all out against the TRS by launching a series of agitations on various issues,” Sanjay said. 
22-12-2021||India||Functional CCTVs can help check brutality in police stations, says Kerala HC||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday said brutality in police stations will stop once there are functional CCTV cameras there, especially in the cells.The observation by the high court came while hearing a man’s plea alleging that he was chained to a railing and then charged with the offence of obstructing an officer there from discharging his duties when he sought a receipt for a complaint made by him.“Are you (police) not ashamed to say that a man came inside the police station and used force to obstruct an officer from discharging his duties?” “Very unfortunate that a citizen who came to make a complaint was chained to the railing and then slapped with the offence under section 117 (e) of the Kerala Police Act for obstructing a police officer from discharging his duties,” Justice Devan Ramachandran said.This conduct is of the kind which occurred in 18th century dungeons and not of the 21st century, the court said.Despite the court coming down heavily on the police, “instances of police brutality are still being reported”, the judge said. The court further said that police stations should not be allowed to function in this manner and that “this brutality will stop only when we have functional CCTV cameras there”.It said it was going to exhort the legislature to do away with section 117 (e) of Kerala Police Act.The judge, during the hearing, said what was cause for concern was that the police was now waiting to “retrieve” CCTV footage of the incident which occurred in February this year to find out the truth behind the complainant’s claims, even though the video was not available in May as per a report submitted by a DySP in October.The DySP had said so in his report after carrying out an internal inquiry into the allegations made by the complainant against two police officers, one of them an SHO.In a memo filed by the police, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) south zone has said that the CCTV footage of the incident has to be retrieved and perused before deciding whether to drop the case lodged against the complainant under section 117 (e) of the Kerala Police Act.“This statement is of some concern as had the footage been available when the DySP made inquiries, as stated in an affidavit filed on October 22, 2021, the entire incident would have come out in the open.“The DySP had said that there was no CCTV footage. So I do not know how the IGP proposes to retrieve the footage or where the police are going to search for it,” the judge said.The court listed the matter for hearing in January next year and directed the police to file an affidavit on why the complainant be not compensated under the public law remedy for the trauma and harassment suffered by him.The judge said the police was keeping the case under section 117 (e) of Kerala Police Act pending against the complainant so that it can later bargain with him to drop his allegations against the two officers, especially the one who had chained and lodged the FIR against him.“I will not permit that,” the judge said and added that because the police and the state were defending errant officers in this manner, they are “not scared of the rule of law”.“If you want officers to be scared of the rule of law, then the state has to take strict action against them in such cases,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/functional-cctvs-can-help-check-brutality-in-police-stations-says-kerala-high-court-101640112573544.html
22-12-2021||India||Dec 21: What we know about Omicron so far||New Covid-19 cases in London have stopped accelerating. The number of people testing positive everyday is still a large number, but the exponential rate at which it was growing over the past fortnight appears to have now become a little linear. The trend, and whether it reflects the actual outbreak dynamics, could hold some lessons for regions preparing to face an Omicron wave. Outside of South Africa, the variant of concern has spread the furthest in the UK capital, possibly accounting for as much as 80% of new cases (if a particular testing artefact is considered) and has triggered a record surge in infections. That the growth rate has plateaued was proposed by Cambridge-based mathematician Alex Selby, who runs a Covid-19 tracker drawing from the several official data streams. “There are still a LOT of new cases per day but if there really is zero growth in new cases then that is highly encouraging. What could have caused it?” he wrote in a Twitter thread on Monday. “It can’t be herd immunity -- the effect is far too quick for that. The only genuine way to change growth in infections that quickly is changes in behaviour, i.e., people not meeting other people as much. The alternative would be that it’s all an artefact due to the testing system struggling to keep up, or fewer people choosing to get tested,” he added. The actual reasons are hard to ascertain. But looking at the two main possibilities offers some implications that other regions should pay attention to.Possibility 1: Testing has hit a ceilingThe record surge triggered by Omicron in the South African Gauteng province, where Omicron first spread widely, and the UK, created concerns that demand for tests will outstrip availability. Gauteng has seen a similar plateauing of new cases. Its growth rate has been in negative on some days, but that has been attributed by South Africa to holiday season travel, when tens of thousands of people leave the province that contains the country’s biggest city Johannesburg for their homes.Testing in London, and the UK in general, is unlike in most other regions in the world: the state-run National health Service (NHS) offers citizens free rapid test kits – known locally as lateral flow device, or LFD – to take Covid-19 tests at home. These tests are in addition to the PCR tests at laboratories, and LFD positive cases need to be confirmed by PCR tests.Of late, there have been anecdotal reports of LFD shortages and the waiting time for PCR results seem to have grown by a couple of days. “Positivity (positive results per test) is around 20% which is high, but it doesn’t sound overwhelming, and though there are certainly some delays in getting rapid tests, there doesn’t seem to be a major testing capacity issue yet,” Selby contended.Elsewhere in Europe, there are more clear signs Omicron can push testing capacity past its breaking point. Recent positivity rates in Denmark have been above 47% and the government is now looking at hospitalisations as the key metric, said Mads Albertsen, co-founder of DNASense, a testing lab in Denmark. Hospitalisations cannot be an early beacon for an incipient Omicron outbreak, which means countries, particularly densely populated ones like India, will need to strengthen testing capacity for a demand surge. Rapid tests, especially those that people can buy cheaply to take at home, could be key. It is crucial to remember Omicron is more transmissible than Delta, and the older variant had triggered a testing crisis in India at the peak of the March-April wave.Possibility 2: Behaviour change among peopleA second possibility could be that people are able to get tested but are choosing not to because they do not want to have to isolate during Christmas, Selby said. “It’s not easy to discount this completely, but I think it’s unlikely because overall numbers being tested are holding up well,” he said. But behaviour change could also genuinely be helping cut new transmission, or at least reduce it from the exponential rates that were prevailing. Google Mobility Report data showed significant drop in visits to workplaces, markets, recreation spots and other businesses, giving at least some indication that people have become more careful. In fact, a study by Yale University researchers, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April, found that people become more careful when cases begin spiking, and it is the surge of new wave that spurs on voluntary behaviour changes. The study found that government-mandated restrictions too led to behavioural change, but the substantial part, at least in the American context, was voluntary.This serves to redouble focus on Covid-safe behaviour. In India, some states are expected to enter an election cycle, with an announcement of poll dates expected early next month.

The number and size of glacial lakes are increasing, which causes further acceleration glacier mass loss, the researchers said.“The glaciers will continue to shrink at a rapid pace till mid-century, leading to higher run-off. After mid-century, the run-off will gradually decrease as glaciated area would have reduced,” said Anil Kulkarni, glaciologist at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change in the Indian Institute of Science. “This will impact seasonality of water availability and total water availability in the region.”The Hindu Kush Himalayas experienced a temperature rise of as much as 1.3 degree Celsius between 1951 to 2014, a comprehensive study on climate change over India by the earth sciences ministry had said in June 2020. Several areas of Hindi Kush Himalayas have experienced a declining trend in snowfall and retreat of glaciers in recent decades, it said.The mountainous region will experience warming in the range of 2.6-4.6 degrees by the end of this century, the official Indian study predicted, which will cause severe hydrological and agricultural impacts in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himalayan-glaciers-losing-ice-far-quicker-than-others-study-101640110472562.html
22-12-2021||India||Omicron: 'Activate war rooms, consider night lockdowns', Centre asks states||States and union territories need to step up scrutiny of Covid-19 infection trends and consider steps like night lockdowns and bans on large gatherings if more than 10% of all tests in a week turn positive or if the occupancy of hospital beds breaches 40% of capacity, the Union government said in an advisory on Tuesday.The advisory was sent by health secretary Rajesh Bhushan to all state chief secretaries and UT administrators in light of the threat posed by the Omicron variant, which has triggered a new wave of Covid-19 in South Africa, UK, Denmark and several other regions.Also read | As Covid cases rise, Delhi govt begins ramping up its home isolation infra“Based on current scientific evidence, the variant of concern (VOC), Omicron, is at least 3 times more transmissible than the Delta VOC. Besides, the Delta VOC is still present in different parts of the country. Hence, even greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision making and strict & prompt containment action is required at the local and district level,” said Bhushan’s letter, calling for “prompt and focused” decisions by all authorities.In all, India has detected 220 cases of Omicron as on Tuesday, with 51 of these confirmed in the last 24 hours, according to data shared by states with HT. Of the total, 77 people who had the new VOC have recovered.States need to constantly review district-level data of “population affected by Covid-19, geographical spread, hospital infrastructure and its utilisation, manpower” and notify containment zones and enforce perimeter control so that “infection is contained at the local level itself before it spreads to other parts of the state”, the letter said.The letter added that the two thresholds it mentions – 10% test positivity and 40% hospital bed occupancy – are normative templates, and local officials can take measures based on population characteristics even before these thresholds are breached.The health secretary then specified “strategic areas of intervention” under five categories.On containment, the official suggested “imposition of night curfew; strict regulation of large gatherings; curtailing numbers in marriages and funerals; restricting numbers in offices, industries, public transport etc”.“ln case of all new clusters of Covid positive cases, prompt notification of containment zones, buffer zones should be done; strict perimeter control of containment zone as per extant guidelines must be ensured; and all cluster samples must be sent to INSACOG labs for genome sequencing without delay,” the letter said.On testing and surveillance, Bhushan recommended there be “door-to-door case search, testing of all severe acute respiratory infections-influenza like illness and of vulnerable and co-morbid people; ensuring right proportion of RT- PCR tests in total tests being conducted daily; contact-tracing of all Covid-positive persons and their timely testing; utilizing access to ‘air suvidha’ portal by state surveillance officers and district surveillance officers to monitor international passengers who have arrived in their states and districts”.For clinical management, the secretary said bed capacity and ambulance availability must be increased, and “mechanism for seamless shifting of patients, availability and operational readiness of oxygen equipment, buffer stock of drugs” should be ensured by utilizing the Emergency Covid Response Package-II funds released by the Centre, and other available resources.The existing National Clinical Management Protocol remains unchanged for Omicron.The Centre also recommended “stringent enforcement” of home isolation as per guidelines. “This would include, among others: customised kit for persons undergoing home isolation, their regular monitoring through call centers as well as home visits etc. This will be a very critical activity in the days to come specially to ensure that persons under home isolation do not spread the virus to others in view of its higher transmissibility,” the letter said.The fourth focus area was identified as vaccination. “Ensure 100% coverage of left-out first- and second-dose eligible beneficiaries in an accelerated manner; with special focus to be given to those districts where the first- and second-dose coverage is less than the national average. The door-to-door vaccination campaign needs to be strengthened,” the letter added.The letter called for improved community engagement and Covid-appropriate behavior.“Ensure advance engagement and information so that there is no misinformation or panic; transparent communication on hospital and testing infrastructure availability etc. Participation of community backed by strict enforcement is necessary for ensuring Covid-appropriate behavior,” the letter said.Experts said that test, track, treat and vaccination strategy will be critical. “Apart from having a good strategy, it is an important thing is to implement it well. It is important for people to understand that adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour is an absolute must, especially wearing a mask and avoiding crowded places and maintaining physical distancing and hand hygiene irrespective of the variant in circulation,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.
22-12-2021||India||Behind the policy and politics around inflation||Retail inflation in India rose 4.91% in November compared with a year ago. The rise was far from unprecedented. And of the 119 months for which data is available under the latest series of Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation has been higher than 4.91% in 70 months.That statistical comfort notwithstanding, there are growing concerns around price rise in the country. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which acts as a proxy for producer prices, grew 14.23% in November, the highest since April 2012, the earliest period for which WPI data is available under the current series.There are valid reasons to be concerned about inflation, an HT analysis shows. What complicates matters even more is the fact that the current spike has come at a time when the economy has just recovered. Here are three charts that explain this in detail.The growing CPI-WPI divergence and the policy ghost of a former Chief Economic Advisor’s argumentThe past few months have seen a growing divergence between the retail and wholesale inflation. WPI growth was 9.32 percentage points higher in November. While there have been instances of divergence between CPI and WPI even in the past, the latest episode is a first when WPI has surged ahead of the CPI in such a big way. In absolute terms, the difference is similar to at least two episodes for data under the current series (mid-2015 and mid-2020), when CPI was far ahead of WPI. It has to be kept in mind, however, that CPI and WPI are very different in their composition.While the inflation-targeting framework mandates the central bank to maintain retail inflation within a band of two percentage points from 4%, the government’s former chief economic advisor once tried to subtly argue in favour of a easy monetary policy by citing WPI . In July 2015, Arvind Subramanian, then the chief economic advisor to the Narendra Modi government, wrote an article in the Indian Express at a time when WPI was lagging the CPI to argue that in exceptional times, there was some merit in questioning the prudence of relying solely on CPI for the conduct of monetary policy. “The monetary policy agreement between the ministry of finance and RBI, as well as the Urjit Patel report, has argued, not inappropriately, that the inflation target/objective should be based on CPI. In normal times, that would be completely unobjectionable. But are these normal times, when the price indicators are, frankly, pointing in dramatically different directions?” Subramanian wrote.If WPI lagging CPI then was good logic for a more accommodative monetary policy in the finance ministry, WPI surging significantly ahead of CPI now should suggest the reverse, namely, a reversal of the accommodative monetary policy stance in force for a long time.At least one member in this month’s monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, Jayanth R Varma, expressed reservation on the part of MPC’s resolution that asked for continuing with “the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.”Consumer perception about inflation has been risingEconomic sentiment need not always correspond with numbers. The latest evidence on consumer perception around price rise, as seen in RBI’s Consumer Confidence Surveys (CCS), and the trajectory of the CPI, are a case in point. While headline inflation has actually declined in the past one year, consumer perception of it has taken an opposite trajectory. Net share of respondents who believe inflation has increased is at close to the all-time high seen in late 2012, the earliest year for which data is available in the surveys.Pandemic’s shock to incomes might have added to inflation’s pain There is another piece of evidence in the CCS that tells us why the inflationary pain could be greater than in the past, even though the numbers are far from their all-time high levels. It is because the latest price rise has been accompanied by a sharp fall in general income levels in the economy. This is best seen from the net sentiment metric on income levels in the CCS. While this value was positive in late 2012, when net perception about rise in inflation was the highest, it is minus 40.6% in the latest CCS round in November. This, when read with the evidence of a large increase in economic inequality after the pandemic and reports of the economic recovery being driven by profits rather than wages, suggests that a large majority of the population might still be facing an unprecedented double whammy of rising prices and falling incomes.To be sure, CCS only measures urban sentiment, and we do not have a similar high-frequency indicator for rural areas. However, the fact that food inflation has been lagging non-food prices means that farm incomes are being subjected to squeeze in the terms of trade.It is this ominous combination of inflation driven by non-food prices along with a widespread fall in income that might have increased the pain of the current inflationary environment. It also underlines the importance of political and not just economic management of inflation for the government, especially as it enters a critical state election cycle early next year.
22-12-2021||India||Bill on electoral reforms cleared, Oppn protests||The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday approved a proposed law that allows election officials to ask registered voters for Aadhaar details, despite protests and a walkout by the opposition, which said the controversial draft legislation infringed on a voter’s right to privacy.The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which proposes linking electoral rolls to the Aadhaar database on a voluntary basis and makes the language of India’s election law gender-neutral, was passed by the upper house by a voice vote. It was cleared by the Lok Sabha on Monday and now awaits the President’s consent to pass into law.A motion by opposition parties to send the draft legislation to a parliamentary select committee was defeated by a voice vote.The bill was “very good,” law minister Kiren Rijiju said, adding that it will help end bogus voting and make the electoral process credible. “This bill is opposed only by those who take advantage of fake voting,” Rijiju said. “Otherwise, there is no basis for opposing this bill.”Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Janata Dal(United), YSR Congress Party, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Maanila Congress supported the bill, saying it will help in eliminating duplicate voters.But lawmakers from the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Left parties, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and Samajwadi Party opposed the bill, and said it might lead to mass disenfranchisement.“It’s a violation of the right to privacy granted by the Constitution. It will cause disenfranchisement of a large number of voters. It will exploit the voters and disadvantaged class of our society… This bill was brought without giving right of hearing,” said Amee Yagnik of the Congress.In his speech, Rijiju said the Election Commission of India and the government met many times and the election watchdog’s biggest concern was the lack of a system to check duplicate voters. “In our democracy, the electoral process should be clean, and that can happen only if the electoral rolls are clean,” he said.As Rijiju spoke, the opposition shouted slogans, waving placards and protesting in the well of the house. They demanded a division of votes as they had moved a motion to send the bill to a select committee. The motion was rejected by a voice vote.TMC member Derek O’Brien and other opposition leaders raised objections over not having sufficient time to scrutinise the bill. “Where is the time to present a resolution asking for a select committee? Forget about merits and demerits,” he said.O’Brien cited rules for a division of votes even as deputy chairman Harivansh urged members to go to their seats. “I am ready to give division but the members should first go to their seats. Being in the well of the house is unparliamentary. The chair cannot allow division in this situation,” the deputy chairperson said.When the division didn’t happen, O’Brien threw the rule book on the table where officials sit and walked out of the House. Other opposition leaders joined him.Leader of the house Piyush Goyal and labour minister Bhupendra Yadav criticised O’Brien. Goyal demanded the TMC leader apologise for his behaviour. “The way he threw the rule book, he just did not insult the chair or secretary general or table office, but the entire nation,” Goyal said.O’Brien was suspended for the rest of the winter session hours later. “After breaking every rule and precedent, BJP have the gall to give lecture about the rule book #Parliament. Irony just died,” he said.The bill proposes an amendment to Section 23 of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1950, allowing the linking of electoral roll data with the Aadhaar database to “curb the menace of multiple enrolment of the same person in different places”.In 2015, the poll watchdog undertook pilot projects to use Aadhaar data to remove duplication and fake entries from electoral rolls before the Supreme Court struck down the exercise. In the 2017 Puttaswamy judgment, the top court enumerated only certain areas – mostly subsidies – for which Aadhaar could be made mandatory. The government in 2019 amended the Aadhaar Act, allowing for the 12-digit identity number to be used for more utilities and services.Opposition parties and digital privacy groups say the draft legislation could have implications on privacy and potential voter profiling.The bill, however, says that no application for inclusion of name in the electoral roll “shall be denied and no entries in the electoral roll shall be deleted for inability of an individual to furnish or intimate Aadhaar number due to such sufficient cause as may be prescribed, provided that such individual may be allowed to furnish such other alternate documents as may be prescribed”.The bill further proposes a change to Clause (b) of section 14 of the RP Act 1950, allowing voters to register four times a year, instead of just once. The new dates for registration will be January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1.The draft legislation also calls for substitution of the word wife with the word spouse in the RP Act. It seeks to enable the requisition of premises for the purpose of being polling stations, counting, storage of ballot boxes, voting machines and poll related materials by proposing a change to Section 160 of the RP Act, 1951.
22-12-2021||India||People consciously not taking jabs pose greater risk, says Bombay high court||People taking a conscious decision to not vaccinate against Covid-19 are not entitled to the same treatment given to inoculated persons, the Bombay high court said on Tuesday while upholding the Mumbai Port Trust’s direction that unvaccinated employees have to produce negative test results every 10 days at their own cost. It was “a reasonable restriction on fundamental rights of the Petitioners to carry out their occupation or trade,” the court said. “We are convinced that persons taking a conscious decision not to vaccinate themselves are effectively deciding to place themselves at a greater risk of contracting and/or transmitting the disease than a vaccinated person,” a division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja said. “While the Petitioners’ decision not to take the vaccination is well respected, that does not mean that they are ipso facto entitled to the same treatment as that given to vaccinated persons by the MPT,” the bench said, dismissing a petition filed by seven employees of the port authority. On June 15, the MPT had directed that with effect from the following day, employees who have not been vaccinated will be required to pay for their treatment in case they contracted Covid-19, and will not be permitted to attend office unless they produced a negative test report at their own cost every 10 days. Some employees moved court on August 5 against the circular, saying it discriminated between vaccinated and unvaccinated employees and violated their fundamental rights. No meaningful distinction could be made between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, and both stood on the same footing in terms of their likelihood to transmit Covid-19, lawyer Aditi Saxena argued for the petitioners. Vaccination was a voluntary act, the disgruntled employees argued. They produced a right to information response by the health ministry to support their contention. Denying the premise that both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons are equally susceptible to transmitting the virus, the court said that the charge was of a “general” nature and “did not contain reference to any scientific material”. The bench relied on material submitted by Shiraj Rustomjee, a friend of the court, which included information provided by medical experts and the World Health Organization, which pointed out that vaccinated persons are far less likely to contract or transmit Covid-19. Even in the case of such breakthrough infections, the severity of the infection and the risk of transmission of the disease are significantly reduced in vaccinated persons and, hence, “it is erroneous to hold that because breakthrough infections are possible in vaccinated persons, they stand on the same footing as unvaccinated persons,” the court held. “The Government of Maharashtra has, in its various Break the Chain orders which have been annexed by the MPT, imposed the same requirement for unvaccinated individuals to carry a negative RT-PCR result certificate with a 15-day validity period,” the judges observed. The port trust had provided free vaccination to its employees and the vast majority had got themselves inoculated, lawyer Rahul Jain said, appearing for the MPT. It is reasonable for a large organization such as the MPT to require a higher degree of checking and monitoring of the Covid-19 status of unvaccinated persons, the court said. “We see no reason in law as to why MPT should be compelled to bear the cost of such treatment when it is offering the alternative of vaccination free of charge and is also willing to bear the cost of treating breakthrough infections in such cases free of charge,” the bench said. “In fact, it is the Petitioners’ demands that now appear to us to be unreasonable, and not the other way around.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-consciously-not-taking-jabs-pose-greater-risk-says-bombay-high-court-101640109453180.html
22-12-2021||India||Jaipur’s royal family settles property dispute||A protracted legal battle between members of the erstwhile Jaipur royal family over ownership of luxury heritage hotels Jai Mahal and Rambagh Palace has been resolved by a mediator appointed by the Supreme Court. Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari, grandchildren of former Jaipur queen Gayatri Devi, have got Jai Mahal palace, and their step-uncles Jai Singh and Vijit Singh have got the Rambagh Palace under an amicable settlement mediated by retired Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph, who submitted a report on the matter.The settlement was confirmed by advocate Abhishek Kumar Rao, who has been representing Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari in the court cases. A bench comprising justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrisikesh Roy noted the submissions of the parties that retired justice Joseph had submitted after successfully concluding the mediation. The memorandum of settlement signed by the parties was sent to the court, which has taken it on record on December 15. “In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, learned counsels on both sides made a request to dispose of these appeals in terms of settlement. In view of the request made, these appeals are disposed of with a direction that all the parties concerned shall abide by the terms of the settlement. The order impugned stands modified, in terms of the Memorandum of Settlement dated 15.12.2021,” the court said. These civil appeals are filed aggrieved by the common order dated 12.03.2020 in Company Appeal (AT) Nos 329 of 2018, 270 of 2018 and 271 of 2018 passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal at New Delhi.The subject matter of these appeals relate to disputes regarding ownership and shareholding between the appellant group and the respondent group in Jai Mahal Hotels Pvt Ltd and Rambagh Palace Hotel (P) Limited.Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari had filed two separate appeals last year against the 2018 orders of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal with respect to the ownership and shareholding of in Jai Mahal and Rambagh Palace. Jai Singh and Vijit Singh, their step-uncles, were the respondents.  Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari will now get Jai Mahal from their step-uncles and their heirs, who had taken it over in 1997.“Erstwhile members of royal family, Jai Singh and Vijit Singh, agreed to handover the Jai Mahal palace to our clients under an amicable settlement arrived between them all on December 15,” Rao said. In turn, Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari will give up some of their rights in other property, the lawyer said.Members of the erstwhile royal family refused to comment on the settlement, saying it was an internal family matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipurs-royal-family-settles-property-dispute-101640109213140.html
22-12-2021||India||Gupkar alliance rejects delimitation panel’s recommendations, plans stir||A six-party alliance pushing for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status rejected the draft recommendations of the delimitation commission on Tuesday and said it will hold a protest in Srinagar on January 1 against the “unacceptable and divisive” proposals.At a meeting on Monday, the three-member delimitation commission proposed adding six assembly seats in the Jammu region and one in Kashmir. The panel, which has lawmakers from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the National Conference (NC) as associate members, also proposed reserving nine seats for scheduled tribes and seven for scheduled castes, a first in the Union Territory.If the proposal is cleared, the total number of poll constituencies will rise from 83 to 90, with 43 in the Jammu region and 47 in Kashmir. In the current state House, Jammu has 37 members and Kashmir has 46.The Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), which was set up on October 20, 2020 to fight for the restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir under article 370,met on Tuesday at the Jammu residence of NC president Farooq Abdullah to discuss the draft proposal. The meeting was chaired by Abdullah and attended by the Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, Awami National Conference vice president, Muzuffar Shah and other leaders.“Alliance leadership wants peace and not the confrontation. For the legitimate rights of people, we will be raising our voice peacefully. On January 1, we will be holding peaceful protest in Srinagar against the proposal of delimitation commission, which is unacceptable to all of us and all the people and all the communities,” said Tarigami.“The proposals of delimitation commission...are divisive and is not in the interests of people of Jammu and Kashmir,,” he added.The delimitation commission, which aims to carve out new poll constituencies in the region, was set up in March 2020 with five parliament members from the UT as associate members. The delimitation process is important because it is the first step towards holding fresh elections in the region that has been under central rule for three years.Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status and statehood on August 5, 2019, when the central government moved to void Article 370 of the Constitution. At a landmark all-party meeting in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told leaders of political parties that statehood will be restored after fresh elections are held in the region, on the basis of the delimitation process.But parties from the region, which remains bitterly opposed to the scrapping of its special status, want statehood to be restored before delimitation and elections – a demand rejected by the Centre.Tarigami said that delimitation in the region should have happened along with the rest of the country but the BJP wanted to divide people on religion and regional lines. “And the fresh draft proposal if accepted, will create divisions. This is a step to divide people on regional and community lines. BJP’s plan is to divide people not only in country but also in J&K,” he said.He said that If these proposals are accepted, the crisis of J&K will deepen further . “This decision will break the heart of the people. We request the government, delimitation commission, Parliament and leaders of political parties that they should hear our aspirations,” he added.Tarigami said that alliance wanted peace and not confrontation. “For the legitimate rights of the people, we will raise our voice peacefully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-alliance-rejects-delimitation-panel-s-recommendations-plans-stir-101640108794677.html
22-12-2021||India||DGCA makes breathalyser checks more stringent||Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday asked airlines to have an MBBS doctor, a trained paramedic or an emergency medical technician to conduct pre-flight breathalyser checks on pilots, making the process more stringent to crack down on flying under the influence.Another test will be conducted upon arrival at the destination, DGCA said. If tested positive for the first time, a pilot will be given the option of getting retested using the same equipment or an alternative one. In 2019, the aviation regulator asked Air India to terminate the services of one of its pilots who failed the test. The pilot, flying as an additional crew member, had failed the test once earlier as well.‘It is a well-known fact that even when the blood alcohol levels are zero in the body, there could be some effect of hangover, which is mainly due to congeners... Even 12 hours after a bout of drink, when blood alcohol level remains zero, there is a decrement in task performance. Alcohol present in the body even in small quantities jeopardises flight safety on several counts and is likely to adversely affect an aviator well into the hangover period,” the revised air safety civil aviation requirement (CAR) document said.Making the CAR more robust, e DGCA said that crew members of all flights (including non-scheduled operators) originating from India will be subjected to a pre-flight breathalyser examination at the first departure airport. Where adequate infrastructure does not exist, the flight and cabin crew will have to undergo a post-flight examination.“If the result is positive, repeat testing will be carried out after an interval of maximum 20-25 minutes. As per the previous CAR, the time between the first and second test was around 15 minutes. Once a crew member is detected positive, medical personnel on duty will provide the pro forma and the crew personnel shall give a declaration in respect of the use of equipment (same or alternative) for the conduct of a second test,” said a DGCA official, adding that under the previous CAR, a request for change of equipment was to be made by the crew member in writing.During this time, DGCA said the crew member will be allowed to wash his face and rinse his mouth, if required. “Before the second test is carried out, a control test must be taken on the equipment being used, to verify the serviceability and correctness of the equipment. Both the readings so obtained will be recorded and a printout taken,” the revised CAR said.The regulator stressed the importance of intensifying the educational programme for crew members about the inherent dangers of flying after consumption of alcohol.The revised rules also clarified that post-flight tests for all scheduled flights originating from destinations outside the country will be carried out at the first port of landing in India.“In case of diversion of flights, due to unforeseen circumstances, to an airport or in Aircraft on Ground (AOG) condition, where facility for pre-flight examination is not available, the flight crew and cabin crew shall undergo post-flight examination at first landing,” the revised rules said.All positive/missed results shall be promptly reported but not later than 24 hours of occurrence to the concerned regional air safety offices of the DGCA and the director of air safety. Test recordings shall be preserved for six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-makes-breathalyser-checks-more-stringent-101640108793309.html

The Congress leader also said that her ‘Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon’ (I’m a girl and can fight) campaign had forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold an interaction with women beneficiaries and self-help groups in Prayagraj. “UP women can see. You just stretched yourself and Prime Minister @narendramodi has succumbed before you. This is just the beginning. There is going to be a storm of women power. Unity of women will bring about a revolution,” she tweeted in Hindi. The Congress has announced that it will give 40 percent of tickets to women candidates in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/instagram-accounts-of-my-children-hacked-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-101640108734697.html
22-12-2021||India||TMC sweeps Kolkata civic polls with 72% vote share||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) won the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls with comfortable margins in 134 wards, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with three seats and the Congress and the Left won from two civic wards each in results declared on Tuesday. Independent candidates secured the remaining three of the 144 wards in the Bengal capital. The BJP, which was in control of five wards in the last civic board, lost control over two. The TMC’s tally was set to touch 137 as the three independent candidates expressed eagerness to join the ruling party. These seats were reserved for women and the winners are relatives of local TMC leaders. Independent candidate Rubina Naaz, who won from ward No. 135 and is the wife of a local TMC leader, declared that she will join the ruling party immediately.Two other winners, Purbasha Naskar and Ayesha Kaniz, said they were willing to join the TMC as well. “We can work more for the people if we are with the ruling party,” said Kaniz, who is the wife of dissident leader Irfan Ali Taaj. “Rubina came to me and expressed her wish. We have accepted her appeal. I have not talked to the other two independent winners till now,” said former Kolkata mayor and transport minister Firhad Hakim, who won from ward No. 82 for the fourth time in a row. Amid buzz that Hakim may become the mayor once again, chief minister Mamata Banerjee left everyone guessing.“Our party will meet in Kolkata at 2pm on December 23 and select the mayor,” said Banerjee before leaving for Guwahati where she offered prayers at the famous Kamakshya temple. Her party leaders described the trip as a private one. Banerjee will return to Kolkata by the evening flight, they said. “The BJP and Left have been wiped out by the people of Kolkata. The Congress has been sandwiched between these two losers. This reflects on national politics as well. I firmly believe that Bengal and Kolkata will show the path to the people of India,” said Banerjee who is eyeing electoral inroads in Goa and Uttar Pradesh where assembly polls will be held in a few months. The TMC’s vote share stood at 72%. The BJP had a vote share of around 8.9% while the Left secured 11.7% and the Congress secured 4.13% respectively.Left candidates came second on 65 seats. The Congress secured the second position on 16 seats while the BJP became the first runner-up on 48 seats.

Bihar chief minister Nitish Yadav recently led a delegation to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi to discuss the matter. It is believed that a caste census would lead to an increase in the reservation quota of other backward classes in government jobs and educational institutions. The Samajwadi Party chief also alleged that the Income Tax department, Enforcement Directorate (ED) that investigates financial crimes and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) were now extensions of the Bhartiya Janata Party and they become active in states headed for assembly elections. “Once we got into alliance with chacha ki party (Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party headed by his uncle Shivpal Yadav), there began a series of raids in the state” he said, referring to raids by taxmen in the premises of people considered close to him. “More such visits would be made by the BJP prakoshth (organizational cells) in Delhi. The CBI, ED and Income Tax department are behaving more like organizational cells of the BJP,” Yadav said. “They got active in Maharashtra, West Bengal and are now active in UP. However, they will not be able to avert the historic defeat of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, as in other states.”Yadav said, contrary to the claims of the BJP government, law and order in the state is at its worst. “Law and order is at its worst and crimes against women are rising, but the UP government only changed the number of Dial 100 service to 112,” He said. “The six Jan Vishwas Yatras of the BJP are proving a flop and, in contrast, lakhs are coming on their own to be part of the Samajwadi Party’s Vijay Yatra.” 
22-12-2021||India||Word ‘lynching’ was unheard of before 2014, says Rahul, stirs row||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over growing incidents of mob killings across the country, saying the word “lynching” was unheard of before 2014, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power.Hitting back, the BJP raked up the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and called former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi the “father of mob lynching”. Taking a swipe at the Prime Minister, Gandhi tweeted: “Before 2014, the word ‘lynching’ was practically unheard of. #ThankYouModiJi.” Gandhi’s remarks came days after two people were lynched over alleged attempts of sacrilege in Congress-ruled Punjab. While one man was lynched at the Golden Temple in Amritsar on December 18, another was beaten to death inside a gurudwara in Kapurthala district. Taking a jibe at Gandhi over his comment, BJP spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said: “The dynast should remember 1984 and the anti-Sikh riots — that’s what set precedent to the act of lynching.” Vadakkan, who was a key aide of Congress president Sonia Gandhi till he joined the BJP in 2019, also attacked his former party over the recent lynchings in Punjab. “Why is Congress dragging BJP into this state (Punjab) matter? This is their election game plan,” he said. The state is slated to go to polls next year. Former Union minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar also hit out at Gandhi, saying: “Get facts right. 2000+ Sikhs were lynched in 1984 & Congress justified it. Selective amnesia will not work. We condemn all lynching.” Speaking to reporters, Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey noted that hundreds of Sikhs were killed in the 1984 riots, for which some Congress leaders were blamed, and also referred to the 1989 Bhagalpur riots to ask if these were not lynchings. “Mobs killed Sikhs by burning tyres around their necks. Wasn’t it lynching?” he asked.More than 2,700 Sikhs were killed in the national capital alone during the 1984 riots which erupted after former prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards. A Supreme Court recommendation in 2018 to enact a special law to penalise lynching is still pending consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/word-lynching-was-unheard-of-before-2014-says-rahul-stirs-row-101640108253079.html
22-12-2021||India||Jharkhand assembly passes bill against mob lynching||The Jharkhand assembly on Tuesday cleared the Prevention of Mob Violence and Mob Lynching Bill, 2021 that provides for jail terms ranging from three years to life imprisonment and fines of up to ₹25 lakh against those involved in mob lynching leading to “injury or death” of an individual.The bill, opposed by the opposition BJP in its present form with a demand to send it to a select committee, provides for punishment for “conspiracy or abetment or attempt to lynch”; “obstructing legal process”; “dissemination of offensive material” and “enforcing a hostile environment”, besides compensation for victims under a state government scheme.With the passage of the bill, Jharkhand became the third state after West Bengal and Rajasthan to have put in place such a law. A law to this effect was an electoral promise of all three constituents of the incumbent JMM-Congress-RJD combine in the 2019 assembly polls. Mob lynching was a major poll issue in the wake of a series of such incidents in Jharkhand in the past few years.An incident on June 17, 2019 made national headlines, in which 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari was tied to a pole and beaten to death by a mob at Dhatkidih village in Seraikela Kharsawan district on suspicion of theft. Ansari was purportedly seen in a video being forced to chant “Jai Shri Ram” and “Jai Hanuman” by the attackers. On June 22, he succumbed to his injuries in judicial custody.“The law has been made to ensure people live in peace, harmony and brotherhood. It will now ensure people live and work in the state without any sense of fear,” chief minister Hemant Soren told reporters after the bill was passed in the assembly.According to the new law, in any incident where the act leads to the victim suffering hurt, the convicts shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and with a fine which shall not be less than ₹1 lakh and may extend up to ₹3 lakh.“...where the act leads to the victim suffering grievous hurt, it shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and with fine which shall not be less than three lakh rupees and may extend up to five lakh rupees...where the act leads to the death of the victim, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for life and with fine which shall not be less than ₹25 lakh, and the movable and immovable properties shall be attached,” the bill said.Besides punishment for being involved in lynching, the bill aims to put in place a top-to-bottom mechanism, with an inspector general-rank police officer to be appointed as a nodal officer, with clearly laid-out powers and duties “to prevent acts of lynching” and “exercise authority against mobs”.In total, 12 amendments were moved by legislators, with the highest nine coming from BJP members, one each from the Ajsu Party, CPI(ML) and an independent legislator. However, all of these including two from the BJP to send the bill to a select committee were turned down during the discussion on the bill by voice vote. The BJP legislators walked out of the House in protest.Party legislator Amit Mandal, who moved five amendments, said the government seemed to have brought the bill in haste.“The officials who have framed the draft of the bill seemed to have invented a new definition of mob. They describe a mob as a group of two or more persons. They should check the definition of mob in Oxford dictionary. Also, immense arbitrary power is being given to the police and district magistrate that could be misused even for trivial issues, even against political opponents,” Mandal said in the House.Another BJP legislator Anant Ojha said the law had been made with an eye of appeasement of a particular community.“The way the bill was brought and passed in the House, it is clear that it has been done as per this government’s appeasement policy. The law has been brought to divert attention from government failures,” said Ojha. Parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam defended the provisions, saying the bill was brought in the light of Supreme Court directions on the issue.

22-12-2021||India||Visa applications from India more than doubled in Nov when compared to Jan||Just before the news of the new Covid-19 variant- Omicron spread, India saw more than double visa applications in November as compared to January this year. According to visa major VFS, the opening of international borders with the easing of travel restrictions, rise in vaccination coverage and pent-up demand for travel, led to a spike in visa applications from India.VFS Global said that visa applications received in India until November 21, 2021, more than doubled vis-à-vis volumes witnessed in January 2021. “Visa applications came for many destinations opening their borders for international travellers such as Canada, Europe, UK, and the USA among others,” its spokesperson said. Travel portal, EaseMyTrip (EMT) said that there is a strong travel sentiment even right now. “We are seeing that people who do not want to travel right now due to Omicron scare, are just postponing their travel instead of completely cancelling their plans. According to EMT, Dubai, Maldives, Abu Dhabi are the most preferred international destinations witnessing the highest advance bookings with Dubai being the top booked destination by Indians and the Middle east being majorly driven by leisure and business travel. “The steady rise in visa applications demonstrates strong intent to travel. Since the restart period happened to overlap with the peak students’ season in India, students comprised a large section of international travellers from India, followed by business travellers and tourists visiting families,” said Pranav Sinha, head, South Asia, VFS Global. As per VFS Global, a significant recovery in travellers’ sentiments as a three-fold rise in visa applications was seen since June 2021. According to Prahlad Krishnamurti, chief business officer, Cleartrip, international demand slightly decreased in December as compared to last month. The pandemic remains volatile in the light of new variants, but according to industry experts, it is too early to see an impact on travel behaviour. Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer (CEO) of CAPA India said, “It is too early to comment but short term impact is visible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visa-applications-from-india-more-than-doubled-in-november-when-compared-to-january-101640102673500.html

22-12-2021||India||India blocks 20 YouTube channels linked to ‘Pak disinformation campaign’||The ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B) on Tuesday said it has ordered the blocking of two Kashmir-related websites and 20 YouTube channels as they “belong to a coordinated disinformation network operating from Pakistan”.The two separate orders for the channels and website were the first to be issued by the ministry under the new information technology rules notified on February 25 this year.According to the ministry, they were issued in a “coordinated effort with intelligence agencies”.“The channels were used to post divisive content in a coordinated manner on topics like Kashmir, Indian Army, minority communities in India, Ram Mandir, (the late CDS) General Bipin Rawat, etc,” the ministry said in a statement.Among the 20 YouTube channels ordered to be blocked are those launched by The Naya Pakistan Group (NPG), operating from Pakistan, which has a network of YouTube channels and a combined subscriber base of at least 3.5 million. Their videos have had over 550 million views, the ministry said.“Some of the YouTube channels of the NPG were being operated by anchors of Pakistani news channels,” it added.The 20 channels include The Punch Line, International Web News, Khalsa TV, The Naked Truth, News 24, 48 news, Fictional Historical Facts, Punjab Viral, Naya Pakistan Global and Cover Story.Besides the channels, the Kashmir Global and Kashmir Watch websites were ordered to be blocked in their entirety.Speaking to reporters, I&B minister Anurag Thakur said an inquiry was conducted to assess the attempts to spread anti-India content from across the border. “These channels and web portals were in violation of the law,” he said. “Strict action has been taken against websites which seek to promote Pakistan’s agenda and prevent them from working against India.”The statement issued by the ministry also shared screenshots and instances of fake news that were being put out by these YouTube channels.According to the government, The Punch Line claimed in one report that 20 Indian Army generals were killed at a training facility in Kashmir by “Kashmir mujaheddin”. Another report in the same channel claimed Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has decided to build a mosque in place of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. A third example listed a report in Naya Pakistan Global channel that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has sent his army to Ayodhya.The two orders to block the YouTube channels and websites were issued by information and broadcasting secretary Apurva Chandra, invoking his emergency powers under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules notified earlier this year.“And whereas, after having gone through the information published by the aforementioned websites, I am satisfied that information posted on the above-mentioned websites is detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, and security of the state, and therefore falls within the ambit of section 69(A) of the IT Act,” Chandra said in his interim order to the department of telecom.This is the first time that the I&B ministry has invoked its powers under the new IT rules.Earlier, orders to block websites could only be issued by the ministry of electronics and information technology or the department of telecom under the IT Act and the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951.The new rules, which introduced an ethics code for digital media, required the appointment of grievance redressal officers, the creation of a three-tier mechanism for grievance redressal with an inter-ministerial committee at its apex , and defined the process to be followed by the I&B ministry on dealing with content that violates the code.The interim order by Chandra will be placed in front of the inter-departmental committee for review. The inter-departmental committee forms the apex of the three-tier redressal mechanism, which includes a self-regulatory mechanism followed by regulation by industry bodies.The committee, in a first, also has members from the industry body — one member each from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry and Confederation of Indian Industry, one member from the Bar Council of India and a member from the Press Council of India.Besides these, the committee also has members from ministries, including those from the ministries of women and child development, law and justice, home affairs, electronics and information technology, external affairs and defence.The latest IT rules have been challenged in court by several digital news media outfits, including LiveLaw and TheWire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/block-2-kashmir-websites-20-youtube-channels-orders-i-b-ministry-under-new-it-rules-101640077171039.html
