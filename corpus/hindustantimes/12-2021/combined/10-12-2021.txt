She also congratulated students for their achievements. Speaking on the occasion governor said that the fact that students from abroad, who won medals, showed the popularity of Bhatkhande Sangeet Sansthan in other countries. “The guru is supreme, because only the guru gives you knowledge. He makes you understand what is good or bad, and he gives you self-confidence. Guru alone guides you on the right path. Education has to be taken forward if the country is to. Whatever survey about education is conducted by the state government and the central government, it should be discussed in the university. At present, more than 50% of the girls are anaemic, which must change for betterment of the country,” Anandiben said. Giving an example from Gujarat, she said, “In 2001, only 49% girls were educated, we started the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign in Gujarat. Within 10 years, this figure reached above 99%. At the same time, the ratio of women against men was 904 women against 1000 men. Today, there are 1017 women against 1000 men.” She said, only education shapes up the character of the society, it brings prosperity in the country. In order to popularise music, the university should organise competitions in at least 10 colleges of the city every year and winners should be awarded on January 26 (Republic Day), she added. The governor also directed the university officials to prepare online courses for taking the Indian music to a new height. Padma Bhushan Sajan Mishra, the chief guest, said, “Music is the only science left in which blessings are taken by touching the feet of one’s guru. However, this tradition is slowly disappearing now.” Meanwhile, a minute’s silence was also observed in the memory of CDS General Bipin Rawat who died two days ago in a helicopter crash. A souvenir of Bhatkhande was released and the university students presented captivating performances of Bharatnatyam, Kathak and classical singing on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bhatkhande-varsity-convocation-education-shapes-up-character-of-society-brings-prosperity-in-country-says-guv-101639160724827.html

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has refused to give permission to dig up the area near Bil Akbarpur underpass for laying pipelines and, as a result, a new route will have to be chalked out to connect the primary treatment plant in Dehra to the Jaitpur water storage facility, they said.The NHAI, while refusing permission, said any leakage from the pipeline can flood the underpass and suggested that the Greater Noida authority to change the planned route between Jaitpur and Dehra.“We are looking into this issue and it will be addressed. We will try to complete the project as per the deadline,” said AK Arora, general manager, Greater Noida authority.To provide water to Greater Noida households, the authority has to lay pipelines between the Dehra treatment plant and Jaitpur storage facility. And for that, the authority sought permission from the NHAI since a portion of the network has to cross the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (Kundli – Ghaziabad – Palwal route). But NHAI has refused permission citing flooding concerns in the event of a leakage.“We do not think we will be able to finish the project by December 31 as planned. It will be delayed and may be completed next year,” said a Greater Noida authority official, requesting anonymity. The authority started work on the Ganga water project in 2005 and it was slated to be ready by 2010. It is being executed at a cost of ₹800 crore and when ready, will deliver 85 cusecs of Ganga water to Greater Noida households.“The project was delayed for a long time due to unavailability of land. Farmers had refused to give us land in areas where water pipeline was to be laid out,” said an official from the Noida authority, adding that several land disputes remain unresolved delaying this crucial project.When the project could not be completed by 2010, the authority extended the deadline to 2013. It has missed several deadlines since then and in April 2016, the authority set a March 2018 deadline for the project, but work got delayed once again.
10-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad ramps up testing as four Covid-19 cases reported in a day||The district health department has issued directions to ramp up testing at primary health centres as there has been a minor rise in Covid-19 infections, four of which were detected on Friday, taking the tally of active cases in the district to 12. Of the four Covid-19 cases which came to the fore on Friday, one is a 14-year-old girl who lives in Crossings Republik and is a student of a Greater Noida school. A 74-year-old man from a high-rise in Vasundhara; a 37-year-old male patient from Indirapuram and another 31-year-old man from Sector 7 in Vaishali are among the others who have tested positive for the infection. Officials said all the three male patients have taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The 31-year-old man arrived in Delhi from Patna by flight on December 5 while the girl’s father has a travel history from Gujarat. “We have informed district officials about the girl; they will conduct necessary procedures at her school. Though there is a minor rise in Covid cases, all the patients have mild symptoms and are in home isolation. We are keeping a track of those coming from abroad as well as those arriving from other states. So far, we have sent about 210 samples for genome sequencing and none tested positive for the new variant, Omicron,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. According to official records, there have been very few Covid cases in the district since August. The last time the district had the highest number of active cases (21) was on July 27 this year. “Since there is minor rise in cases, we have asked all the urban primary health centres to conduct at least 50 tests per day. The more we test, chances are more cases may come to the fore,” said Dr Gupta. Currently, the district has a daily target of conducting 3,900 Covid tests via RT-PCR while the target assigned for rapid antigen tests is 3,500. According to official records of the district health department, total 2,075,460 samples have been collected for Covid-19 test since March last year. The health department has collected more than 40,000 samples in the first 10 days of this December. The overall sample positivity is 2.87% while is it is 0.03% for the month of December. Health experts said there seems to be a minor rise in Covid cases. “The testing had decreased after Covid cases started declining. It is a time when testing should be increased to trace the suspected cases and treat them at the earliest. Further, people should take every precaution, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). Data from the health department shows total 55,692 Covid cases have been reported in the district, which include 461 deaths. The district has recorded 324 cases in June, 65 in July, 26 in August, 18 in September, 14 in October and six in November.

The project is to end on January 31, 2022, but PMC has not been able to even start it. Bapat, and PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar met Union minister Gajendra Sinh Shekhavat on Friday. Bapat said, “Minister Shekhavat promised that project would continue and funds would not lapse. At the same time, he instructed us to issue a work order within a month.” The river rejuvenation project is getting executed with the help of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). As per the agreement, it was expected that the project work will be completed by January 31, 2022. The Central government approved Rs1,000 crore for this project. The PMC is not required to pay anything. A total of 11 new sewage treatment plants have been approved under it. This project got approved in 2015, but later when the PMC floated tenders, a cartel of bidders quoting costs was exposed. PMC scrapped the tendering process, which took time as the central government and JICA needed to clear the process. Recently, Union minister Nitin Gadkari held a meeting about the same and instructed PMC and the Jalshakti ministry to speed up the work, after which PMC floated fresh tenders for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-unable-to-start-1-000-crore-mula-mutha-river-development-project-deadline-extended-101639159888357.html
10-12-2021||Noida||UP Gate protest site to get cleared by December 15 as farmers pack up for home||It was pack-up time at the UP Gate protest site on Friday as farmers got busy gathering up the last of their belongings and dismantling tents and other makeshift structures that had helped make a one kilometre stretch of National Highway-9 (NH-9) their “home” for the past one year. Farmers said the site will be completely cleared by December 15 and they will all be homeward bound after celebrating “Vijay Divas” on Saturday, to mark their victory in getting Central government to withdraw the three contentious farm laws and accede to their other demands.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), on Thursday, called off the more than a yearlong protest after the Centre accepted their demands, including the withdrawals of cases registered against protesters and compensation for the kin of those who died during the agitation.“We have started packing up our stuff and are happy that we will soon be reunited with our families. The agitation was a success only because it was a collective effort — several of our brothers lost their lives during the course of the agitation,” said Puran Singh, a farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh.“It took us days to erect temporary structures which often got damaged in the adverse weather and we had rebuild them. But, farmers never lost heart and braved all conditions, all odds, with equanimity. The collective efforts have paid off and now we are looking forward to going home and spending time with our loved ones,” said Malkit Singh, another farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri.The farmer leaders said the site will get completely cleared by December 15, and farmers will start returning home from December 12.“The first batch of farmers will be homeward bound on December 12. As regards the future plans, we will go to different parts of the country where there are similar problems. We will tell people about this agitation and also seek their suggestions,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a man who had become the face of the agitation.“Farmers have a lot of issues and the rate for their crop is a major problem. This agitation was for the imminent problems that came up. We will also try to reach out to the families of farmers who died during the course of this agitation,” Tikait said.He said for the past year, the UP Gate site had became a village where farmers and people from different parts of the country gathered and interacted.“We feel pained to leave here — UP Gate had became our village where people from different regions gathered and stood together. The one thing that we take away from here is a big family; our was a small family, which now has expanded and grown big. I will move out from here on December 15 only after ensuring that every farmer has left. We will also try to clear one side of the highway for commuters by December 12,” Tikait said.The site on Friday observed no celebrations as a mark of respect for the dead soldiers, including the chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash two days ago.“There was no celebration at UP Gate on Friday; we will observe “Vijay Divas” on Saturday and felicitate people who worked hard to make this agitation a success. We are expecting many farmers to join us for the event. A day later, on Sunday, farmers will start heading home,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and UP Gate site spokesperson from SKM.The Ghaziabad police said it was in touch with farmer leaders and will ensure that their movement back home is smooth.“Most of the farmers camping at UP Gate are from western UP and Uttarakhand and they will be retuning with their tractors and trolleys. We have coordinated with the respective districts to facilitate their smooth movement,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).).

The four patients from PCMC are contacts of a Nigerian woman who was already confirmed as an Omicron case. Of the seven patients, four have been vaccinated. One patient has received a single dose of the vaccine, while one patient has not been vaccinated. One patient is three-and-a-half-years old so not eligible for vaccination. Four patients are asymptomatic, while three have mild symptoms, said the state health report. PCMC officials confirmed that a total of 10 Omicron cases have been reported from the area all of which can be tracked to the three passengers who had returned from Nigeria. Of these 10, five have already been discharged after they tested negative for the infection and rest are in institutional quarantine at the Jijamata hospital, as per state protocol. Dr Laxman Gophane, assistant health officer said, “A total of 340 people who either travelled to foreign countries or have come in close contact with them were tested and reports of 160 tests have been declared, 32 are positive and rest are negative.

10-12-2021||Pune||Maharashtra among the bottom ten states with lowest vaccination rate||PUNE Although districts like Pune, Mumbai and Thane have crossed or about to cross 100% partial vaccination among all beneficiaries, Maharashtra still is one of the ten states in the country that have a lower than National average vaccination rate of 86% first dose vaccination among beneficiaries and 53% fully vaccination rate among 18 plus. Some of the worst performing districts in the state include, Thane, Nashik, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Nanded and Solapur. However, metro cities like Pune, Mumbai and Kolhapur lag in second dose due beneficiaries.Among the ten states that are at the bottom with coverage of both first and second dose less than the national average include; Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Puducherry, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The central government has now asked the states to create awareness, mobilisation and vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries with first and second dose of the vaccine through house-to-house visits. Although adequate doses to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries with both first and second dose aged above 18 years have been made available to all states, beneficiaries are not turning up at the vaccination centres, said officials.During the Friday review meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, “Although Pune has achieved 100% first dose vaccination it is also true that Pune also has the highest number of second dose beneficiaries due. Using the CoWin database and the contact numbers of all beneficiaries the administration will follow up with them and call them individually to the vaccination centre to be fully vaccinated.”One of the officials who attended the meeting said that Pawar is of the opinion that the admin must take stern steps in case people continue to refuse to take the second shot . “If people continue to avoid the second dose, then we might have to use a carrot and stick policy to bring people to the vaccination centres,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-among-the-bottom-ten-states-with-lowest-vaccination-rate-101639159050951.html
10-12-2021||Pune||Four tehsils in Pune district record below 50% second doses, says Ajit Pawar||PUNE Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and state Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil on Friday held a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation in Pune. As per information shared by the district administration on Friday, four tehsils in Pune district have administered the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to less than 50% of the eligible population. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar instructed officials to improve the vaccination rate in these parts and warned of strict actions if the second doses are deliberately delayed. In Pune district, Baramati (49%), Bhor (45%), Daund (47%), and Indapur (40%) have a below-50 per cent rate of second-dose delivery. “In these specific tehsils where the percentage of second doses needs to be increased special drives will be conducted. We are giving them an opportunity this week. We will see what sort of response will be received. If people in these towns and tehsils don’t cooperate and keep on ignoring the second dose, then in the next week we will take a strict decision,” said Pawar. In the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) a second-dose rate of 76% and 66% respectively, has been recorded. “The district was left far behind in the vaccination target and when they took strict action on those not taking it, the situation improved. Actually, we are trying to convince people. People are not thinking about their own, and the lives of others. This week we will see the response, otherwise we are also inclined towards taking strict decisions,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/four-tehsils-in-pune-district-record-below-50-second-doses-says-ajit-pawar-101639158743992.html
10-12-2021||Pune||Five Omicron patients in Pune test negative for the variant||PUNE Five of the seven earlier confirmed Omicron cases in the district have been discharged, after they tested negative for the infection through an RTPCR test. Four more Omicron confirmed cases have been reported on Friday from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal corporation (PCMC). All contacts from the same cases reported earlier. As of Friday Pune had reported 11 confirmed cases of the new Covid variant, the highest for any district in the state. This took Maharashtra’s total tally to 17 Omicron-positive Covid-19 cases. One of the 11 was an index Omicron case in Pune city, a 47-year old male and was discharged on Thursday. The patient was found positive for Omicron through a routine surveillance. He visited Finland from November 18 to 25, 2021. He was tested due to a mild fever on November 29 and was found Covid positive. He has taken both doses of the Covishield vaccine and is completely stable without any symptoms. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer at Pune Municipal Corporation’(PMC) said, “The patient hardly reported any symptoms right from day one. He was under institutional quarantine at a hotel as per protocol. We even tracked down 50 of his close contacts and none of them tested positive for the Covid-19 infection.” In addition to this, 10 from neighbouring Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation tested positive for the new variant. Initially, three travelers who arrived from Nigeria, were found infected with Covid-19 in Pimpri- Chinchwad, and as of latest reports, a total of seven have tested positive for the new variant after genome sequencing; all from the same family or close contact of the patients who came from Nigeria. Dr Laxman Gophane, medical officer of PCMC said all 10 had tested positive for the new variant and now five have been discharged after they tested negative for the infection. Three out of 10 had come from Nigeria and the rest are close contacts.

Dr Gophane added, “They could test positive for the infection due to the shredding off of the dead viruses from the body. I myself had tested positive for the infection 1.5 months after I got infected. We will conduct an RTPCR test again three days later and if they test negative they’ll be discharged.” Of the six people, three are under the age of 18, and therefore, have not taken the vaccine. The three adults have taken both doses of the vaccine – two have taken Covisheild, and one, Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/five-omicron-patients-in-pune-test-negative-for-the-variant-101639157844070.html
10-12-2021||Lucknow||Can’t compel rape survivor for her child’s DNA test: Allahabad HC bench||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has ruled that a rape survivor cannot be forced to allow her child to undergo a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test to determine paternity. A single judge bench of Justice Sangeeta Chandra had on December 3 overturned June 25, 2021 order of the Pocso court, Sultanpur district, directing the DNA test of the rape survivor’s child on the plea of a minor who is an accused in the case. “It is apparent that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has misdirected his energies. The question before the learned Trial Court was not whether the child that was born to the prosecutrix (rape victim) was the child of the opposite party no.2 (rape accused),” said the court.“There was no question for determining the paternity of the child. The question involved in the case was whether rape was committed on the prosecutrix by the opposite party no.2. There was no reason for the prosecutrix to let her child undergo DNA test,” the court observed. “The court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an unchaste woman,” the court said. “The revision stands allowed,” said the court while overturning the Pocso court’s order for DNA test of the rape survivor’s child. On December 17, 2017, the victim’s mother had lodged a First Information Report (FIR) at Kotwali police station, Sultanpur district, alleging that her minor daughter (14) was raped. In the FIR, the mother had alleged that the accused had raped her daughter about seven months ago and thereafter she got pregnant. As the accused in the rape case was a minor, the proceedings of the case were conducted by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB). During proceedings of the case, the accused moved an application before the JJB for the DNA test of the baby. But on March 25, 2021, the JJB rejected the application. Thereafter, the accused moved the Pocso court seeking the DNA test of the child. On June 25, 2021, the Pocso court accepted the application and gave order for the DNA test. The victim’s mother then moved the high court against the Pocso court’s order.
10-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to procure 20 lakh rapid antigen test kits||As the latest Omicron variant of covid-19 looms large, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to procure 20 lakh rapid antigen test kits to detect Covid-19 cases within 15- 20 minutes.These tests are used at malls, railway stations, bus-stops, for detecting Covid positive patients.A proposal for the purchase will be tabled before the civic standing committee in its upcoming meeting next week. It is set to cost the civic body ₹9 per antigen kit. The kits will be purchased by the civic body in batches, and in the first batch 50,000 kits will be purchased for a cost of ₹5 lakh.A senior civic official said, “We have been using rapid antigen kits in cases where we need to quickly detect positive patients. It has also helped us with mass testing, primarily at market places, entry points to malls, at railway stations. RT-PCR tests follow a positive rapid antigen test’s positive result for the virus, but we can immediately quarantine a person tested positive on an antigen test, and check the spread of the infection.”Antigen tests are not useful in detecting Omicron variant. Civic officials say they anyway conduct RT-PCR test if a person is found positive in antigen test. “Only an RT-PCR test can be used to look for the S-gene drop out indicator for the omicron variant,” said Jyoti Gokhale, a microbiologist with Thane based Dr Vaidya’s Laboratory. “Even the RT-PCR tests have to be carried out using specific kits that look for the S (spike) region of the virus,” she said. According to Gokhale, rapid antigen tests detect certain proteins in the SARS-CoV-2, but these tests don’t have any markers or specifications to indicate the presence of a particular variant of the virus. “Therefore, rapid antigen tests can only be used to convey a positive or a negative result for Covid-19. Antigen tests also have high chances of producing false-negative results. Due to this, the government has mandated that positive results through rapid antigen can be considered accurate but a negative result should be followed up with the RT-PCR test for confirmation,” she said. Presently, on an average, BMC conducts between 35,000 and 45,000 covid tests per day, of which about 30-40% are rapid antigen tests, and the rest are RT-PCR tests. Mumbai’s overall daily positivity rate remains around 1%, and the positivity rate of antigen tests kits has remained below 1%. So far, BMC has procured a total of 4,000,000 rapid antigen test kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-procure-20-lakh-rapid-antigen-test-kits-101639156104332.html
10-12-2021||Lucknow||Two UP lawyers held in a case of misbehaviour with woman CJM||Police action is likely against some more lawyers with tainted background or chargesheeted in criminal cases after the arrest of two such lawyers on Thursday night in a four-year-old case of causing nuisance and misbehaving with a woman chief judicial magistrate (CJM) on district and sessions court premises here.A senior police official said there was a list of criminal cases in which lawyers were accused as well as chargesheeted but action was not initiated against them. He said as many as five to six lawyers of criminal and tainted background were on the radar and action would be initiated against them soon.Sharing further details about the arrest of two lawyers, another police official said the two lawyers were identified as Abhishek Singh and Atmad Hasan Idrisi. He said the police had filed the chargesheet against the two lawyers in connection with the case registered for misbehaviour with the CJM in 2017. Idrisi has some more criminal cases registered against him, he added.The police action was initiated when the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on November 30 ordered the commissioner of police, Lucknow, to file personal affidavit stating details of cases registered against advocates in the state capital along with the status of investigation and trial in such cases. The next hearing in the high court is scheduled in the matter on Monday (December 13).The bench of Justice Rakesh Srivastava and Justice Shamim Ahmed had on November 30 observed: “It appears that an organised group of advocates is indulging in extortion, money laundering, blackmailing and is creating difficulty in law and order in the court campus, which is difficult to countenance.” “Such a state of affairs, wherein the rule of law stands hijacked by a few anti-social elements, cannot be allowed to continue,” the court had said.The court stated the police commissioner will also revisit the cases in which the final report had been submitted and if it was found that there was some laxity in investigation and all the witnesses did not come forward due to fear of the accused persons, it would be open to him to order further investigation in accordance with law. The court also ordered the district judge, Lucknow, to submit a report on cases pending against lawyers in a sealed envelope on next hearing of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/two-up-lawyers-held-in-a-case-of-misbehaviour-with-woman-cjm-101639155924263.html

10-12-2021||Mumbai||5-member team of vaccinators trek 16km on foot to jab villagers in remote hamlet||For Dr Harshal Bhore and his team of vaccinators, Wednesday was unlike any other vaccination day. Not only did they have to report early in the morning but also had to trek with heavy temperature-controlled bags for around 16km as part of a three-hour one-way journey to reach their vaccination camp. All these efforts were to ensure that the 138 eligible people in Dapurmal hamlet, 100km from Thane, could get their first dose of vaccine.A team of five vaccinators visited Dapurmal village in Shahpur Taluka at the foothills of Sahyadri ranges. It is not easily accessible. There are a few who travel towards the city on a regular basis. The rest of the population consisting of 246 villagers rely on local produce for their livelihood.The vaccinators belong to the Kasara side of Shahpur Taluka. They are based out of Vihigaon Public Health Centre. On Wednesday, the team gathered at around 8am with vials of vaccine doses stored in temperature-controlled bags and basic medications.“The village is situated amidst a hilly terrain. It does not have a proper approach road and is like a tribal settlement. Hence, we had to walk for 16km carrying the bags. Moreover, we had books and other paperwork in order to note down all the personal details of the villagers and provide them with CoWIN registration. It was with the support of the Asha workers posted in the village that we managed to reach out to the villagers,” said Bhore, community health officer, Shahpur Taluka.The vaccinators also took efforts to counsel and create awareness regarding the importance of vaccination as there was reluctance amidst the villagers. “From among the 246 villagers, around 138 were eligible for vaccination and all of them were provided with the first dose on Wednesday. This included two pregnant ladies and three lactating mothers. After completing the vaccination schedule, a health camp was also conducted,” said Namdev Farde, health assistant, Vihigaon.The vaccinators also provided some stationery and gifts to the students in order to gain the trust of the entire families to get vaccinated. “This village has two Asha workers who had asked all the villagers to stay at home on the day and refrain from going to their workplaces. This helped us achieve 100% first dose vaccination in the village on Wednesday,” said Bharati Thackray, staff nurse at Vihigaon. The villagers travel one hour daily on foot to get water from a river that flows nearby. Block facilitator, Sujata Bhoir, said, “Although it was a tedious day and a long trek to reach and return, we feel accomplished as we have helped them get one step closer to getting immunised from Covid. We are keen to visit the village again for the second jab and fully vaccinate them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/5member-team-of-vaccinators-trek-16km-on-foot-to-jab-villagers-in-remote-hamlet-101639154844083.html
10-12-2021||Lucknow||Saryu canal project: BJP plans to woo farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) plans to woo farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh with the inauguration of the Saryu Canal National Project by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Balrampur on Saturday (December 11).On the eve of the inauguration, the BJP launched a massive campaign on social media, as well as in the rural areas of eastern UP, terming the project a major achievement of the party’s double engine government at the Centre and in the state. Party leaders mobilised the cadre to make the inauguration programme successful. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the 6,623-kilometre-long canal system will benefit the farmers in nine districts of eastern UP — Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabirnagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj. The canal project will give boost to the agriculture sector in eastern Uttar Pradesh and be an important milestone in the BJP government’s pledge to double the income of the farmers by 2022, he said.Terming the Saryu canal a major gift to the farmers in eastern UP, a BJP leader said it showed the commitment of the party’s governments at the Centre and in the state to the welfare of farmers.When the Prime Minister inaugurates the Saryu Canal National Project on Saturday, protesting farmers will be returning to their villages from Delhi border after the farmers’ unions called off their yearlong agitation, he said. It shows the farmers’ trust in the BJP government, he claimed.Uttar Pradesh Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh said the Saryu Canal National Project will benefit 30 lakh (three million) farmers in eastern UP as the ₹9,802-crore canal will irrigate 15 lakh hectare land in 6,227 villages.Under this project, five rivers have been connected, including the Ghaghra, Saryu, Rapti, Banganga and the Rohini. The sub canals with a length of 6,600 km have been linked to the 318-km main canal.The canal system is an excellent example of the river-linking project launched by the BJP government at the Centre, he said. It will also protect the districts of eastern UP from recurrent floods, the minister said. The Saryu canal project was planned in 1972, but the work on the project started in 1978. Initially, the project was limited to three districts of Devipatan division but expanded to nine districts in 1982.The previous governments completed 52% of the work on the project in four decades whereas the double engine BJP government completed the remaining 48% of the work in four years after the formation of the BJP government in UP in 2017, he said.On Wednesday, the Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved funding and implementation of the Ken- Betwa inter-linking rivers project that will benefit farmers in four districts Jhansi, Mahoba, Banda and Lalitpur in Bundelkhand of Uttar Pradesh, along with the nine districts of the same region Madhya Pradesh. 
10-12-2021||Mumbai||Seven new cases in state, tally at 17||Mumbai Maharashtra on Friday detected seven new Covid-19 cases with Omicron variant, pushing the state’s total to 17. Of the seven cases, three were detected in Mumbai including one in Dharavi. The remaining four cases are from Pimpri-Chinchwad in Pune district. Of the 17 found so far, six Omicron infected patients in the state have tested negative for Covid-19, and have been discharged, health department officials said.With the new cases in Mumbai, the total number of cases of the Omicron variant rose to five. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the newly infected patients are males of 25, 37 and 48 years of age. The 25-year-old returned to Mumbai from London on December 1, while the 37 and 48-year-old patients returned to Mumbai from South Africa and Tanzania, respectively, on December 4. All three patients are admitted at Seven Hills Hospital in Marol area of Andheri.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to procure 2,000,000 rapid antigen test kits to quick detection of Covid-19 cases. These tests are used at malls, railway stations, bus-stops, for detecting Covid positive patients.A proposal for the purchase will be tabled before the civic standing committee in its upcoming meeting next week. It is set to cost the civic body ₹9 per antigen kit. The kits will be purchased by the civic body in batches, and in the first batch 50,000 kits will be purchased for a cost of ₹500,000.A senior civic official said, “We have been using rapid antigen kits in cases where we need to quickly detect positive patients. It has also helped us with mass testing primarily at market places, entry points to malls, at railway stations. RTPCR tests follow a positive rapid antigen test’s positive result for Covid-19, but we can immediately quarantine a person tested positive on an antigen tests, and check the spread of the infection.” The Omicron variant has been declared a ‘variant of concern’, with faster transmission rate.“Only an RT-PCR test can be used to look for the S-gene drop out indicator for the omicron variant,” said Jyoti Gokhale, a microbiologist with Thane based Dr Vaidya’s Laboratory.According to Gokhale, rapid antigen tests detect certain proteins in the SARS-CoV-2, but these tests don’t have any markers or specifications to indicate the presence of a particular variant of the virus. “Therefore, rapid antigen tests can only be used to convey a positive or a negative result for Covid-19. Antigen tests also have high chances of producing false-negative results. Due to this, the government has mandated that positive results through rapid antigen can be considered accurate but a negative result should be followed up with the RT-PCR test for confirmation,” she said. Presently, on an average, BMC conducts between 35,000 and 45,000 covid tests per day, of which about 30-40% are rapid antigen tests, and the rest are RT-PCR tests.Dr Mangla Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, said that besides the 25-year-old, the remaining two patients are not residents of Mumbai. “The 25-year-old is a resident of South Mumbai, the 48-year-old is a Chennai resident who had come to Mumbai’s Dharavi for professional work, while the 37-year-old is a resident of Gujarat,” Gomare said.After the reports of the patients came out positive in the RT-PCR tests, the samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).The BMC also added that the 25 and 37-year-old patients were fully vaccinated, and the 37-year-old has mild symptoms, while the remaining patients are asymptomatic. The 37-year-old was admitted to the hospital by the airport authorities as a precautionary measure while the remaining two patients were hospitalised after their reports came out to be positive.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, said that the Tanzania returnee who went to Dharavi had to take a compulsory test at the airport as he was not vaccinated. “The patient was asked to wait at the airport till reports came, however, he left for Dharavi in the evening and the RT-PCR report came positive. Following which, the local ward office (G/North) tracked the patient and the sample was sent for genome sequencing,” Dighavkar said. Dharavi, a densely populated slum of at least 850,000 people with a population density of 354,167 per square km, was a hotspot of Covid infections in the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020.BMC officials said that the high-risk contacts of all three patients have been tracked and tested, and none of them tested positive.According to the health department, the four new cases in Pimpri-Chinchwad are contacts of a Nigerian national (of Indian origin), who was detected with Omicron strain of the virus on December 5. The 44-year-old-woman, along with her two daughters, had come to Pimpri-Chinchwad on November 24 to meet her brother. “Out of seven patients found today, four have been vaccinated. One patient has received a single dose of the vaccine, while one patient has not been vaccinated. One of the patients is a three-and-a-half-year-old so not eligible for vaccination. Four patients are asymptomatic while three patients have mild symptoms,” a statement from the health department said.Since December 1, 61,439 passengers, including 9,678 passengers from at-risk countries, have arrived at airports in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. The state has found 20 Covid positive cases of people from at-risk countries and five from other countries. The field surveillance is underway of all international passengers that arrived since November 1. Through the airport and field surveillance, 89 samples have been sent for genomic sequencing. Results of 47 are awaited so far, the health department said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra added 695 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the state’s tally to 6,642,372. It reported 12 deaths, taking the death toll to 141,223. Mumbai added 194 new Covid infections and added one fatality. The active case count in the state stood at 6,534.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/seven-new-cases-in-state-tally-at-17-101639154544282.html
10-12-2021||Patna||BJP legislator gets notice after he scorns Bihar leaders, praises Nitish Kumar||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Gyanendra Singh Gyanu who questioned his party’s state leadership’s ability to lead the party to a victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, has been served a show-cause notice by the BJP’s disciplinary committee, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.Gyanu, a legislator from Barh seat less than 100km from state capital Patna, has been a vocal critic of the state leadership after party veteran and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi exited Nitish Kumar’s cabinet in November 2020.. He was later elected a Rajya Sabha member.“He has been given 14 days to explain his position for criticising the party leadership,” said BJP Bihar unit’s disciplinary committee president Vinay Singh.On Friday, Gyanu suggested he doesn’t need that long and will respond in a day or two.“My proximity to chief minister Nitish Kumar and criticism of the state of affairs in the party was not liked by party leaders,” the four-time lawmaker told HT.Gyanu had been in Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) for years and was seen to be close to the chief minister. But he sprung a surprise in August 2015 when he, along with three other party rebels, vaulted into the BJP camp right before the Bihar elections in which the JD(U) partnered with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).The switch was a huge setback to Nitish Kumar. But after Kumar hit the reset button in 2017, and revived the JD(U) partnership with the BJP, Gyanendra Singh Gyanu and Nitish Kumar are known to have patched up.“In the NDA (National Democratic Alliance), CM Nitish Kumar is the only leader who has a vision. There is no alternative to Nitish Kumar and in the future also, Nitish Kumar will remain the chief minister of Bihar. BJP has become directionless and it doesn’t have a leader in Bihar BJP who can become the Chief Minister,” the Barh MLA said on December 5.“I fear the situation in the state BJP is such that it will have an adverse impact on the party’s performance in 2024 parliamentary elections,” he added, criticising the party for not creating a strong leadership.“Novices were made the ministers or put them in the organization. At one point of time, the likes of Sushil Kumar Modi and Mangal Pandey mattered. If there was any problem in the NDA, Modiji was available to solve it. He had the influence on the legislature party and on the organization. But today there is no one to look after,” Gyanu said, angering the state leadership.On previous occasions too, the BJP MLA has gone public with his criticism of the party’s ministers and once, even went to the extent of accusing all except one or two of corruption.The MLA has been sore about being kept out of the state cabinet. In February, when Nitish Kumar-led NDA government was expanded, Gyanu lamented that the “party ignored old, experienced and dedicated leaders”.

10-12-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Attendance Anxiety||Katrina and Vicky got married. They didn’t invite you.Come to think of it, neither did Anushka and Virat, Deepika-Ranveer, Priyanka-Nick or even RajKummar Rao and Patralekhaa. It could have been due to travel issues. They had destination weddings and everyone knows you don’t travel well.Or perhaps, you were not invited because you don’t know them and have never met them. Still, it would have been nice…At this stage, your chances of getting invited to Ranbir and Alia‘s also appear exceptionally dim.***However, this does not stop you from stressing about what you would wear to all these nuptials. After all, you wouldn’t want to let the side down, would you?Wall- to- wall Sabya in Tuscany for Anushka and Virat’s?Edgy, out-of -the box matchy-matchies for Deepika-Ranveer‘s? A mile-long dramatic veil for Priyanka and Nick’s?For the last, you‘d been eyeing a particular curtain in your drawing-room. How would it have looked trailing five feet from your head across the floor? No?Well, no one’s said dressing for a Bollywood wedding was easy.Rumour has it that Anaita Shroff Adajania is booked till next Diwali, while amorous Bollywood couples wait patiently to secure her dates.Last heard, she was sourcing underwater bridal wear for an upcoming shoot... err …wedding, to be held on a coral reef, eighty kilometres under the ocean, off the Maldivian coast. Apparently, the bride feels it is the best solution to restrict the number of guests during the pandemic. (Also, she knows her future mother-in-law is dead scared of water). Meanwhile, a flock of sea turtles that inhabit the reef are said to have agreed to sign non-disclosure agreements.***Katrina-Vicky got married and of course, along with your outfits, you can’t help stressing about how you’d dance at a celebrity wedding. Perish the thought that you could get away with your tired old ‘screw the light bulbs and wipe your kneecaps’ faux Bhangra routine. Dancing at a celebrity wedding is serious business.One misstep to the bride’s latest break-out hit item number and YOU’RE yesterday’s dog food.Dancing at a Bollywood celeb’s wedding is a religion invented at the altar of Karan Johar and blessed by Aditya Chopra.However, you have to admit that Bollywood celebrities dancing at Bollywood celebrity weddings seems a little like cheating.Like being invited to a sit-down dinner where every other guest is a 3- star Michelin chef, who has brought their own meal, while you’ve arrived with a boiled- egg sandwich. How is it possible not to feel outclassed? Or stressed?***Perhaps the real reason why Kat-Vick, Anushka and Virat or Deepika-Ranveer etc. did not invite you is that they know how stressful attending a wedding is for you. Or attending anything for that matter. That’s because while most people have performance anxiety, you have attendance anxiety.After all, besides the dressing up and the keeping in step to a group rendition of Chaiyya Chaiyya - there’s a lot else that you are required to do on these occasions.Like standing in a long queue to wait your turn to greet the couple.While making small talk with your fellow queue-ees. While balancing yourself on high heels, which have begun to pinch. While hanging on to your saree palluv and hem. Along with your pretty, but impractical evening clutch.And a discreet gift.And (hopefully) a glass of water. Or wine. Or Tequila.Or a couple of Tequilas. Along with your smile.While you stress about what you will say to the couple when you finally reach them.Best to prepare yourself and rehearse a few lines before the mandatory greet and meet and photo–op. Blessings and congratulations are the norm. Telling the groom’s family how you’ve known the bride ever since the days she was expelled as a juvenile delinquent from kindergarten for sundry crimes and misdemeanours - is not.Nor is asking for directions to the nearest loo : “Because you know guys -I’ve been waiting for an hour…”***So, Katrina and Vicky Kaushal got married and you were not invited.That doesn’t mean you didn’t attend. Thanks to 1,654 breathless hyperventilating news reporters, not to mention 97 TV crew camped outside the venue, giving you a blow-by-blow account of every single detail of the event (we mean every single) your presence was assured.You had the special mehendi applied on your hands, you tasted the dishes on the banquet and you demonstrated the courage of your convulsions into the wee hours of the morning along with the best of them. Now Anil Kapoor (God bless him) is on your speed dial. Gurdas Maan is your man.***Katrina and Vicky got married. Badhai ho.Given how deeply you were involved in every aspect of the happy occasion, who says you didn’t attend? In fact, you could have been one of the main invitees. To all of them.Including Virat and Anushka’s and Priyanka and Nick’s and Deepika and Ranveer’s...The jury’s still out on whether or not you were present, wearing your finery, posing for the paps and making your best moves. In fact, the jury’s still out on whether you were present at your own wedding too. But that’s another matter, for another day…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-attendance-anxiety-101639153823819.html
10-12-2021||Mumbai||State may ask districts to impose curbs to push 2nd dose numbers||Mumbai The state government is considering asking districts to impose restrictions to encourage full vaccination of citizens, even as seven more cases of the Omicron variant, thought to be at least four times as transmissible as the Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus according to preliminary studies, were detected in Mumbai and Pimpri-Chinchwad on Friday. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar told reporters that the state lagged behind in second dose vaccinations, and hinted that pending further discussion, the administration may be asked to impose restrictions on those who are not yet fully vaccinated. At present, only 47.84% of the state’s population has received two doses of the vaccine that has been proven to reduce severe Covid disease and cut rates of hospitalisation. “We took a stock recently and saw that there are vaccines available. The number of people who have taken the first dose has increased. In the second dose, many districts are lagging behind. It is important for them to take their second dose. Therefore, we have told the administration to carry out awareness campaigns and push for second dose vaccinations by bringing in some restrictions,” Pawar said. Some of the restrictions that the districts could choose from, depending on the local conditions, include restricting the sale of petrol and diesel at fuel stations, entry to government offices, shopping complex, malls, and industrial units under Maharashtra Industries Development Corporation or MIDC and other services offered by the state, a senior government official who did not wish to be named, said. The state calculates the number of people who are due for their second dose by keeping track of those who have crossed the minimum duration of the gap between two doses —28 days for Covaxin and 84 days for Covishield. What this means is that the number is dynamic, and will also include those who have not taken their shot after the 42nd and 113th day, which is the outer limit of the second Covaxin and Covishield shots, respectively. As of Friday afternoon, at least 9.8 million people have crossed the minimum duration for their second dose. Various districts have already imposed restrictions on access to certain amenities for residents who are not vaccinated. The Thane Municipal Corporation this week began to restrict people who are not fully vaccinated from travelling in state buses, with teams checking vaccination certificates of passengers at the main bus depots in the city. In Mumbai, only those who are fully vaccinated (including essential services) are permitted to travel by the local trains. Furthermore, only fully vaccinated Mumbai residents are allowed to enter malls, shopping centres and auditoriums. In Nagpur, the municipal corporation has restricted entry to government offices to those people who are doubly vaccinated. Health department officials said that the restrictions are under consideration as vaccination is not mandatory. The government might ask individual districts to come up with restrictions as motivation to push their numbers. “The Centre has not made the vaccination mandatory. We are looking at having restrictions like not allowing such citizens to enter government offices, in malls and shopping centres, etc. Aurangabad district collector had issed orders sale of petrol and diesel only for those who are vaccinated. Similarly, other districts might be asked to have some restrictions in an attempt to drive the second dose numbers up,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity. Health minister Rajesh Tope was not available for a comment. The Aurangabad district administration in November ordered ration shops, gas agencies and petrol pumps to supply groceries and fuel only to people who had taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Out of the 36 districts in the state, 22 districts (with large rural populations) are a matter of concern for the administration. Nanded has the lowest fully vaccinated beneficiaries with 29.18%, followed by Hingoli (32.09%), Solapur (32.18%), Jalgaon (33.55%), and Osmanabad (34.04%). Other districts that are below the state’s average — 47.84% for double dose, 83.74% for single dose — include Nandurbar, Akola, Beed, Amravati, Latur, Yavatmal, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Nashik and Palghar among others. Box Current restrictions * In Mumbai, the state government has only allowed fully vaccinated citizens to get single-journey tickets or a season pass to travel in the local trains. This is in effect in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. *Only fully vaccinated citizens are allowed to enter malls, shopping centres and auditoriums. *Nagpur Municipal Corporation has allowed entry to government offices to only those people who have taken both the doses *Aurangabad district collector has disallowed entry to people who have not taken a single dose of vaccine to government offices, MIDC areas, malls and shopping complex, at heritage sites and tourists spots.

10-12-2021||Patna||BJP MLA show caused for criticising party leadership, ministers||Four days after questioning the leadership of his party, Barh BJP MLA Gyanendra Singh Gyanu has been served a show-cause notice by the party’s disciplinary committee for openly and frequently raising voice against the party organisation and ministers. The notice to this effect was issued by the party’s state unit disciplinary committee president Vinay Singh. “He has been given 14 days to explain his position for criticising the party leadership,” said Singh. Confirming the receipt of the letter, Gyanu said he would submit his reply in a day or two. “My closeness with CM Nitish Kumar and criticism of the state of affairs in the party was not liked by party leaders,” he said. Gyanu, who left JD (U) in 2015, praised Nitish Kumar for his vision. “In the NDA, CM Nitish Kumar is the only leader who has a vision. There is no alternative to Nitish Kumar and in future also Nitish Kumar will remain the CM of Bihar. BJP has become directionless and it doesn’t have a leader in Bihar BJP who can become the chief minister,” he said. “I fear the situation in the state BJP is such that it will have an adverse impact on the party’s performance in 2024 parliamentary elections,” he said on December 5 and attacked the party for not creating a strong leadership. “Novices were made the ministers or put them in the organization. At one point in time, the likes of Sushil Kumar Modi and Mangal Pandey mattered. If there would be any problems in the NDA, Modiji was available to solve them. He had an influence on the legislature party and the organization. But today there is no one to look after,” Gyanu said.The BJP MLA, on earlier occasions too, had opened a tirade against his party ministers and had said that barring one or two ministers, all indulge in corruption. Earlier in February, when Nitish Kumar-led NDA government was expanded, Gyanu was vocal after being denied a ministerial berth. “The party ignored old, experienced and dedicated leaders,” he had said.. 
10-12-2021||Patna||Complaints of irregularities hit Bihar’s paddy procurement drive||The state cooperative department’s bid to ensure timely procurement of paddy from the farmers has been crippled by the allegations of irregularities in payment and the general reluctance of the staff engaged in the procurement process of the major Kharif crop in the region.As a result, the department so far could procure only 3.02 lakh metric tonne (MT) of paddy from the farmers against the target of 45 lakh MT, set for 2021-22 fiscal. The state government started the procurement process on November 1 and scheduled to wind it up by January 31. The state government had authorised around 5,200 primary agriculture cooperative societies (Pacs) and Vyapar Mandals (VMs) out of the total 7153 agencies to procure the produce.“On an average, we are receiving 30-50 complaints from the farmers across the state that their product is not being taken by the staff of primary agriculture cooperative societies (Pacs) of Vypar Mandals (VMs) over different reasons. We refer the cases to the cooperative department for resolution. The complaints related to payment of paddy lower than the MSP of ₹1940-1960 per quintal and refusal to buy paddy in the name of excess moisture,” said an executive manning the department’s call centre.Worried over the tardy pace of procurement, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan had on Thursday directed the district magistrates (DMs) of all the districts to expedite the process and sort out issues in the light of complaints received at the call centres on a priority basis. A senior officer of the cooperative department said that an individual farmer is eligible to sell up to 250 quintals of paddy to Pacs/VMs, while sharecroppers are allowed to sell 100 quintals.Agriculture secretary N Saravana Kumar said that over 8.50 lakh farmers had registered themselves with the department’s portal to sell paddy with the government agencies. So far, nearly 41,000 farmers could avail of the facility. Pacs and VMs of Supaul emerged as the highest procurer of paddy with their stock crossing over 23,000MT, while Munger stood at the bottom of the procurement list with around 447MT stock of paddy on Friday.“It could be due to the farmers’ protest in Delhi that the state government launched the procurement from November 1 this year against November 15 year. But getting the MSP of the produce is difficult, as we need to spend some extra bucks to arrange smooth procurement of paddy,” said Vijay Mishra, a farmer of Bikramganj in Rohtas.

10-12-2021||Mumbai||Despite Kalyan court’s order, no progress in investigation, claims family of 18-month old girl||A day after the case was filed against two Kalyan-based doctors for allegedly prescribing wrong medicines to a one-and-a-half-year-old girl leading to her death, the family has alleged that the police have still not produced the doctors before the court nor are they investigating the matter.The Kolsewadi police claimed that they have no jurisdiction to take action against fake doctors and it is the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) that should investigate. KDMC chose to stay silent on the issue.The clinic where the parents took the girl was in limelight in 2018, when a doctor was arrested for raping a minor. The family, which has been running from pillar to post to seek justice for the girl, claimed to have hit a wall despite court’s orders. They claimed that the police had blamed them five months ago when they approached the police station.Munni Sahani, 26, mother of the deceased girl, said, “I am illiterate, poor and unaware of the legal procedures. However, I do know that I have the right to seek justice for my child even if the protectors of law refused to help. On July 5, we took my daughter to the clinic, where she was given medicine. Later, when she did not recover, I took her again on July 6, when they gave her medicine and steam. After we came home, she slept. At 6pm, I found her dead. I took her to the same doctors, Mohamad Ansari and S Alam, who threw us out and told us that ‘you can’t do anything wrong to us, do whatever you want’.”The parents then went to the police station. However, they refused to take the case. The mother added, “The Kolsewadi police asked us to leave and blamed us that we must have given wrong medicine and not the doctors. We requested a post-mortem but the cops and some government hospital doctors told us that there was no need for a post-mortem as the result would come after a year and we’d waste time.”The family finally got help from lawyer Satyendra Dubey, who fought with them in the Kalyan court. The court asked the police to file the case in the matter against the doctor three days ago. The family claimed that they were unnecessarily called to the police station and made to wait for a whole day without any question or getting information.Sahani said, “We told police five months ago that the doctor who prescribed us the medicine is a fake doctor but no one authenticated the fact. Whatever we earn, we use for basic food and legal proceedings.”Senior police inspector Basir Shaikh didn’t answer as to why they didn’t take any step five months ago. “We have asked KDMC to check the details of the doctor. That’s not our work. Whether our officers informed KDMC five months back or not, I can’t tell you details of all these. Our investigation is on.”Medical health officer of KDMC, Ashwini Patil, too was reluctant to share more insights into this matter. She said, “Whatever inquiry and investigations we have done will be informed to the police and also we are waiting for the directions from Maharashtra medical council for further action.”Dubey said, “Police have added non-bailable offence and they have only detained the two. Both the police and KDMC are merely passing the buck.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-kalyan-court-s-order-no-progress-in-investigation-claims-family-of-18-month-old-girl-101639151181384.html

The HC asked Gor to give the undertaking while hearing his application for permitting his release on temporary cash surety. The NIA appeal will be heard on Wednesday next week. The division bench of Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Sarang Kotwal while hearing the NIA’s appeal was informed by advocate Sandesh Patil that the central agency was agitating the order by the HC single-judge who had set aside the order of the special NIA court which had stayed the bail it had granted to Gor for a period of 25 days at the request of the NIA. In the appeal, the NIA had sought a stay of the bail granted by the special NIA court. While assuring the court of cooperating with the agency, senior advocate Shirish Gupte for Gor submitted that in case of being released, his client would surrender to the NIA if its appeal was successful. However, the court said that it would hear the appeal on Wednesday and decide whether the bail order can be stayed or not. “This is a substantive appeal and we are looking at the correctness of the order. Even if we hear it in a prima facie manner, we will make observations on the merits,” the court added. Thereafter, the court asked Gor whether he was willing to give a statement that he would not act upon the bail order until the appeal was heard, to which Gor replied in the affirmative. The single-judge bench of Justice Sandeep Shinde while quashing and setting aside the 25-day stay on the bail order of the special NIA court had also refused NIA’s request to stay the operation of its order. Gor was arrested in March 2021 and was remanded to judicial custody. He had first applied for bail in August 2021 but it was rejected on the grounds that the investigation was still continuing and the chargesheet was not filed. However, in September 2021, after the NIA filed the chargesheet, Gor filed the application for bail claiming that he was not aware of the larger conspiracy in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-explosive-scare-hc-stays-naresh-gor-s-release-on-bail-101639148961363.html
10-12-2021||Delhi||Maid, off honour: Do you treat domestic help with equality?||Domestic helps and nannies are the lifeline of our households yet many a times aren’t treated with that kind of respect. Recently, actor Sumona Chakravarti shared a post about her experience at the airport where a help stood beside a family enjoying a meal at the restaurant. They didn’t bother to offer her food, and didn’t even let her sit! And such disturbing sights,Delhiites claim, are quite common in the city. “I remember, a few weeks back, I had gone out for dinner to a restaurant in a mall. There was a big family there, and they had brought their maid along to take care of their baby. While the baby was sleeping in the stroller, the maid was given a chair a little away from the table and made to sit there. The stroller was also parked right next to her. I just cannot understand why she couldn’t join the family at the table,” rues Manisha Verma, a teacher from Malviya Nagar. Sharing a similar experience, Nikita Parmar, a homemaker from Vasant Kunj, adds: “We were at a fine dining restaurant in south Delhi a few days back, where I saw a family make their help sit at a different table, while they enjoyed their meal elsewhere. It was very clear that the family wasn’t comfortable with their help sitting along with them. I feel this is so unfair! It enraged me so much, but what do you do with such people... If you can’t treat them well, then better not take them along with you.”Some have gone to the extent of taking a stand against this kind of mistreatment, but to no avail. Ishita Bhatt, an environment consultant from Gurugram, recalls, “A month back I saw a lady yelling badly on her help at an indoor kids’ playing area in Gurugram because the kid got hurt while playing. She was scolding her so badly and was so loud that almost everyone present there was feeling bad for the help. I understand that the kid got hurt, but the mother was also present at the time of the child getting hurt, then the responsibility lies with her too. I didn’t know that woman personally, and initially was a little sceptical to interfere in the matter, but her inhuman behaviour towards her help forced me to intervene... I tried to explain her that it was just an accident and the kid was fortunately fine with a little bruises that would get healed in a few days, but she refused to calm down.” However, there are exceptions. Priyanka Seth, a businesswoman from Gurugram says for her help is like her family member. “We are a couple with two kids. My full time help is the fifth member of our family. She travels with us and goes on all the outings in the same manner as we do. She uses those opportunities to learn and grow. For example, she started her flying experience with us. Every time we go to the airport, she’d ask me about it, understanding the process and all. Eventually she gained enough confidence that she recently decided to fly to Kolkata (nearest city to her village) to visit her parents,” says Seth, and Heena Gandhi, a homemaker from Paschim Vihar, chips in, “We recently went to a mall close to our place and at the restaurants there, we saw tables that had families sitting with their helps. Everyone was eating the same meal. I feel this is the minimum that a family can do for someone who is working for them!”Dr Anjana Singhla, a general physician from Saket, opines that at times, onlookers tend to get a bit judgmental. “Sometimes people make arrangements to ensure that the kids are taken care of and there is someone available with them at all times. For instance, they take turns with the help to have food — like I always offer food to my kids’ nanny first and while she is eating, I take care of the kids. Once the nanny is done, she plays with the kids and the I eat my meal in peace. And I think this is a great arrangement. Then again, onlookers might not understand and may jump to judgements. Like this once, a lovely lady told me to not ‘mistreat’ the nanny by not offering food. When I explained to her that the nanny has already eaten, that woman gave me a hug,” she shares.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/maid-off-honour-do-you-treat-domestic-help-with-equality-101639148732444.html

10-12-2021||Mumbai||Defamation suit: Nawab Malik tenders unconditional apology to HC||Mumbai Maharashtra minorities development minister Nawab Malik on Friday tendered an unconditional apology and assured the Bombay high court (HC) that henceforth, he would not make any comments or pass any remarks against Dnyandev Wankhede, father of the NCB officer Sameer Wankhede, or their family. A division bench of Justice SJ Kathawalla and Justice Milind Jadhav accepted the apology and a further undertaking given by the NCP leader and remanded Wankhede’s plea for interim injunction against Malik for fresh adjudication by a single-judge bench. The apology and reiteration of the undertaking came in response to a notice issued by HC on December 7 to the NCP leader, asking him why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him for apparent wilful breach of the undertaking that he had given earlier. On November 29, Malik had assured HC that he would refrain from making defamatory statements against Wankhede or his family members. Malik on Friday filed a short – four-page affidavit stating that the statements made by him were not intentional, but were made in the course of general interviews to the press and in response to specific questions asked by the media persons during the interviews. “I say that all the three statements, extracts and/or comments at Exhibit C, D & E were neither press releases nor press statements issued by me, or on my behalf,” said the affidavit. “These responses were made in the course of interviews with journalists which covered a large number of topics and a considerable period of time. In the course of such interviews, the journalists had asked specific questions and it was in response thereto that I had made the statements. These responses were made by me in the belief that such responses made in the course of interviews were not within the ambit of the statement made on my behalf to this Hon’ble Court,” it adds. “I had no intention to disrespect, dishonour, overreach the court or breach the said Orders,” stated the affidavit, adding, “I tender my unconditional apology to this Hon’ble Court in respect of the breaches of my undertaking given to this Hon’ble Court as recorded in the Orders dated 25th November 2021 and 29 November 2021.” The NCP leader has reiterated his undertaking to the court and stated that henceforth he will not even answer queries of media persons regarding Wankhede and his family members. However, the affidavit added that the undertaking would not restrain him from making comments on political misuse of central agencies or the acts of their officers. “I however believe my statement would not prevent me from commenting on the political misuse of central agencies and the conduct of their officers in the course of performance of their official duties hereafter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamation-suit-nawab-malik-tenders-unconditional-apology-to-hc-101639146800604.html
10-12-2021||Mumbai||With ample beds, Navi Mumbai civic body claims to be ready to handle 7K patients simultaneously in case of 3rd wave||With 45% increase in oxygen beds as compared to the peak of the second wave in April this year and 100% increase in ICU beds, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has claimed that it is ready to handle more than 7,000 active patients at one go.In terms of oxygen as well, with possession of just 120 dura cylinders during the second wave to now having 93 metric ton storage tanks, 3 PSAs and 200 dura cylinders, NMMC is confident of not falling short of oxygen if ever there is a third wave.In April 2021, there were 12,000 active patients with some in the waiting list to get beds, ventilators and oxygen beds.A total of 6,702 beds were available in April when the second wave was at its peak. The NMMC has increased the bed capacity to 11,635 beds.NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “With the past experience, we decided to have enough oxygen for ourselves and not depend on anyone for getting the dura cylinders filled. The necessity of ICU beds was the most and hence we focused on building them first. It takes around three months to get ICU beds ready and hence it is not possible to start getting them ready when the cases start seeing an increase. Meanwhile, the beds without oxygen can be set up within 15 days.”Besides the previous facilities that were available during the second wave, NMMC now has an additional 2,840 beds without oxygen. “These facilities are ready and we have the beds too. Whenever the need arises, all we have to do is place the beds at these facilities,” he added. Besides, 1,100 oxygen beds have been made ready at Mayuresh building in Belapur and GD Pol institute in Kharghar, 400 ventilators are also ready in addition to the 129 that were available previously.Storage tanks to store Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) with a total capacity of 93 metric tons have been fixed, of which three with a total capacity of 60 metric tons is at CIDCO exhibition centre, 20 metric tons at Airoli Municipal Hospital and 13 metric tons at Nerul Municipal Hospital. LMO would be provided by the government, which will be filled in these tanks. Corporation has also made four Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants, of which three are ready and the work on the last one is going on. PSA at Vashi General Hospital, CIDCO Centre and Airoli Hospital are ready while the fourth one is being fitted at Belapur Municipal Hospital. The PSAs can manufacture five to seven litres of oxygen per minute.“The dura cylinders are mobile and can be carried anywhere and can also be provided to private hospitals if required. These storage tanks that we have installed will be used to fill the dura cylinders. As per the government order, we have asked all the private hospitals as well to always be ready with three times the required oxygen,” oxygen nodal officer, Babasaheb Rajale, said.The average requirement of oxygen during the peak of the second wave was around 28 tons per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-ample-beds-navi-mumbai-civic-body-claims-to-be-ready-to-handle-7k-patients-simultaneously-in-case-of-3rd-wave-101639146385612.html

On November 29, Malik assured the high court that he will refrain from defamatory statements against Dnyandev Wankhede or his family members.The notice was issued after Wankhede’s lawyer cited excerpts from Malik’s interview given after his undertaking where he was alleged to have made defamatory comments against the family.Malik’s affidavit on Friday underlined that the statements were “not intentional”, and made in response to specific questions asked during interviews and not press releases nor press statements.“These responses were made in the course of interviews with journalists which covered a large number of topics and a considerable period of time. In the course of such interviews, the journalists had asked specific questions and it was in response thereto that I had made the statements. These responses were made by me in the belief that such responses made in the course of interviews were not within the ambit of the statement made on my behalf to this Hon’ble court,” the affidavit added.“I had no intention to disrespect, dishonour, overreach the court or breach the said orders,” stated the affidavit, promising that in future, he will not “even answer queries of media persons regarding Wankhede and his family members”.The affidavit however added that the undertaking would not restrain him from making comments on political misuse of central agencies or the acts of their officers. “I, however, believe my statement would not prevent me from commenting on the political misuse of central agencies and the conduct of their officers in the course of performance of their official duties hereafter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-apologises-to-hc-for-violating-promise-not-to-attack-wankhede-family-101639144100624.html

The idea behind this special education zone was to groom students as global citizens and addressing problems of the world through academic pursuits. Maharana Pratap Education Council and its students would play an important role in achieving this, said Pradhan while addressing the concluding programme of the 89th Founder’s Week celebrations of Maharana Pratap Education Council as the chief guest.Maharana Pratap Educational council is an academic venture of the Gorakhnath temple under which four dozen educational institutions were being run. While DDU Gorakhpur University, Madan Mohan Malviya University of Technology and Mahayogi Gorakhnath University were already functional, Ayush Vishwavidyalay was under construction here. The minister said the NEP had been prepared under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was in line with the strategic changes in the global scenario. “It aims at making India the No 1 country in the world and the children of India as global citizens,” he emphasized. Pradhan hailed UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath as an epitome of successful leadership, saying his leadership never bothered about issues but always looked at solutions. “Under his leadership, eastern Uttar Pradesh has got the gift of fertilizer factory by PM Modi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gorakhpur-to-be-developed-as-special-education-zone-pradhan-101639142540724.html

The residents allege that some of these companies transport their debris to the deserted places near the mangroves at odd hours and dump there.Dattatray Patil, a 41-year-old activist from Ulwe, said, “If you walk towards the mangroves for five minutes from Bamandongri railway station, you will see heaps of debris dumped there. Common people like us cannot generate this amount of debris at home. So, obviously, people who are into the construction business and have projects in this area do this. If this menace is not stopped soon, the debris will severely affect the mangroves here.”The Bombay High Court, in 2010, said that no non-forest activity can be permitted in the areas where mangroves grow even if such areas have not yet been declared as ‘protected forests’.Anil Bhoir, a 52-year-old resident, said, “The construction workers have been dumping debris near the mangroves in Ulwe for the past several years. We came across such incidents earlier and also informed the CIDCO officials about it. But they never take our complaints seriously.”A CIDCO official said, “I am not aware of debris dumped near the mangroves. I will ask our officials to remove them soon. I will also ask them to put a few boards announcing that dumping of debris and other garbage is prohibited near the mangroves.”According to the state mangrove cell, there are 1,471 hectares of mangrove forests in government-owned land in Navi Mumbai, which are protected by the law.

The police said that he was arrested after Kalyan resident, Appu Dutta (40), a government servant employed with the State government’s Land Records department, filed a complaint.The police said that on Tuesday, Dutta parked his bike in the pay-and-park area outside the station and went to his Mulund office by train, as per his daily routine. When he returned at night, he was unable to find his bike anywhere and approached Shinde.“As it happened, Dutta had lost the receipt issued to him that morning when he paid for his parking slot. Dutta told this to Shinde and asked him to check his register as there would be an entry in it. Shinde looked through his register, found the entry and scratched it out in front of Dutta. Shinde then said that he had no idea about Dutta’s bike and that it was not his responsibility,” senior police inspector Valmik Shardul, Kalyan GRP said.The incident led to an argument between Dutta and Shinde, and Dutta subsequently approached the police on Wednesday morning. After recording a statement from Dutta, the police registered an FIR and arrested Shinde the same day.The police have charged Shinde with destruction of a document or record to prevent its production as evidence, criminal breach of trust by person entrusted with property and cheating under the Indian Penal Code. After being produced in court, he was remanded in police custody till Sunday. “There are no CCTV cameras covering the parking lot, and we are trying to find out if there have been similar instances of vehicles going missing in the past. We shall be writing to railway authorities to seek this information as well as bring this matter to their notice,” Shardul said.Central Railway officials said that there are no hard and fast conditions imposed on private pay-and-park operators regarding installation of CCTV cameras, and it is left to the operators as to how best they can ensure the security of the vehicles left in their care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/payandpark-attendant-outside-kalyan-station-arrested-for-missing-2wheeler-101639141042706.html

Sunil Yadav, who is president of the Pharmacists Federation, UP chapter, said pharmacists are demanding wage revision along with other demands.Pharmacists are posted at district-level hospitals, medical colleges, community health centres and primary health centres, and are engaged in drug distribution, and at many places, work in injection rooms to administer injectable drugs and vaccines. Pharmacists are demanding wage revision, right to prescribe drugs, creation of new posts and standardisation of their work. Posts of pharmacists are less against the guidelines, and at some places, there are no pharmacists deployed.“Pharmacists deployed at emergency wards did not join the work boycott. But if our demands are not addressed, we shall go on complete work boycott from December 17, and boycott emergency work from December 20,” said Yadav adding, “Drug distribution is significant work as incorrect dose taken by a patient can do more harm than benefit.” For the past one-week pharmacists in the state have been working with black badges during their duty hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/patients-suffer-as-pharmacists-two-hour-work-boycott-continues-101639139777876.html
10-12-2021||Mumbai||PMLA court refuses to disbelieve Sachin Vaze’s statements||Mumbai A special PMLA court in Mumbai refused to disbelieve statements given by dismissed assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze to the enforcement directorate (ED) and said that the statements cannot be thrown out at the stage of bail. While dismissing the bail plea of former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde, the special PMLA Judge M G Deshpande said that the statements given by the dismissed API to ED cannot be thrown out at this stage of bail merely because he is a person of doubtful integrity. “In order to draw a legal conclusion about the conduct of any person, a trial is the only remedy,” said the court, adding that, “Because, it is a mixed question of law and facts.” The special judge said he had already held that there was a meeting in the house of the then home minister Deshmukh and Vaze, despite being a lower rank officer, took part in it. “Vaze also has boldly accepted that he paid cash to Shinde twice and this cannot be overlooked at this preliminary stage of bail,” said the court. “It is also alleged that cash was transferred through hawala and then sent to trust in the form of donations. In this way, there is a clear case which indicates the generation of Proceeds of Crime, its placement, layering and integration for projecting tainted money as untainted.” ED has arrested Shinde and Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande on June 26, 2021 in connection with money laundering case against Deshmukh. Advocate Ejaz Khan, who represented Kundan Shinde, had argued that apart from Vaze’s statement, there was absolutely nothing against the personal assistant of the then home minister. Khan had contended that the statements of the dismissed API cannot be relied upon as they were actuated by malice. The special court accepted that there was absolutely no corroboration to the statements, but added that collection of illegal money is basically a very secret process. “From the facts, it came out that there was a secret conspiracy amongst Anil Deshmukh, Sanjeev Palande, his personal secretary, dismissed inspector Vaze and (Kundan) Shinde,” said the court. Vaze in his statements to ED had said that on Deshmukh’s instructions, he had collected ₹4.7 crores from some orchestra bar owners in Mumbai and handed over the amount to Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-court-refuses-to-disbelieve-sachin-vaze-s-statements-101639138458779.html
10-12-2021||Mumbai||HC allows PMLA adjudicating authority to decide on attachment of Deshmukh‘s properties||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday permitted the single-member adjudicating authority constituted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to conduct a hearing on the provisional attachment of the properties belonging to former home minister Anil Deshmukh, his wife, son and other members of the family to conclude hearing on whether the attachment was valid or not. However, the court held that no coercive action would be taken pursuant to the completion of the hearing till the next hearing of the challenge by Aarti Deshmukh, to the constitution of the authority on January 10, 2022. The division bench of Justice Gautam Patel and Justice Madhav Jamdar, which is hearing the petition filed by Aarti Deshmukh, was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Enforcement Directorate (ED), that as per the rules, the single-member adjudicating authority could continue hearing the issue of provisional attachment and the objection raised by Deshmukh in the petition was not maintainable. Deshmukh has claimed that the adjudicating authority has to consist of three members which include one each from the fields of law’, administration and finance or accountancy. Further, one of the members was to be appointed as chairperson of the adjudicating authority and it would function within the department of revenue. Singh submitted that the December 6 order of the bench restraining the adjudicating authority from passing the final order should be modified. The modification Singh said was only to the extent that the authority can pass orders, however, its implementation would be subject to the outcome of the petition. However, senior advocate Vikram Choudhri for Deshmukh objected to Singh’s submissions and said that permitting the adjudicating authority to hear and decide on the issue of provisional attachment would prejudice his client and hence, it should not be allowed to pass orders till the petition was heard on merits. After hearing both sides, the bench held that there would be no prejudice to the petitioner if the authority was permitted to conclude hearing the issue of provisional attachment and pass orders if its implementation was kept pending till the petition was heard and decided by it. While both Singh and Choudhri agreed, Choudhri sought protection from coercive action in the event of any adverse decision by the adjudicating authority which the court allowed. The court then directed ED to file its reply to the petition by January 4 and any rejoinder till January 6 and posted hearing of the petition to January 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-allows-pmla-adjudicating-authority-to-decide-on-attachment-of-deshmukh-s-properties-101639138098591.html

With this, the total count of Omicron cases in the country’s financial capital touched three, while the nationwide tally stood at 26.A 49-year-old Dharavi resident who returned from Tanzania on December 4 was found infected with the highly contagious strain of the virus that was detected late last month in South Africa. Civic body officials said the patient is not vaccinated against Covid-19 and asymptomatic.The sample of the patient was collected at the Mumbai airport which later came out to be positive. After which, his sample was sent for genome sequencing at Kasturba Hospital in the city where it came positive for Omicron. Two of his high-risk contacts have tested negative for the virus so far.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) admitted the patient at Seven Hills Hospital.Earlier in the day, two more cases of Omicron were confirmed in Gujarat's Jamnagar after two contacts of a foreign returnee, who was the first Omicron case in the state, tested positive.In Mumbai, the first two patients of Omicron who tested positive earlier this week had been vaccinated with Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine and had shown no symptoms.They were a 37-year-old man who arrived from South Africa and his 36-year-old friend who landed from the United States.(With inputs from Mumbai bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-third-case-of-omicron-detected-in-city-india-tally-touches-26-101639137466420.html

The initiative is a part of the Swachh Survekshan 2022 programme initiated by the civic body.The facility was inaugurated at Sector 29 by popular singer and Navi Mumbai resident, Shankar Mahadevan, who is Swachh Navi Mumbai brand ambassador, in the presence of municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, and additional municipal commissioner Sujata Dhole.The pet corner has sand where the pets can litter. It also has a scooper, garbage bags and bin. The area has been spruced up with wall paintings of dogs and pet lovers.Speaking at the inauguration, Mahadevan, who brought along two of his pet dogs, said, “This is a very special day for all of us. The issue of open defecation concerns not just humans but also animals. Navi Mumbai is already open defecation-free with respect to humans. Now, this initiative will ensure that the city will also be free from pet waste soon.”The city has already been recognised as ODF with Water+ ranking in the Swachh Survey.Bangar added, “While most pet owners who take their pets for a stroll ensure that their waste is collected, there are some who litter on the roads, footpaths and other open spaces. We have been levying penalties on them. However, penalising is not the solution. We should also provide alternatives and this pet corner is just for that. We have taken up corners where sand has been made available and provided a scooper and garbage bags.”Scientific disposal is followed in which the owners can pick up the waste and put it in the bag which is then dumped in the bins provided from where it will be taken away. Bangar added that the city would have similar pet corners at 10 locations in the first phase and the number would increase further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shankar-mahadevan-inaugurates-pet-corner-in-vashi-101639137382144.html

10-12-2021||Pune||Global Village idiot: Why and how a ‘smart city’ is defined by airport experience||PUNE I landed in Hong Kong at 9.10 am, cleared immigration, freshened up, changed into my work suit and made it to the 10 am client meeting with ten minutes to spare. (I had taken the 1.15 am flight from Mumbai, had a good night’s sleep and had a great breakfast in flight). After a full day’s workshop, I left for the airport at 5.15 pm, checked in, cleared immigration, grabbed a bowl of barbecued chicken on steamed rice, spent an hour picking up stuff for the family and chocolates for the team, and then got onto the return flight at 7.45 pm. I was back in Mumbai by midnight.What would have made the trip perfect was if I could have just taken a cab home. But I live in Pune and there were no direct flights out to Hong Kong then (still aren’t). So, I had to factor in two four-hour road trips each time I flew in or out of the country.Between 2006 and 2016, I used to travel frequently to Hong Kong for work. On most visits, I stayed at a business hotel in the nearby town of Tung Chung, which was 10 minutes by cab (15 minutes by bus). (I have also stayed at the airport hotel within the airport complex.) The client offices were usually mid-way between the airport and township. The hotel was part of the commercial and residential area of Tung Chung planned across the low-lying hills - a clean waterfront with ferry pier, office complexes, a township with metro, bus station, malls and hotel. Even when I had clients in town (Kowloon or Hong Kong island or even further), it wasn’t a hassle because the metro rail is super-fast and the bus service was clockwork. I always felt as if I was part of a real-life lego set - life is that efficient in Hong Kong.Dinner was either at the hotel or the Citygate mall or the airport.Every third day, I used to take a bus or cab into the airport to visit the retail shops, browse the book shops, the aviation museum or eat at one of the many local food joints that were part of the airport. Hong Kong airport is a social destination and locals and visitors often shop, meet for drinks or eat at the airport - the entire complex is designed to invite people to interact with the airport, with outlets accessible to everyone and then some outlets can be accessed only by those with a boarding pass. One used to be able to walk in and out of the airport, window shop, grab a drink or a bite and go back home.That’s the kind of airport I hope we get in our city when they eventually decide to build the new one in Purandar taluka of Pune district. I love the current Pune airport because this is my home town and I love flying into the quaint, cute airport. My happiest trips overseas were when Jet Airways ran flights to Abu Dhabi and Singapore, SpiceJet had a Pune-Sharjah and Lufthansa flew to Frankfurt.But it’s going to be difficult to get a digital age airport because historically (and especially post 9/11) airports have been designed to keep non-flyers out.Modern airports (up till the 1990s) have contributed to a city when the airport has been an integral part of the city’s economic, social and cultural life, its aspirations and its future. We are now in the digital age and the emerging megacities are being redesigned around connectivity to the extent that the definition of megacities is all about the volume of people and cargo and services that the city handles and the number of other cities it is connected to. Hong Kong, Singapore, Doha and Dubai are prime examples in Asia and the Middle East where the airports are airport cities in themselves with an entire ecosystem that can be open to non-flyers and that contributes significantly to the local economy.The Hong Kong airport employs more than 78,000 people and it has a well-developed conference, exhibition, retail and entertainment complex which is a destination by itself, apart from being a hub for road and ferry connectivity to Macau and mainland China. There are several examples of such airport ecosystems across the world with varying degrees of public access, keeping and monitoring the real security risks in mind.In recent years, several airports in the USA have been experimenting with not just public access areas but public access beyond security checkpoints as well. Pittsburgh international airport was the first to open to non-travellers in 2017 under what is called ‘Terminal Tourism.’The primary argument here is that there has to be a vision for integrating the airport into the city’s growth from an administrative viewpoint. Further, there has to be a passionate and knowledgeable entity driving the vision for the airport’s design and development, in collaboration with private entities and residents with some government ownership so that it becomes a matter of city, state and nation-building.Towards such an end, as far as Pune is concerned, I feel that local citizens have to do their bit by taking an avid interest in the development and voicing the need for a world-class aspirational airport for starters. We are already on the Smart City road map. Why not expand the horizon to think global while connecting local to regional and creating new opportunities?Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

Under the project, tourism amenities will be developed at places like Patjirwa Sthan temple under Pujaha Panchayat in Bairia block West Champaran, the Durga Bagh temple in Betia, Khadda Maai temple in Nautan block, West Champaran and the Amwa Mann, the lake in West Champaran, officials said. The department has decided to spend more than ₹6.74 crores on the development of the Patjirwa Maai Sthaan. It’s believed to be Siddhapeeth, a site where a body part of Goddess Sati, the wife of Lord Shiva, had fallen. Locals believe the feet of Goddess Sati had fallen at Patjirwa Sthan.The Khadda Maai Sthan, another old temple in Nautan block will be developed with more than ₹5.46 crores while the Amwa Man lake will be developed at the cost of ₹14. 61 crores.Most of these places have been related to mythologies and religious texts and draw a large number of pilgrims from the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh as well as from neighbouring Nepal.“But the facilities for pilgrims at these places were missing. We have decided to develop these places as one of the best pilgrimage destinations,” Narayan Prasad, tourism minister, said.Though Champaran is known mainly for the Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), it has several heritage sites, ancient Hindu temples, lakes and water bodies, he added. “Though these old temples are not popular on the national level, it’s been drawing pilgrims from UP and Nepal. With so many pilgrimages and lakes, we are considering creating an exclusive Champaran Circuit. Tourists would love to stay in Champaran for not less than a week,” he said.The Durga Bagh temple is known to attract many devotees, the site, however, remained ignored for decades. “The department will develop a boundary wall here while a mandap for religious functions and basic amenities will also be developed,” he said.At the Patjirwa Sthan, Parikrama Path, Yatri Niwas, public amenities, wedding mandap, parking and signage will be developed while at the Khadd Mai Sthan, the department will develop boundary walls, public amenities, Yatri Niwas, sitting benches signage and parking.The Amwa Man lake too has a picturesque value and once developed, it will draw a large number of tourists, the minister said.“Here, we have planned to have a thematic gate, a viewpoint, jetty, musical fountain, kids bridge, canopy walk and public amenities,” he said.

The mayor added the envelope had no seal and that she would file a police complaint regarding the letter.Last year too, an unidentified person had called the Shiv Sena leader on her mobile phone, which was attended by her assistant, and abused her and also allegedly threatened to kill her. She had filed a police complaint on December 22 last year and the man was later arrested in January next year from Jamnagar in Gujarat.The fresh threat to Pednekar came amid the ongoing row over BJP MLA Ashish Shelar’s alleged objectionable remarks against her.Earlier this week, the mayor had filed a complaint against Shelar at the Marine Drive police station in Mumbai for his remarks during a press conference on December 4 regarding the Worli cylinder blast accident last month.Pednekar said Shelar made derogatory remarks about her and said that she visited the blast site after 72 hours. “The mayor of Mumbai is the first citizen and it is a very important post. The term used to describe me as a woman mayor is objectionable,” she wrote to Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil.Following her complaint, Shelar was booked under sections 354 A (4) (making sexually coloured remark) and 509 (words or gestures insulting woman's modesty) of the IPC.Shelar said his remarks against the mayor were distorted a day after the complaint was filed against him. “The police complaint filed against me is based on a press statement made some days ago. The entire video of the press conference is there in public domain. However, to enable a legal action against me, my words have been distorted deliberately,” PTI quoted the BJP MLA as saying.(With inputs from Bureau and Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-kishori-pednekar-receives-letter-with-death-threat-to-file-plaint-101639131422191.html

Many people here are not aware of the harm that drugs can cause. Therefore, the prohibition law should remain in force in Bihar. I am not in favour of reviewing the prohibition law,” Paswan saidFormer Bihar chief minister and HAM-S president Jitan Ram Manjhi had on Wednesday questioned CM Kumar’s alcohol ban in Bihar, requesting him to rethink the matter. “The chief minister should rethink the implementation of prohibition. Only poor people are being caught and harassed. Those who are involved in the illegal liquor trade racket are not being arrested… 70 % of the people who are being caught are poor,” Manjhi had claimed. Manjhi also pointed to revenue loss for the state government and dwindling hotel businesses in Bihar as a consequence of the prohibition. “Hotels in tourist spots such as Bodh Gaya are incurring losses. Tourists and programme operators have shifted to alternative venues in Ranchi and Kolkata,” he said, adding that a limited number of people should be given permission to consume alcohol amid state-wide prohibition. His remarks came in the backdrop of recent hooch tragedies in the districts of West Champaran, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Vaisshali, which left more than 40 people dead. The BJP, the NDA’s major alliance partner, has also been demanding a review of the prohibition, with the party’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal saying six years have passed since the liquor ban law was implemented and so it’s time to review it. “There is a need to review this law... I believe that its success and failure should be reconsidered,” Jaiswal recently said.

Four out of six Omicron patients in Pimpri-Chinchwad and a patient in Pune city have tested negative," said Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of the district.These seven persons, including an NRI woman and her two daughters from Nigeria, had tested positive for Omicron in Pune last week. They were admitted for treatment in city-based hospitals and their latest tests came out negative. The new strain, discovered in Africa last month, has been classified as a 'variant of concern' by the WHO. Pawar further said that 100 per cent of the eligible population in the district has been covered with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines, and over 1.38 crore shots have been administered so far. The pace of vaccination has increased in the district in the last 10 days, the minister said. "It is true that people were a bit reluctant about taking the second dose, but now after the recent developments (Omicron), the pace of vaccination has increased and queues are being witnessed outside the vaccination centres," Pawar said, adding the focus needs to be on rural areas. "Doctors in the (state) task force (on Covid-19) have advised that we have to administer the second dose at the earliest and if we become successful in that, the situation will be good," he said. The state government has received a list of over 4,500 passengers travelling to Pune district from abroad, Pawar said. "The search is on for these passengers. Passengers are being contacted, their information related to their health is being recorded," he said. Currently, the Covid-19 positivity rate in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits and Pune rural is 1.4 per cent, while in the Pimpri-Chinchwad region, it is 0.7 per cent, Pawar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/5-of-7-omicron-patients-in-pune-test-negative-for-covid-19-maharashtra-dy-cm-101639128079708.html

10-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board institutes new billing system. Here are key pointers||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has instituted new water consumption rules in the national capital under which no consumer can be charged more than 1.5 times the amount of the bill in the previous month.According to DJB minister Satyendar Rai, an automatic system has been put in place to self-regulate the meter reader's tablet when consumption variance goes 50 per cent higher or lower compared to the previous month's bill. Such a system will strengthen the revenue management system of the board, the minister said.“Now your bill cannot be more than 1.5 times that of the previous month. If it exceeds this, an explanation will be provided to the customer, and he or she may file a complaint. The board will be accountable and responsible for any errors,” Satyendar Jain said in a statement on Thursday.In cases where the current month's bill varies 50 per cent higher or lower than that of the month previous, the new water consumption bill will only be generated by the zonal revenue office once the meter reading image confirms the consumption.“This step will curb the erroneous reading bills that were being generated,” the minister was quoted as saying in the statement.Moreover, to keep a vigil on the water billing system, revenue officers will be conducting random meter reading image audits. These “meter inspector” officials will make personal visits to the site and recheck the images of the meter readings to ensure that the readings are not improper or incorrect. In case it is found that certain incorrect images are being fed, the inspectors have been authorised to take strict against the concerned meter readers.According to HT's sister publication Live Mint, there are currently about 900 meter readers taking readings of about 26.50 lakh consumers in 41 zones in Delhi categorised by the DJB. Of these, only about 18 lakh consumers avail zero bills under Delhi's free water scheme.As per Delhi minister Satyendar Jain, the new rotation system for meter reading in Delhi will make the billing system “stronger and more transparent”. Under this new system, the meter readers will be changed every billing cycle, thus cutting any potential loopholes or discrepancies regarding the existing readers.“This will lead to the smooth functioning of the system and will eradicate any type of corruption involved,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-institutes-new-billing-system-here-are-key-pointers-101639107671784.html

10-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Where art meets veggies||The plastic container, filled with neatly stacked green shimla mirch, is defying gravity by clinging to the wall. Little plastic packets, containing corn, are hooked along the wall like a caravan. The bitter karelas, on the other side, are arranged in stand-up position inside another gravity-defying container. And then there are laukis, hanging in front of the counter like a row of chandeliers in a hotel lobby.This has to be one of Delhi’s most eye-catching vegetable stalls. The veggies are arranged artistically. Clearly, great amount of thought has gone into the execution of the display. Of course, it is worth sending a shout-out to many other stalls as well, whose owners deck up their products with care, love and attractive layouts.Tajuddin Vegetable Shop in central Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin, however, takes the art of showcasing vegetables to greater sophistication. The effect is so intense that the awestruck spectator is convinced that the person behind the exhibit is an aesthete of high order. With some shyness, veggie seller Mohsin Qureshi confesses, “I built the new arrangement ahista, ahista (slowly, slowly), over several days.” The slim man, in his 30s, is seated on a chair behind the stall’s counter. Dressed in a black jacket and a cap, he gestures towards his elder brother standing on the street, after whom the establishment is named. Tajuddin founded the shop about 25 years ago, here on the intersection of three narrow by-lanes beside the Nal Wali Masjid.The shop’s new look is a month old. Tajuddin notes that almost every visitor is gushing at the decoration. “When people stop by to get gaajar, mooli or tamatar, they just want to rush back home. And then they gradually start to notice...”Mr Mohsin recalls the intense admiration of his close friends. “Akbar, who runs a restaurant in the Basti; Shanu, who is a businessman; Feroze, who has a job in Lajpat Nagar… they all gave full marks to my styling.” Tajuddin says his younger brother has an innate sense of elegance. Mr Mohsin shows mobile phone photos of his home (located close-by on “Karim Hotel Wali lane”) in which he recently made alterations to a room. A new mirror stands out, consisting of a series of smaller mirrors.The two brothers have six married sisters. They visit their mother every Sunday. Since they prefer to stay in purdah, they haven’t actually seen the shop’s new appearance. “Last Sunday, I did a video call with all of them and showed the dukaan,” says Mr Mohsin. The sisters gushed over the props.Indeed, every person interested in how artists rustle out art from the ordinariness of their everyday life ought to visit this stall. It’s open daily from 6am to 10pm. Watch out for the peacock feathers crowning a bunch of lettuce leaves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-where-art-meets-veggies-101639089840655.html
10-12-2021||Delhi||HC pulls up SDMC over inaction against hawking||The Delhi high court on Thursday pulled up officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) for their failure to prevent unauthorised hawking in Nehru Place and instead “complaining” to the court about vendors not complying with orders.A bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla said it was “astonished” and “surprised” that an SDMC officer was telling the court about the violation of its orders to keep the Nehru Place area free of hawkers, instead of taking action himself.The court, which was hearing a batch of petitions concerning vending in the area, took exception to an affidavit filed by the SDMC, which said that certain vendors were “occupying much larger space” than mandated and were regularly flouting restrictions with impunity. The affidavit was filed in a related contempt case.“We are astonished. Are these people powerless? Don’t they have any power? Why are they complaining to us? We should be complaining to them.. What is he (officer) doing? He is the person at the ground level…What sort of affidavit is this? Is this some joke or what? They are supposed to ensure compliance. Does he want to work or does he want us to retire him.. He is saying he can’t do anything? What is he getting salary for? He doesn’t want to act.. He is at the ground level,” the bench observed.During the hearing, the counsels for SDMC claimed that the erring vendors were not complying with the restrictions concerning the time of vending as well, it further noted. The court remarked that while the SDMC official was “telling us the truth”, he had to take action at the ground level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-pulls-up-sdmc-over-inaction-against-hawking-101639089587445.html

He has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA.He was also arrested in another case under UAPA and sedition for his alleged speeches at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to cut off Assam and the rest of the northeast from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharjeel-gets-bail-in-jamia-case-101639088295882.html

Now that Delhi is likely to have clearer skies the minimum temperatures will remain around 7-8°C,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services.He added that heavy snowfall in parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir played their part in reducing Delhi’s mercury.“Delhi has been receiving consistent winds from the northwest. Since there has been heavy snowfall in parts of Himachal Pradesh, J&K and Uttarakhand, colder winds from there are helping bring down the temperatures,” he said.Owing to the cloud cover over the city for much of the month, Delhi has so far this December been warmer than normal, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The minimum temperature has oscillated between 10-12°C over the last week, and on December 5, it rose to 15°C (three above normal).And while clear skies helped keep the city’s pollution levels in the ‘poor’ zone on Thursday, they did increase marginally from the previous day, showed recordings from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) rose to 289 on Thursday, from 237 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.Forecasts said that they air is likely to worsen on Friday.“The air quality over Delhi is likely to deteriorate marginally but remain in poor to lower end of very poor category owing to slow wind speed.

The Delhi Jal Board will be held accountable and responsible for any errors,” Jain said.A DJB official said that there will be a system check to stop billing from meter reader tablets if consumption variance is over 50% higher or lower in comparison to the previous bill.“Directions have been issued that a bill with more than 50% variance will be generated by the zonal revenue office only after confirmation of consumption, according to the meter reading image. A daily meter reading image audit on a random basis will be done by revenue officers. In case of improper images, the senior inspectors will re-check the site and in case of a variation, action will be taken against meter reader,” official said.A government official stated that grievances were received by the officials wherein the meter readers either do not upload a picture of the current meter reading or upload a random image and put a reading as deemed fit by them. “Under current system, this exercise has no check until a consumer lodges a complaint about the same,” official added.Delhi Jal Board employs 900-meter readers who are authorised to take readings of about 2.65 million consumers under 41 zones of the city.About 1.8 million consumers avail zero-bills under the 20 kilolitre free water scheme, the agency says.

The union has been protesting at Chhat light points on Airport road since December 6. The protest march once again caused a huge traffic jam, stretching up to 3km on one side of the Airport Road. The protestors were stopped at Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan in Sohana. Mohali police had already made arrangements for diverting the traffic from Chhat traffic lightpoint to other possible roads but could not avoid the jam. District vice-president of the union, Amandeep Singh said, “During the 2017 assembly elections, all truck unions in the state were dissolved by the Congress government, then led by CM Captain Amarinder Singh. As now there is a Congress government led by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, we demanded that Channi government restore the unions.

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh slipped in Swachh Rankings under BJP: Alka Lamba||Congress trained guns on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with the city beautiful slipping sharply in the Swachh Survekshan rankings.Releasing the “chargesheet” against the BJP’s six-year rule in the MC on Thursday, the Congress made “poor” solid waste management as the main thrust of its takedown of the BJP’s performance in last six years.The chargesheet also includes 15 point-by-point report card on BJP vision document ‘Sankalp Patra’ of last election.Alka Lamba, national spokesperson of AICC, said, “The city is no longer being seen as ‘city beautiful’ with its ranking slipping to 66th spot.” During its previous 14-year tenure at MC, the Congress made Chandigarh a top city with world class roads, exquisite parks, and good quality of life for its citizens, asserted Alka.On BJP state president Arun Sood’s claims that poor solid waste management was a Congress legacy, the Congress city chief Subhash Chawla, said, “This is standard BJP practice to blame others for its failures. How many times has the BJP penalised the company running the waste processing plant if it was working properly! I challenge Sood for an open debate on the issue.”The Congress also attacked the BJP on the financial position of the MC.“The BJP increased taxes on water, sewerage and property tax. In fact, the sewerage tax at 30% of the water bill is the highest such tax in the country. Despite a huge increase in the taxes, the revenue earnings of the Corporation have gone down drastically in last four years,” said Chawla.“The central government grants to the city have come down significantly. This shows that the BJP government in Delhi is simply not interested in the growth and welfare of the city,” added Chawla.On the Aam Admi Party, Lamba, said, “The Aam Admi Party (AAP) is the B-team of the BJP and it’s trying to damage the Congress only at BJP’s behest. BJP is using money, fear of investigation agencies to create such b-teams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-slipped-in-swachh-rankings-under-bjp-alka-lamba-101639084124100.html

10-12-2021||Gurugram||Right-wing groups double down on namaz protest, Muslims dig in heels||The Gurugram Police and the district administration are on high alert as Muslim groups on Thursday reiterated that they will offer namaz on Friday at all 37 designated sites, and the Hindu outfits planned to disrupt them and hold religious functions at those places.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said no one will be allowed to disturb peace in the city, and take law and order into their hands. Gurugram Police said at least five police stations were “on alert” and have been assigned duties for Friday.“We have elaborate security arrangements and will ensure the safety and security of people offering namaz,” Garg said.Rajender Kumar, assistant commissioner of police, said the police will ensure no confrontation will take place at spots where trouble is expected.“More than 100 policemen are deployed at suspected spots, and we will ensure that no confrontation takes place,” he said.Right-wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram since 2018. The same year, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, in November, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing outfits continued to protest and disrupt prayers. The Muslim groups have maintained that they were forced to use public spaces since there were not enough mosques in the city.Hindu Sena members on Thursday said they will organise a “bhajan programme” at the Sector 37 site on Friday, and have invited people to join them. They said they were planning to park cars and trucks all over the ground.Praveen Yadav, a member of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, said nobody will be allowed to offer namaz at the Sector 37 site. “The ground belongs to Khandsa village and no outsider will be allowed to encroach it. The majority of Muslims coming to offer prayers here are from Bangladesh and do not even have any identification card. They are being brought here to disrupt the peace in the city,” he said.Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson for the Gurgaon Muslim Council, said the Muslims in Gurugram will offer namaz at all 37 sites, and the administration will be responsible for their safety. “If any right-wing Hindu outfit threatens us, or tries to confront us, it will be the responsibility of administration and police to ensure our safety. We will visit the sites only to offer namaz, and it is our right. If other groups want to give it a communal colour, they should be booked and action should be taken against those creating nuisance,” he said.Members of the Hindu outfits added that they will protest at the Sector 44 site.Meanwhile, members of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti and the Muslim Rashtriya Manch with the deputy commissioner to chalk out a plan for Friday.Mahavir Bhardwaj, state president of Samiti, said, “The matter has been resolved as Gurugram Imam Sanghathan has agreed not to offer namaz in the open and people who have vested interests are trying to politicise the issue. Those offering namaz in public places will be held responsible if any untoward incident is reported from that site (Sector 37),” he said.Khurshid Rajaka, coordinator of Gurugram Imam Sanghathan, who is also the national convener of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said they have planned to offer prayers at six sites such as Shyam Chowk, Shankar Chowk , Huda land opposite Spicejet office in Udyog Vihar, Golf course, Leisure valley and Huda land in Sector 69. .The Gurugram Muslim Council has maintained that the Muslim Rashtriya Manch was colluding with the Hindu outfits, and did not represent the Muslims in the city.
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: PAU’s protest snowballs into political issue||The protest by Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU) Daily Paid Labour (DPL) union, contractual employees’ union and teachers’ associations snowballed into a political issue, with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal addressing protesters during a visit on Thursday.In his address, Grewal assured the SAD/BSP-combine, if elected to power, would revise the pay scales and put into motion a process for permanent recruitments. Grewal, who has visited protesters in the afternoon, empathised with the DPL employees, saying “It is not possible to run a house in ₹7000. Some of them are working for nearly 15 to 20 years on the same pay scale.” “Sadly, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who claims to be a common man, could not see the plight of these workers. The government should look into their plight and increase wages. Some provision has to be made to accommodate them and increase their pay scale to ₹21,000. Else the SAD/ BSP government will get their pay scale revised,” he added. Grewal meets teachers’ associationsGrewal later met with protesting members of the Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisations (PFUCTO), also listening to their demands. The development took place a day after cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu persuaded Harmeet Singh Kingra, the president of the PFUCTO and the PAU Teachers’ Association, to end his seven-day-long hunger strike. Ashu had also requested the protesting teachers to end their strike, after giving them assurances of raising their demands of regularisation and increment in salaries in the next cabinet meeting. The protesters, however, refused to cede until an official notification was issued announcing the same. Fissures emerge between protesting unionsFissures between the DPL union and the contractual employees’ union, who have displayed a united front so far, also became increasingly apparent following mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu’s December 7 visit. A faction of contractual employees, led by Jagwinder Singh Grewal, have abstained from the protest site over the last two days. Sandhu had given assurances on taking up the issue of hiring contractual staff for 500 vacant posts of the university, while retaining the DPL staff on contractual basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianapaus-protest-snowballs-into-political-issue-101639083822764.html

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu: Farooq Abdullah decries use of religion for political objectives||Without naming the BJP, National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah on Thursday decried the machinations of playing religious card for furthering political objectives, saying “they always see religion in danger whenever elections are around the corner”. “Lord Rama or almighty Allah can never be in danger, the politicians may be,” he said while addressing a day-long convention of party’s SC Cell here this afternoon. He said religion is not to divide the people but to serve humanity and do well for all. Dividing and discriminating against the people in the name of religion is exploitation that has to be opposed. He expressed anguish over Scheduled Castes still being discriminated against in most parts of the country and deprived of their rights. Though a change has taken place due to reservation as a result of which the community can take pride in producing good doctors and engineers, the backwardness and economic deprivation are still continuing, he said. He exhorted the community to unite and take sagacious decisions during elections so that their elected public-spirited representatives can bring about the desired transformation in their socio-economic and political emancipation. He said the National Conference has always espoused the cause of the community and ensured their participation in decision-making by getting their representatives in the Legislative Council. He regretted that the conditions of the Scheduled Castes have not improved despite the nation getting Independence nearly 75 years ago “I urge the SC community to unite under the banner of the National Conference to ensure their overall growth and progress”, he said and exhorted them to identify honest representatives who can be mandated for elections. He said elections are going to be held and it is only a matter of time. He also referred to the poverty and exploitation of the poor over seven decades ago, saying it was his party that took pioneering and revolutionary measures by making tillers owners of the landholding they were toiling with their sweat and blood. Reiterating his concern about curbs to the media for reporting freely and objectively, Dr Abdullah wondered over the government response that nothing like this is happening or any order having been issued to impose curbs on the media. He said this is yet another lie being spread by the government as the mediapersons know what they face for writing the truth, which at times is against the interest of the executive. He said editors of some media houses have told him what they are made to face for writing the truth. Farooq also reiterated that the people of Jammu and Kashmir will peacefully seek restoration of their snatched rights. He said the people are yearning for getting their rights back. Earlier two minutes of silence was observed as a mark of respect for CDS General Bipin Rawat, his wife and other ranks who died on Wednesday in a tragic helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-farooq-abdullah-decries-use-of-religion-for-political-objectives-101639083525396.html

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Dysfunctional waste plant of Chandigarh is Congress’ legacy: Arun Sood||Listing the achievements of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the last six years, the party’s state president Arun Sood on Thursday dismissed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s “guarantees” as poll gimmicks and blamed Congress for the dysfunctional waste processing plant.Sood, along with senior party leader Satyapal Jain and mayor Ravi Kant Sharma, presented the “report card” of the party’s performance in last six years. All mayors in the last six years were from the saffron party. The party also has 20 councillors in the outgoing MC house.The party has prepared a 28-page booklet listing its more than 50 achievements in different socio-development areas. It plans to distribute three lakh copies among the city’s electorates.On its failure to deliver on promises to resolve lal dora issue and regularisation of violations in Chandigarh Housing Board houses, Sood, said, “For lal dora, we are coming with a land pooling policy. We have not allowed a single demolition in the CHB violation cases and are working to resolve it.”Coming under severe criticism from the opposition parties for “poor” solid waste management in the city, Sood, said, “The dysfunctional waste processing plant is a legacy of Congress’s misrule. We are now rectifying the situation, and all set to upgrade it as per IIT Ropar’s report. Congress leaders had even gone to Europe for ‘studying the technology” but in the end signed a one-sided contract in favour of the private company with no exit clause. The city is paying price for Congress’s mistakes.”On the Dadumajra garbage dump, Sood said, 45% of the legacy waste has been removed.AAP’s free water promise will cost residents moreAttacking AAP, which is contesting its first MC polls in the city, Sood, said, “The party is promising 20,000 litre free water, which in Chandigarh costs ₹20 per month. But, as per their Delhi Model, rate slab sharply surges after 20,000 litre, it costs ₹24 per kilolitre. So, by giving a relief of ₹20, they want to burden the people with ₹400.”On AAP’s promise of installing CCTV cameras across the city, Sood, said, “In Delhi, they have installed 1,800 CCTVs, but in Chandigarh we have already installed more than 2,000 smart cameras.”

The driver of the truck was arrested on Thursday afternoon.The couple were identified as Manish Sharma (37) and Kshipra Joshi (32), who died a day after their wedding anniversary, which they celebrated at Sharma’s brother house in Rajasthan’s Bhiwadi, according to a friend of theirs.Joshi was a homemaker, and Sharma worked as a legal consultant with a private firm.They were returning home to Noida from Bhiwadi with their daughter Mishika when the accident took place on Ring Road, near the Hyatt Regency in RK Puram, the police said.A hydraulic crane was deployed at the spot to help with rescue efforts, after personnel from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) and police failed to free the couple and the child from the car, which was practically flattened.The rescue teams used gas cutters to cut the mangled car and rescue the three occupants.All three were taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where the couple succumbed to their injuries, said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma.He said that around midnight, the RK Puram police station received a call reporting the accident.A police team reached the spot and found that the dumper toppled onto the car after hitting a divider. The driver of the truck fled after the accident.“A case was registered and the driver arrested in the afternoon (Thursday) following raids at his possible hideouts,” said the DCP.The truck driver told the police that he had turned his vehicle to the right side of the road when another vehicle attempted to overtake it.The speeding truck then hit the divider, due to which the driver lost control and his truck fell onto the car, which was moving parallel to it on the left.“The front of the car was badly crushed. Since the couple was seated on the front seats, they were severely hurt, while their daughter was on the backseat and survived. The girl was also admitted to the hospital but was discharged after being administered immediate medical attention,” said a police officer.Sharma’s friend, Vivek Pathak, said a passerby used Sharma’s cellphone to contact a friend and inform them of the mishap. The friend, Nitin, then informed Sharma’s family, said Pathak.Meanwhile, traffic on the carriageway was disturbed for nearly an hour, and the police opened up the service lane as an alternate route.Normalcy was restored on the main carriageway around 1am, said senior police officers who were present at the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-dead-child-hurt-as-truck-topples-on-car-101639083243218.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Railway police short on staff despite security threats||After receiving a series of threats from the ISI and a few national rebel groups, the Northern Railways has decided to step up security measures at stations. The latest move, however, has brought to fore the lack of manpower with the Government Railway.The jurisdiction for the local GRP troops stretches from Sahnewal to Goraya and from Ludhiana to Nanaksar. Thirty-four personnel, divided into 17 patrol teams, have so far been deputed.“We have a staff of around 50 people but many security personnel remain busy with administrative and legal work including PO Staff, headquarters Staff, summoning staff, naib court, etc. We somehow manage to depute a total of 17 patrolling teams but the area is so vast that we require more strength,” an official, who did not wish to be named, said.A senior GRP official rued the government’s indifferent attitude towards security measures. “We keep getting threats from ISI and even from rebel groups in the country including those active in Kashmir. After a recent grenade blast near the Pathankot army camp and even after the tiffin bomb incident in Amritsar, we were asked to alert our forces but no one bothered to fill the vacancies here. After people retire, the government should immediately recruit someone so that we can work with higher efficiency”, the official said.He further added that the rules mandate the patrolling staff to work in three shifts of eight hours each, but due to the shortage in staff, senior officials have been forced to extend the shifts to up to twelve hours.He also highlighted the problems being faced by the security personnel in managing the massive footfalls at railway platforms.The GRP and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Wednesday held a meeting with the local senior section engineer (SSE) to ensure better coordination. The security forces requested the engineering staff, including the railway gangmen, to stay alert while working at the tracks.“The meeting was aimed at ensuring better coordination between the security forces and the railway staff deputed on tracks. They can immediately alert us in case they witness any suspicious activity on the railway tracks. We need to be more careful in winters amid fog”, an official said.

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Omicron begins to cast shadow over Himachal tourism industry||Badly hit during the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the tourism industry which has started to recover again fears losses due to the emerging Omicron variant as tourists have started to cancel their advance bookings. Though Himachal hasn’t reported a single case of Omicron infection, the tourism industry is anticipating tough times.After two years were lost to the pandemic, people involved in the travel and hospitality sectors were expecting good business this winter season. However, they are seeing their hopes being dashed again.“Tourism was the worst hit in the last two years due to the pandemic. The industry was slowly coming back on track in the last two months but now the new variant has created a fear among tourists and we are also worried it would hit our business,” said Sanjay Sood, president of Shimla Hoteliers’ Association.He said tourists have started to cancel their advance bookings as the variant has been reported in India also.This would not only hurt the business but also result in job loss as it happened during the first and second wave, he said.“Tourism in Himachal is the worst-hit sector. We were gradually on the path of recovery but the Omicron threat has made the visitors wary now,” said MK Seth, president, Himachal Pradesh Tourism Stakeholders Association.Meanwhile, tourists coming to Himachal are also extra cautious after the Omicron cases reported in Delhi.“We have come from Karnataka. We were also scared before travelling but we decided to come here,” said Amit Kumar, a tourist from Mumbai.“Local residents have an impression that the tourists must be carrying the virus. However, we are taking extra care while travelling,” he said.Tourism is said to be the backbone of Himachal’s economy. The sector contributes ₹12,000 crores to the state’s economy annually which is 7% of Himachal’s GDP.Before the Covid-19 outbreak, roughly two crore tourists, domestic and foreign, would visit Himachal every year.In 2020, the number dropped to around 32 lakh. This year the number was expected to rise, but the new variant has created a scare among the industry people.As per the tourism department data, the state has nearly 6,000 registered hotels, homestays and guest houses state.

Many bookings have also been cancelled. We have already suffered a lot due to Covid. There is a fear among people that it may result in another lockdown which means no business and jobs loss,” he added.

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Non-local snatchers, robbers giving cops a run for their money||Despite expending energy and resources in keeping tabs on known Ludhiana-based snatchers, petty thieves and robbers, police are often blindsided by inter-district gangs, which hop from one city to the next, giving the cops a run for their money. Cops say the umpteen means of transportation and easy movement between the cities are to blame. They are drafting out a plan of action to strengthen security at entry and exit points to the city. “It has been observed that the culprits are repeat offenders, already facing trial in criminal cases in different cities. As they are already under the scanner of the police in a particular city, they move to other places and flee after committing the crime,” says commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar.The commissioner says that small-time criminals meet gangsters in jail, where they form their own small gangs. “After getting bail, they execute crimes in new cities, with the help of their local aides,” he says, while adding that the accused usually stay in rented accommodations in the city for a short span of time. On what is the way out, Bhullar says, “We will request the court to increase the security deposit needed to bail out the accused. We will also initiate action against people who do not get their tenants verified by the police, which allows them to hide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-non-local-snatchers-robbers-giving-cops-a-run-for-their-money-101639082802345.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Farmer agitation called off: Khaps in Jind revoke decision to boycott BJP-JJP leaders||After the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of various farm unions, on Thursday announced to end their over-a-year-long agitation and vacate the protest sites from Saturday, the farmers’ and khap leaders camping at Jind’s Khatkar toll plaza also decided to revoke their decision of boycotting the entry of rulling BJP-JJP leaders in their villages.Azad Palwan, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU)’s Jind president, said after the SKM formally announced to suspend the agitation, they had also decided to revoke their decision of boycotting the entry of ruling party leaders in their villages.“Thousands of farmers from Jind will visit the Delhi borders to take part in the Vijay Diwas on Saturday and others will celebrate the victory at Khatkar toll plaza. Now, we have no problem with the BJP-JJP leaders. They can visit the district and take part in political, social or government programmes. We have no personal enmity with them,” he added. Jind district, which falls in the heart of Haryana, emerged as the central point of farmer agitation. BKU spokesman Rakesh Tikait also addressed his first rally after the Republic Day violence at Jind’s historical Kandela village in February. The khaps and farmers had announced to boycott the entry of BJP-JJP leaders in their villages and due to this Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala failed to visit his constituency, Uchana Kalan, during the year-long period. The farmers had also uprooted the helipad area earlier when Dushyant was expected to take part in a social programme at Uchana, following which he cancelled his visit.Satbir Singh Pahalwan, head of Khera khap, said the khaps had always stood by every section of society during difficult times.“Most of the people in rural areas are dependent on agriculture and we backed them during the year-long stir. We had taken several measures, including social boycott of BJP-JJP leaders during this time. As we won the battle, now we announce to revoke our decision of banning ruling party leaders’ entry in the villages,” he added.Sikkim Devi, a prominent farmer leader from Jind, said women had played a huge role in the success of the year-long agitation.“Our langar sewa would be continued until all farmers reached safety at their homes. This agitation will be known for the unity of youths, aged, women and children. We had broken the boundaries of bad relations with Punjab farmers over the issue of the Satluj-Yamuna link. The opponents attempted various strategies to weaken our agitation but it stood solid like a rock,” she added.Farmers start packing goods at Tikri, SinghuThe farmers camping at Singhu and Tikri borders have started packing up their trolleys, trucks, cars after the SKM announced to leave the protest sites on Saturday after the Union government accepted their demands. The protesters also celebrated their victory by chanting slogans after the SKM announced to suspend the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmer-agitation-called-off-khaps-in-jind-revoke-decision-to-boycott-bjp-jjp-leaders-101639082706031.html

She said corruption was at its peak in the recruitment boards, but the government failed to take required steps to deal with it and provide relief to aspirants.“The BJP-JJP have lost ground in the state as people of every section of society are suffering due to their wrong policies. The Congress will continue to raise the issues pertaining to the general public,” Choudhury said during her visit to Karnal.She said the party will move an adjournment motion on the issue of corruption in the upcoming Assembly session.

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||JJP’s show of strength in Hooda’s stronghold Jhajjar||Aiming to expand its political base across Deswali and Ahirwal belts of Haryana, the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) held a public rally at Jhajjar’s Dadri Toye village on Thursday to mark its third foundation day. Eyeing Jat votes, JJP showed its strength in former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s stronghold Jhajjar, where Congress had won all four seats in the 2019 assembly pollsHaryana deputy chief minister and JJP’s main face Dushyant Chautala presented the list of works done by the BJP-JJP government in two years, while his father and JJP national convener, Ajay Chautala, lambasted Hooda, and his estranged brother and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Singh Chautala. Except Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam, who has differences with Dushyant, JJP’s nine legislators attended the rally. Wrestler Geeta Phogat, elder sister of BJP leader Babita Phogat, also shared the stage with Badra MLA Naina Chautala.‘PM won farmers’ hearts’Addressing the gathering, Dushyant thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for repealing the three farm laws and said with this decision he had won farmers’ hearts.“December 9 is a historical day. We formed the JJP on this day, the Constitution’s first meeting was also held on December 9, 1946, and now the farmers’ have also announced to suspend their agitation on this day. The opposition parties tried to dismantle the state’s atmosphere during the farmers’ stir, but the public has shown intelligence in maintaining peace and harmony,” he added.Listing works done by the BJP-JJP government for the welfare of farmers, Dushyant said they had increased mandis for wheat and paddy procurement amid the Covid-19 second wave.“During Congress’s time, farmers had to wait for a month to get payment of their crop from the commission agents, while our government has been transferring the amount in farmers’ accounts after 72 hours of procurement. If we fail to pay them on time, our government is giving them a 9% rate of interest on the dues,” he said.Stating that the government had fulfilled 40% of promises being listed in the manifesto, the deputy chief minister said pensions had been increased by ₹500 in 500 days. “We ensured 75% reservation for Haryana youths in state’s private jobs. Our government has also ensured 50% reservation for women in panchayat raj and free travel pass for girls in roadways and private buses, which have a government permit,” he said.“If any bus operator charges fare from school- and college-going girls, make a video of the incident and I will cancel the permit of that bus,” he added.Ajay Chautala slams Hooda, AbhayJJP patriarch Ajay Chautala slammed leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his estranged brother and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala, who is also the Ellenabad MLA.“Hooda had grabbed farmers’ land at minimal rates and sold them at high rates to property dealers. He did nothing during his 10-year tenure. Few days ago, his pappu son (Deepender) said the Union government had shifted the airport site from Haryana to another state. I want to ask him what he and his father did in this regard. Dushyant brought the airport to Hisar for the state’s development,” he claimed.“Earlier, Chautala sahab (OP Chautala) did not want to talk to INLD’s current state president, Nafe Singh Rathee, and former Badli MLA Naresh Sharma had spoken ill about the INLD chief. But now both are roaming with him (Abhay). I can say that he (Abhay) can’t hold the party together. His tall claims were exposed in the Ellenabad bypoll where he won by a thin margin,” the JJP chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jjps-show-of-strength-in-hooda-s-stronghold-jhajjar-101639082694825.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Fortified rice: Tender allotment to Maharashtra firms under lens in Haryana||Serious anomalies pointing to cartelisation have come to light in the allotment of tenders to three Maharashtra-based companies, selected to supply about 14,700 metric tonnes (MT) of fortified rice kernel (FRK) in 11 Haryana districts during the 2021-22 kharif marketing season.Cartelisation happens when a group of independent companies join hands to control production, sale and prices of commodities to obtain monopoly and limit competition.The fortification initiative is an outcome of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s August 15 announcement that rice fortified with micronutrients will be made available at ration shops, for mid-day meal and every scheme by 2024.Rice fortification adds micronutrients like iron, folic acid and Vitamin B12. It is aimed at combating anaemia due to malnutrition, and is regarded as a cost effective, preventive and effective strategy to address the nutrition problem, as per the NITI Aayog. Common partner for three companies Bid documents show that the three Maharashtra-based companies, which individually won the bids for supply for 14,700 MT fortified rice had a common consortium partner, Rana Milk Foods Pvt Ltd. Perusal of the consortium agreements made by the three successful bidders (Maharashtra companies) – Nirav Silk Mills, Alkey Synthetics and Virag Enterprises – shows that Rana Milk Foods was made a part of the consortium by all three companies for the purpose of bidding and execution of work thereafter.This despite the fact that all three companies had given sworn undertakings that they had not formed any partnership, joint venture or consortium, directly or indirectly, with any other party for the purpose of participating or executing the FRK tender. ‘Tender to be rejected in case of cartelisation’ As per clause 4 (iv) of the terms and conditions of the tender, the Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department will reject the tender and forfeit the earnest money in case of any clear indication of cartelisation.The clause also stipulates that if the information given by the tenderers in the tender document and its annexure is found to be incorrect at any stage, the department will disqualify or terminate the contract.FRK Manufacturers Association vice-president Anuj Bansal alleged that it was a clear case of cartelisation. “The three firms have been favoured in the tendering process. Haryana-based firms which have installed extruder machines at high costs could not even participate in the bids as the department changed the criteria of annual turnover of at least ₹65 crore each in past three years to annual turnover of ₹10 crore for fortified food products in past two year. We are new entities in the fortified food trade. How can we have an annual turnover of ₹10 crore in this sector?’’ Bansal asked. Association’s president Ram Niwas alleged that the tender process was designed to allocate tenders to selected firms. “The government has allotted tenders to the firm which had offered about ₹59.64 plus GST per kg for supplying fortified rice. But the Haryana-based firms were ready to give the same quality rice at ₹45-50 per kg,” said Ramesh Midha, a member of the association.Tendering process fair, no irregularity, says director Director general, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, Vijay Dahiya, when asked about Rana Milk Foods figuring in all three consortiums and other irregularities, said the technical committee that examined the documents submitted by the bidders had found all papers in order. “The terms and conditions were changed on the basis of pre-bid consultations. Substantive changes were made on the basis of demands and discussion with prospective bidders,’’ Dahiya said. He further said that the FRK tender was allotted after taking into account the lowest bid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fortified-rice-tender-allotment-to-maharashtra-firms-under-lens-in-haryana-101639082690703.html

The central point of all principles of Gita is to make man aware of his duties and the main purpose of Gita is to give a message to a person not to deviate from the path of duty in all circumstances.”“Gita is not a holy book of one religion, but is a unique universal inspiration for the welfare of all living beings. Whenever we stray from the path or we are in confusion, the guidance from Gita helps us,” he added.Devvrat said Gita was the essence of the Vedas. “The cure for all evils like lust, anger, attachment and greed is in the Gita. Gita is a religious book as well as a philosophy of life, adopting which any nation can develop itself.”Education minister Kanwar Pal and minister of state for sports and youth affairs Sandeep Singh were also present on the occasion, along with Kurkshetra MP Nayab Saini and religious leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gita-is-a-unique-universal-inspiration-for-welfare-of-humanity-says-haryana-governor-101639082682825.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Domicile reservation in private industries: HC asks Haryana why law should not be stayed||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday asked the Haryana government as to why law on domicile-based 75% reservation in private industries in the state should not be stayed. The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli acted on the plea of the Faridabad Industries Association, demanding that the law, Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, notified in November, be declared unconstitutional, and rules, if any framed there under, be put in abeyance. The law provides for 75% reservation to local youth in private sector jobs that offer monthly salary of less than ₹30,000. It will come into effect from January 15, 2022, and will be applicable for 10 years. It covers private companies, societies, trusts and partnership firms. The petitioner is a premier industry body in north India, formed in 1952 with 500 members. Their counsel, senior advocate Akshay Bhan, had submitted that the law specifically excludes central government and state government from the purview of its application, thereby creating a situation wherein there was a reservation in private employment, but not in public employment. “Thus, the Act disproportionately places the burden of provision of employment for persons domiciled in the state on private businesses, and the same is contrary to all norms of constitutionality as well as propriety,” he had argued. Bhan had further maintained that the law had failed to take into account the fact that businesses operated in a competitive global economy and that the reason for India’s astronomical growth in the past two decades could largely be attributed to its ability to put to work its highly skilled but cost-effective labour, and provide world-class goods and services at competitive rates. The law is also in violation of Article 16 of the Constitution, which provides that no citizen shall be ineligible for or discriminated against in respect of employment on ground only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them. The state’s response has been sought by January 12, 2022. Meanwhile, another petition filed by the Gurgaon Industrial Association was withdrawn on Thursday to make some changes in the plea. One more petition has been filed by the Rewari Chamber of Commerce and industry on the issue, which is yet to be taken up by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/domicile-reservation-in-private-industries-hc-asks-haryana-why-law-should-not-be-stayed-101639082680635.html

The places where excavation is done beyond above specified limits, the case would be dealt with under the Punjab Minor Mineral Rules (PMMR), 2013, and prevailing guidelines. The brick kiln owners had submitted representations highlighting the problems in obtaining environment clearance besides other issues. Reduced power tariff from Nov 1 It also decided to give relief of ₹3 per unit in power tariff to domestic consumers having sanctioned load up to 7 kW from November 1 instead of December 1. The decision would involve a financial burden of ₹151 crore on the state exchequer. Acceding to the consent of the management of the Government Aided Private School, Public High School, Kukarpind, in Jalandhar district, the cabinet gave the approval to take over of the school by the government in public interest along with all the assets. It also decided to take over Janta High School, Phuldiwal, in the district (private school affiliated to PSEB) which remained closed since 2008.

Addressing rallies in support of the party’s Patiala (rural) candidate Jaspal Singh Bittu Chatha and Nabha nominee Kabir Dass, the SAD chief said, “The SAD-BSP alliance is committed to redress all grievances of the people of Punjab. Also, we have a consistent stand on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue.” “We will not allow the reconstruction of the SYL canal. On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has supported handing over Punjab river waters to Haryana and Delhi,” he added. The Akali Dal has a 100-year history of fighting for the rights of the farmers and the underprivileged sections of society, he claimed. “The AAP is mindlessly copying our 13-point programme for the people of Punjab. Their national convener Arvind Kejriwal promised ₹1,000 per month to all women in the state without taking into consideration whether the well-do actually needed such relief,” he said.Claiming that AAP was trying to befool Punjabis as Capt Amarinder Singh did earlier, he asked Kejriwal to tell as why he had not implemented any of the promises he made here in Delhi.“Once the SAD-BSP alliance government is formed, a criminal case will be registered against former Congress minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot for embezzling crores of rupees meant for distribution to scheduled caste students under the SC scholarship scheme. “Dharamsot was indicted by an additional chief secretary for embezzling ₹69 crore. The scam is actually bigger than this. All those who committed the crime will be punished,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/our-govt-will-take-up-restoration-of-chandigarh-punjabi-speaking-areas-to-state-sukhbirbadal-101639082082789.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt issues order to drown out protest slogans with DJs during CM’s visits||The “common man’s” chief minister, who loves to step out of his vehicle to meet the common man, seems to be bothered by the noise created by protesting organisations on his visits to different parts of the state. The Punjab Police, it seems, have found out a novel way to drown out the noise of protesting employees and unions at the venues of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s functions. An order has been issued to all deputy commissioners and district police heads to arrange DJs to play out loud gurbani/religious songs at the venues of protests during the CM’s visit so that sloganeering becomes inaudible. The orders were issued by the special protection unit of the police, copies of which have been sent to the chief minister’s principal secretary and the director general of police (DGP).“Whenever there is a protest during the CM’s visit to your respective district, religious hymn or songs should be played by installing DJs on the spot so that the voice of protesters’ slogans could not be heard at the venue of the function,” the order read.The order, however, was withdrawn later in the evening after it drew flak, saying its was a clerical error. Inspector general of police (special protection unit) AK Pandey issued a letter to all deputy commissioners, police commissioners and SSPs withdrawing the order. Jakhar, opposition slam move, call it undemocratic Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar attacked the Channi government over the move. He tweeted, “It couldn’t be true! Sacrilegious and a mockery of democracy.” Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said that people have a democratic right to protest or raise their voice for their demands. “The Congress government has exposed itself with these orders.”Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema too condemned the move, saying the government is trying to suppress the voice of people. “But first they must understand that Gurbani teaches one to raise their voice against persecution and oppression,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-issues-order-to-drown-out-protest-slogans-with-djs-during-punjab-cm-s-visits-101639081901770.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Women outnumber men at Punjab CM Channi’s Payal rally||Women in large numbers thronged the venue of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s rally at Payal on Thursday, outnumbering their male counterparts. The womenfolk said they had come with a hope that their long-standing grievances will be resolved. Channi, who addressed his first rally in the area after becoming CM, began his address by acknowledging that the number of women present in the audience was indeed “huge”. “Your number reminds me of ‘melas’ (fairs) where women used to greet and meet each other. My wife is also from a humble background like me. We are not fake like Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal who wants to invade Punjab and make it his home. Why would you want an outsider when the real aam admi is in front of you?” he asked.Punjab was not shamlat (common) land where outsiders can come and rule, he said, taking a jibe at the Delhi CM. “The AAP chief makes tall claims whenever he visits Punjab but the truth is that he is totally ignorant about the ethos, culture or the issues of the state and what it stands for,” Channi added. He listened to grievances of women who flagged inflated power bills. Some raised issues related to property disputes, accusing the police of turning a blind eye to their complaints. Others had issues pertaining to unemployment and not being able to get the benefit of government schemes. One Baljit Kaur started crying over her power supply being snapped in a case of electricity theft. This prompted the CM to stop his speech and call her to the stage. He instructed the deputy commissioner to address her issue. He, however, remarked that there was the possibility of such woman being “planted” by his political rivals. ‘SAD, BJP, Capt have formed troika’ Coming down heavily on his predecessor Captain Amarinder Singh, Channi said he could not achieve anything during his tenure and has now joined hands with the BJP which is inimical to the interests of Punjab. “Amarinder and Sukhbir Badal are befooling the people of Punjab. The reality is that the Shiromani Akali Dal, the BJP and Amarinder have together formed a troika,” he claimed. The SAD indulged in an open loot of the state and it is due to the dictatorial attitude of the Badal family and Majithia that the party has been weakened. “As long as Sukhbir and Majithia are there, the Akali Dal cannot regain its lost ground,” Channi said, adding that the fleet of buses was acquired by the Akali leaders by looting the hard-earned money of people. The sacrilege cases, he said, were being pursued vigorously and the guilty will not be allowed to go scot-free. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said the Congress would not rest as long as the people of Punjab were satisfied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/women-outnumber-men-at-punjab-cm-channi-s-payal-rally-101639081602658.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Calling off farm stir: Main demands met, but confusion remains on some, says KMSC||The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which has a stronghold in Punjab’s Majha region, on Thursday agreed with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)’s decision to call off the protest against the central government against the three farm laws. The organisation, however, pointed out that while their main demands were met, confusion still prevails on some.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint platform of the protesting farmer unions, has announced that it had accepted the Centre’s proposal to resolve pending demands and called off the year-long agitation. KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “Some points in the proposal letter issued by the Centre are not clear. For instance, there is no clarity on fixing minimum support price (MSP) for crops. The central government has not backtracked from going ahead with its agenda of privatising the power sector through the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2021, as it said the step would be taken in consultation with the stakeholders that also include private companies.” “Meeting the demand of withdrawal of the cases registered against the farmers is appreciable, but it is yet to been seen what will happen next. The point on the stubble burning is also satisfactory,” Pandher said, adding that there was no mention of the Lakhimpur Khiri incident in the proposal. Also, there is no mention of the two men arrested on charges of murder in connection with the Lakhimpur Khiri incident and demand of removal of Union minister of state Ajay Mishra, he added. “Even as the demands of the morcha are met, there is no end to the problems of farmers and the common man. Therefore, the struggle for farmers will continue through various means,” the KMSC leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/calling-off-farm-stir-main-demands-met-but-confusion-remains-on-some-says-kmsc-101639081420431.html

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: A multitude of unaddressed problems plague ward 32||Residents of Ward 32, a general ward, which comprises Sectors 44 and 51, have been awaiting a representative to tackle the plethora of issues ailing these areas.The ward earlier also included Colony Number 5, covering parts of Sectors 50 and 51. But it was cleared out in 2013 and its residents were allotted one-room houses under the slum rehabilitation scheme in Dhanas.The vacated land has since remained in a state of neglect. Adarsh Dhingra, a nearby resident, said the land had stayed abandoned for eight years, leading to snakes, littering and foul smell.The road in front of Model Jail in Sector 51 has been in a bad shape for at least three years. The park in front of the jail is also a picture of neglect with huge growth of wild grass.For smooth traffic flow, a makeshift roundabout was set up by the traffic police at an intersection. The barrels used are all rusted now and are not even stationed in a circle, beating its purpose.Sector 51 is also home to several retired cops, who live in the Chandigarh Police Cooperative Housing Society. Society’s president retired deputy superintendent of police (DSP) SC Sagar described their share of problems. “For installing a temporary canopy to keep rain from entering the apartments, retired cops are slapped with huge fines. It is embarrassing to be treated like criminals, when all we have done is protect our house from rain,” he said.Sector 44 forms the bigger part of the ward, but even its residents complain their problems aren’t addressed.President of the Sector 44-B Resident Welfare Association (RWA), Swadesh Talwar said, “Since Sector 44 was separated from Sectors 34 and 35, it has remained neglected. The roads here are crying for repair, while the community centre is in a shambles despite many requests to the authorities.”President of the Sector 44 RWA, Anish Garg added, “Parking remains troublesome, especially in the MIG flats area. Community parking is urgently required here. The next councillor must also tackle the deteriorating law and order situation. Sanitation also requires attention, as heaps of garbage can be seen scattered across the sector.”Shopkeepers in Sector-44 market are also a disenchanted lot. President of the Sector 44-C market association and former president of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Anil Vohra said, “There is only one entrance to the market, where also a vending zone has been set up, leading to chaos. Full-scale dhabas are being run in the vending zone, which the next councillor must take a stand against. The public toilets need to be upgraded, while the corridor in front of the shops requires re-tiling.”Know Your WardGeneral wardVoters: 15,500 votesWard areas: Sector 44 and Sector 51Key issues:Bad roads in the wardArea vacated by razing Colony Number 5 needs to be developedParks and the Sector 44 community centre need better maintenanceLocal voicesThe roads in Sector 44 are in a bad shape.

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Order to curb NCR pollution: Two thermal plants shut, Punjab paying ₹15 crore daily to buy power from grid||With two thermal power plants at Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar ordered to shut their operations till December 15 due to high level of pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is buying electricity at exorbitant rates from the national grid. The state is paying ₹15 crore, including ₹2 crore as transmission charges, to the power exchange daily for the electricity that can be generated at ₹4 per unit in own thermal plants, officials said. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the NCR in its November 26 order had said that the NTPC’s Jhajjar unit, the Rajiv Gandhi Thermal Power Station (RGPTC) at Hisar, the Panipat plant, Talwandi Sabo plant, Nabha Power Ltd, Rajpura, could remain operational. But in a November 30 order, Punjab was asked to keep the Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar plants shut till December 15.The Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) is left with coal for only less than a day and is running at 50% load. As such, the PSPCL has to pay ₹2.25 crore per day as fixed charges to the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) due to non-generation for shortage of coal. According to an Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) order, the private plants get fixed charges if coal shortage is not attributed to them. Also, one of the two units of the Rajpura plant is under maintenance.“Both the Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat plants have coal for 9 and 16 days but have been asked to stop generation by the CAQM. To meet the shortfall, the PSPCL is purchasing more than 400 lakh units per day from the exchange,” admitted a PSPCL official. It was strange that the plants at Jhajjar, Hisar and Panipat, which are located very close to the NCR, were allowed to run whereas plants in faraway places like Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar are barred from generating electricity, he added. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the corporation’s move to purchase power from the grid is not causing any financial loss as prices are equivalent to the electricity produced in Punjab. “It will adversely affect Punjab only if the prices of power at the grid exceed ₹4.5 per unit,” he said.
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh adds 256 Covid deaths to its tally||The Chandigarh health department on Thursday added 256 Covid fatalities to its tally, while stating that the data has been reconciled after matching the figures from the cremation ground. With this, the toll of Chandigarh jumped from 820 to 1,076, surpassing the figures of Mohali (1,073) and Panchkula (379). “The health department was reconciling the figure of Covid-19 deaths with the record maintained at the cremation ground. During the process of reconciliation, it was observed that there was a mismatch of 359 deaths. On the forms of 359 deceased, the cremation ground had mentioned Covid-19 as the cause of death, but there no Covid confirmation certificates from hospitals. The UT government or private hospitals didn’t have any records of these people,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg.These 359 people had died since the pandemic broke out in March 2020.Garg added, “The health department then contacted the families of each of these persons and it was found that 256 deaths, of the 359, were actually the deaths due to the virus, in accordance with the existing guidelines. Also, 22 deaths, which are mentioned as Covid death at cremation ground, could not be proved as there is no document about Covid positivity. However, the remaining 81 deaths either relate to residents of other states or their addresses are incorrect or could not be traced.”It was observed that most of the people, out of the remaining 81, were from neighbouring states, including Punjab and Haryana.Thus, the number of deaths of residents of UT Chandigarh due to Covid-19 will be treated as 1,076 instead of 820, the health department said, adding that the data of these 256 deaths is being added on the portal of the Union ministry of health and family welfare.The health department is still contacting the families of 103 deceased people, (22 people who had no Covid positive report and 81 people with links from other states or remained untraceable). The data is also being shared with the concerned state governments.The UT health secretary also informed that families of these 256 deceased people are now eligible for ex-gratia of ₹50,000 each, which is being given to the next kin of the deceased in accordance with the guidelines of the Union government and Supreme Court.In April this year, Hindustan Times had reported the ‘mismatched’ death tallies of the health department and cremation ground. As per HT’s reports in April, the health department’s official numbers indicated 42 Covid deaths in Chandigarh, but the cremation grounds in the city said the number is as high as 70.In April this year, the tricity had reported 43,068 Covid cases besides 311 fatalities. With 46,245 cases and 790 deaths, May 2021 had proved to be the deadliest for the tricity since the pandemic began in March last year. But following the restrictions on public movement and businesses, the curve started going down.29 kin of Covid-19 deceased get ex-gratiaChandigarh administration received 138 applications for ex gratia assistance as minimum standard relief of ₹50,000 to the next of kin of the deceased who died due to Covid 19. Of them, 29 applicants have got their claim of total ₹14,50,000 via direct benefit transfer mode. Rest of the applications are under process for release of payment.The claimants can submit their application through a form to the sub-divisional magistrate along with specified documents, including a death certificate, certifying the cause of death due to Covid.The claimants can download the application form online from chandigarhdistrict.nic.in19 more test positive in tricityAs many as 19 fresh infections of Covid-19 were reported in the tricity on Thursday, with Mohali recording 12 of them. Four cases were reported from Chandigarh and three from Panchkula. On Wednesday, the tricity’s daily tally was 22. No death was reported on the day, but UT health department had added a backlog of 256 Covid-related deaths. Tricity’s active cases tally rose to 155 on Thursday, with 69 patients still being infected in Mohali, 63 in Chandigarh, and 23 in Panchkula.Chandigarh asks PGI to hand over 20 unused ventilators The UT administration on Thursday asked the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to hand over the 20 PM Cares fund ventilators that were discarded by the institute on grounds that these were ‘unfit’ for patients. The hospital authorities had said there were some technical glitches in the ventilators.UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “All the ventilators received under PM Cares fund have been installed at the government hospitals of Chandigarh. However, there were some technically unfit ventilators with PGIMER and GMCH. The issue was taken up with the Centre and a team had visited to repair these ventilators at GMCH. There are 20 ventilators at PGIMER that have not been put to use till date. We have asked PGI to give us these ventilators so that we can install them in our hospitals after getting them repaired.”The PGI had previously said that the ventilators may not be fit for ventilating critically ill patients, and that these should be checked properly before allowing it to be used on patients due to safety concerns.The technical difficulties discovered while evaluating the quality of ventilators were stated in the reports, including the fact that the prescribed respiratory rate could not be achieved for paediatric patients and that chronic leak of 10 to 20% was seen in adult settings.However, PGIMER director Dr Surjit Singh, said, “The ventilators have technical glitches and we have already sent the complaint to director health services. The UT health department can take back the ventilators from us if they want.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-adds-256-covid-deaths-to-its-tally-101639081060453.html

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Meet the ardent fitness enthusiasts of Chandigarh||Back in 2016, Dr Sunaina Bansal, a gynaecologist, read an article that Denmark was the happiest country in the world primarily owing to its culture of cycling. Immediately, she bought a cycle and started pedalling to her workplace and In 2017, she formed “Cyclegiri”, a group to promote cycling as a mode to get fit. It now has over 1,000 members and organises cycle rides and spreads awareness about achieving fitness through cycling. “I make it a point to use my cycle to go to the hospital I work for atleast four times a week. Chandigarh has many cycle tracks and is an ideal city for long rides.We have also tied up with Chandigarh administration and traffic police on several occasions and organised cyclothons,” said Dr Sunaina. Till last March, Gursimran Sidhu, 39, who is the construction business, led an unhealthy lifestyle where he was constantly travelling and bingeing on junk food. Contracting Covid-19 forced him to think about his health and fitness, which led him to join a group of friends who would run 10km-12km everyday to remain fit. “I had put on lot of weight and wanted to shed it. I started running 10-12km every day and ate healthy for a few months. As a result, I lost 14 kgs and now, running is part of my life,” said Gursimran. Naveen Kumar Tanwar, an income tax officer, became an avid cyclist during the time the pandemic started. As all gyms were closed, he bought a cycle and would go for long rides on every morning. “I started cycling vigorously last year. I enjoyed it so much that I would cycle every day and on weekends, I planned long route rides. As a result, I lost almost 15 kgs of weight and developed a wonderful hobby. I have cut down on the using my car and last weekend , I even cycled to Jalandhar,” said Naveen, 41. With availability of municipal corporation parks, open gyms and the administration-run multi-purpose complexes, there are ample facilities in the city for residents to use. In August, around 150 docking stations were built in Chandigarh where over 1,250 bicycles were made available for public to use under Chandigarh Smart City Limited. Under this scheme more docking stations are to be built with more bicycles to be made available in the future. The city has around 200-km cycle tracks. “We used to conduct many marathons in the tricity before the pandemic hit. But, at the individual level, people are running every day to remain fit. We plan to organise a marathon soon, after things improve,” said Chetan Wadhwa, co-founder of NGO Chandigarh Runners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/meet-the-ardent-fitness-enthusiasts-of-chandigarh-101639080882504.html

10-12-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow jewellery shop loot follow-up: Police suspect involvement of professionals||Criminals who struck at an Aliganj jewellery shop in Lucknow, conducted reconnaissance of different routes, prepared two teams of two members each, and used different routes to escape after committing the crime, said police officials on Thursday.This knowledge has led them to infer that those who committed the loot were a seasoned and professional gang.On Wednesday, unidentified armed miscreants broke into Tirupati Gems and Jewels Pvt Ltd, near Kapoorthala crossing, under the Aliganj police station limits and fled with cash and gold ornaments worth several lakh rupees. The miscreants shot at one Sharavan Kumar, an employee of the shop, when he resisted their bid.A police official privy to the investigation, said that the police had scanned video footage of over two dozen CCTVs installed on different routes heading towards the jewellery shop. He said the video footage analysis suggested that the loot was committed in a well-planned manner.He said four people are suspected to be involved in the crime—two entered the shop while two remained outside the shop to keep a watch on police movement. He said one of them had visited the shop even on Tuesday apparently to collect information about a number of employees, footfall of customers at different times of the day and conducted reconnaissance of different approach and exit routes of the area. “One of the suspects is spotted moving around on Tuesday and even present at the time of the crime on Wednesday,” he said. The official said that the footage also suggests that they worked in two teams comprising two members each. He said one team committed the crime while the other team remained in the background to come in if the first team got trapped while executing their plan. He said the two teams even escaped from the spot by different routes that later merged at the same crossing.“We are trying to ascertain the route towards which they all moved after committing the crime by connecting the dots with the help of video footage available on different routes leaving from Aliganj area,” he explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-jewellery-shop-loot-follow-up-police-suspect-involvement-of-professionals-101639079500184.html

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers end stir: Capt hopes for constructive political environment, resolution of MSP issue||Congratulating farmers over the triumphant culmination of their over year-long agitation against the farm laws, Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday hoped it would pave the way for a more constructive political environment for the progress of the farming community, who constitute the backbone of India’s economic growth and sustainability.In a statement, Amarinder said he is happy the farmers’ fight has reached its logical conclusion and the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments agreed in principle to follow his erstwhile government’s decision in Punjab to compensate the families of farmers who had lost their lives during the agitation. The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government had announced ₹5 lakh in financial aid and a job for one member each of the deceased farmers’ families in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively. He has since quit the Congress and floated his own party.The former CM expressed relief that the agitating farmers, farm labourers and their families will finally be back in the warm comfort of their homes after camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year. He hoped the lingering issue of MSP, for which the Centre had constituted a committee, would also be resolved soon to the satisfaction of the farmers. He further hoped all future legislations and decisions concerning the farming community, which has been at the forefront of India’s progressive march since Independence, would be taken in the spirit of mutual agreement, after due consultation with all the stakeholders.Asserting his party’s unequivocal support for the farmers, Amarinder said that, as in the past, he would continue to do everything in his power to protect their interests and ensure their welfare. He pointed out that as the chief minister of Punjab, he had not only supported the farmers’ fight for the repeal of the farm laws but had ensured that they were not, in any way, harassed even when they were sitting in protest across the state or marching towards Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-end-stir-capt-hopes-for-constructive-political-environment-resolution-of-msp-issue-101639079140900.html

10-12-2021||Chandigarh||UK court turns down India’s appeal to extradite KZF member||The high court in England on Thursday rejected an appeal by Indian authorities seeking permission to appeal against a magistrates’ court order turning down the extradition on human rights grounds of Kuldeep Singh, wanted in India as an alleged senior member of the banned terrorist organisation Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF).Singh, alias Keepa Sidhu, is charged with conspiring with others to commit terror activities in Punjab dating back to 2015-16, including a plot to assassinate then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.The 44-year-old is also accused of recruiting youths in Punjab to the banned KZF organisation by offering them money and organising a meeting of separatists in a gurdwara.District judge Gareth Branston, presiding over the extradition case at Westminster Magistrates’ Court here, ruled in January that as the offences carry maximum sentences and “no possibility of a review of such a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or conditional release”, it would be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.“The district judge’s comprehensive and clearly reasoned judgment cannot be faulted,” high court justices Nicola Davies and Pushpinder Saini said in their judgment, handed down at the Royal Courts of Justice here.“There are no grounds upon which it would be appropriate for this court to interfere with the discretion exercised by the district judge,” they conclude.Singh faces a total of four charges in India, under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act related to raising funds for terrorism, conspiracy and being a member of a terror outfit and of the Arms Act related to firearms offences.The court documents note that he is accused of being a point of contact in Punjab and liaising with the head of the KZF, who was residing in Pakistan, and other co-accused members of the organisation, who lived in Belgium and England.Singh, who entered the UK illegally in 2005, was on immigration bail when he was arrested at Loughborough Immigration Reporting Centre in eastern England in October 2019.In September 2020, the Indian authorities were successful in revoking bail granted to him at the magistrates’ court level.Singh – who used a Punjabi interpreter in court – then remained remanded in judicial custody for the duration of the extradition hearings before District Judge Branston, which concluded in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uk-court-turns-down-india-s-appeal-to-extradite-kzf-member-101639078719902.html
10-12-2021||Other||Disupte over possession of house: HC issues notice to UP dy CM Maurya||In an alleged dispute regarding possession of a house in Kalindipuram Awas Yojna, Prayagraj, the Allahabad high court on Monday issued a notice to UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to file his counter affidavit to the allegations made against him in the petition. A two-judge bench comprising justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and justice OP Tripathi fixed January 10, 2022 as the next date of hearing in the case. In its order dated December 6, the court on Maurya, who is respondent No.6 in the petition, observed, “It seems that despite our previous orders, no counter affidavit has been filed by the State-respondents. There are serious allegations of mala fides against the respondent no. 6. It is stated that with his support that the private respondent is trying to grab the house of the petitioner.” Advocate Jagat Narain Mishra, appearing for petitioner said the petitioner bought the house from the earlier owner who handed over the possession of the house to the petitioner but after the letter of deputy CM, dated March 14, 2018, police illegally dispossessed the petitioner from his house. Earlier on October 6, 2021 the court had observed, “The grievance urged in the instant petition is that the petitioner, who owns House No.GI 456 EWS, Basera Kalindipuram Awas Yojna, Prayagraj, was dispossessed of the house on 06.06.2018 by the intervention of the State machinery. In support of the said contention, reliance has been placed on a communication sent by respondent No.6 to Senior Superintendent of Police, Allahabad dated 14.03.2018 wherein it is mentioned that respondent No.9 had requested for possession of the house being delivered to her on basis of certain enquiry report and the Senior Superintendent of Police was directed to take necessary steps and inform him accordingly.” “It has further been alleged that with oblique motives, the petitioner was thereafter implicated in false case by lodging a FIR against him. The petitioner is alleged to have made complaints in this respect to various authorities but no heed was paid to the same and hence, the instant petition has been filed.”, further observed the court. Fixing January 10, 2022 the court said, “We adjourn the hearing and post the matter on 10.01.2022. Meanwhile, issue notice to respondent no. 6 calling upon him to file counter affidavit in reply to the allegations leveled against him. The State-respondents are also granted time to file a counter affidavit by the next date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/disupte-over-possession-of-house-hc-issues-notice-to-up-dy-cm-maurya-101639077939428.html
10-12-2021||Patna||Fund crunch at IGIMS halts genome sequencing in Bihar||Lack of funds to buy reagents has forced the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) to stop next generation sequencing (NGS), amid all the buzz around Omicron, the new Covid-19 variant, and steps being taken to contain its spread. Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka are among some Indian states to have reported the deadly variant, believed to be virulent in nature. Bihar has not reported any Covid-19 case of the new variant so far, as it awaits genomic sequencing results of four Covid-19 positive patients, having international travel history, said health officials. Their samples have been sent to the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, the nearest mapped Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomics consortium (INSACOG) laboratory for genomic sequencing to ascertain the strain of the Covid-19 virus. The IGIMS is the only institute in Bihar to be part of the INSACOG, comprising 28 national laboratories, to monitor the genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the pandemic. The institute stopped NGS amid shortage of funds to buy reagents, after having tested one sample in the last week of November that was found positive for the Delta variant, said doctors at the institute requesting anonymity. The 53-year-old patient had a travel history of United Kingdom. He had gone to attend a marriage ceremony in Motihari town of East Champaran district, where he fell ill and was admitted to a private hospital in Patna. Prior to this, the institute had done trial run of two archived samples of the second wave (April to June), which tested positive for the Delta variant, the doctor quoted above said. Sources at the institute said the reagents for NGS were costly. It cost ₹15 lakh (approx.) for one run of the machine. A maximum of 96 samples could be accommodated in one run. It generally took a minimum of 10 days to get the test result, which involved multiple tests. The machine aborts the sample if, at any stage, the quality of the test was not up to the mark. In such event, one had to re-run the entire process, leading to delay in getting the precise result, said a microbiologist at the institute. Officials at State Health Society, Bihar, said funds for purchase of NGS reagents were on way, after the IGIMS made a formal request for it on December 7. “Based on information of travellers from “at risk” countries on the Air-Suvidha portal of the government of India, as many as 957 of the 1,200-odd samples of international travellers collected from the last week of November have tested negative, while four are positive. The samples have been sent for genomic sequencing. Results of the remaining 239-odd samples are awaited,” executive director of the State Health Society, Sanjay Kumar Singh, said on Tuesday.

10-12-2021||Lucknow||A corporation that turns beggars into entrepreneurs||“Charity breeds poverty. But investment creates wealth.” This simple yet potent thought led to the setting up of ‘Beggars Corporation’ that aims at turning vagabonds into entrepreneurs.Set up in January 2021 by social worker Chandra Mishra in Varanasi, the constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the corporation aim is not to rehabilitate beggars through donations but instead transform them into entrepreneurs by equipping them with desired skills.“Presently 55 beggars from 12 families have turned businessperson’s by forming a self-help group. They are not only making conference bags, laptop bags, common bags of paper and cloth but are supplying them to top hotels of Varanasi, multinational companies. Recently, they supplied hundreds of bags for delegates who participated in national executive meeting of BJP in Delhi,” said Mishra convener of Common Man Trust and founder of Beggars Corporation.He added, “I am not here for rehabilitating the beggars through donations but I am here to transform them into entrepreneurs. I want them to realise the importance of labour. I want to provide them employment and help them lead a dignified life.”On the reason why he chose this, Chandra said, “I came to know that Indians donate ₹34242 crore annually (according to figures of Bill and Belinda Gates Foundation’s 2017 report) to India’s 413,670 beggars (figures from ministry of social justice and empowerment). I thought if that amount is invested then it would create more wealth. In India, West Bengal has highest 85000 beggars followed by Uttar Pradesh which has 65,835 beggars. Varanasi where I work has more than 12,000 beggars out of them 6000 are healthy adults. If the donated money is used for training them into employment generators then it would change the picture of the economy.” Encouraged by the success of pilot project, corporation has decided to eliminate begging from Varanasi by March 2023. “Now, we are working out employment models, building capacities for the startups without help from the government. Charity breeds poverty. But investment creates wealth. If beggars can be entrepreneur’s then nobody can be unemployed,” he said.On the challenges, he said “First I had to convince the beggars to work. I followed the formula of Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammed Yunus who financed more than 1 lakh self-help groups (SHG) of beggars in Bangladesh and all of them not only returned the principal amount but are running successfully running their SHGs. To my surprise most of the beggars agreed to work. Once beggars agreed to work the second challenge was to sell the products manufactured by them.”Mishra said, “Now we have decided to enlist Beggars Corporation as a profit company and within five years we will also bring the IPO in the market. We are ready to pump in ₹2.55 crore from angel investors and venture capitalists. We don’t want any monetary help from the government but we want them then to help us in marketing the products manufactured by beggars, besides helping us in identifying beggars, issuing them identity cards, providing treatment to disabled beggars and alternate livelihood to fit beggars wherever possible. This would help us solve the major problem of beggary in India. We are ready to invest but will need a bit of help from the government too.”Mishra said, “Besides employment, educating the next generation of beggars is also important. For that we established a morning school—”School of Life”. This is an integrated system of normal education where besides educating them we impart skill training, personality development to transform child beggars into responsible citizens. Through this we want to ensure that no beggar kid takes up begging again.”

The ministry has red flagged certain points. The project manager National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) NN Giri said efforts were underway to address the concerns of the ministry. The tenders for the project would open next week, he said. In order find solution to the issues raised by the ministry, the project director would meet the chief conservator of forest in Lucknow in a day or two, said officials who are privy to developments. The 62.75 km long and six lane expressway is one of the key projects. The NHAI has completed the land acquisition but the few patches of land marked for forest conservation are the major concern. The area, where expressway and the ring road would merge near Lucknow, is the four hectares of forest land. “The three patches are the cause of concern in taking the NOC,” said one official. The ₹4,500 crore expressway would run parallel to NH27 and would have two elevated portions between Amausi and Bani on the East end and it would run on the face till Azad Nagar in Unnao from Kanpur where it would get connected to the Ganga bridge. This expressway would also be linked to the proposed ring road in Kanpur, Meerut-Prayagraj expressway and Unnao-Lalgunj highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/environment-ministry-denies-noc-to-kanpur-lucknow-expressway-101639076204729.html

This is the same centre which was started by the Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA) in March this year to provide oxygen to Covid-infected residents of the society. Reports of the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has made residents alert and they want to be prepared for the worse, said Vikas Vashisht, president of Panchsheel Greens-1 AOA.“During the second wave of Covid-19, we were not prepared with oxygen supplies and beds in the society. Many of the residents here became critical due to lack of beds and oxygen. We do not want a repeat of the same and hence decided to restart the Covid care centre and keep it ready in case of any emergency as a precautionary measure,” said Vashisht, Covid cases had started surfacing in the society from the beginning of March but it was only by the end of that month that the AOA could arrange oxygen cylinders, concentrators for common use and create a Covid care centre, he added. At the peak of the second wave in mid-April, over 250 residents of the society were down with Covid. The society has 2,000 houses, of which 1800 are occupied.“The oxygen cylinders were brought from Jammu as they were not available anywhere around NCR. Over 80 patients used the facilities between March and May at the centre,” said Vashisht.Later, the Covid care centre in the common area of the society was shut down in June after number of cases started declining. Since then, it had not been used. “On Thursday, we decided to refill the oxygen cylinders and turned on the three oxygen concentrators to check the facilities. The centre has five beds, two 100 litre-capacity oxygen cylinders, three 7-litre capacity oxygen concentrators, PPE kits, hand sanitisers, face shields, face masks, oximeters, hand gloves and wheel chair,” said Anurag Mathur, vice president of the AOA.A resident, who is a general physician at a private hospital in Greater Noida west, will be providing medical assistance at the centre. All the facilities are free of cost for the residents.“We will be conducting a complete audit of all residents to make a note of how many are fully vaccinated and how many are still left. We have appealed to all the residents to get both shots of Covid-19 vaccine soon, if they have not taken it yet. The AOA will also enforce Covid protocols strictly,” said Mathur.When asked about the initiative, district magistrate Suhas L Y said, “The AOAs can take initiative inside the societies for the well-being of the residents as they deem fit.”
10-12-2021||Noida||Pollution levels spike in Ghaziabad, Noida as wind speed drops||After a day of respite on Wednesday, when the air quality in Noida and Greater Noida was recorded in the “moderate” zone, pollution levels once again spiked on Thursday to take the air quality back to the “poor” category, as wind speeds dropped, according to officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s 4pm bulletin on Thursday, Greater Noida and Noida recorded air quality index (AQI) of 297 and 277, respectively, in the “poor” category— they were both in the “moderate zone” on Wednesday. The AQI of Ghaziabad, meanwhile, was at 303, under the “very poor” category — it was in the “poor” category on Wednesday. “The conditions in Ghaziabad are different from those in Greater Noida and Noida. Here, we have a huge vehicle base and also thousands of vehicles that pass through the state highways and national highways criss-crossing the city. Local sources such as vehicular emissions impact AQI levels as also the adverse meteorological conditions,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UP pollution control board, Ghaziabad. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered ”good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 ”moderate”, 201 and 300 ”poor”, 301 and 400 ”very poor”, and 401 and 500 ”severe”. HT visited the outskirts of Ghaziabad city on Thursday morning and saw moderate fog, with reduced visibility, on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, near Dasna and Masuri. “The foggy conditions prevailed till 10am Thursday after which sunshine was visible and the skies cleared up. The visibility remained low only during the morning hours,” said Ajay Yadav, a resident of Dasna. The IMD officials said there is no prediction of fog as such for the next couple of days in Delhi or nearby areas. “Fog will happen once the temperature starts declining further. Even then, fog depends on a number of conditions. The wind speed on Thursday was calm and this could have resulted in the accumulation of pollutants,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist from IMD. A forecast by the Union earth ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, on Thursday, winds are likely to be moderate, enhancing mixing and ventilation of pollutants for next three days. “Air quality for the next three days is likely to improve gradually but within the lower end of ”poor” or “moderate” category. During December 12-14, low winds are likely, leading to weak dispersion and degradation of air quality. From December 15 onwards, significant improvement is expected due to high wind speed,” the forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pollution-levels-spike-in-ghaziabad-noida-as-wind-speed-drops-101639075779013.html

Uppuganti, who was arrested by NIA and was kept at Byculla Women’s prison, was shifted to a hospice after HC’s direction as she has stage four cancer. The division bench of Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the petition of Uppuganti seeking treatment for her cancer, was informed by advocates Dr Yug Choudhry and Payoshi Roy that their client was terminally-ill and needed urgent hospitalisation. On September 9, the HC had directed Uppuganti to be shifted to a hospice at Bandra for 12 weeks and posted the hearing of the petition to December 17. However, on November 29, Uppugantis lawyers had approached the court and sought an urgent hearing as the under trial required immediate treatment at Tata Hospital. The court had asked the prison authorities to get a report from the hospital which was submitted to the bench on December 8. The report signed by the Professor Medical Oncology and Professor Surgical Oncology and Associate Professor Radiation Oncology and signed by the Director of Tata Memorial Hospital said, “The prognosis (outcome) of such a patient is poor and treatment offered is essential with palliative intent (symptom directed and not with intention to cure cancer) and is chronic (long term) without the need of any admission in hospital (unless any acute emergency arises) and generally such patients are managed at home/hospice care as standard practice.” In light of the report, the court extended the September 9 arrangement four months and posted the petition for hearing on April 8, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-extends-nirmala-uppuganti-s-hospice-stay-by-four-months-101639075603855.html
10-12-2021||Noida||Traffic to resume on Delhi-Meerut Expressway only after NHAI inspections||Farmers weren’t the only ones feeling happy and relieved on Thursday to hear the Samyukta Kisan Morcha announce that the yearlong agitation against the farm laws has been called off and protest sites will be vacated, the latest by December 12. Commuters too were a much relieved lot as finally, a year of harrowing snarls and long winding diversions was drawing to a close.But the officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said opening of National Highway 9 (NH-9) and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) lanes will take more time and a round of inspections to assess damage, if any, to the highway, of which the expressway is a part. Only when all infrastructure facilities are found to be intact will be road be opened to commuters, they said. The Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the highway/expressway has been shut since December 3 last year when farmers erected the dais at the site, hampering the movement of thousands of vehicles. The protest also resulted in closure of Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Hindon elevated road which ends at UP-Gate. “The safety of commuters is our prime concern. We will conduct inspections and assess any issues/damage to the DME. Once all issues are resolved and rectified, we will open the highway/expressway to commuters. This may take a week or more,depending on the condition of roads/infrastructure,” said Arvind Kumar, project director, NHAI. “Once the site is vacated by farmers, our teams will assess the entire stretch from UP-Gate to Indirapuram,” he added. During their over yearlong occupation, protesting farmers have been using the electricity taken directly from overhead lines to power gadgets such as televisions and washing machines and for charging mobile phones and laptops. They also erected hundreds of tents after drilling through the bitumen layer. Cracks were also visible on the road surface after the Delhi Police, on October 30, removed their heavy barricading and iron spikes put in place to deter farmers from taking a tractor march to Delhi, after a similar rally on Republic Day ended in violence and the death of a farmer and injuries to hundreds of policemen. Earlier in September, the NHAI raised concerns about the maintenance issues related to DME as a result of the ongoing farmers’ protest. They also shot a letter to the Ghaziabad administration for resolution of issues resulting out of farmers’ protest and also due to non-maintenance of DME. “Due to farmers’ protest for over a year, traffic was diverted through sector 2, Noida, to Anand Vihar border near Kaushambi and also through the Hindon Canal Road. No vehicle was allowed from Pratap Vihar to UP-Gate. Opening UP-Gate will provide relief to thousands of commuters. About 300 of our personnel were deployed there on a daily basis, besides additional deployment during initial days,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). Residents said for over a year, commuters faced a lot of hardship in commuting to their offices and making other trips. “Normally, there are about 5,000 to 6,000 vehicles passing through Kaushambi. As a result of the diversion, the traffic volume through Kaushambi spiked to about 70,000 vehicles per day. It is a great relief that UP-Gate will now be vacated,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments RWA.
10-12-2021||Delhi||Farmers protest: At Singhu, elation makes way for hectic cleaning||It was time to pack up and head back home. There was a sense of anticipation among farmers at the Singhu protest site since early Thursday as whispers made the rounds that today might finally be the day when their yearlong protest against the erstwhile farm laws may be called off. By afternoon, bated anticipation gave way to relief and elation as the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions helming the protest, declared an end to the protests.Soon, the protest site on the Delhi-Haryana border was a beehive of activity as farmers went into overdrive dismantling tents, pack up belongings, sweeping away the litter and cleaning up a stretch of road that they called their “home” for over a year.The SKM in its address on Thursday said farmers will start retreating from Delhi’s border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur from 9 am on December 11. Farmers said the extra time given is to ensure these locations are cleared up and left the way they were when farmers first arrived on November 26, 2020.“We had called this place our home; we cannot simply leave it the way it is now. We built tents and houses which protected us from the inclement weather and we will now remove each and every structure before we depart,” said farmer Satnam Singh from Patiala, as he swept clean the area where his bamboo hut stood till Thursday morning.Farmers HT spoke to at the Singhu border were jubilant and relieved, albeit with a tinge of sadness. “There are some fond and not so fond memories attached to this place,” said Gurnam Singh, 73.“We lost a lot of brothers camping here and some nights were particularly hard; but there was strength in togetherness and we pulled through. Now, we are happy to be going back home, having achieved all that we set out to do,” said Tarn Taran, a farmer from Punjab.Sixty-year-old Harpreet Kaur from Sangrur, who was camping at the border along with her grandchild, was busy bidding farewell to those already leaving the site on tractor-trolleys. “We were like one family; we bonded with people from different villages and states overnight. What we achieved happened only because of the persistence of each and every one of us,” she said.Closer to the main stage, there is a party-like atmosphere, with multiple tractors parked outside, their speakers blaring popular Punjabi tracks to which farmers were shaking a leg.In comparison, the main stage, which usually was jam-packed with protesters eager to hear the fiery speeches, remained deserted, save for the farmers who will dismantle it overnight.“It will take some time to restore this place to the way it was— about four or five days. We will gradually send items back home in trucks. Several trucks will be needed for the fresh produce alone which was being used to cook langar (community food),” says Sukhpal Singh from Patiala.Jogi Ram from Jakhauli village near Sonepat in Haryana was among those leaving the site on Thursday itself. Having camped at Singhu for nearly 10 months, he says justice has finally been delivered. “We called in a few others to help dismantle our bamboo huts. Each and every item will be loaded onto a truck and we will leave for home tonight, which is not too far. This place was our home and we will not leave it dirty,” he said.For Ravinder Nayak, a vendor selling clothes at Singhu border for the past six months, the day was bittersweet. “We will miss selling items here and the atmosphere that existed, but we also understand that farmers need to go back home. I am glad they got what they wanted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-at-singhu-elation-makes-way-for-hectic-cleaning-101639075363197.html
10-12-2021||Noida||Farmers start dismantling tents in UP's Ghazipur, protest site to get cleared in 2 days||With the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of 40 farmer unions that was leading the yearlong agitation against the now repealed farm laws, calling off the protest on Thursday, after the government accepted their demands, farmers at the UP-Gate site started dismantling tents while others raised slogans in victory and distributed sweets to those around to mark their happiness— they will finally get to go home victorious. As farmers went about packing up belongings and other infrastructure that they had put up during the course of their yearlong protest on Delhi-Ghaziabad border, the SKM said all protest sites will be vacated by December 11. It will take about two days to clear the site at UP-Gate as it is currently spread over an area of a kilometre, the farmers said. “This is a major milestone in the farmer’s protest movement — the government has accepted all our demands and we will now go home. We will start removing tents and other infrastructure and clear the area by December 12. On December 11, we will celebrate Vijay Diwas (Victory Day). We again apologise to commuters who faced hardships on NH-9 for such a long time,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and UP-Gate site spokesperson for SKM. Farmers in their hundreds arrived at UP-Gate on November 28, 2020, under the banner of Tikait-led Bharatiya Kisan Union with an intention to march to Delhi in protest. But when they were stopped from entering Delhi by the police, little did know that the border-point — roughly, the area under the UP-Gate flyover— was going to be their home for the next one year. A day later, farmers arrived en masse in cars, tractors and trucks from Uttarakhand and parts of Uttar Pradesh and occupied the nearby areas and set up their dais on National Highway 9. There they stayed put — through the winter cold, the aggressive second wave of the pandemic, the heatwave, the downpour and the squalls; stoically bearing with the police barricades and deaths of fellow protesters —till on November 19, on the occasion of Guru Purab, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the three farm laws will be repealed, a promise that Parliament kept on the first day of the winter session. Even then, farmers refused to move.They demanded a legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, the withdrawal of cases registered against protesting farmers and compensation for the kin of farmers who died during the agitation. The government called them for talks and acceded to their demands, paving the way for the SKM to call off the protest on Thursday. “We asked farmers not to hold any celebrations on December 10 as a mark of respect to soldiers, including chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and 12 others, who died in a helicopter crash on Wednesday. On December 10, these soldiers will be cremated. So, there will be no celebrations,” Bajwa said. The farmers at UP-Gate, numbering about 200-300 on Thursday, were glued to social media as the SKM took up the crucial meeting at Singhu Border in the afternoon. As news spread, there were chants of “Kisan Ekta Zindabad’ while some of the farmers started slowly dismantling tents. “It is good that farmers will get to return home but it is a fact that the government accepted our demands only after a year. I have been at the site since the beginning of the agitation, which saw many ups and downs. Many of our brothers also lost lives during the agitation and that is very painful. The farmers braved adverse weather conditions but stayed together and saw the protest to its victory,” said Buta Singh, a farmer from Uttarakhand. Pyara Singh, another farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, said it was a victory of farmers but it came at a heavy price. “Hundreds of our farmers lost their lives and that could have been avoided had the government paid us heed. If the government had to accept our demands, it could have done so much earlier. The development has given hope that we will get a better price for our crop,” he added. The SKM in a statement said, “Current agitation stands suspended. Battle has been won and the war to ensure farmers’ rights, especially to secure minimum support price as a legal entitlement for all farmers, will continue. Considering that the nation is mourning the demise of CDS General Bipin Rawat and his associates, SKM has decided to postpone all celebrations with regard to the victory of farmers, and celebratory rallies will be taken out day after tomorrow on December 11 when farmers leave the morcha (protest) sites together in victory rallies.” 
10-12-2021||Delhi||‘Tiffin bomb’ blast at Rohini court in Delhi, one hurt||A low-intensity blast took place inside a courtroom at the Rohini court complex on Thursday morning, injuring a policeman, who was posted there as a naib court, triggering panic and raising serious questions over the security arrangements that were strengthened after a gangster was shot dead inside another courtroom by two gunmen in September.The police have not ruled out a terror attack even as no group has come forward to claim responsibility for the blast that took place at 10.30am inside courtroom 102.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said the “minor, low-intensity” explosive was kept in a laptop bag. “The spot was cordoned off. Forensic and the National Security Guard (NSG) teams inspected and examined the site as well as the explosives. The forensic experts collected the debris from the spot for examination. We are waiting for the reports. A case has been registered and investigation is being carried out by the special cell,” Biswal said.Though top police officers did not divulge the nature of the explosives, officers who visited the blast site called it an “improvised explosive device (IED) blast”. They said that the explosive device that was kept in a black laptop bag, and was attached to an unidentified electronic device.They said a medium size battery, usually used in two-wheelers, and a timer may have been used to trigger the explosive substance, which, the police officers suspect could be ammonium nitrate. A damaged metal tiffin box, some small iron screws, shrapnels and wires were found at the explosion site, the officers said asking not to be named.Investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity said court proceedings were yet to begin when the blast took place. Besides head constable Rajeev, a naib court, who was injured in the explosion, at least seven other people were inside the courtroom on the first floor.Lawyers and litigants said that a commotion broke out in the building as soon as the explosion took place. “I was waiting for my case’s hearing in courtroom number 9 on the ground floor when an explosion shook us. I saw people running on the floor and screaming that a bomb has gone off. The police personnel had cordoned off the first floor when I reached there,” said Sangram Singh, a lawyer.Initial probeA senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said initial findings suggested that the bag containing the IED was placed near a wooden partition at the entrance of the court room. He said the injuries to the head constable suggest that he might have stepped on the bag carrying the explosive device.Investigators, however, were not able to tell how the device was brought inside the court complex through a double-layer of security that was put in place after gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi was shot dead by two gunmen who stormed a hearing and opened fire at him. They security staff gunned down the two assailants who entered the court dressed as lawyers.Following the incident, the courts directed the city police to take immediate steps to enhance security at all seven district courts in the city.Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana also visited the Rohini court a day after the shooting, and took stock of the situation. Asthana later announced that security at Delhi’s seven district courts will be upgraded on par with that of the Delhi high court, and said that a slew of measures such as deploying paramilitary personnel and regular security audits will be implemented.The police commissioner could not be reached for his comment on Thursday’s blast, and the major security lapse at the Rohini court.Lawyers outragedLawyers practising at the Rohini court said it was an “attack on the judiciary” and asked how could a person carrying an explosive device go through the double security layer, and then trigger an explosion.“This is an attack on our democracy, and an attempt to intimidate the judiciary. People visit courts to seek justice. September’s shooting incident and today’s (Thursday’s) blast in the courtroom show that criminals have no fear of law. These incidents are nothing but attempts to intimidate judicial officers, lawyers, court staffers and litigants,” said Shekhar Gehlot, a lawyer.Vikas Kumar, another lawyer, said, “After September’s shooting incident, a two layer security apparatus was installed at all the gates of Rohini court. Litigants as well as lawyers are allowed only after showing IDs, and being frisked both manually as well as going through metal door frame detectors . All bags are scanned in X-ray machine. Still, the suspect entered the court with an explosive device. It speaks volumes about the state of the police security.”
10-12-2021||Noida||Park in Noida’s Sector 74 awaits development||An undeveloped park in Sector 74, which has been proposed for development by the Noida authority has been lying idle for years, worrying residents in the area who claim that the garbage and waste water accumulating in the park could lead to the outbreak of several air and water-borne diseases.The vacant land has become a sort of dumping ground, sheltering mounds of garbage which have been dumped illegally. The land also has several pockets, where sewage water has accumulated over the course of time. The plot also has swings and a trampoline, which are used by children from a nearby slum close to Sarfabad village.“This area, earmarked by the Noida authority, is to be developed into a park. However, it has not seen any development in the past few years. There are two such plots here that need immediate attention. The garbage, sewage water and the condition of the area, in general, is not just an eyesore for residents but also a health hazard. We have been following up with the authority since 2017, but nothing has been done yet,” said Arun Sharma, president of the Apartment Owners Association (AOA), Supertech Capetown. Residents said that while the threat of an outbreak of water borne diseases looms large due to the vacant plot, that has become a harbour for both garbage and waste water, chances are that the dirty water may seep underground and upset the water table. Recent reports of over 20 people of a housing society in a neighbouring sector suffering from hepatitis A and jaundice has also worried residents.“Jaundice, typhoid, colitis, dengue and malaria are just some of the various diseases that such poor living conditions can cause. There are many other health risks. Most of these builders extract ground water for supply illegally, since they have not taken the requisite permissions from the authorities. The sewage water being let out in this ground must have already polluted the ground water. Children are at maximum risk,” says Ritika Sinha, a resident of Golf City in Sector 75.Officials from the Noida authority said the horticulture department recently visited the area and is planning to start development of the park soon. “It had been left fallow till now, but discussions have started to develop the park. We have also discussed with the forest department to develop a portion of the park as a Miyawaki forest,” said Indu Prakash, officer on special duty of the Noida authority.Miyawaki is a traditional Japanese plantation technique to plant fast growing trees densely in a small area close to each other.Prakash added that dense plantation was being considered as the 7X sectors have high population and not enough trees. More plantation can also help control pollution in the area. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/park-in-noida-s-sector-74-awaits-development-101639075122090.html

The driver of the truck was arrested on Thursday afternoon.The couple were identified as Manish Sharma (37) and Kshipra Joshi (32), who died a day after their marriage anniversary, which they celebrated at Sharma’s brother house in Rajasthan’s Bhiwadi. Joshi was a homemaker, and Sharma worked as a legal consultant with a private firm.They were returning home to Noida from Bhiwadi with their daughter Mishika when the accident took place on Ring Road, near the Hyatt Regency in RK Puram, the police said.A hydraulic crane was deployed at the spot to help with rescue efforts, after personnel from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) and police failed to free the couple and the child from the car, which was practically flattened. The rescue teams used gas cutters to cut the mangled car and rescue the three occupants.All three were taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where the couple succumbed to their injuries, said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma.He said that around midnight, the RK Puram police station received a call reporting the accident. A police team reached the spot and found that the dumper toppled onto the car after hitting a divider. The driver of the truck fled after the accident.“A case was registered and the errant driver was arrested in the afternoon following raids at his possible hideouts,” said the DCP.The truck driver told the police that he had turned his vehicle to the right side of the road when another vehicle attempted to overtake it. The speeding truck then hit the divider, due to which the driver lost control and his truck fell onto the car, which was moving parallel to it on the left.“The front of the car was badly crushed. Since the couple was seated on the front seats, they were severely hurt, while their daughter was on the backseat and survived. The girl was also admitted to the hospital but was discharged after being administered immediate medical attention,” said a police officer.Sharma’s friend, Vivek Pathak, said a passerby used Sharma’s cellphone to contact a friend and inform them of the mishap. The friend, Nitin, then informed Sharma’s family, said Pathak.Meanwhile, traffic on the carriageway was disturbed for nearly an hour, and the police opened up the service lane as an alternate route. Traffic was restored on the main carriageway around 1am, said senior police officers who were present at the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-accident-couple-dead-child-hurt-after-truck-topples-onto-car-in-rkpuram-101639074764503.html

On September 8, the high court said that it was a clear case of custodial violence and transferred the probe to the central agency.According to the first information report, Gujjar’s mother, Geeta, has accused jail officers of demanding ₹1 lakh as protection money from Gujjar when he was lodged inside the prison.Informing the court about the status of the investigation in the case, CBI informed justice Mukta Gupta that it was “going beyond” the allegations of extortion levelled by Gujjar’s family against the jail officials. The counsel for CBI said that the agency was examining the bank statements of the accused jail officials to ascertain if they got the money.“We are examining extortion and murder. We are going beyond the case and looking into the larger conspiracy... We have sought the bank account (of relevant persons),” the CBI counsel said.The counsel asserted that the CBI was “linking the chain” and “within a month”, the grievances raised by the petitioner, Gujjar’s mother, would be sorted out.On Thursday, the judge granted time to the CBI to file a detailed status report on the investigation in a sealed cover and posted the matter for hearing on January 17, 2022.Lawyer Mehmood Pracha, appearing for the petitioners, stated that there were eye-witnesses who needed adequate protection against coercion inside the jail, and submitted that the CCTV cameras were deliberately switched off at the time of the incident.However, CBI counsel said that adequate care was being taken for the protection of the witnesses, including the undertrials, whose statements have been recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/probing-extortion-by-tihar-jail-officers-in-ankit-gujjar-case-says-cbi-101639074760826.html
10-12-2021||Noida||Yeida files FIR against pvt developer for ‘illegal’ sale of plots in Jewar||To curb the illegal sale of plots under the guise of a government scheme, a practice that is largely rampant in Jewar, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Thursday started a crackdown against those who are developing unauthorised housing projects in the area and luring gullible people. The authority filed an FIR against a private developer in Kasna police station for cheating buyers by claiming that the Yeida has ‘approved’ the housing project. According to the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, 1976, no private developer can execute housing or other projects without the approval of the Yeida on around 2.68 lakh hectares of area spread between Greater Noida and Agra along the Yamuna Expressway. Despite repeated communications, the private developer could not be reached for comments. Established by the Uttar Pradesh government in 2001, the Yeida had notified at least 2.68 lakh hectares of agricultural land for planned development. It means any development--be it housing, industrial or other usage-- that takes place without obtaining the requisite approval for the layout and building map from the Yeida is ‘unauthorised’.“We filed the FIR against the company that was selling the plots in violation of the rules. We have also appealed in the past via advertisements that the buyers should not be lured by such developers, who are developing illegal projects. From the time works at the Noida international airport have been expedited, several real estate agents have become active on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. We will take strict action against such developers,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yeida. Real estate consultants are approaching people through social media, text messages, phone calls and have also put up hoardings on Jewar-Bulandshahr road to lure potential homebuyers. Residents around the area allege that developers are selling a 100 square metre plot for anything between ₹15- ₹20 lakh depending on the location. The rates are, however, not fixed.Yeida officials were startled to see social media users putting up the authority’s logo on their display advertisements while offering industrial plots earlier this week.U B Singh, station house officer of Jewar police station, said, “We have suggested the authority to put up warning boards too at prominent locations for creating awareness. We are taking action against developers who are violating law.”

Rajesh Tripathi, the additional secretary of information technology, was returning to his official residence at Purab Premium Apartments in Sector 88 from Phase 11 in Mohali when the incident took place. Investigating officer Amrik Singh said Tripathi was driving back alone in his Maruti Ertiga. “On reaching the dividing road in Sectors 86 and 87, four men in a Maruti Swift car waylaid him. Three men stepped out of the car and pointed a pistol at him. They asked him to get down from the car and drove away in it. Tripathi managed to note down the number of the Swift car in which the assailants came,” said the cop. “We have already sent our police parties to Moga and Faridkot districts,” he added. The investigating officer said a resident, Gagandeep Singh, outside whose house the incident took place took Tripathi to the police station. “We are checking the closed circuit television camera (CCTV) footage and are hopeful of arresting them soon,” Amrik Singh said. A case was registered against unidentified persons at Sohana police station. On November 28, passersby caught an armed carjacker, who was trying to flee with a car snatched on gunpoint on Kharar-Landran road. Two of his accomplices, however, managed to flee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-civil-service-officer-s-car-snatched-at-gunpoint-in-mohali-101639034010434.html
10-12-2021||Chandigarh||Top leaders get into campaign mode as political temperature soars in J&K||As the winter chill sets in, political temperature in Kashmir has started soaring. With an eye on elections, all top leaders in J&K are already in campaign mode, testing waters and strengthening their public connect.Though no poll dates have been announced yet, majority of mainstream leaders are hoping that elections could be held within next few months once the delimitation process gets over. In recent days, three former chief ministers and leaders of mainstream political parties have addressed several gatherings across J&K, which saw formidable crowds. Former leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad attended a series of rallies and sought restoration of statehood, along with land and job reservations for people. “He (Azad) held rallies in all regions of J&K and the response was tremendous. This is also an effort to strengthen the Congress at the grassroots level,” said GN Monga, vice-president of the Jammu and Kashmir Congress. He said these rallies were effort made to reach out to the people, who were dejected after the abrogation of Article 370. “More rallies will be held in coming days by Azad and other party leaders,” he added. National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah just ended his tour to Chenab valley, where he addressed several political rallies which drew huge crowd. Omar targeted the Centre for taking away special status of J&K and vowed to continue his fight for restoration of the statehood and special status. He even blamed the Congress for not strongly defending the Article 370 that was granted by their leadership. Omar’s political adviser Tanvir Sadiq said the response from public was overwhelming. “The sad part is that people are not happy. They are upset and disillusioned with what happened post-August 5, 2019. They are disappointed with the way this state has been broken into two parts and downgraded to a UT. They want answers as to why a prosperous state like ours was put in situation where we are today.” Tanvir said the government’s claims of development and prosperity post-August 5 have proved wrong. “There is no accountability or redressal at any level. All J&K faces is destruction, helplessness, unemployment, poverty and injustice,” he said, adding that it was not a part of their election outreach. “This was a part of the leadership contact programme,” he said. While PDP president Mehbooba Mufti addressed people in north Kashmir’s Bandipore, BJP state president Ravinder Raina held rallies at Tanghdar and Uri close to the LOC and promised the border residents various development projects. “The aim of these programmes by the PDP leadership is to make people aware of their rights and keep them ready to fight for justice,” said a PDP leader.The People’s Conference led by Sajjad Lone and the Apni Party led by Altaf Bukhari also organised political programmes in different parts of Jammu and Kashmir to show their political strength.“These rallies are a part of the public outreach, especially post-abrogation of Article 370. And when there is talk of elections in J&K, no party wants to remain in oblivion. They prepare their cadre for polls whenever dates are announced,” said People’s Conference spokesperson Adnan Ashraf. He said his party was organising small meetings in different parts of Kashmir, but big rallies were also in the offing. “May be later this month,” he said. ‘A pre-assembly election posturing’Pervaz Majid, a political analyst who teaches journalism at Amar Singh College, said the mainstream politicians visiting hinterland is perhaps Delhi’s measured and guarded approval for warming up to the assembly election. “In fact, statements by these political leaders — from Omar Abdullah to Azad to Ravinder Raina indicate a pre-assembly election posturing. What amazes is that people in good numbers attend their rallies; again an indicator of the public mood for an election wherein they want their MLAs around for grievance redressal,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/top-leaders-enter-campaign-mode-as-political-temperature-soars-in-jk-101638736595127.html
10-12-2021||World||Omicron variant: Boosters could provide 70% to 75% protection, shows UK study||Covid vaccine boosters improve protection to as much as 75% against a rapidly spreading omicron variant that’s much more likely to bypass two doses than earlier strains, preliminary U.K. data show.The basic course of shots from AstraZeneca Plc and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership provided much lower defenses against symptomatic infection with omicron, compared with the delta strain, the initial study showed. A booster lifted protection to 70% to 75% in the early days after the shot.“These early estimates should be treated with caution, but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the omicron variant,” Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at the U.K. Health Security Agency, said in a statement.The findings come as the U.K. accelerates its booster campaign in the face of the heavily mutated variant. New evidence shows the strain is growing much faster than delta, and U.K. health officials expect omicron to become the dominant variant by the middle of December, accounting for more than half of new cases.Effectiveness against severe disease is still unknown but expected to be higher than against symptomatic illness alone, the government said Friday. The U.K. has relied largely on the Pfizer vaccine for boosters, complemented by Moderna Inc.’s shot when needed. Many people in Britain got the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first two doses.Preliminary StudyThe analysis looked at 581 people with confirmed omicron, and health authorities said the figures should be interpreted with caution until more cases have been studied. The U.K. has moved to reimpose some measures, including indoor mask-wearing and work-from-home guidance as omicron proliferates. The new strain may be spreading faster in England than in South Africa and U.K. cases of the variant could top 60,000 a day by Christmas, according to epidemiologist John Edmunds.Other early indications of vaccine effectiveness against omicron have given a mixed picture, with Pfizer and BioNTech saying initial lab studies show a third dose may be needed to neutralize it. Researchers in South Africa have also found a drop-off in the level of antibody protection from that vaccine versus the new strain, though so-called T-cells may still offer an immune defense against severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-boosters-could-provide-70-to-75-protection-shows-uk-study-101639159113888.html
10-12-2021||World||Pakistani Taliban declares end to ceasefire with Pak govt; to resume attacks||The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) will not extend the month-long ceasefire deal negotiated with the Pakistan government, the militant group has announced, in a major setback to Prime Minister Imran Khan's efforts to secure a peace agreement with the dreaded outfit waging war against the state for decades.The Pakistani Taliban has been behind many major attacks on Pakistani security forces and civilians over the last 14 years, including the attack on an Army school in Peshawar in 2014 that killed over 150 people, mostly children.A statement issued by the TTP on Thursday accusing the Pakistan government of failing to honour the decisions, including the release of their fighters.It gave out details of the six-point agreement reached with the government under the aegis of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” (IEA) on October 25, 2021, the Dawn newspaper reported.The two sides, according to the agreement, had accepted that the IEA would play the role of a mediator and that both sides would form five-member committees each which, under the supervision of the mediator, would discuss the next course of action and demands of each side.Both sides, it said, had also agreed to observe a month-long ceasefire from November 1 to November 30, 2021, and that the government would release 102 “imprisoned mujahideen” and hand them over to the TTP through the “IEA and that both sides would issue a joint statement regarding the ceasefire on November 1, 2021”, the report said.According to the statement, the government not only failed to implement the decisions reached between the two sides but on the contrary, the security forces conducted raids in Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Swat, Bajaur, Swabi and North Waziristan and killed and detained militants.“Under these circumstances, it is not possible to extend the ceasefire,” the TTP said.Earlier in an audio message, TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mahsud announced an end to the ceasefire and asked his fighters to resume attacks past 12 am. The ceasefire had come into effect on November 9, the report added.In the message, Mufti Noor can be heard as saying that since the TTP has not heard back from the mediators or the government, therefore, past midnight, his fighters reserve the right to resume attacks wherever they were.The TTP decision to end the ceasefire is a big setback to the government's efforts to secure a peace agreement with the militants waging war against the state for decades.A lot of informal discussions had taken place between the two sides before and during the ceasefire and certain confidence-building steps had been agreed upon to reassure each other, the sources were quoted as saying by the Dawn.Afghan Taliban are playing the role of principal mediator between Pakistan and the outlawed militant conglomerate comprising several factions.Under the deal, the government has agreed to release close to one hundred militants being held at ‘de-radicalisation centers’. The first batch of around 12 has already been released. The second batch is expected to be freed in the next few days, to be followed by more in the days and weeks to come, the report said.Quoting sources, the Dawn reported that during the informal talks, it has been made clear to the TTP that there are certain redlines which are not open to negotiations.The TTP, however, has set its own conditions which among other things include enforcement of Shariah and restoration of tribal areas to their pre-merger status.The ceasefire has remained enforced with no major violations. TTP-led militant attacks inside Pakistan which had seen a dramatic spike in the immediate aftermath of the Afghan Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in mid-August have seen a steady decline, the report said.These attacks saw a further decrease of 28 per cent since October, when the ceasefire came into effect, according to official statistics of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.TTP was also behind a 2014 attack on an army-run school in the northwestern city of Peshawar that killed 154 people, mostly school children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-taliban-declares-end-to-ceasefire-with-pak-govt-to-resume-attacks-101639156826026.html

We have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said.US President Joe Biden is expected to focus on election integrity, independent media and countering authoritarian regimes around the world in his remarks wrapping up the two-day Summit for Democracy attended virtually by most world leaders, journalists and activists.In his opening remarks on Thursday, the US president warned against taking democracy for granted. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said.|#+|Democracy is under threat, he added, from autocrats around the world who seek to perpetuate their hold on power by touting their policies and practices as the “more efficient way to address today’s challenges”. They “fan the flames of societal division and political polarization”.And most importantly and worryingly, Biden went on to say, was their effort to increase “the dissatisfaction of people all around the world with democratic governments that they feel are failing to deliver for their needs”.This “is the defining challenge of our time”, he said.The two-day summit has been attended president and prime ministers from around the world. The notable exceptions were Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, China’s President Xi Jinping, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Hungry’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. More than 100 government’s were invited, which did not include Russia and China, of which 89 accepted.Pakistan was among those who turned down Biden’s invitation saying it will engage with the US “at an opportune time in the future”. Biden has not spoken to Prime Minister Imran Khan since taking office, even as his officials have engaged with their counterparts in Islamabad several times.“Democracies are not all the same,” Biden said in opening remarks. “We don’t agree on everything—all of us in this meeting today. But the choices we make together are going to define, in my view, the course of our shared future for generations to come.”Biden said the US will lead by example — “investing in ...our democracy” and supporting , “partners around the world at the same time”.The most serious threat to democracy in the US came on January 6, when hordes of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol to prevent a joint sitting of the two chambers of congress from certifying Biden’ election victory in November.“Our domestic agenda has been focused on delivering for the needs of the American people and strengthening our democratic institutions at home,” he said and went on to list them out, including efforts to make it easier for Americans to register to vote and then cast their votes.Outside of the US, he announced the launch of a fund of $424 million “to shore up transparent and accountable governance, including supporting media freedom, fighting international corruption, standing with democratic reformers, promoting technology that advances democracy, and defining and defending what a fair election is” around the world.The summit kicks off a “year of action” with follow-up measures. “It essentially gives us more time to develop some of these initiatives, to develop commitments, to work together with all sorts of governments around the world to reinforce the themes of democratic renewal,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters earlier this week while previewing the summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-focus-on-elections-media-as-democracy-summit-wraps-up-101639157003691.html

10-12-2021||World||Geminid meteor shower: Best timing, place, ways to watch||The Geminid meteor shower, one of the favourite meteor showers of skywatchers, is currently active and is expected to peak on the intervening night of December 13-14, making those hours the best time for viewing, according to Nasa.The Geminid meteors are caused by debris from a celestial object 3200 Phaethon whose origin is up for debate among astronomers. While some consider it an extinct comet, others argue that the object has to be an asteroid given its similarity to the main-belt asteroid Pallas. The proponents of 3200 Phaethon as an extinct comet have based their argument on the observations showing some small amount of material leaving the object’s surface.According to Nasa, the Geminids are denser than meteors belonging to other showers, like the Perseids. The density of the Geminids enables them to get as close as 29 miles above Earth’s surface before burning up.Best place to watchSkywatchers around the world can see the Geminids meteor shower but the observers in the Northern Hemisphere get the best view. For the observers, the altitude of the Gemini radiant gets lower above the horizon as they enter the Southern Hemisphere and move towards the South Pole. People in these locations see fewer Geminids than their northern counterparts, Nasa said.Weather and the lunar phase are also major factors in determining the visibility of meteor showers during any time of the year. Moonlight overshadows the fainter meteors, making it difficult for skywatchers to see less bright ones. This year’s Geminids meteor shower won’t be ideal to observe during its peak since the Moon will be almost 80% full.“Nevertheless, that bright Moon is expected to set around 2:00 a.m. wherever you are located, leaving a couple of hours for meteor watching until twilight,” Nasa said in a blog post.How to watchWeather permitting, skywatchers should get away from bright lights to let their eyes adjust to the dark. They should lie on their back and observe the sky closely. They should also not look at their cell phone screen.Nasa will broadcast a live stream of the Geminids meteor shower’s peak on December 13-14 through a meteor camera at the space agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The live streaming will start at 8pm CST on the NASA Meteor Watch Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/geminid-meteor-shower-best-timing-place-ways-to-watch-101639155456581.html
10-12-2021||World||US Supreme Court leaves Texas six-week abortion ban in force, allows challenge||The US Supreme Court on Friday allowed abortion providers to pursue a legal challenge to a ban on most abortions in Texas, with the fate of the Republican-backed measure that allows private citizens to enforce it now hanging in the balance.The justices, who heard arguments on the case on Nov. 1, lifted a block on lower court proceedings, likely paving the way for a federal judge to formally block the law. The conservative-majority court on Sept. 1 had declined to halt the law. The court in a separate case dismissed a separate challenge brought by President Joe Biden's administration.The Supreme Court has yet to decide another major abortion rights case from Mississippi that could lead to the overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide.The court in the Texas case ruled 8-1 that the challenge was allowed under a 1908 Supreme Court ruling that said state laws can be challenged in federal court by suing state government officials. Texas had sought to exploit a loophole in that earlier ruling by saying no state officials could enforce it, but the Supreme Court said the challengers could pursue their case by naming state licensing officials as defendants.Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas dissented on that part of the ruling, saying he would have dismissed the lawsuit altogether.The Texas law enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature made it more difficult to directly sue the state. Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits under the law. Biden's administration has called it a "bounty."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-leaves-texas-six-week-abortion-ban-in-force-allows-challenge-101639149925851.html

Biden will make his late-night television debut as the president of the United States on ‘The Tonight Show’ on Friday, host Jimmy Fallon announced during his show the previous night."Guys we have a big announcement for tomorrow night's show. The 46th president of the United States joins me for his first late-night appearance since taking office," Fallon said.The White House has not revealed where the US president will be when he tapes the segment. This is not the first time Biden will be appearing on Fallon’s ‘The Tonight Show’. In April 2020, just a week before Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidential race, he appeared on the show where he bantered with Fallon. He also gave an appearance in September 2016 when he was deputy to US President Barack Obama.The announcement comes amid a steep drop in Biden’s approval rating, and the Democrat has been under tremendous pressure to engage more with the media. Biden’s approval rating has suffered as the majority of Americans disapprove of the way he has handled the economy, according to a recent poll jointly conducted by Washington Post and ABC News. About 53% of the respondents disapproved of the way Biden has handled his job as the US president.“Overall, the survey offers a set of harsh judgments about the president’s performance and the state of the economy. Together, they send a stark warning to Democrats about their prospects in the 2022 midterm contests,” The Washington Post had said in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-make-late-night-tv-debut-as-us-president-on-jimmy-fallon-s-the-tonight-show-101639141880861.html

Israel, a country of 9.3 million people, has reported 8,210 deaths from the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Most of its population — over 6.3 million people — has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and more than 4 million Israelis have received a booster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-extends-travel-restrictions-for-a-further-10-days-amid-omicron-scare-101639125488735.html

Macron said the boycott was "a symbolic step" and will not have a useful outcome.A number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada have announced a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in China over concerns of human rights violations in the country.The boycott also came in the backdrop of the sudden disappearance of Chinese tennis player Peng Shua, who is untraceable since she made sexual assault allegations against a former vice premier, three weeks ago."I didn't hear anybody in the world say: let's not send our athletes. So we're talking about something rather symbolic," Macron said during a news conference on Thursday, as per local media reports.Instead, the French president said France would work with the International Olympic Committee on a charter guaranteeing the protection of athletes "given what has happened over recent weeks”. "I don't think we should politicise these topics, especially if it's to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic," he added."To be clear: You either have a complete boycott, and not send athletes, or you try to change things with useful actions," Macron also said.In the backdrop of multiple reports claiming human rights violations in China under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CPP), the US, the UK, Canada and Australia have said they will not send government representatives to the Beijing Games, slated to be held in February.This includes allegations of abuse against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang regions, where according to reports, China has detained over a million people of minorities, in a large network of what the state calls "re-education camps." Since 2016, several reports have come into the light detailing the brutal policies of China including "forced birth control and sterilisation" of Uyghur ethnic groups.Earlier in the day, an independent UK tribunal also said that the country is committing genocide against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang.However, China denies any wrongdoing, saying allegations of human rights abuses are "fabricated" and "motivated."Reacting to the boycott call, China on Thursday said the countries "will pay the price for their mistaken acts"."The US, Australia, Britain and Canada's use of the Olympic platform for political manipulation is unpopular and self-isolating, and they will inevitably pay the price for their wrongdoing," foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/insignificant-and-symbolic-french-president-macron-on-boycott-of-beijing-game-101639122569063.html

10-12-2021||World||Al-Qaeda numbers in Afghanistan up 'slightly' since Taliban takeover: US||The al-Qaeda extremist group has grown slightly inside Afghanistan since US forces left in late August, and the country's new Taliban leaders are divided over whether to fulfill their 2020 pledge to break ties with the group, the top US commander in the region said Thursday.Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the departure of US military and intelligence assets from Afghanistan has made it much harder to track al-Qaeda and other extremist groups inside Afghanistan.“We're probably at about 1 or 2% of the capabilities we once had to look into Afghanistan,” he said, adding that this makes it “very hard, not impossible” to ensure that neither al-Qaeda nor the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate can pose a threat to the United States.Speaking at the Pentagon, McKenzie said it's clear that al-Qaeda is attempting to rebuild its presence inside Afghanistan, which was the base from which it planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the United States. He said some militants are coming into the country through its porous borders, but it is hard for the US to track numbers.The US invasion that followed the Sept. 11 attacks led to a 20-year war that succeeded initially by removing the Taliban from power but ultimately failed. After President Joe Biden announced in April that he was withdrawing completely from Afghanistan, the Taliban systematically overpowered Afghan government defenses and seized Kabul, the capital, in August.McKenzie and other senior US military and national security officials had said before the US withdrawal that it would complicate efforts to keep a lid on the al-Qaeda threat, in part because of the loss of on-the-ground intelligence information and the absence of a US-friendly government in Kabul. The US says it will rely on airstrikes from drones and other aircraft based beyond Afghanistan's borders to respond to any extremist threats against the US homeland.McKenzie said no such strikes have been conducted since the US completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on Aug. 30. He added that America's ability to conduct such strikes is based on the availability of intelligence, overhead imagery and other information and communications, “and that architecture is still being developed right now.”Al-Qaeda is among numerous extremist groups inside Afghanistan. After 2001, it lost most of its numbers and its ability to directly threaten US territory, but McKenzie said it retains “an aspirational desire” to attack the United States. During their first period of rule in Kabul, from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban gave haven to al-Qaeda and refused Washington's demand after 9/11 to expel the group and turn over its leader, Osama bin Laden. The Taliban and al-Qaeda have maintained ties ever since.“So we're still trying to sort out exactly how the Taliban is going to proceed against them, and I think over the month or two it'll become a little more apparent to us,” he said.Similarly, McKenzie said it's not yet clear how strongly Taliban will go after the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, which has violently attacked the Taliban across the country. The United States blamed ISIS for an Aug. 26 suicide bombing at Kabul airport that killed 13 American service members in the final days of the US evacuation.ISIS was “reinvigorated," McKenzie said, by the release of numerous ISIS fighters from Afghan prisons in mid-August. He said both ISIS and al-Qaeda are recruiting from inside and outside Afghanistan.“So certainly we should expect a resurgent ISIS. It would be very surprising if that weren't the case,” he said, adding, “It remains to be seen that the Taliban are going to be able to take effective action against them.”He called al-Qaeda a more difficult problem for the Taliban because of their longstanding ties.“So I think there are internal arguments inside the Taliban about the way forward,” he said. “What we would like to see from the Taliban would be a strong position against al-Qaeda,” which they promised as part of the February 2020 Doha agreement that committed the United States to fully withdrawing from Afghanistan. “But I don't believe that's yet been fully realised.”McKenzie declined to provide an estimate of the number of al-Qaeda operatives inside Afghanistan.“I think it's probably slightly increased,” he said. “There's a presence. We thought it was down pretty small, you know, toward the end of the conflict. I think some people have probably come back in. But it's one of the things we look at, but I wouldn't be confident giving you a number right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-commander-al-qaeda-numbers-in-afghanistan-up-slightly-101639114155519.html
10-12-2021||World||US study validates Narendra Modi’s green energy goal||India would be able to cut electricity costs, meet its doubling power demand and reduce emissions if it meets its target of installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, and without having to shut down polluting coal- and gas-based power plants, says a new US study released on Thursday.But there are conditions to this optimistic projection. The costs of battery storage and wind and solar energy technologies should continue to fall as they have over the past decade and should be accompanied by complementary flexible resources, such as efficient energy storage, agricultural load shifting, and hydropower, and optimally utilising the existing thermal power assets in the country.The study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LNBL), which is a US department of energy’s office of science lab managed by University of California, projects that if India achieves the target of installing 500 GW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030, it could reduce electricity costs by 8-10%, provided the renewable energy and battery storage prices continue to decline. And it will be able to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of its electricity supply by 43-50% by 2030 over the 2020 level. Emissions Intensity is the unit of Green House Gas emission relative to the GDP, a measure preferred by India for fixing its mitigation targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement called Nationally Determined Contributions. Other countries - specially developed countries - have committed themselves to reducing just emissions, irrespective of the size of their economy.The study validates the cost-effectiveness of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow recently that India would have installed 500 GW of renewable energy production capacity by 2030.“We found that building such high levels of renewable energy would actually be economical for India, thanks to the cost reductions in clean technologies that have occurred much faster than anticipated,” said Berkeley Lab scientist and the study’s lead author Nikit Abhyankar, an Indian-American. “However, the key to achieving the lowest costs, while maintaining grid reliability, lies in complementing the renewable energy buildout with flexible resources such as energy storage and demand response, and utilising the existing thermal power assets in the country in the most efficient manner.”The study’s two others researchers are also Indian-Americans, Shruti Deorah and Amol Phadke. It was funded by the US department of state, Bureau of Energy Resources, under the Flexible Resources Initiative of the US-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force.India has committed itself to installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, up from the current 100 GW, and eventually to 500 GW by 2030.The study demonstrates that if India hits the 2030 target, 50% of its electricity supply could come from carbon-free sources compared to only 25% in 2020.This would require, though, quadrupling total renewable energy capacity, the study said. But that would still be cheaper than building coal- and gas-based plants if the transition was supplemented by, the researchers found, flexible resources such as shifting agricultural electricity consumption to solar hours, using batteries to store four to six hours of daily energy for nighttime use, and utilising flexibility in existing thermal power plants is cheaper than building new coal- or gas-based plants.This does not have to come at the expense of traditional coal- and gas-based energy plants. India does not have to shut them down immediately, a prospect that confronts many developed countries such as the United States, accompanied by the closure of mines and job losses. This would give India time to plan its long-term transition from these polluting energy sources.But, as stated earlier, there are certain conditions for this least-cost optimism. Worldwide price in battery storage and wind and solar technologies should continue to fall. And for its own part, India will require to make certain regulatory changes, in an enabling policy and regulatory framework.This framework, the study says, should include enabling states to share resources with each other, integrating reliability and cost-effectiveness in electric utilities’ planning and procurement practices, widening and deepening the electricity markets, ensuring that energy storage is appropriately valued and compensated for, and coordinating between power and gas sector operations for efficient utilisation of the existing gas pipelines and gas power generation assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-study-validates-narendra-modi-s-green-energy-goal-101639116248897.html

These facts are grounded in history and law, and represent a universally agreed norm governing international relations.”“This is the right choice that is in line with the global trend and has people’s support. China highly appreciates this decision,” the statement said.China says Taiwan is a breakaway province, with no right to the trappings of a state, and has not ruled out using force to reunify it.The Reuters report said China has stepped up pressure to win away Taiwan’s remaining allies, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, with El Salvador and the Dominican Republic going over to Beijing in 2018, and Panama the year before.China’s ambassador at the United Nations, Zhang Jun, congratulated Nicaragua, saying Beijing commends the decision. “The One-China principle is a consensus widely accepted by the international community and allows no challenge,” Zhang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-loses-ally-nicaragua-to-china-101639114988182.html

10-12-2021||World||US court rejects Donald Trump's bid to keep Jan 6 Capitol riot documents secret||A US federal appeals court on Thursday rejected former president Donald Trump's bid to prevent the release of White House records relating to the January 6 attack on the Capitol.The appeals court agreed with a lower court ruling that President Joe Biden could waive executive privilege on the records, so that they could be handed over to a Congressional panel investigating the violence by Trump supporters.Trump, who has been accused of fomenting the attack on the US Congress, sought to exercise his privilege as a former president to keep the documents and phone records that might relate to the attack a secret.But the court said Biden's judgment carried more weight in the case."The right of a former president certainly enjoys no greater weight than that of the incumbent," the appeals court said in its ruling."In this case, President Biden, as the head of the Executive Branch, has specifically found that Congress has demonstrated a compelling need for these very documents and that disclosure is in the best interests of the nation," the court said.Supreme Court appeal expectedThe ruling did not trigger the immediate release of the records. The appeals court said that Trump's lawyers would have two weeks to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.There, Trump's attorneys are expected to request a new freeze on the release while the high court reviews the unprecedented case."Regardless of today's decision by the appeals court, this case was always destined for the Supreme Court," said Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington."President Trump's duty to defend the Constitution and the Office of the Presidency continues, and he will keep fighting for every American and every future administration."The appeals court said the public interest was greater than Trump's own in relation to the records, which are held by the National Archives."That public interest is heightened when, as here, the legislature is proceeding with urgency to prevent violent attacks on the federal government and disruptions to the peaceful transfer of power," it said.The records are sought by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 violence, in which hundreds of Trump supporters forced the shutdown of Congress and delayed a joint session to confirm that Joe Biden had won the November 2020 election over Trump and would become president."We applaud the Court's decisive ruling, which respects the Select Committee's interest in obtaining White House records and the President's judgment in allowing those records to be produced," the special committee's Democratic chairman Representative Bennie Thompson and Republican vice chair Liz Cheney said in a joint statement Thursday.Documents that Trump hoped to block include records from his top aides and memos to his former press secretary.The more than 770 pages include records of his former chief of staff Mark Meadows, his former senior advisor Stephen Miller and his former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin.Trump had also hoped to block the release of the White House Daily Diary -- a record of his activities, trips, briefings and phone calls.Another trove of documents Trump does not want Congress to see includes memos to his former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, a handwritten note on the January 6 events and a draft text of his speech at the "Save America" rally, which preceded the attack."Today, the Courts have once again rejected the former President's campaign to obstruct Congress's investigation into the January 6th insurrection," Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said in a statement after the ruling."No one can be allowed to stand in the way of the truth - particularly not the previous President, who incited the insurrection."Investigation advancesThe January 6 committee meanwhile continued to push ahead in its investigation.Witness and document requests indicate it is seeking to determine whether the White House played a role in encouraging or even plotting the January 6 attack as part of Trump's effort to prevent Biden from taking office.Cheney, the committee's vice-chair, said it had now heard from nearly 300 witnesses, including four on Thursday: former Trump aide and Pentagon official Kash Patel; Ali Alexander, who helped organize the pro-Trump rally at the White House before the Capitol attack; and two others.When Trump political consultant Steve Bannon refused to testify on his role on January 6, he was held in contempt, and then arrested by the Justice Department.Next week, the committee is expected to also rule Meadows in contempt for refusing to testify."The investigation is firing on all cylinders," Cheney said on Twitter."President Trump is trying to hide what happened on January 6th and to delay and obstruct. We will not let that happen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-rejects-donald-trump-s-bid-to-keep-jan-6-capitol-riot-documents-secret-101639107263574.html
10-12-2021||World||Singapore: Omicron variant of Covid-19 detected in 2 people with booster shots||Two Singapore residents may have caught the omicron variant even after receiving Covid-19 booster shots, in cases that may shed light on the protection offered by the third dose of vaccine. A 24-year-old female airport passenger service worker has returned a preliminary positive test to omicron, in what would be the city-state’s first local case of the variant, the health ministry said in a statement late Thursday. The second person is considered an imported case after returning from Germany via the vaccinated travel lane on Dec. 6. Both had received the third dose of vaccines, the ministry said. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE earlier this week said initial lab studies show a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine may be needed to neutralise the omicron variant. Company researchers observed a 25-fold reduction in neutralizing antibodies that fight the variant, compared with the original strain of the virus, in people who got just two shots. However, boosting with an additional shot of the vaccine restored protection to a level similar to the initial two-dose regimen. “Given its high transmissibility and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more omicron cases at our borders and also within our community,” Singapore’s health ministry said.Both people are recovering in isolation at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, and all close contacts will be placed in 10-day quarantine at designated facilities, the ministry said.The airport worker had been tested as part of weekly testing for frontline border workers. She was asymptomatic when detected through the testing, according to the statement. In the second case, the 46-year-old had tested negative with a polymerase chain reaction test on arrival. However, she developed a runny nose the next day and sought medical treatment the day after that, when she tested positive.   Singapore has seen a sharp drop in community cases over the past month, along with a significant easing in hospital loads. the city-state has one of the world’s best vaccination rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 87% of the total population is fully vaccinated, while 96% of those eligible are fully inoculated, most with Pfizer or Moderna. Some 29% have also received booster jabs. Government officials have said jabs for those aged 5-11 will be offered soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-omicron-variant-of-covid-19-detected-in-2-people-with-booster-shots-101639104397845.html

10-12-2021||World||China guilty of Xinjiang genocide: Independent UK panel||China is committing genocide against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, an independent UK tribunal said, adding to the criticism Beijing faces over its activities in the western region. “The tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the PRC, by the imposition of measures to prevent births intended to destroy a significant part of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as such, has committed genocide,” Geoffrey Nice, chair of the London-based panel of lawyers, academics and former diplomats, said on Thursday, using an acronym for the People’s Republic of China.  The tribunal has no government backing, meaning its conclusions are non-binding, but its decision is certain to elicit an angry response from China. The country’s Foreign Ministry has dismissed the panel as a “machine churning out lies” and Beijing sanctioned it in March. “Despite its name, this is a propaganda organization that has nothing to do with the law,” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper, wrote on Twitter on Thursday after the decision. “The so-called ruling is purely a public stunt to coordinate with anti-China propaganda.”An important finding of the tribunal was that genocide couldn’t have taken place “without the knowledge and tacit support of President Xi Jinping and other senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party,” said Sam Brownback, former ambassador-at-large for the US International Religious Freedom commission. “Even if those individuals did not give direct orders, they created an environment in which these crimes against humanity could take place without repercussion against those committing them,” he added.The US House approved a volley of measures this week targeting China over allegations of human rights abuses, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a resolution stating the International Olympic Committee “failed to adhere to its own human rights commitments” to tennis star Peng Shuai and a resolution calling for a United Nations investigation into genocide in Xinjiang.With the Beijing Winter Olympics now some 57 days away, the US, UK Australia and Canada have announced diplomatic boycotts of games also over human rights concerns. That followed the Women’s Tennis Association’s decision to suspend activities in China over the treatment of Peng, who last month alleged an affair with a top Communist Party official.Since launching in September 2020, the tribunal has heard from academics, former politicians and victims of alleged abuses. Its chair, Nice, was a prosecutor in the Slobodan Milošević trial for war crimes at The Hague.  “China is one of the oldest continuous civilizations existing today and yet it faces determinations supported by evidence that would show it to be -- in part and that part its government not its people -- to be wholly wicked,” Nice said. Charles Parton, a former UK diplomat in China who participated in the tribunal, described its approach to Xinjiang-related issues as “probably the most thorough look at all the evidence.”  German scholar Adrian Zenz, who also provided testimony, called what’s happening in Xinjiang an “atrocity.” “The tribunal constitutes a people’s effort to step in where governments and multilateral institutions have failed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-guilty-of-xinjiang-genocide-independent-uk-panel-101639103248062.html
10-12-2021||World||Congressional staffer allowed into US Capitol complex with gun||A congressional staffer carrying a gun was allowed to move freely inside the US Capitol complex for several minutes on Thursday, even though an X-ray machine at a security checkpoint had picked up the weapon in his bag.The 57-year-old man told police he had left the pistol in his bag by accident but the incident nevertheless raised serious questions over security at the seat of US democracy, almost a year after the deadly January 6 insurrection.With numerous dignitaries including President Joe Biden due in the Capitol Rotunda for Republican statesman Bob Dole's memorial, the House of Representative's worker was waved through security at the Longworth office block across the road.The man, identified as Jeffrey Allsbrooks, was tracked down and detained four minutes after officers noticed the gun -- a delay roughly equivalent to the typical duration of mass shootings in the United States.The US Capitol Police issued a statement confirming that officers "spotted the image of a handgun in a bag on the X-ray screen" after the staffer had passed through security.But the force did not reveal exactly how long he had been in the building before the breach was spotted, and did not respond to a request for confirmation of media reports that the gun was loaded."Allsbrooks told our officers he forgot the gun was in the bag. We are charging him with carrying a pistol without a license," the statement said."This case remains under investigation and the department is looking into what happened before, during, and after those four minutes."LockdownThe agency sent out an alert just before 8:00 am notifying Longworth staff of a security threat and telling them to lock themselves in the nearest office and stay away from all doors and windows, or "seek cover if in a public space."Staff was prevented from entering or leaving the building during the lockdown, which was lifted after a few minutes.The arrest came with Biden preparing to pay tribute to a former Republican senator and presidential candidate, Dole, who is lying in state in the Capitol.The police have been on high alert since one of their officers died and numerous others were wounded after thousands of supporters of defeated president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on January 6 in a bid to overturn Biden's election victory.Security was tested again on April 2 when a man rammed a car into police at a barricade outside the complex, wounding one officer.And government offices were evacuated when a motorist stopped his pickup truck outside the Library of Congress, across the road from Congress, in August and said he had explosives.A month later Capitol police arrested a man who had multiple knives, including a machete, in his truck near the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the same area.Allsbrooks didn't respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congressional-staffer-allowed-into-us-capitol-complex-with-gun-101639103097973.html

10-12-2021||World||Lithuania gears up for China-led biz boycott||China has told multinationals to sever ties with Lithuania or face being shut out of the Chinese market, a senior government official and an industry body told Reuters, dragging companies into a dispute between the Baltic state and Beijing.China downgraded its diplomatic ties with Lithuania last month, after the opening of a representative office by Taiwan in Vilnius. Lithuania’s ruling coalition had agreed in November last year to support what it described as “those fighting for freedom” in Taiwan, putting its relations with China at risk.China views self-ruled and democratically governed Taiwan as its territory and has stepped up pressure on countries to downgrade or sever their relations with the island.China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Thursday that China followed international trade rules and again criticised Lithuania for its stance on Taiwan.“It has created the false impression of Taiwan being separate from China, gravely harmed China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and started an egregious precedent among the international community.”Western nations would ‘pay the price’: ChinaChina warned Western nations on Thursday that they would “pay the price” for a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as a French minister said they would not be joining the US-backed effort.Washington unveiled its decision not to send a diplomatic delegation earlier in the week, saying it was prompted by widespread rights abuses by China and what it sees as a “genocide” against the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang.Australia, Britain and Canada followed suit in a flurry of diplomatic bonhomie on Wednesday.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the announcement in Ottawa and tweeted, “Canada remains deeply disturbed by reports of human rights violations in China.“As a result, we won’t be sending diplomatic representatives to Beijing for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. We’ll continue to support our athletes who work hard to compete on the world stage.”“The US, Australia, Britain and Canada’s use of the Olympic platform for political manipulation is unpopular and self-isolating, and they will inevitably pay the price for their wrongdoing,” Wang said.Soon afterwards Beijing received welcome news from Paris, as education and sports minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said France will not join the boycott.“We need to be careful about the link between sports and politics,” Blanquer said during an interview with RMC radio and BFM television, adding France would carry on condemning human rights violations in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lithuania-gears-up-for-china-led-biz-boycott-101639095295660.html
10-12-2021||World||WHO warns against hoarding vaccines||Wealthy countries may start to hoard Covid-19 vaccines again, threatening global supplies as they seek to shore up stocks to fight the new Omicron variant of the virus, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday.The warning by the head of WHO’s department of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals, Dr Kate O’Brien, comes as supplies to the Covax dose-sharing programme run by the WHO and vaccine charity GAVI have increased in the past few months due to donations from wealthy countries and after India eased limits on exports of vaccines.“What is going to shut down disease is for everybody who is especially at risk of disease to become vaccinated,” said Dr O’Brien. “We seem to be taking our eye off that ball in countries.”Meanwhile, the WHO’s vaccine advisory panel recommends that people who are immunocompromised or received an inactivated vaccine should receive a booster dose of a Covid-19 shot, the head of the panel said on Thursday.The recommendation comes after the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation held a meeting on Tuesday to evaluate the need for Covid-19 boosters.Separately, the EU medicines watchdog said on Thursday the Omicron variant of coronavirus may cause milder disease.Also, European Union countries are expected to agree to limit to nine months the duration of Covid-19 certificates for travel around the bloc, three EU sources told Reuters.Johnson left reeling over Christmas party scandalBritain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday faced a political backlash for imposing new virus restrictions and public fury about whether a Downing Street Christmas party last year broke lockdown rules.Members of Johnson’s ruling Conservative party openly voiced opposition to his new guidance to work from home and the prospect of compulsory vaccine passports.Also, the number of cases of the Omicron variant in Britain has nearly doubled in one day after a further 249 cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the total to 817.The UK Health Security Agency said if the growth rate and doubling time continue at the rate seen in the last two weeks, they expect to see at least 50% of Covid-19 cases to be caused by Omicron variant in the next two to four weeks.Britain is also experiencing it worst ever outbreak of bird flu, farming and environment minister George Eustice told parliament on Thursday.Britain’s chief vet Christine Middlemiss told BBC Radio on Thursday that around 500,000 birds had been culled as a result of at least 36 outbreaks.The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid booster to include 16- and 17-year-olds, amid growing concern over the Omicron variant’s ability to overcome immunity conferred by two shots.Denmark’s PM defends decision to cull minksDenmark’s PM Mette Fredriksen insisted on Thursday she did not know her government’s decision last year in November to cull 15-17mn minks over fears of a new coronavirus strain was unlawful.Austria plans to impose fines of up to around $4,000 on people who flout a vaccine mandate it aims to introduce in February for all residents age 14 and over, the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-against-hoarding-vaccines-101639094743485.html

He said about 40 injured had serious wounds and were taken to local hospitals. Later, the death toll in the Mexico road accident was revised to 53.That meant at least 107 people were crowed into the vehicle. It is not unusual for freight trucks in Mexico to be carrying so many people in migrant-smuggling operations in southern Mexico.The crash occurred on a highway leading toward the Chiapas state capital. Photos from the scene showed victims strewn across the pavement and inside the truck's freight compartment.The victims appeared to be immigrants from Central America, though their nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Moreno reported that some of the survivors said they were from the neighboring country of Guatemala.Moreno said that it appeared the sheer weight of the truck's human cargo may have caused it to tip over and that as the vehicle toppled over it hit the base of a steel pedestrian bridge.In recent months, Mexican authorities have tried to block migrants from walking in large groups toward the U.S. border, but the clandestine and illicit flow of migrant smuggling has continued.In October, in one of the largest busts in recent memory, authorities in the northern border state of Tamaulipas found 652 mainly Central American migrants jammed into a convoy of six freight trucks heading toward the U.S. border.Migrants involved in serious accidents are often allowed to stay in Mexico at least temporarily because they are considered witnesses to and victims of a crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/49-migrants-killed-dozens-injured-in-mexico-truck-crash-report-101639093948384.html

Still, most Chileans now support same-sex marriage and have shown signs of becoming more liberal on social and cultural issues in recent years.Civil unions have been permitted in Chile since 2015, which affords same-sex partners many but not all the benefits of married couples, like the right to adoption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-love-relationships-on-equal-footing-says-chile-prez-brings-law-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage-101639073714483.html
10-12-2021||India||CDS chopper crash: Tearful farewell to India’s fallen heroes||India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, and the CDS’s defence assistant Brigadier LS Lidder were on Friday cremated with military honours at Brar Square in Delhi Cantt in two separate solemn ceremonies steeped in military tradition, with top government officials attending the heart-wrenching final send-off, and thousands of men, women and children lining the road leading to the crematorium to pay their last respects with slogans of glory to the departed.Three grieving daughters performed the last rites.While Kritika and Tarini lit the funeral pyre of their parents, Bipin and Madhulika, 16-year-old Aashna performed the last rites of her father Lakhbinder Singh Lidder in ceremonies filled with emotion and pride.“We will carry on with the good memories of my father. I am happy he didn’t have to suffer. My dad was a hero,” Aashna later said.The Rawats and Lidder were among the 13 people killed in a horrific Mi-17V5 helicopter crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu.Lidder’s last rites were conducted in the morning and attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, and India’s top military leadership. At one point, the Brigadier’s wife Geetika and daughter Aashna sat next to his coffin and kissed it -- the moving images broadcast live on television and watched by millions of Indians who mourned along with the Lidders.The mortal remains of the Rawats lay in state for public viewing and for dignitaries to pay their last respects at the CDS’s official residence on Kamraj Road. Those who paid respects at the residence included home minister Amit Shah, a few of his colleagues, national security adviser Ajit Doval, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, and a battery of top government and military officials.The funeral procession started from Kamraj Road at 2pm and reached Brar Square at 3.30pm, covering the 10km route in full 90 minutes, allowing people to pay homage along the way. Ninety-nine personnel from the army, navy and air force and 33 members of the tri-services band formed the front escort, while 99 personnel acted as the rear escort of the procession, officials said.Rawat was accorded a 17-gun salute at the funeral attended by the defence minister Rajnath Singh, law minister Kiren Rijiju, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the three service chiefs, Defence Research and Development Organisation chief G Satheesh Reddy, several former service chiefs, top officials of a few friendly foreign armies, diplomats and a slew of other dignitaries.Top officials of the militaries of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan attended the last rites. Over 800 serving military personnel attended the funeral, the officials said.“Paid my last respects to General Bipin Rawat and his wife, Mrs Madhulika Rawat. General Rawat devoted his life to serving and protecting our nation. India will remember his courage, valour and patriotism. Farewell General,” Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid his last respects to the 13 people killed in the crash, after an Indian Air Force C-130J special operations aircraft flew their mortal remains from Sulur to the Palam air base in Delhi.The schedule for the last rites of the remaining people has not been finalised yet as the “process for positive identification of remaining mortal remains is still on.” Their mortal remains have been kept at the mortuary of Army Base Hospital till the identities of the bodies are confirmed.The Coonoor crash was of one of the worst air accidents involving India’s top military brass and a setback to the ongoing military reforms in the country, the biggest since Independence. Rawat was spearheading the military’s theaterisation drive to enhance the effectiveness of the armed forces and reshape the conduct of future operations. He took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years.The CDS’s shocking demise will have implications for the ongoing military reforms, including theaterisation, and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan. Rawat survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur in February 3, 2015. He was a lieutenant general at that time.Out of the total 14 persons on board the helicopter, 13 were killed. The other deceased are Lieutenant Colonel Harjinder Singh, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan (pilot), Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh (co-pilot), Junior Warrant Officers Rana Pratap Das and Arakkal Pradeep, Havildar Satpal Rai, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitendra Kumar, Lance Naik Vivek Kumar and Lance Naik B Sai Teja.The sole survivor, Group Captain Varun Singh, is on life support at the IAF Command Hospital in Bengaluru. A top three-star officer is heading the inquiry into the crash. Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers there.The defence advisor and the naval advisor posted at the Pakistan High Commission also paid their last respects to Rawat and his wife at the CDS’s official residence, according to the high commission officials.
10-12-2021||India||India’s Omicron tally 32; symptoms mild, says govt||India’s tally of the Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2 touched 32 as nine new infections were reported in the country on Friday, but so far all of them have exhibited mild symptoms, senior health ministry officials said, adding that there was no immediate plan to authorise vaccine boosters.On Friday, seven new cases of the heavily mutated variant were detected in Maharashtra and two more in Gujarat, local officials said. For the past three days, there had been no new case of the variant in the country.“All Omicron positive cases have so far had mild symptoms,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health said, adding that close to 70 clusters are currently under investigation across India. Agarwal, who was addressing a media briefing early on Friday, said that till then there had been 25 cases of the variant in the country.The new cases from Maharashtra were reported hours after the health ministry briefing.Infections have now been reported in four states and one Union Territory – 17 in Maharashtra, nine in Rajasthan, three in Gujarat, two in Karnataka, and one in Delhi.Officials, however, reiterated that the government’s focus remains on ensuring primary vaccination, and there was no recommendation yet from the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) on the booster doses.“We are keeping an eye on global scientific studies. There is no stand of the World Health Organization (WHO) on booster doses... But WHO has clearly highlighted the need for completing primary vaccination as the most important priority and our view is also aligned with this. We have to first complete the task of vaccinating all individual with both doses,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.When asked about vaccines for children, Paul said, “The team has been examining information coming from several sources in this regard... We do not have any recommendations on paediatric vaccination from them (NTAGI) as yet. They are examining it and other facets of vaccines.”Paediatric vaccination is yet to begin in India, even though on August 20, the Drugs Controller General of India granted emergency use authorization to Zydus’ vaccine, ZyCoV-D. The vaccine has been tested, and approved for restricted use, in anyone aged 12 years and above.Globally, at least 50 countries have begun giving doses to children. In most cases, children above the age of 12 are being inoculated. The shots being used for these ages are typically the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna doses – both have shown to be safe in children and their efficacy has been established.The officials stressed that public adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, along with vaccination, remains the biggest weapons in the country’s arsenal against the viral outbreak.“We have to remember that both vaccines and masks are important,” Paul emphasised.“WHO recently pointed that public health and social measures compliance is declining with increase in vaccination rates. There is no need to panic, rather adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour is a must even for the fully vaccinated persons,” said Agarwal. “WHO has also shown that laxity in public health measures is leading to a surge in overall cases,” he added.Head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that, clinically, the variant, which was detected in India on December 2 after being first identified in South Africa on November 8, does not pose a serious threat for now.“Clinically, Omicron as yet is not posing a burden on health care system; however, vigil has to be maintained. Regular meetings are being organised to examine and keep a watch on the global scenario; and regulator meetings are being held to examine the Covid scene in India, with focus on Omicron,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR.Much remains unknown about Omicron. After being detected in early November, it was labelled as a variant of concern (VOC) by WHO on November 26. Dozens of countries have imposed travel restrictions on southern African nations since it was discovered.Officials also said that at least 70 clusters are under close watch for Omicron across India.“We are watching and investigating more than 70 such clusters, even though by and large it looks like the Delta variant is in circulation there. But we have to be careful and vaccination is the key to reduce risk of severe disease. Extremely crucial to take both the doses along with adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Bhargava added.On November 27, a day after the declaration of Omicron as a VOC by WHO, states across were advised to increase surveillance at airports, increase testing and continue monitoring hot spots, Agarwal said. The aggressive screening of international passengers, especially from ‘at-risk’ countries was made effective from December 1 with 58,469 passengers arriving in India from 298 international flights from ‘at risk’ countries being tested on arrival, of which 83 tested positive for Covid-19.As on date, 2,936 Omicron cases have been detected from 59 countries, with 78,064 Covid positive cases being under investigation. The most Omicron cases have been reported from the United Kingdom, Denmark and South Africa.Union health ministry is also conducting meetings with all states and senior people involved in pandemic management on a daily basis to ensure all measures are put in place appropriately to prevent and stop the spread of the disease, especially with the new variant that suspected to be highly transmissible.According to experts it is important keep the testing momentum up to ensure the disease does not spread aggressively. “5% and above test positivity means that disease is in circulation and testing and isolating positive case early is the only way to stop the disease from spreading within the community,” said Jacob John, former virology head, Christian Medical College, Vellore (Tamil Nadu).
10-12-2021||India||Democracy lives with and within the people: Modi||Democracies must work together to forge global norms for emerging technologies such as social media and cryptocurrencies so that they cannot be used to undermine democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday.Delivering India’s national statement at the Summit for Democracy hosted by US President Joe Biden, Modi offered to share with the world India’s expertise in holding free and fair elections and transparent governance through digital solutions.During his address, Modi sought to build on US president Abraham Lincoln’s description of democracy in the legendary Gettysburg Address of 1863 – government of the people, by the people, for the people – by adding the concept of “with the people, within the people”.Biden convened the virtual summit of government and civil society leaders on December 9 and 10 to focus on challenges confronting democratic nations and on reforms and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights around the world.Modi noted that the second day of the summit, which featured interventions by leaders from around the world, provided a platform for furthering cooperation among democracies, and said: “We must also jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies such as social media and cryptocurrencies, so that they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it.”He added, “India would be happy to share its expertise in holding free and fair elections, and in enhancing transparency in all areas of governance through innovative digital solutions.”Modi also raised the role of technology companies in democratic societies at a closed-door plenary session hosted by Biden on Thursday. He was among leaders of 12 countries that joined the session. Modi said that in view of technology’s ability to impact democracy positively or negatively, technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies.The Indian government has focused on the regulation of international technology and social media companies and personal data protection in recent years. The government also plans to introduce legislation to ban private cryptocurrencies and create a framework for an official digital currency.While delivering the national statement on Friday, Modi said multi-party elections, independent judiciary and a free media are “important instruments” of democracy. He added, “However, the basic strength of democracy is the spirit and ethos that lie within our citizens and our societies. Democracy is not only of the people, by the people, for the people but also with the people, within the people.”He pointed out that different parts of the world had followed “different paths of democratic development” and there is much to learn from each other.“We all need to constantly improve our democratic practices and systems. And we all need to continuously enhance inclusion, transparency, human dignity, responsive grievance redressal and decentralisation of power,” he said.Modi said he was proud to represent the world’s largest democracy at the summit, and that democratic spirit is integral to India’s civilisational ethos.He pointed to democratic practices that existed in India’s past, and said: “Elected republican city-states such as Lichhavi and Shakya flourished in India as far as 2,500 years back. The same democratic spirit is seen in the 10th century ‘Uttaramerur’ inscription that codified the principles of democratic participation.”This democratic spirit made ancient India prosperous and centuries of colonial rule could not suppress the people’s democratic spirit. “It again found full expression with India’s independence, and led to an unparalleled story in democratic nation-building over the last 75 years,” he added.India’s development as a democracy, Modi said, was a story of “unprecedented socio-economic inclusion in all spheres” and of “constant improvements in health, education, and human well-being at an unimaginable scale”. He added: “The India story has one clear message to the world. That democracy can deliver, that democracy has delivered, and that democracy will continue to deliver.”By working together, democracies can meet aspirations of citizens and celebrate the democratic spirit of humanity. “India stands ready to join fellow democracies in this noble endeavour,” Modi said.While India has commended the US for convening the Summit for Democracy, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan decided to skip the event – a move widely seen as a gesture of solidarity with his country’s “all-weather ally” China, which has repeatedly taken pot shots at the US over democratic values in the past few days.Biden pointed to challenges faced by democracy worldwide in his opening remarks on Thursday. He also announced the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, for which the US will provide $424.4 million in 2022.

Banerjee was invited to a seminar in Kathmandu by the Nepali Congress Party and she agreed to attend it, TMC leaders said. “This shows how vindictive the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has become after its defeat in the March-April assembly polls and the subsequent by-polls. They are jealous of Mamata Banerjee’s popularity,” said Bengal minister Tapas Roy. Though Indian nationals do not require passports or travel permits to visit Nepal, Banerjee, being a chief minister, had to follow standard protocol and seek the Centre’s clearance before going to a foreign country, said a TMC leader who did not want to be identified. “The MEA sent her a note, asking why a political party from another country invited a chief minister of an Indian state to a seminar?” the TMC leader said. Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said he had no information about the Centre’s decision. “I am a BJP worker from Bengal. How can I know what the ministry of external affairs is doing?” he said on Friday evening. This is not the first time that the Centre has refused to allow Banerjee to attend programmes on foreign soil. In October, she was not allowed to attend a peace summit in Rome. In 2018, she was denied permission to visit the USA for a programme held to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda’s historic speech in Chicago. The TMC and Banerjee reacted on both occasions and accused the BJP-led government of misusing powers for political reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vindictive-cries-tmc-as-centre-bars-mamata-banerjee-from-visiting-nepal-101639159824014.html
10-12-2021||India||Courts cannot become adventurous and supplant authorities, says SC||Courts cannot become adventurous and pass orders supplanting existing authorities, said the Supreme Court on Friday as it set aside a direction passed by the Madhya Pradesh high court appointing lawyers and judges to conduct inspection of nursing colleges in six districts in the state.“This creates a very inconvenient situation if lawyers and district judges conduct inspection of nursing colleges,” said a bench of Justices UU Lalit and S Ravindra Bhat while dealing with a petition filed by the Private Nursing College Association of Madhya Pradesh.The association had approached the top court against an August 18 order passed by the Gwalior bench of the high court directing inspection of nearly 271 private nursing colleges situated in Gwalior, Morena, Shivpuri, Datia, Bhind, and Sheopur districts. The direction of the HC came on a PIL filed by one Hariom who alleged irregularities in private nursing colleges which did not indicate how many beds they had to treat patients during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.For Gwalior, the inspection commission comprised a judicial officer and two lawyers of the MP high court, while for the remaining five districts, the inspection committee had a district judge and Collector or their nominees. The committees were supposed to conduct surprise physical inspections at these colleges and submit report on the infrastructure and other requisites at these institutions.Setting aside the direction of the HC, the top court said, “We deem it appropriate to set aside the direction and request the high court to consider the matter afresh and appoint such committee which is in conformity with the Madhya Pradesh Nursing Shikshan Sansthan Manyata Niyam 2018.The association represented by advocate Rahul Kaushik submitted that the inspection of the nursing colleges was conducted annually by the MP nursing council by a team comprising a senior doctor from the government medical college and principal of a government nursing college. He further stated that the HC order was contrary to the 2018 rules and allowed lawyers and judges to conduct inspection, when they had no technical background or expertise in the field associated with nursing colleges.The bench said, “Courts cannot become adventurous like this and supplant existing authority. Covid gripped the nation in April-May while this order was passed in August when the impact of the pandemic had dissipated. We will ask the high court to decide the matter in a manner known to law.”The petitioner was represented by advocate Puneet Jain who said that he had no difficulty if lawyers and judges are not made part of the team. However, he stated that an inspection was necessary to verify the claims of the association that they have requisite beds to treat patients and impart training.The MP nursing registration council had filed an affidavit, both in the high court and Supreme Court, clarifying that the power of inspection rests with the council. During the inspection of the 271 colleges in question, the council submitted that all of them had the necessary prerequisites for recognition and were rightly given recognition.The bench recorded in its order the assurance given by the association that all help shall be extended to the committee conducting inspection pursuant to high court’s order to ensure it is completed within the shortest possible time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courts-cannot-become-adventurous-and-supplant-authorities-says-sc-101639157484213.html

The bench will pass its order on Monday. The petition has been filed by BJP state vice-president Pratap Banerjee. During the last hearing on December 6, the West Bengal state election commission (SEC) told the bench that it wants to hold the elections in six to eight phases by May next year. During a long hearing on Friday, Advocate General S N Mookherjee, who represented the state government, said the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls will be held on December 19 because of the better vaccination status of Kolkata residents and healthcare facilities available in the city. He cited logistical problems and the Covid-19 pandemic as reasons for postponing the polls in the remaining 22 districts. Advocate Pinky Anand, who represented the petitioner, countered the SEC’s argument that elections in the districts are being postponed because of the new threat posed by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. She argued that people of Kolkata, who will cast their votes in less than 10 days, are not immune to it. Stating that polls in all civic bodies of Bengal were held simultaneously in 2015, Anand told the bench that electronic voting machines (EVM) containing voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) are mandatory but these will not be used in the KMC election according to the affidavit earlier filed by the SEC. Senior advocate Jayanta Mitra, who represented the SEC, countered Anand. He said the situation in 2015 was quite different. He told the bench that the SEC informed the Election Commission of India (ECI) about shortage of EVMs in the state but the ECI told the SEC that it had already loaned all EVMs in its stock to Bengal. Mitra also told the court that EVMs given to the state for the municipal polls do not have the provision for VVPAT. Mitra informed the bench that EVMs with VVPAT are used only in assembly and Lok Sabha polls. States such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra do not use EVMs with VVPAT in municipal polls, Mitra said. The court wanted to know when the SEC will submit its plans for polls in the rest of the civic bodies. Mitra told the court that the schedule will be decided after the KMC elections on December 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-reserves-order-on-bjp-s-plea-for-single-phase-civic-polls-in-bengal-101639155263058.html

Here is what govt says you can do||The education ministry on Friday shared advisories for parents and teachers with respect to online gaming and the threats it can pose towards children if they are not monitored. The comprehensive set of advisories by the ministry of education aims to ensure that children understand the concept of in-game purchases, learn to protect their identities online and also understand the addictive nature of gaming from a young age.The education ministry asked the parents and teachers to ensure that children should overcome all online gaming downsides with the associated mental and physical stress to children.“Playing games leads to a serious gaming addiction which has been considered as a gaming disorder. The game is designed in a way that each level is more complicated and complex than the previous one. This causes a player to push themselves to the limit in order to progress in the game,” the ministry said in a release. “Therefore, playing online games with no restriction and self-limits leads many players to become addicted and are eventually diagnosed with gaming disorder. The gaming companies also emotionally compel the child to buy more levels and almost force in-app purchases,” it further added.Here are the dos and don’ts shared by the Union ministry for education:Don’ts -Dos -||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worried-about-your-child-s-gaming-addiction-here-is-what-govt-says-you-can-do-101639151162383.html

The conclave was held at Patsoi in Manipur’s Imphal West district.“We’ve got to realize that by using force, we cannot achieve our goal. We need to look into security aspects also. But, AFSPA is not the solution to the problem,” he said. “It is only through socio-economic measures, that we’ll be able to find the ultimate solution. By using the Armed Forces, we’re once again damaging our youth,” he said “Therefore in this conference we need to realize that this kind of politics, these kinds of laws make things worse.”The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 which gives power to the Indian Army and Central forces deployed in “disturbed areas”’, is in force in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur (excluding seven assembly constituencies in Imphal) and parts of Arunachal Pradesh. It was withdrawn from Meghalaya in 2018.On the issue of unemployment, Sangma said, the NPP feels that every young man must be given skill sets apart from education and the youth’s energy should be tapped.So until we can create a business environment, we will not be able to resolve the issue of unemployment in the region as the government has a limited role in terms of giving jobs, he said.On climate change, he urged the volunteers of NPYF to play a key role in combating climate change in the North eastern region.Manipur deputy chief minister Yumnam Joykumar, former minister L Jayantakumar, NPP Manipur unit president N Kayisii, president of the Arunachal chapter of the NPP Mutchu Mithi were also present during the day-long Youth Conclave. The NPP, which has four legislators in the 60 member Manipur assembly, is a key ally of the BJP-led government in the border state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-manipur-visit-conrad-sangma-vows-to-continue-fight-to-repeal-afspa-101639151061675.html

According to estimates provided by external affairs minister S Jaishankar in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, 330,058 Indian workers returned from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and 137,900 more from Saudi Arabia. An estimated 97,802 workers returned from Kuwait, 72,259 from Oman, 51,190 from Qatar, and 27,453 from Bahrain. “While a large number of Indian workers in the Gulf returned to India as a result of the impact of Covid-19, the economic recovery in that region and their increasing openness to travel from India has now seen a return by many of them,” Jaishankar said in response to a question from MP Abdul Majeed Ariff of the CPI-M. The West Asian region is home to some nine million Indian expatriates, with the largest numbers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Amid the pandemic, Jaishankar said, the government’s priority was ensuring that the impact of the crisis on Indian workers, in terms of loss of employment, was mitigated. The external affairs ministry and missions in the Gulf engaged with governments in the region to maintain the workers ensure their welfare and facilitate financial payments due to them, he said. “As the pandemic has receded in recent months, this focus has shifted to pressing for return of workers and families on an expeditious basis. To that end, all Gulf nations were pressed to establish air bubbles and ease visa, travel and health restrictions,” he said. “All countries in the Gulf have responded favourably to these efforts by the government, as a result of which, there has been a steady flow of returnees back to the Gulf. Government will continue to make this its priority in engagement with the Gulf nations,” he added. Jaishankar said Indian missions in West Asian countries are continuing to pursue with governments of host countries the return of Indian workers, realisation of payments due to them, new recruitment in light of economic recovery and other welfare measures. The government launched a programme in January to upskill Indian blue collar workers in the UAE to enhance their employability and wages. During the pandemic, Indian missions in the region extended support to Indians by using the Indian Community Welfare Fund and by coordinating with community associations. This support included expenses related to lodging, air fares and emergency medical care.

While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation recorded three Omicron cases in Mumbai, four cases were reported from Pune’s Pimpri-Chinchwad area. The three Omicron patients in Mumbai have recent travel history of Tanzania, South Africa and the United Kingdom.The health department said that the four Omicron patients from Pimpri-Chinchwad were contacts of a Nigerian woman who had tested positive for the new variant of concern recently.Out of the seven Omicron patients, four have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine while one has been administered with a single shot. One patient identified in Mumbai’s Dharavi area is unvaccinated and another is a three and half year old kid, thus ineligible for vaccination, according to the health department. Four of them are asymptomatic and three are having mild symptoms.Earlier today, the BMC said that the patient who had returned from Tanzania was asymptomatic and was admitted to Seven Hills Hospital in Mumbai. The patient, aged 48 and male, was not vaccinated against Covid-19. The Omicron patient who arrived from London last week is a 25-year-old male and the South Africa returnee is a 37-year-old male and a resident of Gujarat. Both of them are vaccinated against the virus.The update comes amid the Centre’s warning over the decline in usage of face masks across the country amid the emergence of the Omicron variant. Dr VK Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog, told a regular press briefing that people are operating at a “risky and unacceptable” level, stressing that both masks and vaccines are important for protection against coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“Mask usage is declining in India. We have to remember that both vaccines and masks are important. As far as protection capability is concerned, we are now operating at a risky and unacceptable level.

Jaishankar’s remarks in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha indicated India’s continuing commitment to the port on the Gulf of Oman despite speculation about its viability following the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in mid-August. “The Chabahar port has provided much needed sea-access to landlocked Afghanistan. The port has also emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region. It is a more economical and stable route for landlocked countries of the region to reach India and the global market,” he said in the reply. Chabahar port facilitated the delivery of humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, and India used it to ship 75,000 tons of wheat as food assistance to Afghanistan in 2020. A total of 110,000 tons of wheat and 2,000 tons of pulses have been trans-shipped from India to Afghanistan so far. During the Indian Prime Minister’s visit to Iran in May 2016, a trilateral agreement to establish the International Transport and Transit Corridor (Chabahar Agreement) was signed by India, Iran and Afghanistan. India is participating in developing the first phase of Shahid Behesti terminal at the port in cooperation with the Iranian government. Jaishankar said in response to a question from MP Ritesh Pandey of the Bahujan Samaj Party that India has committed a total grant assistance of $85 million and a credit facility of $150 million for developing the Shahid Behesti terminal. “As part of our commitment towards infrastructure development of Shahid Behesti terminal, Chabahar port, India has supplied [six] mobile habour cranes (two 140 tons and four 100 tons capacity) and other equipment worth $25 million,” Jaishankar said. The Indian company, India Ports Global Limited, through its wholly owned subsidiary, India Ports Global Chabahar Free Zone, took over operations at Chabahar port from December 24, 2018. Since then, it has handled 160 vessels, 14,420 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of cargo and 3.2 million tons of bulk and general cargo. The Shahid Behesti terminal has handled shipments and trans-shipments from countries such as Russia, Brazil, Thailand, Germany, Ukraine, Oman, Romania, Bangladesh, Australia, Kuwait, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates.

10-12-2021||India||India, Afghan embassy quietly prepped for flight from Kabul for weeks||NEW DELHI: A special charter flight from Kabul to New Delhi on Friday evacuated 104 people, most of them Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, and took back Afghan nationals stranded in India and medical supplies.The flight, operated by Afghanistan’s Kam Air and arranged by India, brought 10 Indians and 94 Afghans, including members of the Hindu and Sikh minorities, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet. Indian authorities and the Afghan embassy in New Delhi worked discreetly over the past few weeks to arrange the charter flight, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.A video posted on social media showed a Sikh man, who was among the Afghan Sikhs evacuated to India, saying that they were taking the flight after waiting for almost three months.The group – which included women, six children and three infants – brought with it three Guru Granth Sahibs from historic gurdwaras and Hindu religious texts from the ancient Asamai Mandir in Kabul.The family of Mahram Ali, an Afghan security guard killed during the March 2020 terror attack on Gurdwara Guru Har Rai in Kabul, was evacuated to India and will be rehabilitated by Sobti Foundation.The charter flight took back close to 90 Afghan nationals, mostly people who came to India for medical treatment and were stranded after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The aircraft also carried medical supplies that are part of the humanitarian aid offered by India to Afghanistan, the people said. The last commercial flight from the Indian side on the Kabul-Delhi route was operated by Air India on August 15, the day Kabul fell to the Taliban. Hundreds of Indian nationals, including diplomats and security personnel, were subsequently evacuated from Kabul in special Indian Air Force flights during August. India also withdrew its ambassador and all other staff from the mission in Kabul – effectively closing the embassy for the second time since 1996.However, scores of Indian nationals were still in Afghanistan after all evacuation flights were stopped because of security concerns, which were heightened after the devastating suicide attack at Kabul airport on August 26 that killed more than 180 people.The people cited above said many of these Indians subsequently left Afghanistan via land routes and travelled to Iran and Central Asian states. As of last week, it was believed that a little more than a dozen Indians were currently stranded in Afghanistan.More charter flights could be arranged to take back hundreds of Afghans still stranded in India, the people said. Four special flights were recently arranged to take Afghan nationals stranded in India to Kabul via Tehran but this arrangement was subsequently suspended as the cost was too high – each traveller paid almost $850 for the trip – and most of the Afghans could not afford the fare.

Bipin Rawat: I can still feel the warmth of that handshake||The tragic demise of Gen Bipin Rawat and his wife Madhulika Rawat, who were on board the IAF chopper which crashed near Coonoor, Tamil Nadu, left the entire nation in a state of shock and anger. Actor Anupam Kher who had the “good fortunet” of meeting Gen Rawat many times, expressed grief over the unfortunate incident. He shared throwback pictures from when he met CDS Rawat.In an exclusive conversation with HT City, Kher remembers the late Gen and the words of wisdom he got to learn from the officer.I have grown up seeing people in uniform as I come from Shimla, which was the headquarters of Army Western Command. I met them when I was on my way to the school and college and then I did plays with Army officers. So I am somebody who has the greatest regards for the Army and people in services.Then I came in close contact with them when I as a drama school student did a play with them. Because I spent a lot of time with people like Colonel Kaul of that time or later on Gen. JP Gupta, I understood it all — discipline and living life under the shadow of constant danger protecting the nation.Four years back, I was very thrilled when I was asked to join the NCC (National Cadet Corps) Board, where I got the opportunity to meet all the three chiefs of services — Army, Naval and Air Force. And it was also where I met General Bipin Rawat for the first time. A photo that I took with all of them was the ultimate picture, and felt like getting the biggest award.I thought he had such an amazing sense of humour because he was genuinely laughing at my jokes. So, I saw the human side of him and he also asked me, ‘Sab theek hai? Gharwale kaise hain?’ like a regular person. I also got the chance told them how great I am an admirer of his conversations and most importantly mention that I was in the NCC and showed him my ID. I stayed in touch with him and conveyed that ‘main aapse milna chahta hoon’. Hence, when I was in Delhi, he made time for me and I especially went to South Block to meet him. That’s when I spent time with him and asked him, ‘Yeh jazba kahan se kab sikhte hain’. To which he very candidly replied, ‘Hum jazbe ke sath paida hote hain aur fir yeh badhta jaata hai’. That one hour of conversation, where I took a picture shaking hands with him, was the most amazing.There was also this one time when I got a call (from his office) informing that his wife wanted to see my play in Delhi and the show was houseful. So, I organised passes for her. After that, I got a call from General Rawat, who told me that his wife found the story of life ‘very inspirational’.Then he became the Chief of Defense Staff (CDS), and I met him when the oath ceremony was taking place at the second Lok Sabha aur jis garmjoshi ke saath woh mile, that was amazing. For me, he symbolises epitome of solidarity, courage and an amazing sense of dignity. I’ve always seen him as someone very decisive and to the point. Sometimes you need role models to live life and they are not necessarily supposed to be sportsperson, politicians... my role model is people like Gen Rawat.It took me a lot of time to register what had happened with him. I think he really lived through his life rather than the end of life. The courage will come from what he symbolised. The loss of course is there, but millions of people like me, who felt sad about his going, will continue with his legacy of deshbhakhti. Kabhi kabhi kisi ke jaane ke baad pata lagta hai ki woh hamare liye kitna important insaan tha. As long as people like them are there, our country will always be stronger and powerful. I will cherish that handshake and I can still feel its warmth. That handshake gave me a feeling that ‘everything will be okay with my country’.Follow author on Twitter/@monikarawal

In a country which prides itself on its diversity, there are bound to be different perceptions and opinions which would include political opinions.“The present proceedings in a way emanate from the same. We say so as what the petitioners have done is to reproduce what the political class has stated against each other and which is already in public domain, an aspect pointed out eminently by senior counsel for the petitioners,” it said.The bench said that no doubt by the very nature of the job required to be performed by the political class, at times their exchanges may get heated.“But it should not explode. We are sure difference in perceptions can be expressed in better language,” it said in its order uploaded today.The top court had earlier stayed further proceedings in a fresh FIR lodged in West Bengal against them.On June 26 last year, the top court had stayed further proceedings in three FIRs lodged in West Bengal against petitioners.In their intervention application, Sharma and others had said that they are constrained to move the top court due to persistent hounding and victimisation by the West Bengal government, who in its endeavour to scuttle inconvenient media reports registered multiple FIRs against them.The application had further said, "That the order dated June 26, 2020, came as a respite to the petitioners whose honour, life and liberty were sought to be repeatedly undermined by the state..."However, "it appears that the respondents are unrelenting in the efforts to persecute the petitioners/ applicants as the petitioners/applicants have recently on August 5, been served with a notice under section 41A of the CrPC from CID, West Bengal concerning FIR registered with Bhadreshwar police station, it had said.It had said that the FIR relates to media reports published in 'opindia.com' about Telenipara communal riots of May 2020 and were registered contemporaneously around the same time as FIRs, which forms the subject matter of the writ petition.The petitioners had said the FIR came to their notice only on the receipt of the notice under section 41 CrPC on August 5 this year requiring them to appear before the investigating officer on August 13, but later the investigating officer through an email dated August 12 asked the petitioner to appear on August 23.They had sought a stay on the investigation emanating from the FIR registered at Bhadreshwar police station and the notice issued to them for appearing before the investigating officer. They had also sought quashing of the FIR.On June 26 last year, the apex court, while staying the three FIRs, issued notices to the West Bengal government and the Centre seeking their replies on the plea.The main writ petition filed by Sharma and others including the founder and CEO of the news portal and the editor of its Hindi language publications claimed that the West Bengal government and its "authoritarian Kolkata Police" are misusing FIRs and "brute police powers" to intimidate journalists."The petitioners are constrained to invoke the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this court under Article 32 of the Constitution against the patently extortionist and mala fide actions of the Government of West Bengal to impose illegal censorship in the state by threatening, scuttling, and gagging honest media houses through misuse of state police," the plea claimed.The petitioners had claimed they were informed that the cause of one of the FIRs lodged by police was an article published by the news web portal on the issue of alleged hiding of data related to COVID-19.The plea had claimed that one of the FIRs lodged pertained to a news report published by the web portal in October last year.It alleged that to undermine the freedom of the press, the state has rather chosen to "hound down" the petitioners by registering multiple FIRs in order to "bargain for deletion of news articles by putting the petitioner's life and liberty at bait".It had claimed the state and the police are not only intimidating the journalists but also threatening their family members to seek deletion of media reports which bring to the public notice "the actual state of affairs in the state of West Bengal during these difficult times".It had also alleged that the police had intimidated some of the petitioners to get the news articles deleted."Accordingly, the officers while insulting and demeaning the petitioner no. 1, asked her to use her influence to get the articles removed or to face the brunt of state's political executives," it had claimed.The plea had claimed that deleting any content from the internet has a nationwide effect and any decision to delete any content has to be left to be taken by the Centre and not by state governments.It had also sought a direction to exclude the role of police in the matter of deletion of content on the internet particularly since there exists a regulatory mechanism for overseeing such content and restricting any mischievous contents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-use-state-force-to-browbeat-political-opinion-journalists-supreme-court-101639144200850.html

10-12-2021||India||Opposition against high speed rail project gains momentum in Kerala||The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Kerala government is of the opinion that the ambitious high speed rail project, called K Rail, will change the transport system of the state but opposition parties are against the idea saying it will turn into another Nandigram for the ruling party. Many green activists have also opposed the ₹63,490 crore proposed project saying the state is yet to learn lessons from recent natural calamities and early warnings of climate change. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, known for his adamant posture, however said the government will go ahead with the project and the party has also given an open call to its workers to expose forces that are bent on derailing developmental activities of the state. The government has also started a crackdown on protestors who disrupted survey and other work related to the project. Police said around 100 people were booked in four districts of north Kerala in a week. Last week the government announced special officers to acquire land and they faced fierce resistance at many places. Protestors have floated action committees throughout the state and are planning to intensify their struggle. The CPI(M) is planning to portray it as a struggle between development and anti-development forces in the state. Though the project is yet to get environmental clearance and the Union railway ministry’s nod the government is surging ahead with the project. On Wednesday, the CM sent a letter to Prime Minister Modi seeking his personal intervention to speed up sanction for the project. In the letter, he said, a pan-India future ready rail system will hike economic growth and improve ease of living and would benefit not only the state but also the nation at large. “I request your personal intervention to accord sanction to the key project that will be a milestone in the progress of the state,” he said. But earlier Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnav had red-flagged the project citing its inability to bear the liability of loans to be availed from international agencies. The state had submitted a proposal to take ₹33,700 crore from lending agencies but the Niti Ayog had given approval for the big project on two conditions, the repayment of the loan and cost overruns would be the sole responsibility of the state. The high-speed rail connecting one-end of the state (Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram) needs 1383 hectares of land most of which is private land. Since land is at a premium in the densely-populated state it will be a gargantuan task for the state. The state is planning to fund the project using equity funds from the government, foreign lending and railway ministry’s part funding. It will take only four hours to cover 529.45 km (present time is 12 hours) and it will be completed by 2025, said the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd, the nodal agency for the project. But it seems things are not that easy for the government. The two main opposition parties, Congress and BJP, are opposing it and some of the allies of the ruling Left Democratic Party have apprehensions about the big ticket project. Green activists and some of the left-leaning organisations like Sastra Sahitya Parishad, that played a key role in total literacy movement, have also opposed the project. “The government is going ahead with the project ignoring large-scale protests from different sections. The CM is not even ready for a dialogue. It will cause immense environmental damage and displace thousands of people,” said state Congress chief K Sudhakaran MP. He said the party will have to pay a heavy price and reminded the CM of the last days of the CPI(M) government in West Bengal which tried to suppress a farmers’ uprising in Nandigram over a proposed car project in 2007-2008. “The railway ministry feels that the big-budget project was unnecessary and instead of this it should help it to develop the existing railway line. The state has not even done a social and ecological study on the project,” said Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, a staunch critic of the project. Some of the allies of the LDF also expressed apprehensions over the project. “True, many left organisations have reservations over the project. The government will clear all doubts,” said CPI secretary Kanam Rajendran. However, CPI(M) leader A Vijayaraghavan underplayed any differences in the ruling front. “It was part of the LDF manifesto. The project was conceived after enough studies. Forces that oppose the development of the state are creating unnecessary confusion and fanning trouble. K Rail will herald a new phase for the state,” he said. Metroman E Sreedharan also spoke out against the project. “Let the government first help complete the ongoing doubling work of the existing stretch between Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram which is dragging for more than two decades. K Rail’s alignment is also flawed; it is running parallel to the existing line from Tirur (Malappuram) to Kasaragod. The railways opposed this alignment. Around 140 kms of the line passes through wet land and it is not suitable for high speed trains,” he said. But the CPI(M) said the Metroman was opposing the project due to his political affiliations. (He was a BJP candidate in last assembly elections and lost).

10-12-2021||India||Keeping up with UP | The question of West Uttar Pradesh||As the farmers return home after spending a painful (but fruitful) 14 months on the borders of Delhi, it’s time for realpolitik. Their return has been made possible by a retreat by the Union government on almost all fronts – the farm laws which set off the protests have been repealed; codification and expansion of the minimum support price regime are on the table (and will, at the least, be discussed); all criminal cases related to the protests will be withdrawn; and the kin of farmers who died during the protests will be compensated.

10-12-2021||India||Stir called off, farmers head home from Delhi’s borders||The Union government and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of farm unions, on Thursday reached a deal on a raft of demands that had sparked yearlong protests by peasants in a major political challenge to the Modi regime. Farmers camped at Delhi’s borders began packing up on Thursday after the SKM accepted a clutch of proposals from the Centre, contained in a letter signed by Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal ,towards resolving key agrarian issues raised by it. The agreement paved the way for SKM to call off one of the largest demonstrations by farmers the country has seen in decades. The SKM will meet next on January 15, its leaders said. Protesters will take out victory processions from their camps on Delhi’s borders on December 11 on the way back to their villages, it was announced. The letter promised the continuation of government purchases of produce at a minimum support price (MSP) and also a possible broadening of the MSP regime; the withdrawal of cases against farmers; compensation for farmers who died during the protests; the removal of criminal liability for burning crop stubble; and that no changes to the Electricity Act would be made without consultation. The compromise between the Centre and protesting farm unions came after two days of back-channel negotiations that saw proposals being sent back and forth, and 11 rounds of tenuous negotiations that hit a deadlock on January 22. Tens of thousands of farmers opposed three agricultural reform laws enacted by the Modi government in September 2020, hunkering down on highways across several states for nearly 14 months. Thousands had also set up virtual protest townships at five sites along Delhi’s borders, choking traffic.Modi had said that the now-replealed laws would have benefited farmers by giving them greater access to markets. However, farm unions feared the reforms would pave the way for the government to stop buying produce at assured prices, eroding their bargaining power and leaving cultivators at the mercy of large corporations and supermarket chains. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 19 that his government would abandon the contentious laws and Parliament repealed them on November 29. The scrapping of the laws created an opportunity for farmers to re-engage with the government. On December 7, the Centre sent draft proposals to resolve the stand-off, to which the farm body proposed amendments. The SKM signed off on a final letter from the Centre on Thursday that contained key steps forward. “Today is victory day for farmers, who launched the biggest movement in the country after the freedom movement. Victory to those who feed the nation,” said Daljit Randhawa, a wheat-grower from Punjab’s Sangrur, who has been camping at a protest site on the outskirts of the nation capital for months. The proposals contained in letter from the agriculture secretary were unanimously accepted by the five-member team of farm leaders authorized to take decisions on behalf of the SKM. In the letter, the Centre said it would set up a committee mandated to “ensure how all farmers can get minimum support prices (MSP)”. It also assured that the current levels of federal procurement of farm produce at assured prices would not be pared. “This has allayed a major fear of farmers that the government could reduce or stop buying farm produce at MSP,” said Yogendra Yadav, the leader of Swaraj India, and a member of the SKM’s coordination committee. Farmers have demanded a law to guarantee minimum prices for 22-odd commodities. Distress selling of farm produce and price volatility in non-cereals have been a major gripe among cultivators. The Union government’s letter also stated that the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana had agreed to withdraw all cases registered against farmers and their supporters during the course of their agitation with immediate effect, a major demand of the SKM. Cases against farmers registered by central law-enforcement agencies and in Union Territories as well as by Delhi police would also be withdrawn immediately, the Centre stated. According to SKM leaders, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh alone have pressed over 45,000 cases against farmers. Accepting another major demand, the Centre stated the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments would grant compensation to the families of nearly 700 farmers who died of heat, cold and exhaustion during the year-long sit-in demonstrations. The government also proposed that it would not move an amendment to India’s Electricity Act without consulting the SKM. The SKM has objected to certain provisions in the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020, saying the changes would increase energy costs for agriculturists. Farmers would also not be criminally liable for burning crop residue after harvests, a major cause of air pollution in the national capital. Peasants would be exempt from prosecution under Section 15 of an anti-pollution law currently in force, the Centre said. During back-channel negotiations with the home ministry, the Centre however told SKM that it had no powers to exempt farmers from fines for stubble burning imposed by the Supreme Court. The farmers had also wanted the sacking and arrest of Union minister of home Ajay Mishra Teni. Teni’s son was arrested after a car owned by him rammed into farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. The SKM eventually didn’t pursue this. “The issue of investigation into Teni and his son is currently being monitored the Supreme Court. So, we have decided not to interfere in this,” said Shiv Kumar Kakkaji, one of the five members of the SKM empowered to take decisions. The Modi government’s move to address key issues of farmers come as the Bharatiya Janata Party prepared to fight crucial state polls, especially in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, where farmers are an influential voting bloc. “It now remains to be seen how whether the government will deliver on assurances on MSP. If farmers are not satisfied, they are likely to restart their agitation. The farm laws were repealed because of farmers represent a significant political constituency and polls are due in states,” said Sudhir Panwar, who teaches political science at Lucknow University.

The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in consultation with Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), Chennai will define the proportions and rules of constructing shoe lasts required for providing well-fitting and healthy footwear.Since the present Indian Standard specification for sizing and fitting of footwear is based on the European and French Standards, it necessitates a revision to accommodate for demographic, anthropometric features of the Indian feet for more comfortable footwear. The ministry of commerce and industry said that the anatomy and functional requirements of footwear for children, juveniles and adults are “demography dependent”, adding that the design and development of correct footwear exclusively for the Indian population is necessary.“The project includes anthropometric survey, statistical analysis and development of an Indian foot sizing system and involves foot biomechanics and gait study, materials identification, lasts fabrication, development of design patterns and comfort parameters, wear trials, generation of specification,” the ministry stated.The DPIIT has approved ₹10.80 crore for the completion of the project which will require carrying out accurate measurements taking into consideration all the variations owing to region, gender, age, and health condition.

10-12-2021||India||World needs to focus on ‘right to healthy environment, climate justice’: Kovind||Speaking on the occasion of the annual Human Rights Day, President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday underlined the fight against the climate crisis, saying it’s important for all of us to secure our “right to a healthy environment and climate justice”. The president, while addressing a gathering at an event organised by the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC), warned that degradation of nature is leading to changes in the climate that are irreversible.“On this day, the world should also debate and discuss the right to a healthy environment and climate justice,” Kovind said. “The degradation of nature is leading to irreversible changes in climate, and we are already witnessing its harmful impact. The world is waking up to the harsh reality, but it is yet to build the resolve to make decisive change.”Kovind said it is necessary to protect nature from the “worst effects of industrialisation” in order to make the world a better place for future generations.“Time is running out. I am glad that India has taken initiatives at home as well as at the recently held global climate conference [in Glasgow], which will go a long way in restoring the health of the planet. Especially commendable is India’s leadership in the International Solar Alliance and a series of measures to promote green energy,” he said.The president said the Human Rights Day is the ideal occasion for us to come together and find ways to overcome “prejudices” hindering humanity’s progress. Also Read: Kovind pays tribute to Shivaji Maharaj at Raigad Fort“While non-discrimination is the first condition for absolute respect for human dignity, the world is beset with countless prejudices. They, unfortunately, hinder the full realisation of individuals’ potential, and thus, are not in the interest of society as a whole. The Human Rights Day is the ideal occasion for us to ponder collectively and find ways to overcome such prejudices,” he said. Pointing to the impact of Covid-19, Kovind said that the pandemic has had a “disproportionately devastating impact on vulnerable sections of society”. “India, despite the obvious challenges, has been able to save millions of lives by adopting a policy of free and universal availability of [Covid-19] vaccines. With the biggest vaccination exercise in history, the government has been able to provide protection against the virus to nearly a billion people. I congratulate doctors, scientists and all other ‘corona warriors’ for their heroic efforts to uphold the people’s right to life and right to health,” he said.Kovind appreciated the NHRC for its efforts during the pandemic, underlining its “deep concern for the rights of the vulnerable and marginalised sections of society affected by the pandemic”.The theme of this year’s Human Rights Day is “equality”. Justice Arun Mishra, chairperson of the NHRC, said, “Equality is the essence of human rights. It requires upholding of justice and dignity in every wake of life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-needs-to-focus-on-right-to-healthy-environment-climate-justice-kovind-101639127171585.html

Globally, the cases of Omicron are more than 2,300.Amid the fears of an increased spread of the variant, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Thursday extended the suspension of scheduled international commercial passenger services till January 31 next year."This restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flight specifically approved by DGCA," the DGCA said in a circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/86-of-vaccine-eligible-population-given-1st-dose-health-minister-tells-parl-101639122755940.html

10-12-2021||India||‘Farmers’ stir shows Centre shouldn’t get into state subjects’: Former agri secy||Former agricultural secretary Siraj Hussain said that the repeal of farm laws is a nudge for the central government to leave the subjects in the state list to state governments.In an interview with HT, the former agriculture secretary said, “I think the repeal of farm laws reinforces the need for wider consultation and leaving subjects in state list to state governments.”He added that there is a need to refer all important legislations to standing committees of departments so that the bills are scrutinised impartially.While talking about the reason behind the never-ending momentum of the farmers’ protest, which began a year ago, Hussain said that even though the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were spearheading the movement, farmers from all across the country identified with the demands and goals of the movement.He said this was the first time that the farmers’ movement engaged with farmers from across India and the governments “surely assessed” the impact of such a widespread movement ahead of elections in 2022. Seven states – Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Manipur- are heading to polling booths next year, out of which two, UP and Punjab, are agrarian states.Hussain said that the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which began in December 2019, could not pressurise the government in a way that the farmers’ protest did because the CAA-NRC movement was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. He further reasoned that the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party-led government projected it as a movement by the Muslim community.He noted that even during the farmers’ movement, sections of social media users attempted to portray the movement as sponsored by “Khalistanis” but failed.The Former agricultural secretary noted that the economic ramifications of the repeal of the farm laws cannot be ascertained as there is no decision of providing a legal guarantee to Minimum Support Price (MSP). Legal guarantee to MSP, which has been a bone of contention between the farmers and the government, will be discussed in a new committee with representatives from both sides.On Thursday, the Samkyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 40 farm unions, announced that it has accepted the Centre’s proposal to resolve the pending demands and called off the year-long agitation against the three farm laws. Farmers who have been protesting on Delhi borders will be heading home on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-shows-centre-shouldn-t-get-into-state-subjects-former-agri-secy-101639120991457.html

10-12-2021||India||Special charter flight from Kabul to New Delhi to evacuate more than 100 people||A special charter flight from Kabul to New Delhi on Friday will evacuate more than 100 people, most of them Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, and take back Afghan nationals stranded in India and medical supplies. A few Indian nationals are also expected to be in the group being evacuated from Kabul, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Indian authorities and the Afghan embassy in New Delhi worked discreetly over the past few weeks to arrange the charter flight. A video posted on social media showed a Sikh man, who was among the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus being evacuated, saying that they were taking the flight after waiting for almost three months. The man said 102 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were being evacuated to New Delhi. The group, which includes women and children, will bring with it three Guru Granth Sahibs and Hindu religious texts from the ancient Asamai Mandir in Kabul. The charter flight will take back close to 90 Afghan nationals. Most of them had come to India for medical treatment and were stranded after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. It is also expected to carry medical supplies that are part of the humanitarian aid offered by India to Afghanistan, the people said. There was no official word on the development from the Indian side. The last commercial flight from the Indian side on the Kabul-Delhi route was operated by Air India on August 15, the day Kabul fell to the Taliban. Hundreds of Indian nationals, including diplomats and security personnel, were evacuated on special Indian Air Force flights during August. India also withdrew its ambassador and all other staff from the mission in Kabul – effectively closing the embassy for the second time since 1996. However, scores of Indian nationals were still in Afghanistan after all evacuation flights were stopped because of security concerns, which were heightened after the devastating suicide attack at the Kabul airport on August 26 that killed more than 180 people. The people cited above said many of these Indians subsequently left Afghanistan via land routes and travelled to Iran and Central Asian states. It is believed that a little more than a dozen Indians were stranded in Afghanistan and wanted to come back. More charter flights could be arranged to bring back people from Kabul and send back hundreds of Afghans still stranded in India, the people said.Four special flights were recently arranged to take Afghan nationals stranded in India to Kabul via Tehran, but this arrangement was subsequently suspended as the cost was too high. Each traveller paid almost $850 for the trip - and most of the Afghans couldn’t afford the fare.

The attendants, however, shall not be serving long-distance trains such as Rajdhani Express or Duronto Express.In an interview with the publication, a senior official of the Indian Railways said just like airlines, here too, the train attendants shall not consist of an all-female crew. However, the women who are appointed for the new post are required to be trained in the field of hospitality service, since they will need to provide such services as greeting those onboard, serving food, and taking care of complaints of passengers travelling in the premium trains of the Indian Railways.The decision was taken as part of the Railways' ongoing drive to modernise the experience of train travel and provide better passenger facilities as an incentive to generate more footfall. The train attendants shall match the hospitality standards of those seen in flights to compete with airlines' services, the official told the publication, adding that the hostesses will be working only during the daytime and would not be inducted into overnight services.The Indian Railways currently runs around 25 premium trains on track, including the Shatabdi Express, the Gatimaan Express, one Tejas Express, and two Vande Bharat trains. These trains shall also serve freshly cooked food instead of packaged products, another significant step introduced by the Railways recently to better passenger welfare. An order, issued in this regard to all departments concerned and stakeholders, said the matter has been examined and it has been decided to resume cooked food in trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-introduce-hostesses-on-premium-trains-on-lines-of-flight-attendants-101639112659744.html

10-12-2021||India||Gen Rawat fought China on border and corruption within military||Even as General Bipin Rawat stood up to the aggressive Chinese at Doklam plateau and Ladakh, he will be also remembered for initiating a war against corruption within the military establishment as he used to often say that Indian armed forces were all about respect, not money.As India’s first Chief of Defence Staff, he pushed the Indian Army to ask the CBI to inquire about alleged corruption in the sub-standard construction of married accommodation project (MAP) in Meerut and the Salaria Officers’ Enclave in Delhi by Military Engineering Services (MES). The total sanctioned cost of MAP phase I and II was ₹6,033 crore and ₹13,682 crore. He berated the MES top officials for shoddy construction and told them that Salaria Enclave resembled bombed-out Syria not New Delhi with sub-standard material being used for officers and jawans accommodation.As the army chief, he initiated major reforms in military canteen purchases, much to the anger of the retired generals, by putting a cap of ₹12 lakh on the purchase of cars. When he found that senior military officers were saving precious excise and buying luxury cars like Mercedes and SUVs and top-brand single malt whiskies through the canteen route, he removed these items from the canteen list saying that a normal officer or jawan cannot afford these with the existing salaries. The veterans hated him for putting a cap and only allowing Indian made foreign liquor to be sold in canteens, but General Rawat told them that if they have so much money, they should buy the Mercedes or Blue Label whiskey from the open market and not dent the Indian exchequer. For the jawans, he ensured that sub-standard products did not find their way into the military canteen through the grease route.Another area where he fought against his own peer group was the misuse of disability pension particularly by senior officers of the three services. Keeping his then defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the know, General Rawat found that senior officers were deliberately lowering their medical category before retirement to only not get disability benefits for themselves and their children but also tax-free pension. He found in many cases, a general or an air marshal or an admiral was getting more pension than his salary by using the disability pension route. While he was all for the support to the genuine disabled who lost their limbs in war or insurgency, he was totally against misuse of disability pension. It is perhaps for this very reason that Gen Rawat never claimed disability pension despite having a steel rod fitted inside his ankle due to a serious injury during an operation on the LoC in Kashmir.Today, General Rawat passes into history, but the reforms he initiated within the military to make them more accountable cannot be stopped as it is the need of the hour.

"As the world's largest democracy, India stands ready to work with our partners to strengthen democratic values globally, including in multilateral fora," the Prime Minister added.PM Modi will deliver India's national statement on Friday, which will be open to all.Leaders of more than 80 countries participated in the closed-door virtual 'Summit for Democracy' on Thursday via video conferencing. The summit, called by US President Joe Biden, focused on challenges confronting democracies, including corruption, inequality, and limitations on press freedom, across the world. Besides India, world leaders from France, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Japan, Israel and the Philippines, attended the summit.It also saw the participation of representatives of NGOs, private businesses, philanthropical organisations and legislatures.News agency ANI cited people familiar with the matter that PM Modi said the democratic spirit, including respect for rule of law and pluralistic ethos, is ingrained in Indians.PM Modi also emphasised the need for democratic countries to deliver on values enshrined in their constitutions. He also outlined sensitivity, accountability, participation and reform orientation as four pillars of Indian democratic governance.The Prime Minister, according to ANI, stressed principles of democracy should also guide global governance and that given technology's ability to impact democracy positively or negatively, technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies.During the summit, PM Modi called for contribution from technology firms in preserving democratic societies and said it has the ability to impact democracy "positively or negatively."Biden in his opening remarks called on world leaders to end the "backward slide" of democracy around the globe. “Will we allow the backward slide of rights and democracy to continue unchecked? Or will we together -- together -- have a vision ... and courage to once more lead the march of human progress and human freedom forward?" he asked.Without naming China or Russia by name, Biden also repeatedly made a case that the US and like-minded allies need to show the world that democracies are a far better vehicle for societies than autocracies.Both Russia and China were not invited to the summit. In response to being left out, the ambassadors to the US from China and Russia wrote a joint essay describing the Biden administration as exhibiting a “Cold-War mentality” that will “stoke up ideological confrontation and a rift in the world.”Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan was also absent from the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-work-to-strengthen-democratic-values-globally-pm-modi-101639107320431.html
10-12-2021||India||Barrages on upper reaches of Mahanadi by Chhattisgarh has choked inflow to Odisha, alleges minister||Chhattisgarh has constructed around 516 barrages in the upper catchment areas of Mahanadi river resulting in the reduction of water inflow to the river by 37 per cent between 2005 and 2016 in the non-monsoon period, the Odisha government told the assembly on Thursday.Replying to a question raised by Congress MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati in Odisha Assembly, water resources minister Raghunandan Das said the inflow of Mahanadi river water into Hirakud reservoir has significantly dropped during the non-monsoon season due to the construction of barrages by Chhattisgarh.“While Hirakud reservoir has a requirement of 2 million acre-feet water during non-monsoon period, the water inflow dropped by around 4 per cent from 1991-21 to 2004-05 and by 37% from 2005-06 to 2015-16. In 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 flow of water during the non-monsoon period reduced by 65%, 61 % and 57% respectively. However, in 2019-20, the reduction in the flow of water was just 3%,” Das said. Incidentally, 61 of the 66 gates of Chhattisgarh’s Kalma barrage, situated along the border of Jharsuguda district, have been shut this winter resulting in an inflow of just 5100 cusecs of water to Hirakud reservoir.The river, which runs through at least 20 of Odisha’s 30 districts, fuels Odisha’s economy and agriculture as over 60% of the state’s 4.2 crore population depends on it. After a 25-km long earthen dam was constructed across the river at Hirakud area of Sambalpur district in 1953, the dammed water irrigates over 2.35 lakh hectares of cropland and generated 347.5 megawatts of hydropower for the state. Besides, six biodiversity hotspots in Odisha – including the Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, Chilika lake, Tikarpada sanctuary and Chandaka elephant reserve – directly depend on the river.Since 2016, Odisha and Chhatisgarh are locked in a bitter dispute over the former alleging reduction in water quantity in non-monsoon months by the construction of 6 industrial barrages - Kalma, Saradi, Basantpur, Mirauni, Sheorinarayan and Samoda, four of which have been completed - by the latter.In March 2018, the Centre constituted the Mahanadi Water Disputes tribunal under the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act-1956 to adjudicate the water dispute between Odisha and Chhatisgarh after the Supreme Court directed the Centre to form a tribunal. The three-member tribunal, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar with justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Indermit Kaur as its member, has been tasked with the job to determine water sharing among basin states on the basis of the overall availability of water in the complete Mahanadi basin, contribution and present utilisation of water resources in each state and the potential for future development.Though 21 meetings of the tribunal over the dispute have happened since its formation including its last meeting in September this year, they have failed to yield any result. “The common information format for sharing of information between states is yet to be finalised. The format is important as it deals with 61 subjects related to the dispute,” said Sudarshan Das, convenor of Mahanadi Bachao Andolan, a civil society initiative of Odisha on the Mahanadi water dispute.Das said the tribunal has so far been lacklustre as the hope of an interim order stopping any further construction on upper reaches of Mahanadi by Chhatisgarh has not happened. “Though the tenure of Mahanadi Water Disputes Tribunal has been extended up to March 11 2023, the dispute resolution is not going the right way. The central authorities like the CWC and the CGWA have not been very proactive. Political parties of Odisha including the BJD, the BJP and the Congress have also not been very vociferous in demanding a quicker and meaningful resolution that would ensure the lower reaches of Mahandi don’t run dry in non-monsoon months,” said Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barrages-on-upper-reaches-of-mahanadi-by-chhatisgarh-has-choked-inflow-to-odisha-alleges-minister-101639106569860.html
10-12-2021||India||PAC recommends review of DPRs of all new housing projects for govt employees||The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has recommended a review of the detailed project reports (DPRs) of all ongoing housing projects for government employees in New Delhi. It also highlighted a stock shortage in the general pool residential accommodation (GPRA) and delays in the completion of various redevelopment projects in the Capital.The parliamentary panel said the delays in redevelopment projects were caused by “lack of proper planning by the housing and urban affairs ministry”.In its report presented on Wednesday in the Lok Sabha on the functioning of the directorate of estates - which comes under the housing and urban affairs ministry - the parliamentary panel observed that several redevelopment projects for government accommodation were delayed.The delays, the panel said, were taking place because of a hold-up in the shifting of utilities; relocation of schools, community centres and dispensaries; obtaining approval from Delhi’s forest department and other agencies for replantation of trees; and multiple public interest litigations (PILs).“The committee feels that due to lack of proper planning on the part of the ministry, there has been an impasse,” the PAC report says. The panel recommended that preparatory work for relocation and shifting should take place simultaneously to ensure timely completion of the projects.“The committee, therefore, recommends that the DPRs of all the projects be reviewed, specific time frames prescribed for each task be carried out, and appropriate measures be taken urgently for expediting all necessary approvals,” the PAC said. To provide housing to its employees, the Centre is carrying out the redevelopment of seven government residential colonies in south Delhi - in Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Srinivaspuri, Kasturba Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Mohammadpur and Thyagraj Nagar. Close to 25,000 housing units along with a mega commercial complex is proposed as part of the ₹35,000 crore GPRA redevelopment projects, including a 14km elevated corridor around these colonies.The committee has asked the ministry to inform it about the project-wise steps taken, along with timelines, for augmenting the housing stock.The PAC said there is a shortage of about 36-37% in GPRA housing stock even as the demand for houses dropped from 98,789 in 2008 to 82,803 in September 2020.It also asked the ministry to inform it about the reason behind a sharp variation in the number of houses to be added to the government’s housing stock. As per the report, the ministry in August 2020 informed the committee that 4,599 houses were added and 30,000 were in the pipeline. But in July 2021, it said that 6,254 houses were added and around 26,000 were lined up.The committee also recommended geo-tagging of all government properties to ensure better monitoring and updating housing stock on real-time basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pac-recommends-review-of-dprs-of-all-new-housing-projects-for-govt-employees-101639105730599.html

10-12-2021||India||Mullaperiyar issue: Kerala wants Tamil Nadu not to release water in wee hours||The Kerala government has moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to Tamil Nadu not to release a huge quantity of water in the wee hours from the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam, saying it causes heavy damage to the people living downstream of the dam.In an application filed in the apex court, the Kerala government has also sought a direction to the Tamil Nadu government to control the water level by releasing water from the dam throughout the day instead of releasing a huge quantity of water at the wee hours without giving sufficient warning time.A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar is scheduled to hear on Friday the pleas which have raised issues about the dam, built in 1895 on the Periyar river in Idukki district of Kerala.The Kerala government, in its application filed through advocate G Prakash, has said that the supervisory committee is directed to act according to the interim directions of the apex court to avoid difficulties for the people who live downstream.It said that a ‘joint technical on-site committee for spillway release’, comprising of two members each from the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, be constituted to decide on the quantity and time of surplus discharge through spillway shutters to Kerala.The application said it should also be ensured that only based on the recommendation of the joint technical on-site committee, the surplus to Kerala would be effected with sufficient warning time to the district disaster management authority.“Due to the erratic release of the heavy volume of water, that too without any intimation during the wee hours of the day for the last more than one week created heavy damage to the people and their property who are living in the downstream of the Mullaperiyar dam,” the application said.It said the Kerala chief minister had sent a letter to the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for taking immediate action regarding the release of water.It said that the apex court had on October 28 ordered that for the time being, the parties would abide by the water level notified by the expert committee.The application said that from the last week of November onwards, the catchment area of the Mullaperiyar dam and the places in and around Idukki district experienced heavy rainfall which resulted in the increase of water level of the dam. It said that the chief secretary of Kerala had also sent a letter dated December 7 to the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu explaining the difficulties which the people, who live on the banks of the Periyar river, face due to the sudden discharge of water for the past one week especially at night by opening spillway without sufficient intimation and that too at the wee hours.“The heavy releases of water through the spillway that too without sufficient advance information has created undue hardship, physical and mental agony and loss of property to thousands of people living in the downstream of Mullaperiyar dam,” the application said.It said that to avoid this contingency, an on-site committee consisting of technical members of both the states can be constituted to take stock of this kind of a situation and the panel can decide as to how and when the water from the dam can be released without creating problems to the people living downstream and their property.The top court had on November 22 said that all the issues related to the dam would be heard on December 10.The Kerala government had earlier told the apex court that “no amount of rejuvenation” can perpetuate the dam and there is a limit to the number of years one can keep dams in service through maintenance and strengthening measures.It had said the only permanent solution for removing the “eternal threat owing to the safety concerns” of the dam and for protecting the safety of lakhs of people living the downstream of Mullaperiyar dam is to build a new dam in the downstream reaches of the existing dam.In an affidavit filed before the apex court, the Kerala government had urged that the proposal to fix the upper rule level of Mullaperiyar dam at 142 feet on September 20 as formulated by Tamil Nadu may be avoided.In its response to the affidavit filed by Kerala, the state of Tamil Nadu had said that “repeated assertion” of Kerala and petitioners from there in the pleas filed from time-to-time seek to decommission of the existing dam and construction of a new dam, which is “wholly impermissible” in the light of the apex court verdict on the safety of the dam.“The dam has been found to be hydrologically, structurally, and seismically safe,” Tamil Nadu had said.The Tamil Nadu government had also told the apex court that “repeated assertion” by Kerala to seek decommissioning of the dam is “wholly impermissible” as the dam is hydrologically, structurally, and seismically safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mullaperiyar-issue-kerala-wants-tamil-nadu-not-to-release-water-in-wee-hours-101639077880787.html
10-12-2021||India||Madras high court rejects cop’s plea to quash case filed by Dhoni||The Madras High Court on Thursday rejected a plea from IPS officer G Sampath Kumar to set aside the defamation proceedings initiated against him by cricketer M S Dhoni.Any order at this stage would certainly affect the progress of the main case pending from 2014, Justice N Seshasayee said and dismissed the petition from Kumar.Originally, Dhoni had filed a defamation suit claiming ₹100 crore towards damages from a TV media firm and others for allegedly telecasting malicious news that he was involved in betting, spot and match fixing of IPL matches, in 2014. He sought to restrain the defendants, including Kumar, who initially probed the IPL betting scam from issuing statements and publishing them.Dhoni , captain of the Chennai Super Kings IPS franchise, had submitted the defendants had been carrying highly defamatory, scandalous and libelous false reports and statements since February 11, 2014. The sole agenda of the defendants was somehow to malign and destroy his reputation in the eyes of the millions of his fans and cricket lovers all over the world. He prayed for a direction to the defendants to pay ₹100 crore towards damages.And Justice S Tamilvanan (now retired) granted the interim injunction earlier restraining the defendants from doing so.Aggrieved, Sampath Kumar filed a petition challenging the defamation suit in 2014. In his additional counter-affidavit filed recently, he contended that the suit was to gag him. That was the reason behind filing the suit here at the Madras High Court, whereas none of the other three defendants of the suit were based in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-rejects-cop-s-plea-to-quash-case-filed-by-dhoni-101639077826226.html

10-12-2021||India||NCERT pulled up for taking down manual on transgender-inclusiveness||While hearing compliance reports filed by various state and central departments on the guidelines to be followed by the LGBTQIA+ community, the Madras high court said the National Council of Educational Research And Training (NCERT) rightly posted material on its website to sensitise teachers but “in a very shocking development”, it was taken down within hours of its publication due to pressure from some quarters. Justice N Anand Venkatesh was hearing the case on December 6 in pursuant of his landmark judgment passed on June 7 to ensure the transgender community was protected from various quarters including those in consensual relationships from police harassment. The case pertained to a lesbian couple moving court seeking protection as they were in a consensual relationship and complained of being harassed by their parents who had filed FIRs with local police saying that their daughters were missing. The justice, in his orders, noted that some press reports stated that the concerned persons who had developed this material for NCERT were even transferred out to other departments. “This court is unable to understand the need for such a knee jerk reaction within hours of the material getting uploaded on the website. If someone really had a grievance, the same should have been addressed in a proper manner through proper consultation and meetings, and no one can be allowed to arm twist a state-run council into forcibly withdrawing a material that came out after a long study by a committee,” he said in the order. “It is quite unfortunate that such an important development was nipped in the bud.” He added that this incident serves as reminder that the court has to continuously follow-up to bring in changes in the education system. This court now expects the NCERT to come up with their recommendation based on the report submitted by a committee which had researched this material and file a status report before the next hearing posted for December 23. “The report of an expert body after a detailed study cannot be dumped just because a handful of persons are opposed to this very idea of recognising persons belonging to the community,” justice Venkatesh said. “In a democratic country like India, discussions and consultations must form the basis for any policy and pressure tactics cannot be allowed to shut down any policy, and if such an attitude is encouraged, it poses a greater danger to the fabric of this nation.” Meanwhile, the high court appreciated immediate steps taken by Tamil Nadu’s Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services and the state government for bringing in a specific amending clause to police ‘conduct rules’ pursuant to the previous orders passed by this court. “This new rule will be effectively instrumental in ensuring that the (transgender) Community does not suffer harassment at the hands of any police officer,” the court said. The justice added that regular sensitisation programmes will definitely help the police officers change their attitude towards the LGBTQIA+ Community and in future the new conduct rule will enable them to punish earring police officers in the future.The counsel appearing for the state government told the court that they were taking steps to come up with a transgender policy along with standard words and expressions to be used by the press while addressing the transgender community which they will submit during the next hearing on December 23.
10-12-2021||India||Telangana mines: Production hit as 75k workers go on strike against privatisation||Mining in 23 underground and 19 open cast coal mines belonging to the state-run Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) in northern Telangana districts came to a grinding halt on Thursday, with nearly 75,000 miners launching a 72-hour-long strike in protest against the central government’s decision to privatise four coal blocks in the region.The three-day strike is being spearheaded by Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham (TBGKS), a recognised trade union of the SCCL, affiliated to the ruling Telangana Rasthra Samithi. All the other major unions like Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and Hindustan Mazdoor Sangh (HMS) also joined the strike.TBGKS general secretary Miryala Raji Reddy said around 43,000 coal mine workers and employees, besides around 25,000 contract employees, struck the work, bringing the production of coal in the mines to a halt.The unions are protesting against the NDA government’s move to privatise four coal blocks -- Kalyan Khani block-6, Koyagudem block-3, Sathupalli block-3 and Shravanapalli, belonging to the SCCL.The Centre had already completed privatisation of first tranche of coal blocks in November last year. The bidding for the second tranche of coal mines privatisation is expected to be taken up next week, Raji Reddy said.He said the unions, among other things, also demanded the enhancement of age from 35 years to 40 years for dependents of medically invalidated and deceased employees.The coal mine workers at SCCL Ramagundam region in Peddapalli district took out a rally at the coal mines and raised slogans against the privatisation move. They stopped the mining operations by locking up the gates.Mild tension prevailed at Bhupalpally 8-incline Long-wall coalmine, when the management of the SCCL made an attempt to engage private workers to load coal into the trucks. The union leaders obstructed the private workers from entering the premises and the police had to enter the scene to pacify them.Similar protests were taken up at the SCCL mines at Srirampur, Bellampalli and Mandamarri coalmines in Adilabad district. “The Centre should unconditionally withdraw its proposal to privatise the profit-making coal mines of Singareni. The decision would affect the future of the workers and the very survival of the company is at stake,” AITUC general secretary Vasireddy Sitaramaiah said, addressing the agitating workers.The Singareni coal mines are spread over erstwhile districts of Adilabad, Karimnagar, Khammam, and Warangal in Telangana.
10-12-2021||India||High alert in Kerala after bird flu detection||The Kerala government on Thursday sounded a high alert in Alapuzha district after the state animal husbandry department confirmed bird flu (H5N1) influenza) in some samples sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Disease in Bhopal. Many ducks and local birds perished in the district last week, forcing authorities to rush samples to the Bhopal lab. A total of 140 samples were sent for test and 26 samples tested positive for bird flu. Veterinary officials said the culling of ducks would start in affected areas on Friday, and farmers will be compensated according to the government norms. “The government has instructed the district collector to take necessary measures,” said animal husbandry minister J Cinchu Rani in the state capital. Endowed with many backwaters and water bodies, farmers rear a duck in a big way in the district, which results in cases of bird flu regularly. Birds from other countries are reportedly the carriers of the virus. In Alapuzha and neighbouring Kottayam, duck rearing is an important business, and there is high demand for eggs and meat of the water bird, generally priced higher than poultry. Last year, too, the district reported the viral outbreak, but it was localized and contained. In 2016, at least 500,000 chickens and ducks were culled in Alapuzha and Pathanamthitta districts to control the outbreak. Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by an airborne virus in birds. It can spread to humans in rare conditions, and if it happens, it can trigger a person to person transmission, experts said. There are many variants of the virus and H7N9 is considered the dangerous among them, they added. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are many subtypes of the avian influenza virus, and only some of them will be dangerous to humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-alert-in-kerala-after-bird-flu-detection-101639077707328.html
10-12-2021||India||Kerala high court sends notice to Malayalam movie director over abusive dialogues||Expressing serious reservations over use of abusive languages in a recent Malayalam movie “Churuli”, the Kerala High Court on Thursday sent notice to the censor board, filmmaker and director. A single bench of Justice N Nagaresh made the oral observation after a portion of the movie was played out in the courtroom. The court ordered to send notice to all respondents and observed that dialogues in the movie were “atrocious”. A plea was filed the court last week by lawyer Peggy Fen in which he claimed that derogatory terms were used deliberately to attract more viewers and they were against moral views of the society. “Even though the movie invokes a sense of curiosity and mystery in the minds of viewers there is an overdose of foul language. Majority of the dialogues were filthy and obscene which are opposed to influence public morality,” the petitioner contended. He also said films as a form of art and entertainment tend to influence many in the society, especially youngsters. The petitioner also pointed out that since the outbreak of pandemic and subsequent strict restrictions in cinema talkies most families were hooked to the OTT platform and children normally access these platforms and can view such movies. When the language in the movie created a furore, the censor board said the copy released was not the one certified by it. The mystery film was released on OTT platform by Sony Liv on Nov 19. It was directed by award-winning director Lijo Jose Pellissery and screen play was written by S Harish. Known for his unconventional approach, Pellissery’s movie ‘Jallikettu’ was one of the entries to the Oscar last year. Pellissery did not respond to phone calls. Main casts of the movie are Chemban Vinod Jose, Vinay Fort and Joju Geroge. The story revolves around two cops who were sent to a desolate hamlet in a forest mainly inhabited by history-sheeters to nab a serial offender. Earlier when confronted with the foul language issue soon after the release, the crew had said the cinema revolved around such a story and it was natural such dialogues will arise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-sends-notice-to-malayalam-movie-director-over-abusive-dialogues-101639077704710.html
10-12-2021||India||Vegetable prices continue to soar across southern states after rains||Vegetable prices continue to soar in most southern states with a kilogram of tomato being sold at ₹100 and drumstick costing close to ₹200 per kg, according to local sellers, who cited damages to crops due to heavy rainfall in November as the reason for the sky-high prices.According to the India Meteorological Department, the November rainfall in Tamil Nadu was the highest since 1901, when recording of rainfall started in India.In Chennai, most vegetables were being sold for ₹100 or more, said R Soundararajan, adviser to the Koyambedu Wholesale Vegetable Traders.He said one kg of tomato in Chennai was selling anywhere between ₹90 and ₹120 while a kilo of drumstick was costing around ₹250. “Beans are being sold at ₹90, carrot and ladies’ fingers at ₹80 a kg each in the wholesale market,” he added.In neighbouring Kerala, a kg of tomato was being sold for ₹100 and drumstick for up to ₹200. “Drumstick, an essential ingredient in sambhar, was one of the cheapest in the market. But now we weigh it like gold. Before Diwali one kg of the vegetable would cost ₹40 and now it is between ₹140 and ₹180,” said P Murugan, a vegetable vendor in Palayam market in the state capital.He added that in the first week of November, the retail price of tomato was ₹45 and now it is between ₹80 and ₹100 a kg. Vegetable vendors blame the short supply of produce from neighbouring Tamil Nadu, which weathered heavy rains last month, for the soaring prices. Kerala depends on supply from its neighbour to meet its demand of fruits, vegetables and poultry products.Farmers said vegetable production in Kerala declined sharply due to unseasonal heavy downpour in the last two months. According to IMD data, Kerala received 3,523.3 mm of rainfall from October 1 to November 24 and it was slightly higher than the 2018 tally of 3,518. 9 mm. The highest rainfall in the state was clocked at 4,257 mm in 1961, IMD said.Such has been the shortage in the southern states that both Kerala and Tamil Nadu government have started selling vegetables.With prices of vegetables, particularly tomatoes, soaring due to the northeast monsoon downpour, the Tamil Nadu government began selling tomatoes for ₹85 to ₹100 per kg through state-run farm fresh outlets in 12 districts, including Chennai from the last week of November.The state cooperatives department said in a statement that they are procuring 15 metric tonnes of tomatoes every day for selling through government outlets. In the last week of November, tomatoes had touched ₹140 a kg in retail markets of Tamil Nadu, which primarily gets tomato supply from two regions in Karnataka and three regions in Andhra Pradesh.In November second week, the government-controlled Kerala Fruits and Vegetable Promotion Council had intervened in the market by procuring vegetables directly from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, officials said. It resulted in some relief for more than a week and prices came down by 30-40% but it went up again in last two weeks, local residents in Thiruvananthapuram said.“We know prices again went up. We will make direct procurement from outside and distribute it to outlets to control prices,” said state agriculture minister P Prasad, adding that the Kerala government will take strict action against hoarders and others who engineer price hike.In Hyderabad, vegetable prices have shot up again this week, after a brief respite early last month. Tomatoes, which were being sold at ₹42 per kg on November 9, jumped up to ₹100 per kg in Mehdipatnam Rythu Bazar, a state-run vegetable market, and ₹120 in open markets on November 19, when the city witnessed heavy rains. On Thursday, tomatoes were again being sold at ₹80 a kg, though the official rate at the Mehdipatnam Rythu Bazar, still showed ₹50.“What is displayed at the Rythu Bazars is the wholesale price. But in the retail market, the prices are at least 20-25% more,” an official at the Rythu Bazar said.Similarly, the cost of ladies’ fingers on Thursday at the government-fixed rate was ₹65, but it was being sold at ₹80 a kg and more in open markets. “In the supermarkets, we have to shell off ₹100 for a kg of bhindi (ladies’ fingers). Even the quality is not good,” said S Sunitha, a homemaker.The price of ridge gourd and ivy gourd in the Rythu Bazar on Thursday was ₹65 per kg, but in the open market, it was being sold for around ₹80. Same is the case with cluster beans and French beans, which are priced at ₹65 a kg.“We have stopped bringing other vegetables like carrot, beet root, bottle gourd and cucumber to the markets, because they are very costly. If there are no takers, we would be put to heavy losses,” said a vegetable vendor at a weekly market in Somajiguda.In Bengaluru, a kg of tomato would cost anywhere between ₹98 and ₹110 even as the wholesale prices of the vegetable stood at ₹55, said Manan, the manager of fruit and vegetable outlet, Safal.Prices of several vegetables have come down in the city in recent weeks, the retailer said. “Coriander is being sold at around ₹30 per bunch, onions at ₹38 to ₹45 per kg while ladies’ fingers cost between ₹88 and ₹100 per kg,” he said.(With inputs from bureaus in Bengaluru and Hyderabad)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vegetable-prices-continue-to-soar-across-southern-states-after-rains-101639077701164.html
10-12-2021||India||State has accounted for 10% samples sent for sequencing: Data||Karnataka has accounted for almost 10 per cent of the total samples sent to government-approved labs for genome sequencing across the country between July 1 and December 5, the state health department said on Thursday.Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said that the state has sent 2,149 samples for sequencing to Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) laboratories across India. According to the INSACOG data, around 21,669 samples were sent for genome sequencing from all states between July 1 and December 5 this year.Sudhakar further said that if the number of samples sent for sequencing to private labs during the same period was added, the total samples from the state stand at 6,279. Around 4,124 samples collected from various BBMP wards in Bengaluru were sent for sequencing to a private facility Strand Life Sequences laboratory, he added. Talking about the samples of the contacts of the two patients who tested positive for Omicron, Sudhakar said their genomic sequence report is yet to arrive. “New infections have been discovered in other states. The primary and secondary contacts of the infected, too, are found to have no problems or symptoms. The infected are being treated at the Bowring Hospital. Those who came in contact with the ‘Omicron’ infected have received both vaccine doses,” Dr Sudhakar said.As of now, labs at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) are the only two laboratories in Karnataka that have been approved by INSACOG to conduct genomic sequencing. Since the Union government has ordered state governments to send sequencing samples only to government-approved labs, the pressure is expected to mount on NCBS and NIMHANS. Karnataka chief minister Bommai said on Wednesday that foreseeing an increase in Covid-19 cases, the government had already initiated action to establish genome sequencing labs in the state, and the state health secretary Anil Kumar has been instructed to look into the needs of procuring the necessary equipment and experts for the purpose.During the second wave of Covid-19, the state government had said six genome sequencing labs were being set up at Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Hubballi, Mangaluru and Vijayapura. “We have taken measures to set up genomic sequencing labs. It requires expert facilities and lab equipment. Instructions have been given to the Health Secretary in this regard,” Bommai said in response to a question on increasing the number of genomic sequencing labs in the state on Wednesday.An official of the health department, who didn’t want to be named, said that the government would continue to use the private labs and the labs under construction to increase sequencing in the state, and for higher reference, samples are also being sent to NCBS or NIMHANS. Two cases of Omicron infections were detected in the state last week. One is a South African national who has left the country after testing negative, while the other is a local person, a doctor with no travel history. The second patient who got a reinfection of Covid-19, is at a government hospital.

Technology would enable us to reach any corner of the world. We are in an advantageous situation as the state in general and Bengaluru, in particular, are at the forefront of technological development. We can make the entire world look towards India through the Ayush system,” said Narayan.“There lies a knowledge in our ancient science about attaining overall health through treatments of Ayush system. Now, modern technology can be made use of to cater to the health needs and to develop a holistic outlook,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/technology-helps-in-effective-delivery-of-health-services-karnataka-minister-101639077285101.html
10-12-2021||India||Karnataka high court asks for plan on stray dogs in city’s Cubbon Park||The Karnataka high court on Thursday directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to produce an action plan to control street dogs inside the city’s Cubbon Park and restrictions to be put on pet dogs brought to the park by their owners. A division bench of Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum while hearing a petition filed by Cubbon Park Walkers Association, regarding alleged illegal constructions inside the park, said, “We want to take suo-motu cognizance regarding Cubbon park. How are these dogs permitted in a public place? It affects the morning walkers. People who bring their dogs don’t even chain them, they leave them open, and there is no restriction in the movement for the public inside the park, no entrance fee or nothing is charged, why? How are these dogs permitted in a public place?” Responding to the petition, a BBMP official said that dogs are allowed in the park only Sundays, however, the bench observed that hundreds of dogs are being fed inside Cubbon Park. “... hundreds of dogs just collect at one place, and when you pass by them, they become very furious, they even chase,” the bench observed orally. The bench also noted that rules governing pet owners should be implemented strictly. The bench also pointed out that “pet owners are not following the right etiquette while bringing their dogs to the park. It is nowhere permitted, if you are keeping a dog you have to maintain it. It is not that you keep your house clean and dirty outside, it is difficult to walk on the road inside Cubbon Park. If they are not cleaned every day, you cannot walk because of these dogs”. (What does this mean?)Chief Justice Awasthi went on to recollect his visit to Europe and the etiquettes found among dog owners there. “Once I had an occasion to visit Europe and I was standing on the window of my hotel in the early morning. Hardly any people were there on the road, one person came with his dog, and the dog eased out in the middle of the road, and that person removed a packet from his pocket, and he took out a plastic packet and put the poop in the packet with his hand and threw it in the dustbin. I was just watching and said that is civilization. This is done by everyone there,” he said. “So unfortunate, educated people who are proud of keeping very good species of dogs, and when you talk to them they will tell you the pedigree of the dogs and then what they do on the roads,” the CJ added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-asks-for-plan-on-stray-dogs-in-city-s-cubbon-park-101639077281089.html
10-12-2021||India||Deaths due to manual scavengingcontinue despite government’s Parliament stance||At the start of this year, 82-year-old Buranuddin lost his elder son, his son-in-law and nephew in an accident of manual scavenging in Kalaburagi district, about 573 kms from Bengaluru. His elder son Lal Ahmed and nephew Rasheed Ahmed died gasping for breath after being asked to remove a clog in a drain at Kailasnagar, under 2 kms from the city corporation office.. The son-in-law Rafique also died while Buranuddin’s youngest son survived after battling for life for days. They all worked for the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB). Despite the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act, 2013), which prohibits the practice of manual scavenging, it is prevalent across the country, with many like Buranuddin suffering daily. “They (administrative authorities) gave us compensation of ₹10 lakh, but the daughter in law took it and went to her parents home. Raju (youngest son) got just ₹50,000, and his job also has not been made permanent. Not much has happened for us,” Burhanuddin told Hindustan Times on Thursday. In Karnataka, the advent of social media has brought to light several such instances. In October, activist and advocate Vinay Sreenivasa complained that one contractor of the Bengaluru Smart City project was using manual scavengers to clear out clogs in drains, demonstrating the widespread prevalence of the practice even in cities where administrators and governments thump their chests to portray the prowess of the city in technology, startups and aerospace among other sectors to appropriate its aspirations of being called a “global city”. But the civic apathy in Bengaluru precedes its prowess in technology as poor quality of roads and public infrastructure, inefficient management of garbage, toxic and foaming lakes, unplanned expansion and lack of accountability have become the norm, said, activists. On Tuesday, the Union government told the Parliament that there were no deaths due to manual scavenging. “No deaths have been reported due to engaging in Manual Scavenging (which is lifting of human excreta from unsanitary latrines as defined in Section 2 (1) (g) of the MS Act 2013). However, 321 persons have died due to accidents while undertaking hazardous cleaning of sewer and septic tanks during the last five years,” the Centre said in a response to the Lok Sabha. Activists in Karnataka and other places have criticised the union government for “misleading the parliament”. Bezwada Wilson, the national convener of the Safai Karamchari Andolan, said that at least 45 people have died due to manual scavenging in 2021 alone, with Karnataka accounting for at least five deaths. “We may have succeeded in sending people to space, but we still have a long way to go when it comes to understanding human dignity. Manual scavenging involves people cleaning human excreta. Indian society, which is mainly guided by the caste system, has thrust this practice on people from specific communities, who are from the ‘untouchable’ castes,” according to the Safai Karamchari Andolan. Wilson said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has focused on Swachh Bharat and built toilets, but the background of who cleans them continues to fuel this practice. “Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir and several other places continue this practice (manual scavenging). Under Modi and Swachha Bharat, there is a focus on building toilets but nothing to liberate or rehabilitate manual scavengers. The dry latrines have not been replaced,” Wilson said. He said that the Indian government and state administrations have barely spent money on mechanization for scavenging. “The government’s focus is on building roads and connectivity but not on sewage or septic tanks. It’s embedded in their minds that there is an untouchable caste meant to clean these tanks,” he said. The Union government acknowledged the prevalence of caste in manual scavengers that has far deeper implications on the social fabric. In a response to the Rajya Sabha on December 1, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale said that of the 43,797 persons among the total 58,098 identified in manual scavenging, caste data shows that over 42,500 or a staggering 97.25% are from communities classified as Scheduled Caste. Another 421 are from Scheduled Tribes, a similar number from communities classified as other backward classes. Calling such deaths as “accidents”, activists said is nothing but denial by “image-conscious” governments. “All the deaths have happened inside the manhole and not an accident and anyone calling it one has to be put behind bars,” said Wilson. He also said that parliamentarians and other elected representatives should prevent lying as the deaths, activists say, are “culpable homicide or murder” happening 10ft under the roads. An app was launched by then union minister for social justice and empowerment, Thaawarchand Gehlot called “Swachhata Abhiyan” to create a database on location of unsanitary latrines and identifying manual scavengers who can be rehabilitated. However, Siddharth KJ, a member of the Safai Karamchari Kaaval Samithi, said that the app where the documents are to be uploaded to identify, extend benefits and rehabilitate manual scavengers are being hit by one hurdle after another. “They have made the process very complicated and introduced components that are not part of the MS Act 2013. Because of which those who are still working are not being identified,” he said. SK Quasim, who works with the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) as a suction machine operator, was also a manual scavenger for many of his 30-year service. However, he has still not been able to get the loan amount despite submitting all his documents eight months ago to seek the One Time Cash Assistance (OTCA) announced by the government. Earlier this year, the Karnataka high court had to intervene and ask local authorities to survey latrines and manual scavengers. According to an official from Karnataka Safai Karamchari Commission, a statutory body that looks into the welfare of this section of people, the survey began on November 10. “We are using nation guidelines for the survey. Both urban and rural administrations have begun the survey and is expected to be completed by February,” said the official, requesting not to be named. He said that there are over 5,000 manual scavengers according to the 2013-14 survey. However, activists said that the number is at least 20 times that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-due-to-manual-scavengingcontinue-despite-government-s-parliament-stance-101639077222094.html

According to a statement, the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), headed by Dr MK Sudarshan, advised the government that there is no need for any panic and the Covid situation in the state is comparatively under control. “A decision on adopting new restrictions, especially to restrict the celebrations and large public gatherings and whether to impose night curfew and other norms during the Christmas festivities and New Year celebrations would be taken after reviewing the prevailing situation after a week,” CM Bommai said. “Regarding Covid, our Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) head Dr MK Sudarshan, has informed us about the current situation, and he has shared details about the Omicron variant. According to him, looking at the current figures and the positivity rate, there is no need for any major concern or worry,” he added. He further added that the government has no intention to implement a night curfew in the state in the wake of Omicron fears. “People need not panic about the new coronavirus variant Omicron. The decision on imposing night curfew will be taken after a week,” Bommai stated. Since most of the recent clusters were reported in educational institutions, the chief minister said that the government’s focus remains on Covid-19 clusters in educational institutions and hostels. Steps to reduce visitors, regular sanitisation of the premises, ensuring double-dose vaccination for hotel canteen staff and preparing isolation rooms are required, he added. “Special guidelines or standard operating procedures (SOP) for cluster management and hostels will be issued soon,” Bommai said. “We have already given similar guidelines for cluster management and have said that if there are more than three positive cases in a place, it will be declared clusters, and such measures will continue. Guidelines for students from Kerala, such as double dose vaccines or RT-PCR tests after arriving in Karnataka. will remain,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Bommai received an “informal” briefing about the Covid-19 situation in Karnataka from officials and discussed issues such as management of clusters and the Omicron variant. Intensive surveillance of testing at the inter-state borders of Karnataka-Kerala and Karnataka-Maharashtra would continue, Bommai said. The Chief Minister said his cabinet colleagues have suggested that a special drive to vaccinate people could be taken in the coming days as was done in May and June months of the second wave.Today’s Covid figures||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-wait-for-another-week-before-issuing-new-norms-karnataka-cm-101639077220094.html

I know over 20-25 years she has got a particular approach, we have approach. It is good for the country if the two approaches converge,” Chidambaram said at press conference here.His statement came in the backdrop of Banerjee’s recent remarks in Mumbai questioning the very existence of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA).Queried about Raut’s statement, he said. “I have read Sanjay Raut’s statement, I think he has made a very responsible statement. What Raut says is that we need a non-BJP opposition in the country and the Congress must take a lead and bring together all UPA partners.” “I think that is a very sensible statement. I fully agree with Sanjay Raut. I think it is the correct initiative. We are ready to try but two hands must clap,” Chidambaram added.Raut, after meeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Tuesday, had said no mega alliance against the BJP could be thought of without the grand old party.Asked about an alliance between the Goa Forward Party and the Congress for the 2022 Assembly polls in the coastal state, Chidambaram said “The word alliance is used indiscriminately.” The former Union minister is the Congress’s senior observer for the Goa Assembly polls.“So far, we had one party leader (GFP chief) Vijai Sardesai who came to Delhi and said, “in order to defeat the BJP, my party offers support to the Congress’. Rahul Gandhi said we accept the support. All other details have to be discussed further,” Chidambaram said.He added his party will soon announce the first list of candidates for the Goa polls scheduled in early 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-congress-political-approach-must-converge-says-chidambaram-101639077041734.html
10-12-2021||India||Coonoor helicopter crash: Second tragedy involving top-of-line Mi-17V5||Wednesday’s tragic Mi-17V5 crash near Coonoor was the second high-profile accident involving the Indian Air Force’s latest helicopter inducted in 2012, and the air force currently operates around 145 such Russian-origin choppers that are known to be advanced, reliable and safe, IAF officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The twin-engine Mi-17V5 is the latest version of Mi-17 helicopter operated by IAF. India contracted a total of 151 Mi-17V5 helicopters from Russia in two separate deals. At least six Mi-17V5s have been lost in accidents since their induction began around a decade ago.On February 27, 2019, a day after the IAF bombed a terror base in Pakistan’s Balakot, an air force unit accidentally shot down a Mi-17V5 helicopter in friendly fire near Srinagar. The helicopter came down the day Pakistan launched its fighter jets to target Indian installations in Jammu and Kashmir in response to the Balakot airstrike.A surface-to-air missile hit the utility helicopter, killing six IAF personnel on-board and a civilian on ground and raising questions about whether the ground crew, including air traffic controllers, had followed standard operating procedures.IAF was on its highest alert levels that day as it expected Pakistan to respond to the unprecedented peacetime cross-border airstrike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot on February 26.The reliability of the Mi-17V5 helicopters cannot be doubted, said Air Chief Marshal Fali Major (retd), a former IAF chief and helicopter pilot. He had commissioned the first squadron of the air force’s older Mi-17 helicopters.“I have flown thousands of hours on the Mi-17 helicopters. Its latest version, the Mi-17V5, is a rugged, reliable and advanced platform. I have great respect for the helicopter. I am amazed how it went down. The inquiry ordered will look into every possible aspect of the crash,” Major said. He said the Mi-17V5 had the best safety record in IAF service.Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, who is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, has logged close to 7,000 flying hours in his 39-year career and operated in challenging sectors such as Siachen, the Northeast, Uttarakhand, the western sector and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is one of the most competent officers in the IAF to head the tri-services inquiry, officials said.Developed by Russian Helicopters, the Mi-17V5 is designed to carry personnel, cargo and equipment. The Mi-17V5 can carry a load of around four tonne in a full cargo role. It can also insert assault forces behind the enemy lines, a role frequently demonstrated by the IAF during military exercises.The helicopter is equipped with modern avionics, a self-defence system and other advanced features that enhance its survivability. The Mi-17V5, which has an armoured cockpit, can be fitted with rockets, cannons and small arms for carrying out offensive roles. It has a service ceiling of 6,000 metres, top speed of 250kmph and a maximum range of around 1,180km with additional fuel tanks.“Any aircraft accident is shocking. The Mi-17V5 has a good flight safety record, it’s a reliable machine and pilots swear by it,” Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), former additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies, said on Wednesday.The helicopter, capable of day and night missions in adverse weather conditions, has been extensively used in the Ladakh sector where India and China have been locked in a lingering border standoff since May 2020.
10-12-2021||India||Coonoor helicopter crash: ‘Shocked’, 'inconsolable' as families face sudden loss||At 8:45am on Wednesday, 27-year-old Lance Naik Boggala Sai Teja was on a video call with his wife Shyamala, in the village of Madanapelle in Andhra Pradesh’s Chitoor. It was a routine phone call -- almost every morning, Teja would speak to his wife and spend time virtually with their two children, Mokshagna (5) and Dakshini (2). But, on Wednesday, within hours of their conversation, Madanpelle village was in mourning, with Teja one of the 13 people killed in the helicopter crash in Coonoor in Tamil Nadu that also took the lives of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and his wife Madhulika.The grief were not limited to Madanpelle -- from Agra in Uttar Pradesh to Thrissur in Tamil Nadu to Takdah in the Darjeeling hills, communities came together in mourning, remembering their favourite sons.The call on Wednesday morning was a short one, Teja’s uncle B Sudarshan told HT. “He told his wife that he wanted to see his daughter, but went off very quickly because he had to accompany his boss to Tamil Nadu. He was appointed as the General’s personal security officer only seven months ago. Even his younger brother is a soldier posted in Sikkim,” Sudarshan said.In Thrissur, the family of 37-year-old Junior Warrant Officer A Pradeep Kumar still hasn’t mustered up the courage to convey to his ailing father, AV Radhakrishnan, on a ventilator for the past five days, that their son is no more. “He called up his mother on Wednesday morning, saying he was on an important trip accompanying the CDS and promised her he will be there in the weekend to look after his father,” said his brother A Prasad, now camping in Coimbatore. Prasad recounted that Kumar was part of several rescue operations, including the Uttarakhand floods of 2013 and the Kerala floods in 2018. That year, the IAF rescue team he was part of received a commendation from the President for their work.In the coal town of Talcher in Odisha, the family of 35-year-old junior warrant officer Rana Pratap Das was waiting for him to come home early next year. “He sounded upbeat and asked me what my plans for January next year were when he would be home. Till Wednesday evening we did not know that he was in the ill-fated Mi17-V5 chopper that crashed till we got information from IAF. For several hours I could not even venture to tell his parents about the death of their only son,” said his brother-in-law Sankalp Das.In Darjeeling’s Takdah, the family of 40-year-old havildar Satpal Rai, another personal security officer, was waiting not just for him to come home, but to retire.“Satpal wanted to take early retirement but General Rawat did not let him leave, saying they would retire together in 2024,” said Mandira Rai, the soldier’s wife.When Rai, whose father similarly served in the Indian Army and one of whose brothers is also serving the forces, spoke to his wife on Wednesday morning, they talked about him staying home and starting a business. “He said he would call me again after reaching Wellington. It was Diwali when I saw him last. When he came home he said he would retire and start a business. I have lost my husband but I am proud. He died for the country,” Mandira Rai said.Surendra Singh Chauhan, 74, is still unable to comprehend the tragedy that has taken from him his son, 42-year-old Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan, who was flying the ill-fated helicopter. Sitting in one corner of his Agra home, Chauhan said that the first time they found out about the tragedy was from television at about 6.30pm on Wednesday. “We could not get any official confirmation about the death from the Indian Air Force on Wednesday. My son-in-law in Mumbai left for Coimbatore where my son was posted,” he said.Chauhan said that his son was soft spoken, and close to the entire family. He spent several years away from home, studying first in Gwalior, then Sainik School in Rewa, and then joining NDA. “He last came home on Raksha Bandhan this year after 31 years. It was the last time that his three sisters tied a Rakhi to him. We are all shattered,” Chauhan said.(Inputs from Srinivasa Rao, Ramesh Babu, Pramod Giri, and Hemendra Chaturvedi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coonoor-helicopter-crash-families-face-sudden-loss-101639076800443.html
10-12-2021||India||Coonoor helicopter crash: Black box found, cause of accident under probe||The Indian Air Force Mi-17V5 helicopter that crashed near Coonoor on Wednesday took from the Sulur air base at 11.48am with 14 people on board including chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and his wife Madhulika Raje Singh Rawat, and it was scheduled to land at the helipad at the Wellington golf course at 12.15pm where a three-star general was waiting to receive them, officials familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The air traffic control at Sulur, however, lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08pm, 20 minutes after it took off, defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament in a statement on one of India’s worst air mishaps that took the life of the country’s most senior military commander. The helicopter was seven minutes away from its destination.Rawat was on a visit to the prestigious Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to address the faculty and student officers undergoing a one-year course there. The staff course at the tri-services institution is known to further career progression of young officers from the army, air force, and navy.DSSC commandant Lieutenant General Manmohan Jeet Singh Kahlon, who was commissioned in the armoured corps and has also flown army helicopters, and his staff were waiting at the helipad to receive Rawat.There were tense moments at the Wellington helipad when the Russian-origin Mi-17V5 helicopter, a reliable flying machine, did not land at its scheduled time or even minutes later, the officials said.At this point, it is not clear what went wrong with the helicopter in the final moments of the crash though the area where it went down did not have good visibility. A short video clip, shot by tourists in the area, captured the last moments. The video showed the low-flying helicopter penetrate dense mist over a hill. It did not capture the crash but the audio recorded a loud bang.A three-star IAF officer is heading the inquiry into the crash.Search crews on Thursday recovered the helicopter’s black box that could give vital clues about what went wrong. The black box, which consists of the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), is a crash survivable unit.While the FDR records vital information including altitude, speed, vertical acceleration and other technical data including instrument readings, the CVR contains crew communications.The focus of the team investigating the crash will be on decrypting the black box data, a laborious exercise that could take days, the officials said.Accessing the data held in the black box will depend on its condition, said Air Chief Marshal Fali Major (retd), a former IAF chief and helicopter pilot.“If the black box is not damaged, decrypting it may not take much time. It could be done in a few days. But if it was damaged in the crash, the IAF may have to send it to Russia to decrypt the data and piece together what happened. It will give vital information on all technical parameters,” Major said.IAF had to send the damaged black box of a C-130J special operations aircraft that crashed near Gwalior in March 2014 to the US as it did not have the means to retrieve the data within the country. A C-130J flew the mortal remains of the crash victims from Sulur to Palam on Thursday evening.Major cautioned against speculating on the reasons behind the helicopter crash, and said it was best to wait for the investigators to come out with their findings.The chopper was flown by Wing Commander PS Chauhan, the commanding officer of Sulur-based 109 Helicopter Unit, and his co-pilot Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh. Chauhan was commissioned in June 2002, while Singh joined service in June 2015. The other two IAF personnel on board were junior warrant officers Rana Pratap Das and A Pradeep, who had joined the air force in June 2006 and January 2004 respectively.
10-12-2021||India||Demand for legally guaranteed MSP could put fiscal strain, experts warn||Ensuring minimum support prices (MSPs) for a slew of agricultural commodities produced over two seasons a year, a key demand of farmers, will require higher government subsidies, which could have implications for the fiscal deficit and ramifications at the World Trade Organisation, analysts said.In a key concession to protesting farm unions, the Union government has proposed to set up a committee “mandated” to ensure Indian farmers get MSP for their produce. Farmers have demanded a legislation to make support prices a legal right.MSP is a federally fixed floor rate for farm produce to avoid distress sale. Since the government buys sufficiently large quantities of cereals at declared MSPs, these are not always available for commodities such as oilseeds, corn or pulses.Distress selling of farm produce and price volatility in non-cereals have been a major gripe among cultivators.If the government was to bring a law to guarantee MSP, which is unlikely, analysts said, state-owned agencies may end up procuring large quantities of farm produce so that the market price settles at MSP levels.“Suppose the government were to buy the marketable surplus of 23 main agricultural commodities grown by farmers, then the federal food subsidy bill could go up to about ₹9-9.5 lakh crore,” said Ashok Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. That’s up five times from current levels of ₹1.7 lakh crore.Experts are still unsure of reliable administrative ways to ensure MSPs for farmers without concomitant costs.Economist NR Bhanumurthy of the Dr BR Ambedkar School of Economics University, Bengaluru, said he did not think a legal guarantee for support prices that cuts away from market forces of demand and supply would be practical.“It will be a huge fiscal shock and the government cannot keep tinkering with the markets,” Bhanumurthy said, adding, “Input support measures, such as cash transfers, are better than output support measures.”Some economists, such as PK Joshi, the former chief of the International Food Policy Research Institute, have argued that a price deficiency payment system could be an option, whereby the government pays the difference between declared MSPs and market rates to farmersThis option was implemented under the name Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana by the Madhya Pradesh government on a pilot basis in the 2017-18 kharif season but was later abandoned.Joshi was named as one of the members of a panel appointed by the Supreme Court to look into the three controversial agri reform laws that were repealed this month after 14-month-long protests from farmers. The farm groups refused to engage with the panel on the grounds that the people on it had, in their stated positions, already come out in support of the laws the protesting cultivators opposed.One key issue with the price deficiency payment option was that farmers and traders could rig the system by settling for lower prices so that the government makes good the shortfall between market rates and MSP. Moreover, inferior quality produce could qualify for MSP rates under this system, as was evident in Madhya Pradesh’s pilot project.MSPs, which began with the Green Revolution, are set such that they offer 50% returns over cost but mainly benefit paddy and wheat growers because the government procures only these two commodities in sufficiently large quantities.Indian farmers receive lower-than-international prices for much of their produce because of increasing costs of cultivation, inadequate markets and the government’s policy to keep food prices low. This has worsened agriculture’s terms of trade, measured as a ratio of prices of agri-products to prices of manufactured items. The crisis, therefore, is not one of low production, but of low prices, experts say.MSPs are linked to cultivation costs, which are increased every year. They also have a bearing on inflation.Every 1 percentage point increase in MSPs leads to a 15-basis point increase in inflation, according to Nomura economist Sonal Varma. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Economists say an MSP mechanism that ignores dynamics, such as demand and global prices, and creates distortions. If it is not profitable for private traders to buy at federally fixed MSP, when demand is low, then the private sector will simply exit the markets, they argue.In such a scenario, the government simply cannot be a monopoly buyer of all produce.The government already procures surplus quantities of rice and wheat, which often become unmanageable. The government on average holds at least 70 million tonnes of rice and wheat in federal stocks, whereas food-security norms require reserves of 41.1 million tonnes as of July and 30.7 million tonnes as of October each year.Economists argue that if MSP is made mandatory, then India’s agricultural exports could become non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices. No trader would want to buy at a higher price and export at a lower rate.According to economist Ashok Gulati, the cost of procuring, storing and distributing rice to the poor comes to about ₹37 a kg. For wheat, it is around ₹27 a kg. The cost to company (CTC) of labour of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is six to eight times higher than private labour. Therefore, market prices of rice and wheat are much lower than what it costs the FCI to buy them.Gulati was also a part of the SC-appointed panel the cultivators declined to engage with.The MSP policy benefits farmers only in a handful of states, according to government data.The 70th round of National Sample Survey showed only 13.5% of paddy growers and 16.2% of wheat growers actually received MSPs.Experts also say that while MSPs have incentivised foodgrains over other crops, they have given rise to serious imbalances of water and land resources and shifted land away from crops, such as pulses and oilseeds, necessitating costly imports. They add that MSPs, as administered prices, tend to distort market prices by often ignoring the demand side, international prices, export competitiveness, and ecological impacts of crops such as paddy.“Support to farmers can never be in question. But support in the form of MSP, which is market-distorting, raises questions, such as ‘whether can we move to other ways of supporting farmers that cause less collateral damage,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at New Delhi’s Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.
10-12-2021||India||HC rebukes Ahmedabad municipal corporation over removal of non-veg food stalls||The Gujarat high court on Thursday rebuked the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for removing stalls of street vendors selling non-vegetarian food, and wondered what the civic body had to do with people’s food choices.“How can you decide what people should eat? Suddenly because someone in power thinks that this is what they want to do? Tomorrow you will decide what I should eat outside my house?,” a single-judge bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav observed.The HC was hearing a petition filed by 20 street vendors, mainly egg and non-vegetarian food stall owners, but also fruit and vegetable sellers, challenging AMC’s action and the non-implementation of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, which, among other things, aims to protect legitimate street vendors from harassment by police and civic authorities.The judge added, “Ask your Corporation Commissioner to be present! How do you dare indiscriminately pick up people?”The judge asked whether AMC was following the wishes of the party in power. “Tomorrow they will tell me that I should not consume sugarcane juice because it might cause diabetes or that coffee is bad for my health.”Between November 9 and 12, the municipal corporations of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Junagadh and Bhavnagar issued oral directives to officials to remove stalls and kiosks selling non-vegetarian food, citing religious sentiments, the health hazard posed by the smoke emanating from the stalls, and traffic snarls.The Vadodara Municipal Corporation said last monththat the “public display of meat, fish, eggs hurts religious sentiments” and that it “should not be visible. ” “It hurts the religious sentiments of Hindus on seeing non-veg food when they pass by the road,” Rajkot Mayor Pradip Dav said on November 9, while issuing the directive.Later, all corporations passed off their moves as part of an anti-encroachment drive.Justice Vaishnav asserted, “You don’t like non-veg food, it is your outlook. How can you decide what people should eat outside? How can you stop people from eating what they want?”When AMC claimed that the action was not targeted at stalls selling non-vegetarian food but those encroaching the streets and creating traffic snarls, the court instructed the civic body to release within 24 hours the seized goods of the vendors.The petitioners, represented by advocate Ronith Joy, pointed out that AMC confiscated their goods, including stalls, kiosks and other material, during the “anti-encroachment” drive. There are 125,000 street vendors in Ahmedabad city.The petitioners argued that they could not be summarily uprooted without providing them alternatives as envisaged in the 2014 street vendors law. They pointed out that the legislation has not been implemented in Gujarat.The law envisages the constitution of a 19-member Town Vending Committee by all municipal corporations with adequate representation of the vendors. This committee is required to conduct a survey and identify hawking and no-hawking zones.The petitioners also challenged the “deplorable, illegal, and unjust action” of AMC and the state government “in seizing the laaris/carts and other ancillary equipment/apparatus of the Petitioners coupled with the raw materials used to prepare food/snacks for consumption without following due process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rebukes-ahmedabad-municipal-corporation-over-removal-of-non-veg-food-stalls-101639076201424.html
10-12-2021||India||Odia officer killed in Coonoor crash was planning to visit home next month||Two days before his death, junior warrants officer of IAF Rana Pratap Das was making plans to visit his home in the colliery town of Talcher in Angul district where his ageing parents live.Das, 35, who was among the 13 people killed in the IAF chopper crash at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday that also led to the death of chief of defence staff, General Bipin Rawat, wanted to visit his ailing parents Sribatsa Das and Sushma Das in Krushnachandrapur village of Talcher. “He sounded upbeat and asked me what my plans were for January next year when he would be home,” said his brother-in-law Sankalp Das, a leader of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha. “Till evening we did not know that he was there in the ill-fated chopper that crashed in Coonoor till we got information from IAF. For several hours I could not even venture to tell his parents about the death of their only son.”After his parents and sister got to know about his death, gloom descended in their home. “It’s not just our village, but the entire country is in mourning,” said a villager. Das, who had put in a dozen years of service in IAF was married 3 years ago and has a son, one and half-years old. His wife Shivangi Singh, a dentist, also works in IAF. The mortal remains of Das are likely to arrive in his village by Friday.Condolences poured in from different quarters including Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik following the sad demise of the Odia Jawan in the fatal accident.“Deeply saddened by the demise of Chief of Defence Staff #Gen BipinRawat, his wife & 11 other Defence personnel in a very tragic accident in Tamil Nadu. It is an irreparable loss to the nation. Deepest condolences to the bereaved families and wish speedy recovery of the injured,” tweeted PatnaikUnion Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan described Das as an exceptional gentleman, who served the nation with courage, commitment and diligence. “Shri Das was from my hometown in Talcher. With his passing the country has lost a fine IAF officer and Odisha a brave son. I join the nation in sharing the grief and offer my deepest condolences to his family & friends,” tweeted Pradhan.Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik later moved obituary references in the Odisha Assembly for General Bipin Rawat, his wife, and 11 others who lost their lives in the chopper crash.“With profound grief, I rise to inform the House of the sudden and untimely demise of General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika ji, and 11 other armed forces personnel in a tragic helicopter crash on the 8th of December, 2021 in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu. He had an extremely distinguished career of over four decades of selfless service marked by exceptional gallantry. He was conferred with the Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, and many prestigious awards. He expired on the 8th of December 2021 at the age of 63,” said Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-officer-killed-in-coonoor-crash-was-planning-to-visit-home-next-month-101639076141015.html
10-12-2021||India||Farmer unions say will review progress of promises by Centre||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) may have suspended its 14-month long agitation following a written assurance from the Union government on its demands, but the fight for guaranteed Minimum Support Price is not over yet.Kurukshetra’s Gurnam Singh Charuni , among the top SKM leaders, said that the agitation has only been suspended and may resume if the demands of farmers are not fulfilled.“The next meeting of the SKM will be held on January 15 at Delhi to decide further strategy if the government fails to fulfil its commitments. We will not hesitate to resume the agitation again,” said Charuni .“The fight for guaranteed MSP will continue and we will not stop until we force the government to enact a law to ensure that farmers cannot be forced to sell their produce below the MSP,” said Charuni, who is also a member of five-member committee formed by the SKM to talk to the government over pending issues including MSP.He said that all the protests will end on December 11 and victory marches will be carried out across Haryana; he added that thousands of farmers from Haryana are expected to march to the Golden Temple in Amritsar to pay obeisance.Experts have maintained that a guaranteed MSP will prove inflationary, and also effectively reduce (even end) purchases by private companies.Charuni said that there is no change in his earlier plans to field own candidates in the Punjab assembly polls.“We will fight the Punjab election as we have announced earlier,” he added.Charuni announced on November 26 that while he himself will not contest the Punjab assembly election, farmers and labourers should field their own candidates to have a say in the policy making process. Farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal during his visit to Karnal also threatened to protest Charuni’s political programmes in Punjab by showing him black flags like other politicians.SKM has already announced that nobody will be allowed to use its name for the polls, but Charuni insists that his plans stay and that he is in favour of farmers fielding their own candidates.
10-12-2021||India||Bill on pharma institutes gets Rajya Sabha nod||The Rajya Sabha on Thursday passed the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that seeks to accord status of ‘institute of national importance’ to six more pharmaceutical institutions, besides setting up an advisory council for them.The bill, which was cleared by the Lok Sabha on December 6, was passed in the Rajya Sabha with a voice vote. It was introduced in the Lower House in March this year and later referred to the Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilizers.Speaking in the Upper House, Union health minister Mansuk Mandaviya said, “This bill has come with only four amendments. The first amendment is to give the status of national importance to all NIPERs (National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research).”“There is a Mohali NIPER which was given national institute qualification. After this, six more NIPERs were set up. There was no clarification whether they are of national importance. To clarify this and give them a national importance category is one of the amendments,” he added.An institution of national importance refers to an autonomous institute established under an Act, with the power to hold examinations, grant degrees, diplomas and other academic distinctions or titles. These institutes of national importance receive funding from the central government. The six pharmaceutical education and research institutes which will be entitled to the status are located in Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Hajipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Raebareli.Mandaviya also thanked pharmacists for their role in the world’s fight against Covid-19. “I thank 10 lakh pharmacists and workers, CEOs, MDs, chairmen who ensured medicine supply in India during the fight against Covid and supplied medicines to 150 nations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-on-pharma-institutes-gets-rajya-sabha-nod-101639075899020.html
10-12-2021||India||Winter session: MPs bring regional flavour to debates in Parliament||Biju Janata Dal MP Pramila Bisoyi, 73, doesn’t know any language other than Odiya. On Thursday, her brief speech on women’s empowerment—in Odiya, of course—during Zero Hour in Lok Sabha led to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla describing how he ensured she participated in the debate.Bisoyi, who established around 70,000 women’s self help group in Odisha’s Ganjam district, was not the only one to bring a regional flavour in Parliament on Thursday. Two other speakers, Dhanush Kumar, and S Gnanathiraviam, both from Tamil Nadu, spoke in Tamil.And although DMK’s K Kanimozhi spoke in English, she cautioned others that she might speak in Tamil every day in the House after she stumbled while pronouncing Atmanirbhar Bharat. When some members from the Treasury bench tried to correct her, she laughed and quipped, “See, this is the problem. You don’t understand we speak a different language. I’ll talk in Tamil henceforth, let me know if you can understand.”In the Rajya Sabha, where proceedings were mostly drowned by disruptions, a Tamil Nadu MP KRN Rajesh Kumar, made the first regional language speech in the winter session on Thursday.The Indian Constitution allows lawmakers to speak in their mother tongues in Parliament. Article 120 of the Constitution says, “business in Parliament shall be transacted in Hindi or in English: Provided that the Chairman of the Council of States or Speaker of the House of the People, or Person acting as such, as the Case may be, may permit any member who cannot adequately express himself in Hindi or in English to address the House in his mother tongue.”In both Houses of Parliament, simultaneous translation is provided for members who wish to speak in any official language of the country.In January this year, an official review showed that use of regional languages in the proceedings of Rajya Sabha has increased manifold in 2018-2020. While Hindi remained the most popular language for lawmakers, Telugu, Urdu, Tamil and Sanskrit were ranked second, third, fourth, and fifth respectively.According to the review, while Hindi and English were widely-used, the use of 21 other scheduled Indian languages saw a 512% increase in the period 2018-2020 over 2004-2017.The Upper House witnessed the use of Dogri, Kashmiri, Konkani and Santhali for the first time in 2020 while both Houses heard speeches in Assamese, Bodo, Gujarati, Maithili, Manipuri and Nepali after a long gap.While Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu has been a vocal supporter of the use of mother tongue in Rajya Sabha and elsewhere, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, on Thursday, spoke of how he convinced Bisoyi, who couldn’t complete her matriculation course, to speak in the House.“This is the democracy of India, where there are people like Prasima ji, I specially wanted her to speak today. She told me that she doesn’t know Hindi or English and can speak only in Odiya,” Birla told the House.
10-12-2021||India||Farm protest is over, all eyes now on impact in political arena||The Union government’s acceptance of key demands of protesting farmers and the scrapping of three contentious agricultural laws after a year of protests were driven by looming elections in key states, analysts say.The massive demonstrations by farmers across states, brutal police crackdowns on protestors in states such as Haryana and the death of nearly 700 cultivators due to heat, cold and exhaustion forced a rare climbdown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he announced on November 19 that his government would cancel the laws.A turning point came when four farmers returning from a protest died when a car owned by the son of a Union minister recklessly ploughed into them in Uttar Pradesh.Political watchers said the rare climbdown on the part of the Modi government reflected the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s anxiety to regain support among farmers, an influential voting bloc in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s bellwether state which goes to the polls early next year.Elections are also due in Punjab, where the BJP is looking to truck with former Congress chief minister Capt Amrinder Singh, a state where farmers’ issues are crucial. How the BJP fares in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh vote will also set the tone for the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.“Over the course of the past 14 months of the agitation, farmers had been called anti-national, Khalistani (Sikh separatists) and what not? The country was watching this insult to those who feed the entire nation,” said Rakesh Tikait, a farm leader.Tikait, an influential leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union from the sugarcane-growing belt of Uttar Pradesh, threatened to pull votes away from the BJP. “Yeh saaf tha ke inko vote ki chote deni hogi (We were clear that the BJP needed to be hurt through the ballot),” he said in rallies and soon after farm unions reached a deal with the Union government that will pave the way for a committee to look into agrarian issues.Tikait belongs to the powerful Baliyan khap among Jats, who dominate the political scene in western UP, where deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes broke out in 2013 that had polarized voters, helping the BJP.However, right-wing organisations affiliated to the BJP did not succeed in their strategy of creating a religious divide among farmers in western Uttar Pradesh and their “tactics of labelling farmers as anti-nationals flopped”, said Sudhir Panwar, who teaches political science at Lucknow University.Farmers also boycotted BJP leaders in Haryana and Punjab, and frequently prevented them from visiting their constituencies.Analysts such as Panwar said the Modi government was faced with the choice of either losing face by repealing the laws or losing elections. “It chose the lesser evil,” he said.While announcing his decision to abandon the unpopular agricultural reforms –the biggest during Modi’s second tenure – the prime minister said the changes were designed to boost farm incomes by opening up agricultural markets. However, he conceded that his government couldn’t convince a section of the farmers.Tens of thousands of agriculturists resisted the laws that provided for greater corporate role and investment in agricultural markets. They feared the changes would pave the way for the government to stop buying farm produce at assured prices and argued the reforms would have left them at the mercy of large corporations.“Elite reforms, such as a stock market reform, is easier to pull off than reforms involving millions, such as in the labour and agriculture sectors,” said KK Kailash, a professor at Hyderabad University.New political equations began to emerge in eastern Uttar Pradesh, in which the BJP’s rival Samajwadi Party took advantage of the protests to tie up with Om Prakash Rajbhar, who leads the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj party.“So, the political situation in both western and eastern Uttar Pradesh was proving to be difficult (for the BJP),” Panwar said.

In order for that ecosystem to develop, the industry must go from nascency towards growth phase, which is where we are going,” Scindia said during Question Hour.He said Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) produced 80 AVRO planes, which are 36-seater aircraft, for commuter operations and the 19 seater Hindustan 228-201 aircraft to give a new impetus to the regional connectivity scheme.The minister said a joint venture of Boeing and Tata called Tata Boeing AeroSpace Limited was manufacturing Apache fuselages in India for domestic operations and export. “India has advanced tremendously over the last three or four years towards manufacturing full aircraft,” he said.Scindia said two Dornier 228 aircraft were already being manufactured in India for Alliance Air. “Under Make in India, today we are manufacturing the Indian version of Dornier 228 which is called the Hindustan 228 and six civil aircraft are under production with our internal funding of HAL,” he said. “We are also producing 19-seater light transport aircraft within India with CSR to give a new impetus to regional transport. The ALH-Dhruv (advanced light helicopter) is also being produced by HAL,” the minister added.In a written reply to Ray, the minister said that the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) developed an experimental version of SARAS, a multi-role seater civilian aircraft.Specifying the government’s measures to strengthen the ecosystem for aircraft leasing and financing in India, Scindia said in a written reply that under International Financial Services Centres Authority Act 2019, the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) was established on April 27, 2020. ‘New tax regime was introduced from April 2020 to make Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) inapplicable to domestic companies. Exemption has been provided from corporate tax for a block period of 10 years within the first 15 years for leasing units,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-growth-in-aircraft-manufacturing-scindia-tells-parliament-101639075540683.html

As a result, the auto rickshaw flung in the air and fell into the stream. Since the stream was in full flow due to recent heavy rains, the pilgrims appear to have been washed away,” a police constable involved in rescue operations told the local reporters.Local villagers rescued seven people. “Others were washed away in the swirling waters of the stream. Since it is late at night, the search operation is becoming difficult,” a police officer said.The rescued pilgrims were immediately shifted to the government hospital at Atmakur. “Among them, the condition of a girl is critical,” the police said.Further details are awaited.

Sikkim is one of most peaceful states in the country and he did not require any extensive security cover, the governor said at a press conference in Gangtok. Prasad, who also recently held the additional charge as governor of Manipur, said, “There should be a distinction between necessity and show off. Common people should not get harassed in the name of protocol and security arrangements for the governor. Sikkim is amongst the most peaceful states in the country.” Citing the example of Manipur, he said, “The extensive security arrangements should be trimmed. Or else, it would be a waste of government resources, waste of manpower and harassment for common people.” The administration makes elaborate arrangements with vehicles and security personnel for the governor and officials accompanying him during tours, he said. Prasad also announced that the Raj Bhawan in Gangtok would be opened for tourists from January 1. Tourism is a thriving industry in Sikkim and the Raj Bhawan, which has a rich heritage, will attract tourists and bring more revenue to the state, the governor said, adding that his official residence would remain open for four hours every day. Since Sikkim has been declared a fully organic state, Prasad announced that more organic farming will be done in the Raj Bhawan premises with focus on medicinal plants. A release issued by the state information department said the governor announced major changes in the present protocol system. The practice of district magistrates, sub-divisional magistrates, superintendents of police and sub-divisional police officers accompanying the governor’s convoy has been done away with since it drastically affects the daily functioning of these officials “thus causing inconvenience to the general public.” The governor said that the number of vehicles in his convoy has been reduced to only four or five to avoid inconvenience to movement of public vehicles. Prasad said these steps will not only reduce unnecessary burden on the state exchequer but also reduce pollution. 
10-12-2021||India||Amid Mathura-Kashi temple row, BJP MP pitches for Places of Worship Act’s repeal||A Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker, Harnath Yadav, a member of the Rajya Sabha, on Thursday raised the demand for the repeal of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions), Act 1991, stating that the provisions of the law were “unconstitutional and violate the tenets of equality and secularism, which is part of the preamble.”The lawmaker’s intervention drew a sharp protest from some MPs from opposition parties, who have decided to write to the Rajya Sabha chairman to not allow such “submission during Zero Hour”.Speaking in the Upper House during Zero Hour, the MP from poll-bound Uttar Pradesh said the provisions of the law, which are “illogical” and “unconstitutional “cannot be challenged in courts and that this “clearly means that legal sanctity has been given by the government to the forceful occupation of the Krishna Janmabhoomi and other religious places by foreign invaders”.“This arbitrary and unconstitutional law has deprived Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists of their right to practice and propagate their religion,” he said.The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991 prohibits conversion of any place of worship and provides for the maintenance of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.And while it made an exception to the legal case around the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya, all legal disputes in courts over any other religious places are considered closed by the 1991 Act, Yadav said.“The law also discriminates between Lord Ram and Lord Krishna who are both ‘avatars’ of Lord Vishnu.’ There cannot be two laws for the same acts and circumstances. And the doors of courts cannot be shut for citizens,’ he said.The Supreme Court admitted, earlier this year, petitions challenging some aspects of the law, including the cutoff date, and sought the response of the Union ministries of law, home, and culture.Raising a point of order, RJD’s Manoj Kumar Jha said, “The 1991 Act was passed by this Parliament itself to protect the idea of cordiality and harmony. Now, my learned friend has opened Pandora’s Box. The nation has suffered in the name of religious conflict. Let’s not disturb the social fabric of India,’ he said.Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh who was in the chair said there was no point of order and all notices of MPs are admitted by the Chairman as per Rajya Sabha rules and any member who has objections can write to him.Speaking outside Parliament, Jha said the opposition MPs will collectively write to the Chairman against allowing such issues.“The Act was passed in Parliament in the heat of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, it was decided that from now onwards no other such case shall be raked up in order to have a larger goal of cordiality. Now by allowing this in Zero Hour, in view of UP elections, he (Yadav) spoke about Mathura etc. We will collectively write to the chairman that such issues that have the capacity to brutally divide the nation further should not be allowed,” Jha said.A demand for repealing the law was also made last week by the Deputy Chief Minister of UP, Keshav Prasad Maurya who spoke of preparations being underway for constructing a grand temple in Mathura on the lines of those in Ayodhya and Varanasi. RSS leaders have also demanded a review of the law and its affiliate the Vishwa Hindu Parishad which was in the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement has been campaigning to “reclaim” the temples in Kashi and Mathura.Another BJP lawmaker from the Rajya Sabha, KC Ramamurthy pitched for the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code. He said Article 44 of the Constitution says, the State shall endeavour to provide for its citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India. “A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. In the Sarla Mudgal case, Justice Kuldip Singh emphasised the need for Parliament to frame a uniform civil code to remove ideological contradictions,” he said. Even as some opposition lawmakers disagreed, Ramamurthy said the objective of UCC is to unify fragmented personal laws for marriage, divorce, custody, adoption, inheritance, etc., and cover civil and human rights issues, because personal laws of different religions are dissimilar and hence violate article 14 of the Constitution which guarantees equality before law. “There are misconceptions about a uniform civil code, which needs to be explained to all religions,” he said.
10-12-2021||India||December 9: What we know about Omicron today||New Delhi: The first scientific studies have now almost unanimously confirmed that the Omicron variant is significantly more resistant to immunity elicited by vaccines and past infection. The variant was designated as being of concern (VOC) after it showed a clear ability to spread much faster than other configurations of the Sars-CoV-2.In the past 24 hours, three more analyses have been released, reinforcing some signs seen already and underscoring the next unknowns that must be determined in order to estimate the variant’s implication for the pandemic and infection control measures.Hybrid dosing better?A fifth antibody neutralisation study, by an Austrian team, corroborated findings by teams from South Africa, Sweden, Germany, as well as the analysis carried out by Pfizer: all show a massive drop in how antibodies bind to the Omicron variant, suggesting a hit to vaccine efficacy.The new study adds one crucial insight: a mixed vaccine dose appeared to be more protective than two doses of the same vaccine. The antibodies from people who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine showed a significantly better binding ability than antibodies elicited in those who got the same doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or the AstraZeneca vaccine, the study found.The Austrian study also confirmed that people with hybrid immunity – a past infection as well as a vaccine dose – were significantly protected.Decoding transmissibilityThe second new analysis was published by the UK Health Security Agency as part of its latest risk assessment and technical analysis of Sars-CoV-2 variants. The apex UK health agency now has high confidence that Omicron has a big growth advantage over Delta based on analysis of UK data “showing increased secondary attack rates” and “increased growth rates”.The growth advantage may be due to higher resistance or an inherently better ability of the variant to transmit more readily, the assessment said, adding that “it is most plausible that it is a combination of both”.Crucially, UKHSA refrains from drawing any inference on whether Omicron is more or less severe, citing a lack of data in these early stages of the variant’s emergence, and how the variant could impact the ability of current vaccines to prevent severe disease.The third analysis, by Kyoto University researchers, has estimated that the variant is 4.2 times more transmissible in its early stage than Delta.“The Omicron variant transmits more, and escapes immunity built naturally and through vaccines more,” Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor of health and environmental sciences, said in his findings, which were presented at a meeting of the Japanese health ministry’s advisory panel on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported.Key question nowWhy is the Omicron variant more transmissible? Is it an inherent trait (like it was with Alpha) or because it is leading to more reinfections? Or both?In an interview to The Wire on Wednesday, Dr Richard Lessels, a South African infectious diseases specialist involved in the studying the Omicron that was first found in the country, said studies have shown Omicron could lead to three times more reinfections compared to other variants if it draws its superior transmissibility from a combination of both factors.But if either factor plays a larger role, it could potentially help determine which infection control mechanism could help. A variant that is more transmissible largely because it is more resistant could likely be significantly blunted by booster doses and variant-specific vaccines (which will take time).Since people in older age-groups are still more likely to develop severe disease irrespective of the variant, booster strategies will need to target them first.On the contrary, if inherent transmissibility is a bigger factor, the variant could pose a larger risk to unvaccinated people since the chances of them being infected rises, and infection control could be better achieved via non-pharmacological interventions such as restrictions on gathering.The choice, then, could come down to whether efforts need to be redoubled to reach unvaccinated people (those hesitant, or children) or to roll out boosters. Data and findings on disease severity in different ages will also inform this choice.
10-12-2021||India||ED, CBI tenure bills passed by Lower House||The independence of institutions is the Union government’s top priority and its responsibility lies in facilitating and enabling their independent functioning, Union minister Jitendra Singh told the Lok Sabha as the House approved two bills to extend the term of the directors of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate on Thursday.The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, 2021 extend the tenures of the chiefs of the ED and CBI, respectively, from two years to a maximum of five years. An angry Opposition, however, raised several objections and then walked out of the House before the bills were passed in a voice vote.“There will be continuity, stability. Certain information which is confidential with the head of an investigation agency will remain with him till the conclusion of the cases. This is going to address this (pendency of cases) issue,” said Singh, the minister of state for personnel, public grievances and DoPT.On November 14, the Narendra Modi government pushed two ordinances to amend The Central Vigilance Commission Act and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to allow extension of the ED and CBI director’s terms, respectively. The amendments met with stiff criticism from the National Democratic Alliance’s political rivals.The government argued that the steps were necessary to fight major corruption cases. The two bills were approved by the Lower House after the government rejected a slew of amendments demanded by Opposition leaders.Singh said the bills show the declaration of the intent of this government and its crusade against corruption. He reminded the Congress leaders of corruption charges during the United Progressive Alliance era and asked Trinamool Congress leaders why the West Bengal government withdrew general consent for the CBI.The minister also underlined that, “the extension (for the CBI chief) is going to be by the same process by which the appointment has been made. Who is there in the selection committee? For CBI, the selection committee consists of the hon. Prime Minister, the hon. Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.”Congress leader and former Union minister Manish Tewari alleged that the extension was “arbitrary” and “capricious”, and added that a democracy was as strong as its institutions. “Over the last seven-and-half years, this government has made every attempt to dismantle the system of checks and balances of our constitutional system,” he said.He pointed out how the Supreme Court specified a two-year term for these posts to insulate the incumbents from any governmental interference. “By increasing their tenure from two years to five years, one year at a time will be like dangling a carrot in front of these officers,” he said,While Tewari feared that the extension of the term would “completely and absolutely undermine the autonomy and the independence” of the bodies, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rajyavardhan Rathore claimed that the Modi government didn’t want to maintain status quo. “The Opposition should not look for one year, two years. Look for long term benefits for the whole country,” Rathore said. He also quipped that since Tewari said that the directors will act as representatives of the NDA government, the Opposition must have decided that their government will never come.Rathore cited corruption in the 2010 Commonwealth Games and infrastructure projects, and the 2019 Pulwama attack, and maintained that to tackle such masterminds, the system needed to be smarter. “Drugs, terrorism, human trafficking, organised riots, gun running, insider trading, ponzi schemes, frauds, betting syndicate, all these involve money laundering and if the root cause is found than all these organised crimes can be finished,” he said.DMK leader A Raja lashed out at the BJP and alleged that the ruling dispensation “misused” the office of the President to bring the two ordinances. TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee alleged that the Opposition was being targeted by the CBI “under direction of their masters”.Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP N K Premachandran objected to the ordinance on the ground that it was brought ahead of the winter session. Danish Ali of the Bahujan Samaj Party labelled the government has “government of ordinances” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-cbi-tenure-bills-passed-by-lower-house-101639074698139.html
10-12-2021||India||India has a right to energy but does it need to fire more coal plants?||India has made a commitment to a net-zero target by 2070 at COP26. It may be difficult to pull this off unless necessary steps are taken to shift from coal towards cleaner forms of energy. But, here lies our bind. India has contributed just 3% of cumulative global carbon emissions as opposed to 25% by the US. Since coal is the only fossil fuel we have in abundance, it becomes an easy weapon of resistance against this global climate injustice. Instead of using that weapon, we should channelise our energies in negotiating for monetary compensation and technology transfer from the global North. After all, we need to fight both climate injustice and climate crisis and not privilege one over the other. Five simple charts can explain why India can and should be doing so.What is the nature of climate injustice and why we need to fight it?“Those who are least responsible, bear the brunt of it,” said George Monbiot, a leading environmentalist on climate change, capturing the nature of this injustice succinctly. To understand this, we divide the world into four parts — G7 plus EU, South America, Asia, and Africa to construct a climate injustice funnel. If each region were emitting carbon equivalent to its share in the world population, the figure would look like same-size rectangular blocks stacked one over the other. However, if the region at the top emits a significantly larger amount than the ones below, the plot would look like a funnel. The value mentioned for each block in the chart is the climate inequality quotient (CIQ), which is the ratio of their share in emissions to that in world population, and any value greater than one means that region is emitting more than its share. The picture speaks for itself.But ca

The emergence of Omicron, the seventh such Covid-19 variant, has led to forecasts of the next wave, both in India and abroad. Not only have ill-thought-out travel bans and restrictions been imposed by different countries, including our own, the variant could also become another pretext to prolong the physical shutdown of schools.
