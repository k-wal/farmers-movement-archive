29-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s North civic body turns vacant dhalaos into gardens, libraries||Under the second phase of the project comprising the closure of open dhalaos (garbage receptacle points) by installing fixed compactor machines, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has started converting vacant sites into libraries and mini-gardens. On Wednesday, two such sites were opened to the public in Rohini’s Sector 3.Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of the North Corporation, said that under the policy, the closed dhalao sites will now be re-utilised for creating mini public libraries, recreation halls for senior citizens and charitable dispensaries. The municipal body has, so far, closed 246 dhalaos, and will shut down 100 more soon. Since the space required to store municipal waste is drastically reduced due to compaction, each compactor is able to replace three or four dhalaos.A senior official from the sanitation department, requesting anonymity, said that the North MCD has installed waste compactors at 76 locations. “A model site in the form of a ‘compactor vatika,’ which includes a mini garden with a green belt and flowering plants has been developed in Rohini’s Sector 3. We have also added street art and selfie-points for increasing awareness among common residents regarding waste management. More such sites will be developed to show that efficient waste management can be achieved in an appealing way. We will add educational material related to municipal waste management at the location,” the official said. In the second model site at Rohini’s Sector 3, the vacant dhalao building has been converted into a mini-library that will serve as a spoken English coaching centre for poor children. “People can also donate books here,” the official added.Jain said the civic body has signed MoUs with several NGOs and RWAs to reuse these sites for public welfare activities.“These model sites will be replicated at other locations and we have also made provisions of using space for senior citizens, charitable dispensaries among other uses.Out of the 246 dhalaos that have been closed, the maximum number of sites–113–is located in Rohini zone, 71 are located in Keshavpuram, 36 in Civil Lines, nine in City-Sadar Paharganj zone and seven are located in Narela. “More than 50% of dhalaos in the three zones handled by the private concessionaire have been closed down. The new fixed compactor stations have the capacity to handle 15-20 metric tonnes of garbage,” the official explained. According to officials, the new policy divides closed sites into three categories. The sites on roads will be removed permanently on priority to decongest them, while the remaining ones will be handed over to RWAs or market associations after they sign MoUs with the civic body. The dhalao locations not included in either of these categories will be used for the augmentation of basic departmental infrastructures, such as ward offices or resting places for sanitation workers, the policy said. Last year, the South MCD also sanctioned a budget of ₹10 lakh per dhalao site for re-utilisation and redevelopment. An EDMC official said that 31 fixed compactors have been installed so far, while the work is in the final stages at another seven sites.The project deadline, officials said, is March 2022– before the municipal elections are scheduled to be held next year. Delhi has over 1,209 primary garbage receptacle points, with 550 under the jurisdiction of North MCD (municipal corporation of Delhi), 350 with the South municipal body and 309 with East Delhi Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-north-civic-body-turns-vacant-dhalaos-into-gardens-libraries-101640802146087.html
29-12-2021||Delhi||EDMC launches on-demand construction waste collection service||East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) officially launched the “on-demand collection” of construction and destruction (C&D) waste on Wednesday. The civic body is the first of Delhi’s five local bodies to start this service.Citizens were earlier expected to deposit construction waste at designated spots. The civic body will now collect C&D waste at a cost of ₹452.78 per tonne from January 1, 2022, municipal commissioner Vikas Anand said. He added that residents of east Delhi areas who want to avail of the facility can call the numbers 9205059982 or 9821488633.“The site will be verified by the supervisor deputed by the East Corporation, who will intimate the resident about the charges,” he added.Anand said that the facility will not be available to bulk C&D waste generators as they are obligated to deposit their C&D waste directly at the processing plant at Shastri Park.The EDMC operates a 1,000 tonne per day C&D waste processing facility at Shastri Park. A senior EDMC official from the department of environment management service (DEMS) said that the on-demand collection will take place in association with Indo Enviro Integrated Solution (erstwhile IL&FS Ltd) with a goal to reduce air pollution.In October, changing its strategy to increase C&D waste collection, the East Corporation reduced the number of designated C&D waste dumping locations from 61 to 17. It is estimated that East Delhi generates around 750-800 tonnes of construction waste every day.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that the charges are nominal and will be used to recover the transportation cost. He added that residents of east Delhi should avail of the service instead of illegally dumping construction debris, which leads to an increase in air pollution. While Delhi has the capacity of handling 4,150 tonnes of construction waste everyday, a leakage in the collection mechanism and illegal dumping continues to pose a challenge.Delhi has five local bodies and it is estimated that the city generates over 3,712 tonnes of construction waste every day. Delhi has four operational C&D waste processing facilities at Jahangir Puri, Shashtri Park, Mundka and Bakkar Wala with a cumulative capacity to handle 4,150 tonnes of demolition waste. A total of 212 designated dumping sites have been fixed by the local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/edmc-launches-on-demand-construction-waste-collection-service-101640801606211.html

Unruly and wicked people are coming out of the religious parliaments being held here," Gehlot said in a tweet.He said no arrest has been made in Uttarakhand yet, which is a mockery of law and order situation."It is very shameful that even after more than a week of the controversial Dharma Sansad held in Uttarakhand, no arrest has been made. In a conversation with a media channel, the chief minister of Uttarakhand expressed ignorance about this issue, which is surprising when he himself holds the Home Department portfolio," he said.The chief Minister said that in the BJP-ruled states, even artists, journalists and comedians were charged with sections of National Security Act (NSA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, but despite speeches inciting genocide in Uttarakhand, no arrests have been made.He said that in the name of Dharma Sansad, work is being done to incite people for genocide and abusing freedom fighters like Gandhiji and Nehru.Provocative speeches inciting violence against Muslims were allegedly made by participants at the event held at Ved Niketan Dham in Uttarakhand's Haridwar from December 16 to 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/gehlot-contrasts-dharma-sansad-to-1893-world-s-parliament-of-religions-101640800406111.html

ED officials are investigating their movable and immovable assets, which they have earned through illegal means. ED is issuing summons to close relatives of the trio to question them about the properties owned by them and their source of income. ED has lodged cases of money laundering against Atiq Ahmad, Mukhtar Ansari and Vijay Mishra. While Atiq is at Ahmedabad Jail, Mukhtar and Vijay Mishra are in different jails of Uttar Pradesh. The three Mafiosi-turned-politicians have faced police action earlier as well, but this is the first time that ED has been roped in to scan their assets and trace their sources of illegal income, which makes them influential.

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||No freebies, marshal resources for better future||“Free! Free! Free!” and the echo of errors continues. With the freebie policy hydra rearing its several heads and ringing in the election season, an imperative question is being overlooked: “Are these policies protecting the underprivileged or digging the grave for the State?” With the tax margin rising with every year, the expenditure for the greater good continues to dwindle. According to the budget allocation for 2021-22, Punjab has allocated 11.6% of its total expenditure for education in this financial year, which is significantly lower than the national average allocation of 15.8% for education by all states in 2020-21. 4% has been allocated to health, which is also lower than the national average allocation of 5.5%. 2.2% has been allocated for rural development against the much higher national average allocation of 6.1%. 1.6% of Punjab’s total expenditure has been allocated to roads and bridges as compared to the national average allocation of 4.3%. Recently, a political outfit promised to give ₹1,000 to every woman in Punjab. By one estimate, in order to make such a distribution, it will cost the state exchequer ₹12,000 crore. But does every woman require those 1,000 rupees? It is said that compassion is a virtue and feeding the blind a noble ideal, but blind compassion is pointless. Imagine if one marshals the same amount of investment in health, education and vocational training of the people of Punjab over a period of five years, it would enhance their entrepreneurial skills, in turn, automatically and adequately addressing, and enhancing the education, health and economic wellbeing of the families residing in the state. To realise the Make-in-India dream, it is essential to give up the freebie policy and to equip the people with adequate skills that would not only aid them in sustaining themselves but also contribute to micro and macro development of the state. Pleasing the populace or widening fiscal deficit? By giving freebies, a class of citizens is being created who are and will remain dependent for the rest of their lives on the state for their roti, bijli, paani, kapda and makaan. For instance, canteens set up in one southern Indian state cannot be withdrawn by any political party since the electoral results would be catastrophic, and amount to nothing short of political suicide. Since 1947, the political diaspora has incrementally been distributing the free largesse with not even one withdrawing what his or her predecessors had started. But where does this end? The introduction of fresh “free” schemes without discontinuing the previous antiquated ones solely for the purposes of pleasing the populace is only widening the fiscal deficit, and adding nails to the coffin of the state and Indian economy at large. While it is understood that the articles included in Part IV of the Constitution of India, i.e. the Directive Principles of State Policy, are essentially the duty of the state to follow in matters of administration and legislation, and making laws and differ from the Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution. The principles enshrined in Article 47 provide that the State shall endeavour the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people, and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption, except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health. That being the constitutional directive, the mélange of freebies announced only demonstrates the lackadaisical and insolent approach of the decision makers. In RK Garg v. Union of India [(1981) 4 SCC 675], while interpreting Article 14, the Supreme Court had laid the twin tests (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others, and (2) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. Do these sop schemes meet the test laid in the Article guaranteeing the right to equality? By virtue of the 42nd amendment vide the Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976, the concept of socialism was breathed into the Constitution of India, but today, the misinterpretation of the same is choking the very people it sought to protect. Empower for life of dignity with promising future Nationalism is an ideology that emphasises loyalty, devotion, or allegiance to a nation or nation-state, and holds that such obligations outweigh other individual or group interests, while patriotism refers to a feeling of attachment and commitment to a country, nation, or political community. Patriotism is based on love for thy nation and nationalism on loyalty towards one’s nation. Further, nationalism does not mean giving freebies at the cost of hampering the citizen’s ability to earn a livelihood. Nationalism is to strive not only for the rights but also to fundamentally serve as per the directive principles of the state policy. Patriotism requires one to protect the right of all citizens and to give each one of them the means to practice trade or vocation or professional activity, and not to put them on dole but encourage them to strive for a livelihood. If nationalism means loving your country and serving it to one’s last breath, then it is in that spirit that every citizen serves, and earns a dignified living for themselves. Can this non-exclusive love for one’s own country survive the varied definitions of ideology or will it take the form of jingoism and labyrinth of misplaced decisions on the back of the tax payers’ money sack? Time has come not to just put morsels to the huddle but to lay a complete bouquet of opportunities to empower citizens of the state to lead a life of dignity and a promising future. jay@jaycheema.com The writer is a Delhi-based advocate-adjunct professor.

29-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi rakes up Mathura, says BJP has honoured commitment on Ram temple in Ayodhya||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday joined the growing list of his party leaders who have been talking about Mathura being the next destination by stating that if the BJP has fulfilled promises on Ayodhya and Kashi, Mathura won’t be left behind either. Addressing a public meeting at Amroha in western UP, Yogi who had so far refrained from flagging the issue of the Mathura temple, reminded the people that the BJP had honoured its commitment on Ram temple in Ayodhya. Mathura, the western UP town believed to be the birthplace of Hindu god Krishna, has a prominent mosque, the Shahi Eidgah, located next to the Krishna Janmabhoomi (the site believed to be Krishna’s birthplace). The mosque has been at the centre of a legal battle with Hindu groups claiming that the Eidgah was built on land where Lord Krishna was born.“Humne kaha tha Ayodhya mein prabhu Ram ke bhavya mandir nirman ka karya prarambh karayenge. Modi ji ne karya prarambh kara diya hai na. Khush hain? Ayodhya mein Ram Mandir bananey se khush hain, sabhi log? Aur abhi Kashi main bhagwan Vishwanath ka dhaam bhi bhavya roop se ban raha hai. Aapne dekh liya na .. aur phir Mathura Vrindavan kaise chhoot jayega (we had promised to start work on a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya. Modi ji has started the work, isn’t it? Are you happy? Are all of you happy that Ram temple is coming up in Ayodhya? And, a grand abode of Lord Shiva is also coming up in Kashi. You have seen it, right? Then, how can Mathura and Vrindavan be left behind),” he asked the crowd.“There (Mathura) also, work is in progress,” said Yogi who had already launched one of the six Jan Vishwas Yatras from Mathura on December 19. Earlier, on December 2, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had stirred up a fresh row in the poll-bound state as he said that preparations were underway for the construction of a grand temple in Mathura on the lines of Ayodhya and Varanasi.“Ayodhya aur Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jaari hai, Mathura ki tayyari hai (grand temples are being constructed in Ayodhya and Kashi and Mathura will be next),” Maurya tweeted. The tweet had come days after a right-wing group, Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, announced plans to install a Krishna idol at the Shahi Eidgah after elaborate rituals. The group had, however, cancelled the plan later. “If not in Mathura, where else do you think a grand temple of Lord Krishna would come up? In Pakistan?” UP minister Laxmi Narain Chaudhary had said recently. Chaudhary is a lawmaker from Mathura. Mathura MP Hema Malini too had raised the demand for a grand temple.The growing chorus for a Mathura temple elicited a reaction from the Opposition. “All of them are now playing openly and unabashedly to a familiar polarisation script. Their game plan is clear and by now it is evident to one and all too,” said Congress spokesman Zishan Haider.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had on Tuesday accused the BJP of seeking votes in the name of religion.“They are taking credit for Ram temple when the fact is that it has come up on the directions of the apex court. Now, none can stop temple construction. But the BJP is an expert in distracting masses,” he had said.The chief minister inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of various schemes while participating in the Jan Vishwas Yatras in Farrukhabad and Amroha.In Farrukhabad, Yogi laid the foundation stone of or inaugurated 174 projects worth ₹196 crore while in Amroha too he inaugurated/laid foundation stone of 31 projects worth ₹43 crore.  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday accused the Congress of framing Hindu and Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) leaders as well as saints in terror cases when it (the Congress) was in power.“Congress ruled the country for the most time. But how were they ruling? You would have seen a statement by Maharashtra ATS today, about how back then (during Congress rule) attempts were made to frame leaders and cadres of the Bharatiya Janata Party, RSS leaders and Hindu leaders in fake cases. You would have noticed Congress mischief in Malegaon case. This is a crime against the country and the Congress should apologise to the country for this,” he said at public meeting in Farrukhabad in western UP.“When in power the Congress attempted to frame Hindu leaders. Now, out of power, they are blocking all constructive attempts,” he said in Farrukhabad.
29-12-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi Vadra claims Congress decision on party tickets will pave way for women’s reservation bill||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said her party’s decision to give 40% tickets to women candidates in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will pave the way for passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill in Parliament one day.She claimed that after Congress raised women-centric issues in Uttar Pradesh, all other parties have realised that women who constitute half the population cannot be neglected any further.The Congress general secretary alleged that the present government at the Centre intended to end reservation in jobs as most government-run companies were being sold to industrialists.She was in Sirsaganj town of Firozabad district in western UP to interact with women during the party’s “Shakti Samvad” programme at a college ground. Before reaching the venue, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra interacted with women engaged in making bangles and tried her hand at it. The Congress leader expressed surprise on coming to know that only ₹3 is paid for joining bundles of bangles with the help of gas cylinders. Women from different walks of life participated in the interaction and raised their issues. The participants included students, lawyers, homemakers, Asha (accredited social activists) bahus, anganwadi workers and a sportswoman.All of them asked Priyanka Gandhi to take up issues faced by women. Later, the Congress general secretary said her party’s catchline “Ladki hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon” is not merely a political slogan.She urged women to realise their “political strength” as they constituted half the population. Women should understand their rights, fight for them and vote for a political party that raises their issues, she said.“The decision to give 40% tickets to women candidates in the forthcoming assembly election is a big initiative and would one day pave the way for passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill, ensuring 33% representation of women in Parliament. The bill was proposed by the Congress government at the Centre and one day political parties will be compelled to get the Women Reservation Bill passed in Parliament,” she claimed.“Once Congress assured 40% tickets to women in UP assembly elections, other parties had to recognise women power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was forced to organise an all-women rally in Prayagraj and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav also declared schemes for women,” the Congress general secretary said.“There are vacancies in government jobs in Uttar Pradesh, but the state government is not filling them. The government at the Centre intends to end reservation and government establishments, which otherwise provide maximum jobs, are being sold to industrialist friends… Such privatisation will one day end reservation in jobs,” she alleged.“The present government in the state and at the Centre are denying women their rights and thinks that handing over a gas cylinder is all that is required. Congress party’s manifesto or ‘Shakti Vidhan’ will take care of issues faced by women who would be provided guarantee of jobs, opportunities, health, education to women. The Congress plans to provide 20 lakh jobs after coming to power in the state and eight lakh (0.8 million) of these would be for women. The health centres will have a woman doctor each and every police station will have one woman constable, she said.Free legal aid will be provided to women and 25% vacancies in police would be for women, the Congress general secretary said.“But women should not get swayed by politics of caste and religion with elections in the state approaching,” she said.
29-12-2021||Lucknow||UPPCL to flag tariff dispute with its lone foreign consumer||The UPPCL (UP Power Corporation Ltd) is gearing up to take the pending tariff dispute with its lone foreign consumer to the Indo-Nepal Power Exchange Committee for arbitration. The committee is scheduled to hold its 14th meeting shortly in Delhi.The foreign consumer, in question here, is the Nepal government that has a heavy electricity connection of 5,000 kw/kva subscribed in the name of “project incharge”, Nepalganj but has power dues of more than ₹19 crore pending against it.The UPPCL and Nepal authorities are in dispute over the charging of electricity tariff with the former insisting that it will charge tariff as per the rate revised and fixed by the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) while the latter is demanding the tariff be charged at the rate fixed during the agreement when it subscribed to the connection. “We have written to the Madhyanchal Vitran Nigam Ltd (MVVNL), asking it to provide all the relevant details, including, the date when power supply agreement was signed with Nepal so that we can present our case before the Indo-Nepal Power Exchange Committee when it holds it meeting,” UPPCL chief engineer (regulatory affairs) Neeraj Agrawal said when contacted.“We will demand recovery of pending power dues and revision or applicability of the revised electricity tariff as determined by UPERC for any consumers of a similar nature,” he added.As per electricity the bill (for the period from November 1, 2021 to December 1, 2021) provided by the chief engineer (distribution), Faizabad (Ayodhya), to UPPCL, the foreign consumer has a bulk connected load 5,000 kw/kva but consumed only 2044 units worth ₹16,208.92, the current billing rate being ₹7.93 per unit.The same bill showed the consumer having old arrears of ₹19,30,06,000 plus surcharge/interest of ₹38,60,120 though it paid an amount of ₹38,60,120 to MVVNL in the past. “The Nepal government is yet to pay power dues to the tune of ₹19,30,14,578.92 to us,” a discom official said quoting the bill. UPPCL, according to the official, was scheduled to put up the case in a meeting convened by the Union power ministry in Delhi on December 24, but could not do so because MVVNL did not provide necessary details that were required for the purpose. “UPPCL has sought fresh details on the date of power connection issued to Nepal, month-wise details of bills provided to the consumer, the initial order issued after sanction of the connection and connected load, details provided to UPERC in this regard in the past, copies of correspondence done with regard to recovery of power dues etc,” the official said.
29-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi says govt schools got new lease of life under BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said had the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not come to power in 2017, many government primary schools in Uttar Pradesh would have closed by now and a large number of cooks and part-time instructors would have lost their jobs.Yogi said this while interacting with cooks and part-time instructors engaged in UP basic education department in the state capital.“If the BJP government had not come in 2017, many council schools would certainly have been closed. Subsequently, the services of many teachers, instructors, shiksha mitras and cooks would have come under threat,” Yogi said.Yogi Adityanath also said, “When I visited different schools (in 2017), the number of students was rapidly decreasing. In the last four and a half years, changes that were made in the basic education department have helped a lot in altering the people’s perception towards the state.”Yogi released a booklet based on the basic education department’s achievements, “Four and a half years of Upgradation”, on the occasion. The chief minister credited the collective efforts of teachers, instructors, cooks and departmental officers with the massive change in the basic education.Yog Adityanath said Operation Kayakalp was rolled out to rejuvenate government schools.“We identified such people who had studied in government schools, tried to connect them with their alma mater, formed alumni groups and sought their participation in generating resources to strengthen physical infrastructure of the schools,” he said.“We encouraged people’s representatives, government officials, bureaucrats and well to do people to adopt one government school each. As a result, out of total 1.56 lakh government schools, nearly 1.23 lakh schools got a makeover. Operation Kayakalp was a unique experiment. The school buildings were painted and new toilets were built,” Yogi said.Yogi Adityanath said when he started visiting schools in 2017 after becoming chief minister, he found nearly 75% girls and 40% girls used to come to school barefoot and they did not have good uniform to wear.“We are now giving free uniforms, shoes, books, bags and sweaters to 1.82 crore (18.2 million) students to beat the chill. Recently, in view of Covid, the government transferred ₹1100 (each) in their (parents’) bank accounts,” he said.The chief minister said employees all over the world faced a salary cut during the Covid period. There are 16 lakh (1.6 million) government employees in UP, but the state government never thought of cutting their salaries, he said.“We stopped wasteful expenditure and curbed corruption. We are giving free ration to 15 crore (150 million) people,” the chief minister further said.On the contrary, new teachers were appointed in schools to impart quality education to students, he said.Basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi was also present at the programme.Hike in honorarium announcedChief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday announced fulfilment of the much awaited demand of an increase in the honorarium of part-time instructors and cooks working in the schools of the basic shiksha parishad.The monthly honorarium of 27,546 part-time instructors of the state will be increased by ₹2,000, while the honorarium of 3.78 lakh cooks has been raised by ₹500 per month.Referring to the close relationship between the cooks and the children,the CM directed the department to reconsider the rule that the wards of the cooks should be in the same school for renewal of their service.In an interaction with the instructors and cooks, Yogi also announced that now, on the lines of anganwadi workers, cooks will also get two saris every year, along with free health insurance cover up to ₹5 lakh. At the same time, the amount to be spent on buying apron and cap will be sent to their bank accounts.In view of the demand to increase the monthly honorarium of part-time instructors who get only ₹7,000, the CM announced an additional increase of ₹2,000 to take it to a respectable level.Yogi said that despite limitations, the honorarium of cooks was increased from ₹1000 to ₹1500 per month in 2018. Now in view of the challenges of Covid-19, once again it is being increased by ₹500, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-says-govt-schools-got-new-lease-of-life-under-bjp-rule-in-uttar-pradesh-101640797885789.html

29-12-2021||Lucknow||Urdu poet Akbar is ‘Allahabadi’ again: Original pen names of literary figures restored on UPHESC website||PRAYAGRAJ The original pen names of renowned Urdu poets were restored on the website of Uttar Pradesh Higher Education Services Commission (UPHESC) on Wednesday, a day after it was reported that the suffixes had been changed on the portal from ‘Allahabadi’ to ‘Prayagraj’ prompting officials to claim that mischievous elements were behind this change.On Tuesday, the name of Urdu poet Syed Akbar Hussain (popularly known as ‘Akbar ‘Allahabadi) was found changed to ‘Akbar Prayagraj’ on the website of the UPHESC, an autonomous body under the state government. The ‘Allahabadi’ suffixes of all writers/ poets were found changed to ‘Prayagraj’ on the portal. These included Rashid Allahabadi (born 1944) and Tegh Allahabadi (1930-1970) on the list of Urdu poets from the city. They were listed as Rashid Prayagraj and Tegh Prayagraj, respectively. “Akbar Prayagraj is a noted modern Urdu poet, and Nooh Narwi, Tegh Prayagraj, Shabnam Naqvi and Rashid Prayagraj have their origin in Prayagraj,” the website’s ‘About Prayagraj’ section had read. However, after sharp reactions from literary figures and Netizens, the pen names of these poets were restored to the original. UPHESC secretary Vandana Tripathi on Wednesday said the suffixes of the poets were correct in the Hindi version of the website, but due to a technical fault, the suffixes got changed in the English version of the website. “The due correction has now been made,” she added. Allahabad district was renamed as Prayagraj in 2018 by the Yogi Adityanath government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/urdu-poet-akbar-is-allahabadi-again-original-pen-names-of-literary-figures-restored-on-uphesc-website-101640793386541.html
29-12-2021||Pune||Koregaon Park police station sans ramp facility for differently-abled||PUNE The newly built police station at Koregaon Park is one of the best police stations in the city other than the commissioner’s office, but it has failed to follow the rules of inclusivity as there is no ramp facility for differently-abled and senior citizens.The space for the police station in lane number 4 was sanctioned in 2008, by the state government, given the increased crime rate and rapid urbanisation in Koregaon Park. The project took off after the German Bakery bomb blast in 2010, following which the district collector allotted 10 guntha land for the project in 2011.“While the police are talking about the good work by the Bharosa cell to support senior citizens, how are they supposed to reach the station when there is no ramp facility or railing provided to climb the ten-odd stairs at the entrance in a semi-circular design at the Koregaon Park police station? Any senior citizen is bound to feel giddy and fall. In addition, Pune Police have barred the entry/exit of every person who is differently-abled without proving a ramp,” said Lisa Pingale, who had gone to the police station with her father who is a senior citizen.According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, it is mandatory that every government building must have a ramp facility giving due respect to disabled persons for ease in movement.Anita Iyer Narayan, consultant accessibility, diversity and inclusion, founder and managing trustee, Ekansh Trust, said, “It will be difficult for disabled or senior citizens to use the staircase. The police need to put handrails in place, the flower pots have to be cleared and a ramp with at least one landing in between using slip-proof tiles. There have to be tactile markers for those who are visually impaired. There is simply no accessibility for disabled or for senior citizens.”“The police need to be sensitised and some idea of sign language is essential. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and public works department (PWD) should not pass such design structures at all unless it is fully accessible,” she said.The newly appointed police inspector Vinayak Vetal agreed that there is no ramp facility for easy accessibility for senior citizens and for differently-abled.“I have just taken charge and yes, this police station does not have a ramp, but I will welcome suggestions from residents to rectify this,” he said.Commissioner of Police, Amitabh Gupta, said, “We will do the needful at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/koregaon-park-police-station-sans-ramp-facility-for-differentlyabled-101640793385243.html

29-12-2021||Patna||Central team points to shortage of Covid drugs in Sitamarhi, low RT-PCR tests in Bihar||A four-member Central team has reported near-absence of drugs, considered vital in the management of Covid-19, in Sitamarhi, where it inspected the district hospital on Tuesday, the second day of its four-day visit to the state, said sources in the state health department.The team found that there was no stock of Remdesivir and Enoxaparin injections, while around 700 vials of Dexamethasone injection were available in the district. It also termed the situation alarming, officials accompanying the Central team said.While Remdesivir stops SARS CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, from spreading in the body, Enoxaparin is used to prevent and treat harmful blood clots and helps to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, is used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects in the management of Covid-19.The team advised the Sitamarhi civil surgeon to expeditiously procure these drugs from local suppliers, even as the consignment of drugs through central purchase by the state health department is expected to arrive from Patna by mid-January.The Central team also found that the district was underperforming in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, a confirmatory test for Covid-19.The team also noted that the district was performing at two-third its capacity of conducting 940 RT-PCR tests a day, and pointed out that the state needed to ramp up its RT-PCR testing facility, as it was quintessential in detecting active Covid-19 cases. At present, only 30% of the total Covid-19 tests in the state are being conducted through RT-PCR, while the remaining 70% through rapid antigen kits, which has a possibility of giving up to 40% false-negative results.The team, during its meeting with Sitamarhi district magistrate Sunil Kumar Yadav, stressed conducting RT-PCR tests compulsorily of all passengers arriving in the district by train or inter-state buses.The team, however, expressed satisfaction that adequate arrangements for oxygen were put in place at most state health facilities, including the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur, which it also visited on Tuesday.On Wednesday, the team visited the Patna railway junction, the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Patna Medical College Hospital, and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, all in Patna.The Central team, headed by Dr. Arti Bahl of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi, includes Dr Neeraj Kumar, also from the NCDC, Dr Saurabh Karmakar of AIIMS-Patna, and Hemant Mahajan of RMRIMS, Patna.Most of the Central team members refused to comment on the ongoing inspection.Efforts to reach Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Sunil Kumar Yadav, district magistrate, and Dr. Rameshwar Safi, civil surgeon of Sitamarhi, proved futile, as they did not respond to phone calls.The Centre has deployed multi-disciplinary surveillance teams in 10 states, including Bihar, as a potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic looms.
29-12-2021||Patna||Crime in 2021: Prohibition kept Bihar cops busy, 9 get death for hooch tragedy||The year 2021 kept the Bihar Police on its toes. While enforcing liquor prohibition remained the biggest challenge, corruption in officialdom kept the vigilance wing busy in the last quarter of the year, which saw frequent raids and searches. A blast at Darbhanga railway station in a parcel arriving from Secunderabad, though minor which caused no injuries, became a cause of concern after the probe revealed a terror link. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar said there was no let-up in crackdown against outlaws. “In 2020, about 1,417 criminals were convicted across the state while 2,565 criminals have been convicted so far in 2021. Similarly, in corruption cases, the Economic Offences Unit (EoU) and Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) launched a drive against corrupt government officials and lodged more than 20 cases,” said Gangwar. Liquor smuggling In prohibition cases, Bihar Police registered around 60,000 FIRs, arrested over 75,000 persons, including 1,800 hailing from outside the state, and convicted 253 people in 2021. The police seized 13, 839 vehicles in this connection. Death sentence for hooch tragedyA Gopalganj court awarded death sentence to nine people in the 2016 hooch tragedy case in which 19 people died and two lost vision. The court sent four of the women accused to life imprisonment. Prohibition was enforced in Bihar on April 5, 2016. Terror casesOn June 17, a parcel containing clothes sent from Secunderabad to Darbhanga by a train exploded while being unloaded. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), on December 24, filed a charge sheet against five people, including Hafiz Iqbal alias Kana, an alleged operative of terror outfit LeT.A special NIA court of Patna awarded life sentences to three terrorists of Jamat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and 10 years’ imprisonment to five others for the IED explosion in Bodh Gaya in 2018 when Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was camping in the town to participate in the month-long Kalachakra puja. Four of the nine men convicted for the 2013 blasts at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan were sentenced to death by an NIA court in Patna, which also sentenced the five other convicts to prison terms ranging from life to seven years. Six people were killed and 90 others injured in seven blasts on October 27, 2013, right before BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi was to reach the venue to address an election meeting. Judge versus policeThe Patna High Court took suo motu cognizance after two police officers in Madhubani district allegedly assaulted an additional district judge at Jhanjharpur subdivisional court. One of the police officers, a station house officer, was relieved of his charge after the judge filed a complaint. The policemen have also alleged that they were assaulted by lawyers and court staff. The HC is still hearing the case. Murder that rocked Bihar IndiGo Airlines’ manager Rupesh Kumar Singh was shot dead on January 12 outside his residence in Patna, a killing that hit the national headlines. On February 3, police arrested a youth, identified as Rituraj Singh, 28, and claimed he killed Rupesh days after the latter’s car hit his bike that led to an altercation between the two. Crackdown on corruptionTwo Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, four deputy SP rank officers and four other officials were suspended for their alleged role illegal mining. All are currently facing departmental proceedings. HC lets off massacre accusedSetting aside the conviction by a district court, the Patna High Court acquitted all the 13 accused in the 1999 Senari massacre case in which 34 upper caste people were killed allegedly by members of the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) in Senari village, then part of Jehanabad district and now in Arwal district. The Supreme Court has agreed to examine an appeal of the Bihar government against the High Court’s judgment. 1,582 sub-inspectors inducted The understaffed Bihar Police inducted 1582 sub-inspectors, including 596 women after the passing out parade at the Bihar Police Academy (BPA) in Rajgir, which was attended by chief minister Nitish Kumar.

Do you have no regard for social reforms? If it is so, leave this place,” Kumar snapped, when a scuffle between some people in the crowd and security personnel caught his attention.According to the police, some local elected representatives had come to submit a memorandum to the chief minister and picked up a quarrel when they were stopped at a distance from the dais.The matter was resolved after the district police chief had a word with the agitated people, though not before they had received a tongue lashing from the chief minister.“This meeting has been primarily organised for women. You people have been allowed to watch. Do you think social awakening is required only for them and not for you men?” said a visibly upset Kumar.“If you have any grievances, meet me when I am through with the function,” he said.Kumar then resumed his speech. It was, however, not known whether the chastised members of the crowd got an audience with him.The chief minister launched his “Samaj Sudhar Abhiyaan (social reforms campaign)” on December 22 and has so far toured East Champaran, Gopalganj and Rohtas districts.Kumar’s decision in April 2016 to ban sale and consumption of liquor has been under scanner since hooch tragedies around Deepawali claimed more than 40 lives and police went into an overdrive to strictly enforce prohibition.Fresh embarrassment for him came a few days back when Chief Justice of India N V Ramana remarked that the prohibition law in Bihar suffered from a “lack of foresight” and has resulted in higher judiciary getting “clogged with bail applications”.Kumar, however, has been undeterred, saying that no exemption will be granted even to people coming from outside and they “need not visit Bihar if prohibition inconveniences them”.PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nitish-loses-cool-at-muzaffarpur-rally-101640792967052.html
29-12-2021||Ranchi||CM Soren announces ₹25/L subsidy on petrol for ration card holders in J’khand||Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday announced to provide ₹25 per litre in subsidy to all ration card holders in the state if they buy the fuel for their two-wheelers. Each family holding a ration card would be entitled for the subsidy up to 10 litres of petrol every month. “We have decided to provide a relief of ₹25 per litre on petrol to the poor, labour and middle class. This scheme will be implemented from January 26,” Soren said at the state-level event at Morhabadi ground here to mark two years of his alliance government, which comprises his party Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal. Though Soren did not elaborate on the modalities of the scheme in his speech, his office later tweeted stating that the scheme is meant for fuel being bought for two-wheelers by ration card holders.“Petrol and diesel prices are skyrocketing. It has had bad impact on the poor and middle class families. Many poor families are not even being able to ride their motorcycle due to the soaring fuel prices. They are not even being able to sell their produce. So, I have decided that if ration card holders buy petrol for their motorcycle or scooter, we will transfer money into their accounts at the rate of ₹25 per litre. We will implement this scheme from January 26. All such families could avail of this scheme every month,” Soren’s office said in a tweet. As per the data of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), Jharkhand currently has 58.25 lakh ration card holders.There have been repeated demands by the opposition BJP in the state to reduce VAT (value-added tax) on petrol and diesel, especially after the Centre reduced excise duty on these fuel whose prices had hit a record levels above ₹100 per litre across country. The Soren government, however, has so far refused to reduce the existing VAT rate (22 per cent or ₹17 per litre, whichever is higher, on petrol). On Wednesday, petrol was selling at ₹98.52 in state capital Ranchi. Jharkhand BJP president Deepak Prakash described the announcement an eyewash. “This would also prove to be a mere announcement like other electoral promises of this government. If the state government is so concerned for the poor, they should have reduced VAT rate on both petrol and diesel and provide relief to common people. This government would again take a U-turn on this announcement as done in the past,” said Prakash. The chief minister laid foundation stone of various projects, besides unveiling the new tourism policy of the state. He also announced credit cards for students soon in order to provide them educational loans.Governor Ramesh Bais, JMM president and Rajya Sabha member Shibu Soren and former union minister and Jharkhand Congress in-charhe RPN Singh were also present on the occasion.Riders applySubsidy only for petrol for two-wheelersSubsidy up to 10 litres of petrol every monthNo reduction in VAT rate yetState currently has 58.25 lakh ration card holders||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/cm-soren-announces-rs-25-l-subsidy-on-petrol-for-ration-card-holders-in-jkhand-101640792965625.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||CM wants home portfolio, I have offered to quit, says Anil Vij||Haryana home minister Anil Vij, who was divested of the urban local bodies’ portfolio on Wednesday, had offered to resign from the council of ministers on Tuesday after being told that he may also have to lose the home portfolio.The outspoken minister on Wednesday told HT that his offer to quit came when chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar expressed his intent to divest him of the home department as well.‘Campaign on to divest me of home dept’“I told the CM on Tuesday that a campaign is being run for the last two years to oust me from the home department. Why divest me of the home department only? I am willing to give up all my portfolios,” the six-time MLA said.Clearly riled up at the prospect of being divested of the home portfolio, the minister said he has also drafted a letter offering to quit.Vij said he was initially told by the CM that he will have to shed one portfolio for allocating it to newly-inducted minister Kamal Gupta.“But then, the CM told me that he also wanted the charge of home department for himself. So, I told the CM that I was ready to relinquish the charge of all portfolios and will give this in writing to the governor,” Vij said.As on Wednesday, Vij holds the portfolios of home, health, medical education and research, Ayush, technical education, and science and technology.‘Not fascinated by privileges of a minister’The minister said he is not one to cling on as a cabinet minister and would be happy to work for people as an MLA.“I am clear and categorical on these issues. I am a BJP worker and will always remain one. Ministerial berths, portfolios, perks and privileges do not matter to me. I have told the CM that I am willing to give up all my portfolios,” Vij said.The home minister said he was peeved at not being formally informed by the CM about Tuesday’s cabinet inductions.“We as ministers at least need some ‘izzat’ (respect). Isn’t it appropriate that the CM discusses such important developments with his cabinet colleagues,” Vij added.

Event organisers are worried that the guidelines will have a financial impact on the business. “We had planned an event, passes of which ranged from ₹500 to ₹5,000. They have been all sold out. Being at an indoor venue, we are worried about the capacity. Now if more people come in then it would be a problem for us despite all the Covid safety measures being taken,” said an event planner on condition of anonymity.  Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We appeal to all the citizens to strictly follow the Covid safety guidelines while celebrating. Elderly people and children should try to remain at home. We will take strict actions against event planners who violate the guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/event-organisers-in-a-fix-over-restrictions-on-ny-festivities-101640792484998.html

According to PTI, Shivakumar later asked the cameraman to delete the footage and asked the person to behave responsibly.In a statement later, he did not deny the slapping, but asked if such acts (putting arm around) can be allowed simply because one is a ‘karyakarta (worker)’. “What will others looking at it say?” he added.Last week, the Kanakapura MLA had torn a copy of the anti-conversion bill that was tabled in the Karnataka Assembly.

29-12-2021||Mumbai||Warmer mornings, cooler days a trend in Mumbai this December||MUMBAI: This past month, Mumbai has witnessed its warmest December mornings in over a decade, with the average daily minimum temperature touching 20.18 degree Celsius as compared to 19.77 degree Celsius in 2020. This is the first time in over a decade that the average minimum reading for December has crossed the 20 degree Celsius threshold. The lowest minimum recorded this month was 17.4 degree Celsius on December 29 while last year, the lowest minimum temperature was 15 degree Celsius on the same date.D S Pai who heads the climate research and services division at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Pune said, “So it is clear that the nights and early mornings have been warmer than the last few years, but just because the minimum temperature is showing an increase, we cannot say that December as a whole was warmer. The data shows that during daytime, the conditions were actually cooler than usual.” The average daily maximum temperature recorded in Mumbai this year was 31.1 degree Celsius, the lowest since 2017.For comparison, the average maximum temperature in 2020 and 2019 stood at 32.67 and 32.68 degree Celsius, respectively. The highest maximum recorded this December was 35 degree Celsius on December 13, as compared to a seasonal high of 36.4 degree Celsius last year. One of the reasons for this, according to Pai, could be the presence of a greater amount of moisture in Mumbai’s air this December due to the prevalence of rain-bearing easterly winds.Earlier this month, the city recorded 91mm of rain on December 1, marking the month’s wettest day on record. This was due to a vigorous northeast monsoon in India, combined with a low pressure system over the southeast and east-central Arabian Sea at the time. “As a result, we’ve had more cloudy days across parts of the Konkan and even interior Maharashtra. This moisture helps to cool during the day, but at night it acts like a greenhouse gas and traps terrestrial radiation, pushing up the minimum temperature,” Pai said.Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK, agreed with this broad argument but cautioned that the trend of warmer mornings and cooler days cannot be attributed to a single factor alone. “The appropriate meteorological factor would have shown up had this difference in averages been very large, such as three to four degree Celsius or more, in which case you’d expect major changes in the wind direction and some sort of linkage to other phenomena,” said Deoras, emphasising that a linear relationship between moisture and temperature is hard to imagine in this case since other factors are also at play.However, Deoras agreed that an ‘hyperactive northeast monsoon’ likely played an important role in the incursion of moisture over the region this December. “Relative humidity over 22 days of December remained higher than the normal values at about 5,000 feet off the ground. But there’s a major difference between December 1 to 11 and December 12 to 22 with the values sharply going down during the latter part as the influence of the northeast monsoon ended,” Deoras said.Deoras offered another explanation saying, “If you get winds from the north (and not strictly north but from the northern states), the minimum temperature reduces due to the transport of cold air. This month, such instances are not being seen that frequently,” he said. IMD data in fact shows that there have been only three days this month that Mumbai received strong winds blowing directly from the north, between December 27 and 29, which were responsible for the dip in mercury levels on Wednesday morning.“It would be my hypothesis that such cold snaps or northerly winds have not been felt that strongly this time, which has reduced the cooling in general around Mumbai. In fact, above average minimum temperature is seen not just in the city but also in the adjoining areas of Konkan and madhya Maharashtra,” Deoras explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/warmer-mornings-cooler-days-a-trend-in-mumbai-this-december-101640791165013.html

According to the latest health bulletin data, case positivity rate in the national capital currently stood at 1.29 per cent.The last time the national capital logged over 900 cases in a day was on May 30 when 946 infections were reported.Delhi has been consistently seeing an uptick in fresh Covid-19 cases. Today's figures are 427 more than Tuesday's when 496 new cases were reported. The overall virus tally of Delhi has now shot up to 14,45,102 with the active case count touching 2,191.Delhi is also a leading contributor to India's Omicron tally with 238 confirmed cases so far. Maharashtra, which till now was the top contributor, dropped to the second slot after reporting no Omicron case on Tuesday.Earlier in the day, in a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, it was decided no fresh curbs will be imposed in the city and the ‘yellow alert’ will continue to remain in place.The meeting was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, among other government officials and ministers,The ‘yellow alert’ was sounded a day ago in Delhi in the wake of the worsening pandemic crisis.

29-12-2021||Mumbai||Resident doctors of Sion, KEM Hospitals to withdraw services from today||Mumbai After first-year resident doctors of Sion Hospital joined the nationwide protests by withdrawing from both elective and emergency services from 8 am on Wednesday, all resident doctors from KEM and Sion hospitals will go on an indefinite strike starting Thursday. In separate statements released by the resident doctors of the respective hospitals, they have clarified that all elective, emergency and OPD services will be withdrawn from 2 pm onwards at Sion Hospital whereas, at KEM Hospital, students will start their strike from 5 pm. Resident doctors at KEM Hospital, however, have stated that they will continue working in full force in Covid wards despite the strike.This move comes 48 hours after several resident doctor associations across the country showed solidarity with their fellow doctors who were attacked first, then arrested in Delhi for participating in a peaceful protest.“We (resident doctors) have been working at two-thirds strength for at least seven months now, and are overworked and burnt out both physically and mentally. For weeks now, many of us have been preparing peacefully demanding that first-year postgraduate admissions be initiated, but despite assurances from several Central government authorities, no timeline for admissions have been announced yet,” said the statement released by Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), KEM Hospital.Similarly, MARD representatives at Sion Hospital have decided to join their first-year resident doctors starting Thursday. There are nearly 600 resident doctors in Sion Hospital and 790 in KEM Hospital working at present.“It has been more than six months that we have made multiple legal appeals, protested silently and despite working with only two-thirds of the workforce, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. What is even more unacceptable is the manner in which peaceful protesting resident doctors were thrashed by the police and eventually arrested as well in the national capital,” added their statement. For weeks now, resident doctors across the country have been participating in a protest to raise objections to the delay in PG medical admissions. One of the major concerns raised by these doctors has been the extra work being shared by just two batches of resident doctors instead of three. “At a time when the country is witnessing a rise of a new Covid variant, the least that needs to be done is strengthening of the health care system and we need all hands on deck,” said one of the protesting doctors and added that these admissions will ensure 45,000 more doctors entering the healthcare sector.NEET-PG 2021 exam, which should take place in January, was postponed to February first, then April this year. It was eventually delayed indefinitely due to increasing cases of Covid-19 registered across the country.The entrance test was finally conducted in the month of September this year, but admissions post the exam has been stayed by the Supreme Court which is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of implementation of EWS and OBC quota in all India quota (AIQ) seats and admissions remain stayed until January 6, 2022.“All these months we’ve ensured emergency and Covid duty does not get affected but this attack on our fellow doctors has not gone down well with the entire community,” said another resident doctor. 
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Unconditional love of the ever wandering mongrels||More than 90% of street dogs are not violent; only 2% are overly aggressive. Their count is never decreasing, remaining the same or even increasing and it has made us used to having them in our midst this long. If not disturbed, they mostly do not bother anyone and one can safely go past them watching and enjoying them, or dreading them prudently. One or two may look to see if there are any possible handouts coming their way. Most of them appear healthy and handsome. In spite of frequent non-eventful meetings with so many free roaming dogs, what astounds me is that I did get bitten quite badly just last month, by my friend’s domestic pet dog, not by the so-called fearful ones on the street. I had approached the familiar family dog with my friend’s consent and he being annoyed, unpredictably attacked my arm. The dog not having had an anti-rabies shot, prompted me to go running to hospital for the obligatory treatment. A 2013 study of13 Tamil Nadu schools found that roaming pet dogs accounted for more than half of the dog bites suffered by students. The survey of a Kerala hospital also reflected the same results. More than 50% dog owners do not keep tabs on the vaccination of their pets. Well, these poor, feral dogs have to take the blame of all dog bites. A majority of dogs are undoubtedly among the most responsive and loving animals. Dog spelled backwards is God and many say that it is no coincidence as both exhibit unconditional love and forgiveness. I had the privilege of befriending a free and growing dog. We had seen his pregnant mother visiting the bushes of our residence. Soon she gave birth to five beautiful puppies. Of all these, the only one that lasted, was the most docile. The rest of the pups could not survive primarily due to attacks by bigger dogs and other accidents. The survivor, named Boxie, was seen to grow into a handsome white-fur chap with black patches. He would frequent our place greeting us with a wagging tail even if not given any treat. If shouted at harshly for sitting in damp flower beds during the summer, he would just give me a meek look with his ears drooping and would slip away with a limp tail. Sometimes, he would come with another brown street dog, nicknamed Brownie. If we exhibited any affection for Brownie, Boxie would come between us and his friend, protesting with jealous growls, showing his possessiveness of us. In spite of no responsibility or any efforts for his care, there were countless memorable joyous moments with him. Suddenly, after about five years, Boxie disappeared. I then realised that street dogs rarely live more than this time due to numerous predicaments around. Since 1992, International Homeless Animals Day has been conceived by the International Society for Animal Rights, which was celebrated on August 21 this year. As per the motto of this day, it’s encouraging to know that adopting street dogs is gaining popularity in India. Nowadays, in this chilly weather, it is indeed heart-warming to see a few stray dogs looking stately, covered in dog jackets. They do have good friends maybe limited, undertaking to mitigate their suffering. It’s true: Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole. anshularao@gmail.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based retired additional superintending engineer of BBMB||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unconditional-love-of-the-ever-wandering-mongrels-101640789904926.html
29-12-2021||Mumbai||At 17.4° Celsius, Mumbai sees coldest morning of season||Mumbai: On Wednesday, the city temperature dipped to 17.4 degrees Celsius, the season’s coolest morning so far. The mercury had last dropped below the 18 degrees Celsius mark on December 24, when it settled at 17.9 degrees Celsius, as per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) observatory in Santacruz, which is taken as representative of the city and suburbs.Wednesday’s minimum temperature is down from 19 degrees Celsius the previous day. Officials attributed the dip to the influence of a cold snap blowing over the Konkan, carrying cooler air from north India. “Throughout the month there has been a lot of variation in the intensity and direction of winds. For Mumbai and surrounding, head on winds directly from the north are important for cooling at this time of the year. We are experiencing such winds at the moment, but there will be another spike in temperature in a few days once the wind direction changes again,” said an official with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, the minimum temperature is expected to rise slightly over the next week, touching 19 degrees Celsius once again by December 31 and 21 degrees Celsius by January 3. The maximum temperature is expected to hover around 31 degrees Celsius during this time, up from the 29.3 degrees Celsius reading on Tuesday (which was two degrees below normal).Air quality in Mumbai improved to the ‘moderate’ category on Wednesday evening, with an AQI value of 173. This was down from 239, indicating ‘poor’ air, earlier in the day as per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research’s (SAFAR) network of monitors in the city. “This is because of the strong influence of northerly winds, but there will be a dip in speed after Saturday, so there may be another spike in pollution after that,” said the IMD official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-17-4-celsius-mumbai-sees-coldest-morning-of-season-101640788526312.html

Names such as Pinku, Mohar and Bablu, said Sharma. And the 15-17 donkeys recovered by the police didn’t respond to any of them.Sharma said they bluntly refused to accept them. And he had to set up the special team.They eventually ended their dharna outside the police station after officers promised to find their donkeys within 15 days.“A police team led by ASI and five constables are searching the missing donkeys,” the police officer said.According to reports from Hanumangarh, the villagers told the police that each donkey was worth about ₹20,000, and the 70 donkeys, worth a princely sum of ₹14 lakh.Rajasthan, which has a 500-year-old tradition of hosting a mega donkey fair in Jaipur district, has 23,000 donkeys that are mostly used by nomadic pastoralists in brick kilns for carrying bricks and pulling wheel carts. The population of the beasts of burden in the country and Rajasthan has, however, declined steeply. Between 2012 and 2019, their population in the country fell by 61%, according to the Centre’s livestock census. In Rajasthan, the decline has been sharper; 70%.Sharma said officers from his police station have sounded out people in the nearby villages to be careful about their livestock, especially donkeys, in view of the serial thefts.
29-12-2021||Mumbai||Nurse arrested after patient dies due to wrong injection||Mumbai The Shivaji Nagar police have arrested a 30-year-old nurse after she had allegedly given a wrong injection to a patient in a private hospital at Govandi, who was later shifted to the KEM hospital and died. A panel of doctors which included three doctors of Sir JJ hospital, after examining the medical reports of the deceased, concluded that the death of the woman occurred due to a wrong injection.Based on the doctor’s report of JJ hospital, the Shivaji Nagar police registered a case in the last week under Section 304 (II) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against doctor Rehan Khan of Mannat hospital and nurse Nafisha Mohammad Aslam Shaikh, said police officer. According to the police, the victim, Shabana Sayyad, 36, a resident of Shivaji Nagar area, Govandi was running a fever when she visited Mannat hospital which is located near her residence on October 2, 2020. Nafisha was working as a nurse and she gave her an injection and some medicine without even consulting the doctor. But after two days, Sayyad’s condition worsened and she contracted an infection at the spot, where she was administered the injection, added the officer.She again visited the hospital and Nafisha gave a few more medicines. On October 6, 2020, when the victim’s family members asked the doctor for the reason behind the swelling and infection, the doctor decided to operate.

29-12-2021||Patna||Bihar govt seeks to promote transparency in Panchayati Raj institutions||The Bihar government plans to build Panchayati Raj Bhawans, which will work as secretariats at the grassroots level to ensure people get their work done through a centralised system as part of efforts to promote transparency. Samrat Choudhary, the state Panchayati Raj minister, said there is currently no proper system for auditing funds, which leads to a non-submission of utilisation certificates and a lack of monitoring of work. He added though Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) have been functional in the state and the money is also being spent, the focus now will be putting a system in place to ensure the benefits reach the people, the quality of work is regularly monitored and there is accountability for every rupee spent.Also Read | Third wave of Covid-19 has started in Bihar, says chief minister Nitish Kumar Choudhary cited a Comptroller and Auditor General report and said it has pointed to non-submission of utilisation certificates for around ₹37,000 crores spent through PRIs. “It is important to know the trail of funds spent by PRIs, but right now there is... (no) mechanism for periodic auditing. For the piped water scheme alone, the department has given ₹2,000 crores to the public health engineering department for execution. More funds under different schemes are coming and efforts are on to create the system for it.”Choudhary said the government will appoint audit officers at the block and district levels. “We are creating an engineering cell for executing and monitoring work, which will also track the fund flow for different schemes. Efforts are also being made to reduce red tape... The Panchayati Raj officers have been named new executive officers of panchayat samities replacing the block development officers.”Amid questions over the quality of work, especially in the piped water scheme, Choudhary said it was being taken care of with the constitution of State Quality Monitor (SQM) for supervision of work at the block and panchayat level.“The SQM will comprise retired officers from the administration and engineering fields. We have created 131 posts. There will be 8000 executive officers.”Choudhary said there will be a schedule for officers from various departments--health, education, food supplies, revenue, agriculture, rural development-- for addressing people’s complaints. He added the Centre will provide Bihar ₹1000 crores annually for five years to address healthcare needs in the rural areas. “This will involve setting up primary health centres (PHCs), additional PHCs and health centres as well as supply of medicines,” he said.Choudhary said the new Panchayat Bhawans will be made of eco-friendly fly ash bricks and blocks. “Each Panchayat Bhawan costs around ₹1-1.5 crore.

The video went viral days after calls for violence against Muslims and Christians at the religious gathering provoked outrage.In the video, a woman seer can be seen handing a complaint to Rakendra Kathait, the station house officer of Haridwar Kotwali police station, where a case has been registered against the hate speech accused. “After this complaint, a message should be sent that you are unbiased. You are an administrative officer adhering to the Constitution. You are equal for all. This is our expectation from you,” the woman is purportedly heard telling Kathait. Yati Narsinghanand, who has also been accused of hate speech, is then purportedly heard saying the officer will be on their side. The officer is then seen nodding before they share a laugh.Kumar said based on the report, they will take further departmental action, if required. “The police are taking all the necessary action in the case in which a probe is already on. We have already named three accused in the case and will add more as the probe unfolds.”Also Read: Hindus doing politics in name of Hindutva are fake: Gehlot on Dharma Sansad rowKathait said he had gone to serve notices to two of the three named accused in the case, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi (formerly Waseem Rizwi) and Sadhvi Annapurna, on Tuesday when the video was shot. “One has to understand the whole context of the scenario. I had gone there to serve them notices... stating that they have to present themselves before police or court as and when required. While I was there, Tyagi and other seers present said they were coming to the police station to lodge their complaint, to which I said I wouldn’t be available there in the next few hours, and hence, received their complaint there.”He denied sharing a laugh with the accused, saying, “I was present there with many other people. Anybody can say anything, but that does not mean I am associated with them. The question would arise if I would have replied to their statement. As police officers, we work as per the Constitution and in an unbiased manner.”Police couldn’t serve the notice to the third named accused, Dharamdas Maharaj, as he was not at his residence in Haridwar on Tuesday.In a week since the case was registered, police have only served notices to the named accused who are yet to inform them about the appearance. Once their statements are recorded, police will take a call whether they should be arrested.

29-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves marginally, enters ‘poor’ zone||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality improved marginally and entered the “poor” zone on Wednesday morning amid shallow fog as overcast weather was expected in the Capital. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) at 7am was 288. On Tuesday, the average 24-hour AQI was 305 - in the lower end of the “very poor” category. PM 2.5 was the dominant pollutant in the air.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The air quality was expected to improve. On Tuesday, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said the AQI improved to the “poor” category due to an increase in mixing layer height to 1.5km on Monday that ventilated the near-surface pollutants. Light rain due to western disturbance was likely to improve the AQI further to the upper end of the “moderate” or lower end of the “poor” category. “On 30th (December), 31st (December), and 1st (January), winds are likely to be low reducing ventilation of pollutants, and AQI is expected to be within the ‘poor’ category. From 2nd (January) onwards improvement in AQI is likely due to relatively high winds.”The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the minimum temperature on Wednesday was likely to be 8 degrees Celsius and the maximum 20 degrees Celsius. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was 9.4 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, and the maximum 18 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal.

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||When it comes to national security realism should trump jingoism: Manish Tewari||Senior Congress leader and Sri Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari on Tuesday said it was high-time that Indian political parties analysed national security with realism and humility as opposed to jingoism. Tewari, who was speaking at the launch of his latest book, ‘10 Flashpoints; 20 Years National Security Situations That Impacted India’, at Sector 10, Chandigarh, said, “Over the past 70 years, we have not been able to leave behind the legacy of Partition, and resolve the unsettled borders with China. In order to prosper, we need a political modus operandi with both Pakistan and China, which is not simply a tactical response to an evolving and unfolding situation, as has been seen so far.” Asserting that India will never be able to get to the level it deserves until South Asia was integrated, he said, “Our national security expenditure, and our threats do not match. We either need to dramatically increase the national security expenditure or reduce the threats to our national security.”‘China has 5:1 power differential’ On Chinese influence in South Asia, Tewari said, “In the last 30 years, China has worked on its defense, and infrastructure so it has a power differential of 5:1 with all its neighbours. The Chinese have settled most of their territorial disputes, barring India, and some maritime disputes. It is this power differential, which has given China the confidence to settle disputes on its terms. We need 30 years of peace to match up to China.” The former union minister, who specializes in strategic affairs, said, “The humiliation of 1971 has become a part of Pakistan’s institutional psyche. India should have given a more kinetic response to Pakistan in the aftermath of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks as the incident was not a flash in the pan. Many bombings had taken place across the country.”Govt obfuscating standoff in Ladakh: Tewari The MP also slammed the government for trying brush the 20-month standoff with China in Ladakh under the carpet. “The government is trying to obfuscate matters. Not a single debate has been held in the Parliament, nor has the government said anything about the expenditure incurred,” said Tewari.Asked about India’s no first-use policy pertaining to nuclear weapons, Tewari said the policy has been instrumental in establishing India’s reputation as a responsible global power, and that there was no saying what happened when a push came to a shove. “A first-use policy is anyway an extremely expensive position to assume. We don’t have the wherewithal to implement it as the risk of an accident is large.” Tewari, who had moved a private member’s bill seeking to bring intelligence agencies under a regulatory framework, said, “The collection, coalition, analysis, analysis of intelligence takes place in silos, which weakens security. A similar debate was seen after the blast at the Ludhiana court complex, where intelligence agencies said they had warned the authorities.” Saying that “Tewari hits his boundaries with a straight bat”, former chief of army staff general VP Malik mostly agreed with Tewari’s assessment of the national security situation. “India was no way close to China in terms of “comprehensive power”, which not only means military power, but economic power as well. We need to analyse intelligence correctly so as to be able to check security threats.” The book was introduced to the audience by former IAS officer Vivek Atrey who said that India had to go beyond ‘retail politics’ to think in the long-term when it comes to foreign policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/when-it-comes-to-national-security-realism-should-trump-jingoism-manish-tewari-101640728502875.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||In vote for change, 29 fresh faces make it to Chandigarh MC House||In a vote for change, it was not only the debutant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which pipped the old guards, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, but in case of individual candidates too, voters overwhelmingly opted for fresh and young faces.In the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections, the results of which were announced on Monday, 29 out of the 35 councillors who made it to the House are first-timers.With the city voting for fresh faces, BJP was the biggest loser. Of the 16 councillors, their relatives or former councillors, only six made it through, including wives of two councillors. Even of these six, two could barely cross victory mark. Maheshinder Singh Sidhu won by only 11 votes from ward 2 and Dalip Sharma from ward 3 by 90 votes. All these BJP’s old faces lost to first-timers.For the Congress, putting up a dozen councillors and ex-councillors, only three – Harpreet Kaur Babla, Gurbax Rawat and Gurcharanjit Singh Kala, could win. Both of its sitting councillors Satish Kainth and Ravinder Kaur Gujral lost. Party’s former mayor Kamlesh lost to the first-timer Neha, who became the youngest winner at 25 years.The AAP fighting its first elections, except for one old face, all of its candidates were the first-timers, and 14 of them won. It lone old timer, Chander Mukhi Sharma, lost from ward 13.It’s a young candidate’s electionMore than half of those elected to the MC house are below 40 years of age.Of the total 35 winners, 19 candidates are below the age of 40, nine are between 41-50 years, five are between 50-60 years, and only one is above 60 years.Of the total 203 candidates in the fray, 95 were aged between 21 and 40 years and 108 were above it.The young guns have turned into giant killers in the election. Running a dhaba in Sector 22, 31-year-old Daman Preet Singh from AAP defeated the outgoing mayor Ravi Kant Sharma. “Nobody gave me a chance but we continued to work hard. I have been doing social work during the pandemic period, and the farmers’ agitation finally pushed me into politics. I am here to make a positive difference in people’s lives and governance system,” said Singh.Another young candidate, though already having a taste of electoral politics, the second youngest candidate, Sachin Galav, 27, also put down a seasoned player in the city politics, AAP campaign chairman, Chander Mukhi Sharma. The former Panjab University student union president Galav, said, “University politics and mainstream elections are different. It was likely for the first time I was contesting an election.” Galav wants to bring facilities to his ward, comprising PU and PGIMER, which MC generally overlooks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-vote-for-change-29-fresh-faces-make-it-to-chandigarh-mc-house-101640728202882.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||For third week in row, Chandigarh tricity area’s Covid tally remains above 100||The tricity’s weekly Covid-19 tally remained above the 100-mark for the third consecutive week with as many as 146 fresh infections reported in the week ending on December 26. This is the highest weekly tally seen in the city since the second wave started receding in July.In Chandigarh, the effect of increased public gatherings and complacency among people in following Covid-19 protocols during election campaigning, festivities and marriage events, can easily be seen with the city contributing majority of the cases this week too.The case tally of Chandigarh and Mohali didn’t see any major change this week. Chandigarh reported 71 cases this week, against 70 last week while in Mohali, the case tally was 34, against 35 last week. Panchkula, however, saw an uptick from 31 cases last week to 41 cases this week.On December 25 alone, the tricity reported 36 cases which was the highest single-day tally in five-months.In the previous week, tricity had reported 136 cases, besides three fatalities. The fatalities dropped to two this week, with Mohali and Chandigarh reporting one death each.During the peak of the pandemic in May, the tricity had recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in just a month. The curve started flattening thereon though the weekly cases kept fluctuating. After the second wave ended, the weekly tally had never crossed the 100-mark until the week ending on November 29, which saw 109 infections. In the following week, the tally saw a 15% dip with 93 cases, but then spiked again to 126 in the week ending on December 12 and was followed by 136 cases in the subsequent week.Omicron an added worry, say expertsDr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “We had election rallies in Chandigarh this month, besides festivities and marriage events. These crowded gatherings are now inviting a surge in cases. Since Chandigarh has already reported three Omicron cases, with one of the patients still infected, it is an additional cause of worry for us. People must follow basic rules like wearing a mask, maintaining social distance and getting vaccinated against the disease as it will control the transmission.” Dr Girish Dogra, district immunisation officer, Mohali, said, “In the wake of Omicron cases being reported in the tricity and across the country, we have started sending all Covid-19 positive samples for genome sequencing at National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, to check for the variant of concern. Since Omicron is believed to be more transmissible than other variants, it can be a cause of concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/for-third-week-in-row-chandigarh-tricity-area-s-covid-tally-remains-above-100-101640728022843.html

A sum of ₹2.1 lakh was refunded on Tuesday, ₹2.2 lakh on Wednesday, ₹1.3 lakh on Thursday, ₹1.6 lakh on Friday, ₹2 lakh on Saturday and ₹1.5 lakh.The authorities, meanwhile, refunded ₹1.69 crore to 32,100 passengers due to cancellation of 567 trains in the Ferozepur division.Speaking of the losses, an official at the Ludhiana railway station said, “This is merely a small part of the loss incurred by the railways due to track blockage by farmers as most of the passengers now book their tickets online.”Officials added that the online refunds account for even bigger losses. Normality to be resorted soonA railway official said with the protest coming to an end, normality should be restored in the coming days.“Railways ferry passengers at much more economical fare than any other public transport. People had to pay higher prices to reach their destinations in absence of trains.” the official said.Passengers had faced the brunt of the protest as Northern Railways had repeatedly requested the lot to check the status of the trains before heading to the station for the complete eight-day duration.

Six members are elected to the PU senate from this constituency.The Vice-President’s secretariat in a letter to a candidate who was elected from the constituency has stated that several petitions were filed against the process of senate election held on September 1, 2021, for electing six ordinary fellows from the constituency of faculties. The letter also revealed that the petitioners have prayed for setting aside the election result of the ‘faculties constituency’ and for ordering fresh elections after revising and updating members/voters as per rules and regulations.“It has been felt appropriate to seek comments of the elected candidates from the faculties constituency on the allegations raised by the petitioners,” reads the letter sent by the Vice President’s secretariat.All six members who were elected from this constituency are from the Goyal group and are former senators. They are Navdeep Goyal, Ashok Goyal, Rajesh Gill, Keshav Malhotra, Ronki Ram and Anu Chatrath. The election for the constituency was held in September.The chancellor’s office has requested the members to provide comments on the allegations raised by the petitioners by January 7, 2022, and failing which a decision will be taken on the given petitions as per the material available at hand.So far, 71 members, including 36 nominated by the chancellor, have been notified.

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: MP brother a contender for Qadian, MLA Fateh Bajwa may shift base from segment||Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday, is most likely to shift his base from the assembly segment from where his elder brother and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa has already staked claim on Congress ticket for the upcoming elections. Even as Fateh has said that his new party will decide where he will fight the election from, sources close to him claimed that he is inclined to contest from Batala or Gurdaspur, which have a considerable number of Hindu voters. The MLA has made it clear that he will support the candidate of the BJP or its alliance partner from the segment he currently represents. Whether he will oppose his brother in the constituency, he said, “I will not oppose anybody. I will certainly support my party’s candidate.”On the constituency of his preference, he said, “I will follow whatever the party decides. I will contest from any constituency in Gurdaspur district.”Partap Bajwa on Tuesday held several election meetings in Qadian. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu during a recent rally had batted for Fateh Jung as party candidate from the constituency, claiming he would win from the constituency with a huge margin.“I had not planned to join the BJP in advance. I was feeling suffocated in the Congress as 4-5 party leaders want to become CM. The party has become direction-less is faction0-ridden,” Fateh Jung said.The BJP is the only national party which thinks of development and maintaining law and order in Punjab, added the MLA. A leader close to the Qadian MLA said he is likely to contest from Batala as he has a stranglehold there and the Congress is facing factionalism in the segment. Sidhu has announced former minister Ashwani Sekhri as party candidate from Batala, ostensibly snubbing minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa who has been focusing on the seat for a few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-mp-brother-a-contender-for-qadian-mla-fateh-bajwa-may-shift-base-from-segment-101640725684070.html

Party’s Punjab co-incharge, Raghav Chadha, while addressing the media here on Tuesday, said, “With the BJP indulging in horse-trading, we have decided to install secret cameras at each councillor’s house, and have also told them to put all calls on record. So if the BJP tries to contact them again, we will have evidence.” He said the party will make camera footage and call recordings public if any BJP leader approaches or contacts AAP councillors. Stating that there is currently no plan to take their councillors outside the city, another senior leader of AAP later, said, “We have instructed the councillors to immediately call other AAP workers if the BJP leaders try to contact them. We will immediately rush there.” Meanwhile, Chandigarh state Congress president, Subhash Chawla, Chawla, said, “Today’s AAP press conference is clear indication that they are in panic mode. Installing cameras in their councillors’ house and recording their phone calls, only shows the party fears its councillors can switch sides and that the party high command doesn’t trust its own councillors.” BJP state president Arun Sood, said, “It is a party of opportunistics, so they have to employ such surveillance methods in fear of losing their councillors.” Kejriwal road-show on Dec 30 AAP’s supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is scheduled to take out a road show on December 30 in the city, from Aroma Hotel, Sector 22 to the Sector 23 light point, a senior party leader said. The decision on the party’s mayoral candidate is also likely to be discussed on his one-day trip to the city. Stating that AAP will make the new Chandigarh mayor, Chadha said, “On his visit to the city, Arvind Kejriwal will meet the newly elected councillors. He will congratulate the winning candidates and also motivate candidates who lost. During the visit, the issue of mayoral candidate will also be discussed.” On the MC result day, Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia had met the winning candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/horsetrading-threat-aap-decides-to-put-its-chandigarh-councillors-under-surveillance-101640725562625.html

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Now, underprivileged getting preference over elite in Punjab: CM Channi||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday said the ongoing political phase is a ‘yug parivartan’ (era of transformation) in the state as the poor and underprivileged are getting preference over the elites.Addressing a rally in Mansa district’s Sardulgarh assembly segment, Channi said the Congress would win the forthcoming assembly elections due to its inclusive welfare moves.He said the election promises made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) such as cheaper electricity have actually been implemented by the Congress government in Punjab. “In a short span of time, my government introduced several welfare plans. I understand the problems faced by the common man. People should understand the hidden agenda of AAP as its Delhi-centric leadership wants to control the political power in Punjab. This is unacceptable and the voters will reject them,” said the CM.The AAP, Channi said, has lost its electoral sheen in Punjab due to its policies that go against the state’s interests.“Most of the legislators and parliamentarians elected on AAP tickets have quit the party. The Congress believes in empowering the marginalised sections and inclusive development,” he claimed.On the occasion, CM announces sub teshsil status for Bheniwal village, upgrading of the government hospital at Sardulgarh and a Government Middle School at Juhnir to the senior secondary level.He also announced an additional development grant of 2 crore for the Sardulgarh segment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-underprivileged-getting-preference-over-elite-in-punjab-cm-channi-101640725503107.html

29-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: It was all acacia here||The outdoor sound system is playing soft, moody music. It could be Kenny G.Who could have thought that this desolate wilderness in south Delhi would one day be serenaded by a saxophonist’s tunes. That the rocky ridge that used to be littered with weedy bushes and snakes would be tamed with elegant tiles. That the thorny trees would give way to showrooms and cafes.The three shoulder-to-shoulder shopping malls in Vasant Kunj lie amid a vastness that continues to be partly undomesticated. The malls opened only about a decade back. Charanjit Singh, who retired as a professor at Centre of Russian Studies in nearby Jawaharlal Nehru University, was a JNU student from 1969 to 1973. He used to go walking around the area where these malls are now, and in those times, it all used to be an “undulated thorny acacia and scrubland”.You ought to spend a lazy afternoon in the gigantic plaza outside these malls to absorb the change our city is undergoing. This December day, the sky is smog-free because of last night’s rain. A window of sharp, glittering sunshine has opened up, and some shoppers are exploiting it by lounging along the plaza’s seating spaces, speckled along an archipelago of tiny landscaped gardens.With the malls in the back and the trees lining the horizon across the Nelson Mandela Marg, one feels perched on a land of new beginnings. This is the ‘new’ New Delhi. It is like lounging in the brand new Connaught Place when it was set up by the Brits with the clearing of a babool forest all those years ago. Fifty years from today, all these trees here that face the malls might also give way to concrete destinations.Meanwhile, the plaza is a gift for people who are into people-watching. Every person here appears to be as full of stories as any promising OTT series. A couple is sitting next to a man, who is sitting alone. It is difficult to discern who is lonelier — the morosely quiet pair or the single man happily tapping on his phone. Another romantic pair is flaunting their sartorial compatibility — she is in a green leather jacket, he has a green canvas pithu bag. Then there’s the steady procession of consumers popping out of a glass door from the mall directly behind, balancing multiple shopping bags in their arms with as much dexterity as a railway station porter.Soon, the sun begins to fade, and it becomes uncomfortably cooler. Kenny G continues to serenade. A young man in a blue denim mask, white pullover and denim jeans walks past humming Lana Del Rey’s Summertime Sadness. It’s difficult to believe that some years ago this was all acacia here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-it-was-all-acacia-here-101640725253871.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||How a dongle is proving crucial in Ludhiana bomb blast probe||The dongle recovered from the Ludhiana blast site is proving to be a crucial lead in the probe.Dongle is a small device that is used with a computer, especially to access protected software or the internet. A police official, who is a part of the ongoing investigation, said while everything else kept in the bathroom of the district court complex was destroyed, the dongle incidentally got stuck inside the body of accused. It was during the evening of the explosion in the district court complex that the forensic team visited the spot and found the rubble scattered all over the place. In the debris, the police also found the body parts of the bomber, who was later identified as Gagandeep Singh. During the forensic examination, the probing team found a badly damaged dongle that was stuck inside a body part. “The dongle, tough damaged, was in good condition from which a SIM card was retrieved that further led to the establishment of the identity of bomber Gagandeep and eventually led to the arrest of his Germany-based handler Jaswinder Singh Multani,” said the official privy to the investigation. Gagandeep visited Amritsar 10 days prior the blastIt has further come to the fore that nearly 10 days before the explosion, accused Gagandeep Singh had visited Amritsar.Sources in the department said that the visit was meant to collect explosives. It has not yet been clear when the explosives were handed over to him. The police are also trying to find out where Gagandeep was trained to handle and assemble the sophisticated explosives. During the investigation, it also come to light that on the day of explosion (December 23), the bomber had spoken with the woman constable over the phone. The police are currently probing how Gagandeep travelled from Khanna to Ludhiana. While his white colour Honda Activa was recovered from Khanna, it has not yet ascertained how he reached Ludhiana court complex. It is being suspected that his handlers had ferried him and handed over the explosives enroute Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/how-a-dongle-is-proving-crucial-in-ludhiana-bomb-blast-probe-101640725382372.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Speeding challans up by 49% this year||Speeding remained the most common traffic violation in 2021, as per data compiled by the UT traffic police. Till December 26, 64,119 challans have been issued for the offence, a nearly two-fold increase from 2020, when 32,497 were issued. The number is also the highest since 2014.For speeding, traffic violation information slip (TVIS) or e-challans are issued. This was started in May 2020, when the traffic police first acquired three automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems, which clicked pictures of the speeding vehicle and detected their speed. Due to this, the number of speeding challans in 2020 saw a sharp spike compared to 8,814 in 2019.Member of the National Road Safety Council, Kamaljeet Soi said, “The uptick indicates that the cops are vigilant, which should be appreciated. Speeding is the leading cause of road fatalities, so offenders must be penalised.”Senior superintendent of police (SSP, traffic) Manisha Choudhary, added, “ We have gotten simplified speed limits notified for the benefit of road users and the speed signs have been installed on all major roads. We have been regularly conducting road safety programmes in educational institutes and for the general public. We are also in the process of procuring three night-vision speed radars.”Following some confusion regarding the speed limit, the transport department had released a notification regarding this in April. Currently, on dual carriageways (roads with dividers), the speed limit is 60km/h for light motor vehicles, 50km/h for medium and heavy passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles and 45 km/h for two-wheelers and three-wheelers. On single carriageway roads (roads without dividers), the speed limit is 50km/h for light motor vehicles, 40km/h for medium and heavy passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles and 40 km/h for two-wheelers and three-wheelers. On Sector roads the speed limit is 40km/h for all vehicles.In total 2,29764 challans were issued this year, higher than 1,76,619 in 2020, which was expected as in view of the Covid lockdown in 2020. Also, the data indicates that residents have now become more mindful of not stopping on the zebra crossing at red light intersections. In 2021, 38,095 challans were issued for this, against 55,255 in 2020. People have also started wearing helmets more often now and 13,955 challans were issued to two-wheeler riders for not wearing a helmet in 2021, against 19,739 in 2020 and a whopping 68,622 in 2019.List of major traffic offencesIn total, 2,29,764 challans for traffic violations were issued in 2021 till December 26.Speeding: 64,119Zebra crossing infractions:38,095Jumping red light: 2021- 4,090Underage driving: 29Wrong parking: 19,963Helmetless riding: 13,955Driving without seat-belt: 14,685||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-speeding-challans-up-by-49-this-year-101640725209031.html

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Two more Congress MLAs from Punjab join BJP ahead of assembly polls||In a jolt to the Punjab Congress, two of its sitting MLAs — Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa from Qadian and Balwinder Singh Laddi from Shri Hargobindpur — joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in New Delhi on Tuesday. This is the second setback for the state’s ruling Congress in the last one week as three of its MLAs joined the saffron party recently. Last week, former minister and four-time party MLA Rana Gurmeet Sodhi had joined the saffron fold. Fateh Jung, a first-time MLA, is younger brother of Rajya Sabha MP and former Punjab Congress president Partap Singh Bajwa. Laddi too is a first-time legislator. Both Fateh Jung and Laddi joined the BJP in the presence of the party’s Punjab election in-charge and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Three more MLAs from Punjab are likely to join the BJP in the coming days as the party high command has cleared their names, it is learnt. Interestingly, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu had strongly backed the candidature of Fateh Jung and Laddi at rallies early this month. Fateh was upset after his brother Partap Bajwa announced to contest the assembly polls from Qadian that the former represents. Also, former Akali MLA Gurtej Singh Gudhiyana, ex-Sangrur MP Rajdev Khalsa, United Christian Front Punjab president Kamal Bakshi and Nihal Singh Wala civic body member Jagdeep Singh Dhaliwal also joined the party. Ex-cricketer Dinesh Mongia inducted in saffron fold Former Team India cricketer Dinesh Mongia, 44, who has family roots in Hoshiarpur district, also joined the BJP. Born and brought up in Chandigarh, Mongia played 59 one-day international (ODI) matches for India and had represented Punjab in the domestic cricket. “I wanted to come into active politics and serve the people of Punjab. To me, the BJP appeared to be the best option because of the leadership abilities of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Mongia told HT over phone.

Councillors from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) accused MC officials of not supplying manhole covers in their wards, making them “victims” of public fury and embarrassment. SAD leader Sarabjit Singh raised the issue in the House following which he gathered support from a few other councillors, including Harwinder Kaler of the LIP. However, Congress councillor Jai Prakash, who is also the chairperson of the MC purchase committee, countered the allegations claiming that 700 spare covers were lying with the civic body which were supplied to JEs and SDOs timely. Kaler-Mamta face-offHeated arguments ensued between Kaler and Congress councillor Mamta Ashu after the former accused Jai Prakash of getting signatures from the councillors even before supplying the required material. Strongly condemning Kaler, Mamta referred to Jai Prakash as the most honest and senior-most councillor of the Congress in Ludhiana. All councillors of the Congress, along with the mayor, supported him. Strict action recommended against SDOs, JEsCouncillors, during the discussion at the zero hour, blamed JEs and SDOs for not supplying the development and construction materials, including manholes covers, to them despite repeated requests. Taking strict note of it, the mayor asked the senior officials to fix the responsibility of JEs and SDOs to deliver the material in a time-bound manner and also take strict action against them for lackadaisical attitude. “We are spending huge amount of money on the development works and despite availability of the required material, JEs are not supplying them to the councillors in time, which is unacceptable. I will take serious action against them in case of any further negligence,” the mayor said. Congress councillors even called a few JEs and SDOs useless and corrupt. The mayor, meanwhile, directed the zonal commissioners to hold regular meetings with the councillors to resolve petty issues such as manhole covers, streetlights and leakage in pipes. “Such issues should be resolved at zonal levels rather than taking them up with the mayor and commissioner,” Sandhu said. SAD councillor Jaspal Giaspura, who is also the leader of opposition in the MC general House, sought vigilance inquiry against those officials who refused to issue tender to a database company citing its non-eligibility. “The same company got the tender for two consecutive years and around 105 staffers were deputed in the said company. How did it not fulfil the eligibility criteria for the third time? A vigilance investigation is necessary in this case,” he added. Giaspura also accused the road contractors of using poor-quality material in the construction, causing wastage of finances and resources.“Crores can be saved if the roads are built using material of higher quality. Recently, a road worth ₹2 crore was constructed by the committee after availing loans and it got damaged after few days,” he added. Councillor Sukhdev Bawa, while raising serious concerns over contaminated water and foul odour in his ward number 4 due to illegal slaughtering, sought immediate action from MC commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal. He said the slaughtering is done near temples and government schools in his area, which causes problems for the locals.Sabharwal ordered a probe and directed officials to visit the sites and take the necessary action.
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC House meet: Resolution to avail ₹100-crore loan passed||With the fund-starved Ludhiana civic body struggling to pay for development works, the municipal corporation House on Tuesday passed the much-needed resolution of availing ₹100-crore loan during its meeting held at Guru Nanak Bhawan. The meeting was chaired by mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal. It was likely the last meeting of the House before the code of conduct in the wake of upcoming Punjab assembly elections comes into force. A total of 43 resolutions were presented in the House out of which, 38 were passed while three were cancelled and committees were formed for two resolutions. While a few days are left for the litmus test for the upcoming elections in the state, the councillors promised development works to the voters which exceeded the budget of the Ludhiana MC. Mayor Sandhu said the halted development works in the city will immediately resume after availing the ₹100-crore loan. He added that the civic body is efficient enough to pay off this loan. Meanwhile, the resolution to revise the civic body’s annual budget by around ₹145 crore in order to facilitate development projects worth ₹261.45 crore was also passed by the House.Earlier, succumbing to the pressure mounted by councillors and MLAs, who were looking to woo voters, the civic body had given its nod to the development works of around ₹261.4 crore even when the state government had approved ₹116.8 crore for projects, including roads, bridges, streets and drainage for the year 2021-22. The House further passed resolutions for giving jobs to the kin of deceased MC employees and naming five roads of the city after the ‘Panj Pyare’. Another resolution for regularisation of contractual employees, including 1,104 sewermen and 2,572 cleaners, was passed in the House without any objection.The resolutions concerning waiver of pending water and sewer charges for the residential buildings with area less than 125 sq yards and fixing ₹50 per month as water tariff for residential buildings above 125 sq yards were passed by the House. This was earlier announced by state government ahead of the elections. However, due to lack of funds for maintenance, resolution to maintain 18 colonies of GLADA was cancelled in the House.With an aim to raise funds, the MC House also approved resolution to sell off MC properties through e-auction, including SCOs in Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar, shops situated in market below Jagraon bridge, and vacant land near Master Tara Singh college among other sites. Resolution was also approved to set up a PRO branch in MC to apprise the public of the development works and activities of the civic body. Resolution to make building plan must for power connection droppedDue to the mounting pressure by the councillors of the ruling party, the resolution to stop the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) from issuing power connection in case the owner fails to attach an approved building plan along with the application was excluded from the agenda of the House. The said resolution aimed at curbing the illegal constructions.Councillors tabled around 12 additional resolutions during the meeting, including increasing the salary of the councillors and ensuring electricity connections to houses of 445.68 sq ft (50 gaj).

No party got a clear majority, of 18 seats, in the 35-member House, but the AAP emerged the single largest party with 14 seats, the BJP a close second with 12 seats and the Congress secured eight seats. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) got one seat. With the Chandigarh MP also having one vote in the House, and the incumbent MP, Kirron Kher, owing allegiance to the saffron party, the BJP has 13 votes out of the total 36 votes in a full house. All three parties – AAP, Congress and BJP – have announced that they would put up their candidates for the posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.AAP alleges horse-trading by BJP Firing the first shots, only a day after the Chandigarh municipal corporation results were announced, AAP alleged that BJP is indulging in horse-trading.The party’s Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha, alleged, “BJP leaders called up and visited three of our 14 councillors. They offered one councillor ₹75 lakh, and ₹50 lakh each to two other councillors; and asked them to join BJP.”Addressing a press conference at the party’s office in Sector 39, Chadha alleged that a local BJP leader, on the directions of a Union cabinet minister, was asking AAP councillors to join BJP.When asked why the party didn’t contact the police, Chadha said, “We decided to first inform the public and then go to the police and election commission on the issue.”Why doesn’t AAP release recordings, asks SoodTerming AAP’s allegations as “lies and baseless”, Chandigarh BJP state president Arun Sood, said, “AAP is making these fraudulent claims because it is itself actively trying to buy councillors from other parties. Where is the proof for such frivolous allegations; nowadays, everybody has recordings in their phones; why doesn’t AAP release those recordings?” He further said, “AAP leaders said they would have an AAP mayor. How they are so sure when they don’t have the requisite numbers in the House. Is it because they are indulging in horse-trading with the money they brought from foreign countries?”Notably, Sood on Monday had said that the BJP will put up its candidate for the mayor’s post and appeal to the people to elect its candidate. “We will not align with anybody or pursue other parties’ councillors. We will only appeal to councillors if they want stable and development-oriented governance, they should opt for BJP candidate.”Chadha, meanwhile, said that AAP was not in negotiations with any councillor of other parties for the election of mayor.Cong attacks both BJP and AAPChandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla, alleged, “Both the BJP and AAP are trying to buy out each other’s councillors.”Attacking AAP, Chawla, said, “AAP press conference is clear indication that they are in panic mode. Installing cameras at their councillors’ house and recording their phone calls only show the party fears its councillors can switch sides and that the party high command doesn’t trust its own councillors.”Though Chawla admitted that both AAP and BJP leaders contacted the Congress councillors for the mayoral elections, he denied that any offers of posts or money were made to them.

However, there has been no communication between the two departments since. “PRTC has also not submitted any more representations to its counterpart since 2019. It was only after Raja Warring wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on October 7 this year that the issue was highlighted,” an official said.In July 2018, the PRTC had started eight luxury air-conditioned buses from Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Hoshiarpur to depart from terminal 3 of the Delhi Airport. However, within the month, the Delhi government started issuing fines and banned the entry of these buses beyond the ISBT, citing permit issues. Warring, however, said that despite repeated reminders, the transport department was yet to get a response from Delhi authorities. Meanwhile, PRTC managing director Parneet Kaur Shergill said no fresh representations have been sent as both the departments are corresponding on state level. PRTC authorities have been asked to get tourist permits to carry on with its services to IGI airport. “It is not financially viable for the PRTC to run these buses on tourist permits. PRTC only managed to generate revenue of ₹30 lakh in a month,” an official said.The PRTC buses were charging ₹787 per passenger from Patiala and ₹880 from Ludhiana, while private players, mainly run by high profile politicians,charge exorbitant prices ranging from ₹1,500 to ₹4,000.

Police said the terrorists had been hiding inside the shopping complex owned by Bhat. However, families contested the police claims and said that forces killed innocent civilians in a fake encounter.Deputy inspector general of police, central Kashmir, Sujit Kumar, who headed the SIT, said house owner Altaf Bhat was used as a human shield by Pakistani militant Bilal Bhai, who was also killed in the encounter.“The house owner was used as a human shield by Pakistani militant Bilal Bhai. Mudasir Gul was killed by the foreign militant,” said DIG Sujit Kumar who was flanked by J&K director general of police Dilbagh Singh and inspector general of police Vijay Kumar.Giving details of the encounter, the DIG said they have CCTV evidence which showed that Mudasir Gul along with the foreign militant used to travel in his vehicle and foreign militant Bilal used to stay in the chamber of Mudasir along with Amir Magray and used the place as his hideout. “Amir Magray used to travel to Bandipore and Gurez and when police asked him about foreign militants, he didn’t tell the truth.”Kumar said Amir Magray had sent his picture along with pistol to his friend and helped Bilal Bhai in arranging accommodation in Srinagar. “Mudasir Gul was killed by the foreign militant.”Kumar also said that family members of Altaf Bhat, who owned the building, didn’t give satisfactory replies about the tenants in the building.Meanwhile, the J&K government has received the magisterial inquiry report regarding the Hyderpora encounter, however, details have not been revealed. On November 17, JK Lt Governor Manoj Sinha had ordered a probe into the incident after hue and cry.However, the PAGD termed the press briefing of police as a repetition of the old story and cover-up to the incident.“It does not even, slightly give any objective picture of this shocking incident.There is a strong public perception that the civilians killed in the incident were made human shields by the security forces and the latest statement of the police seems to be a concocted cover-up story,” PAGD spokesman Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hyderpora-encounter-building-owner-used-as-human-shield-by-pakistani-militant-sit-101640723717422.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||PM Narendra Modi did not announce anything big for Himachal: Mukesh Agnihotri||In a stinging attack on Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP regime in Himachal, Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri on Tuesday said that the so-called double engine government has now become a “troubled engine” government.This troubled engine is now beyond repair and the public would replace it in 2022, said Agnihotri issuing a press statement in Una.He said that like his previous visits, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not announce anything big for the state.“The government tried every almost every trick like plying the Himachal Road Transportation Corporation to mobilise the crowd for PM’s rally at Mandi, but got nothing in return as the Prime Minister again disappointed the people of the state,” he said.After the BJP’s 4-0 loss in the byelections, Agnihotri claimed that even the Prime Minister has come to know that the party leadership in Himachal is incapable and he couldn’t expect much from them.He alleged that the BJP government in Himachal was dying to showcase the projects, which were already in pipeline as the new investment.“BJP’s ground-breaking has already been done by the public in byelections and it is sure to lose the 2022 assembly polls,” he said.Taking pot-shots at the BJP government, Agnihotri said the PM has aptly said that there was a model of governance which delays the project.“It is true. There has been a delay under the current regime in setting up the 69 national highways announced by the Central government, delay in the airport, in the disbursement of compensation for land acquisition, for giving benefits to the employees and delay in giving jobs to unemployed,” he said.Agnihotri alleged that the PM did not answer any questions but forced people to listen to him.He alleged that the BJP-led Centre and the state have only burdened the people with rising inflation, unemployment and wrong policies. “It seems that PM was here to amuse the people with his blandishments,” he said. “We have always welcomed him in Himachal for being the PM, but the Opposition also reserves the right to ask as to what Himachal has got from his visit,” he said.He alleged that the government spent from the exchequer for PM’s rally but at the venue, BJP flags were put up.“The PM said that Congress’s model of governance was that of delay but we want to tell him that whatever Himachal has achieved in terms of development today is due to successive Congress governments,” he said.He said if the state government had done good work in four years, the result in the byelections would not have been 4-0.Agnihotri claimed that BJP’s base in Himachal was shrinking and people will overthrow this government in the next assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-narendra-modi-did-not-announce-anything-big-for-himachal-mukesh-agnihotri-101640723711569.html

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Hurriyat blames Union government for demographic changes in Jammu and Kashmir||The Hurriyat Conference on Tuesday sought help from the international community and blamed the Centre for enforcing demographic changes in the Muslim majority Jammu and Kashmir.A Hurriyat Conference statement came in reaction to the real estate summit that was held in Jammu on Monday and was attended by J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, Hardeep Singh Puri, Union housing and urban affairs minister and Union MoS Jitendra Singh.In the summit according to a government statement, top leaders of India’s real estate sector came together and signed 39 MoUs worth ₹18,300 crore for investments in residential, commercial, infrastructure and film sectors.During the summit, J&K governor Manoj Sinha said the next ‘real estate summit’ will be held in Srinagar on May 21 and 22, 2022.Hardeep Singh Puri said the real estate, is the second largest employer in the country, will create innumerable opportunities for economic growth in J&K. “The natural endowments in the UT of J&K and resilience of its people are second to none in the world which now need to be translated into economic development, prosperity and ease of living,” he said.The Hurriyat Conference strongly reacted to the summit. “The Government of India wants to change the demographic character of Muslim majority J&K and disempower its residents through such diktats and measures in order to scuttle the final resolution of the long-standing international political dispute of Kashmir in accordance with the will and aspirations of its people as promised by the international community, based on principles of justice and international law,” said Hurriyat in a statement. “Since August 2019, in succession one after other authoritarian laws and diktats are being implemented in J&K towards this end and to facilitate the electoral prospects of the ruling party in India as J&K has become its favourite whipping boy. Simultaneously, the ruling dispensation is pursuing the divide and rule policy by dividing the population of J&K on the basis of religions, regions, ethnicities and political interests to fracture political aspirations and voices,” the Hurriyat statement said.Mainstream political leaders have also raised concern for putting the land of J&K on “sale” in the name of real estate investment summit۔“Once again, the true intentions of the government are brought to the fore. While offering to secure the land, jobs, domicile laws and identity of the people of Ladakh and J&K is being put up for sale. People of Jammu should be aware, “investors” will buy land in Jammu long before Kashmir,” tweeted NC vice-president Omar Abdullah.Former J&K chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti termed the summit “sale of the resources of J&K”.“J&Ks special status was illegally revoked to dehumanise, dispossess and disempower the only Muslim majority state in India. The GOIs brazen loot and sale of our resources shows that the sole motive is to annihilate our identity and change the demography (sic),” said Mehbooba Mufti in a tweet.The Apni Party, which is considered close to the BJP, also called this summit an “endeavour for undermining the domicile law”.Apni Party president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari on Monday in a statement said efforts that aim at holistic development and job creation in Jammu and Kashmir are welcome but not at the cost of domicile laws that safeguard land and employment rights of its permanent residents.He said, “Our party will always welcome any efforts that will foster progress and prosperity in Jammu and Kashmir. But at the same time, we are pledged to resist any plans that will do away with the exclusive rights of the people on their land and jobs.”He said the way term “permanent resident of the state” has been omitted from the J&K Development Act, was totally unacceptable to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hurriyat-blames-union-government-for-demographic-changes-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101640723702460.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal agriculture minister exhorts scientists to develop integrated farming models||Agriculture Minister Virender Kanwar on Tuesday exhorted the farm scientists to develop integrated farming models which the farmers may adopt as per needs to boost their economy.He was addressing a state-level farm officers’ workshop-cum-farmer scientist interface held at Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesh Agriculture University (HPAU), Palampur.Kanwar also stressed on the production of seeds of the major crop within the state so that the state’s dependence on imports, which accounts for 80% of the total requirement could be reduced.He said efforts were underway to conserve and preserve the seeds of traditional crops under ‘Mukhyamantri Paramparagat Beej Sanrakshan Yojana’ and advised the farm officers to educate farmers about the proper use of chemicals and fertilisers as pesticide residue was highest in Himachal Pradesh.Kanwar said farm chemicals should be only available at registered shops and the person concerned should be properly trained to prevent excessive use of chemicals in the fields.The minister also informed that a 25-year roadmap has been developed for natural farming in the state to shift from chemical farming.He sought the scientists to suggest crops for mid-hill areas of the state. He also invited suggestions to prevent crop damage by wild animals.The problem of stray cattle will end by coming March as many cow sanctuaries would be made functional in the state, he said.Kanwar also discussed issues like the growing problem of lantana grass and asked the university to submit a project for its complete eradication.The minister underlined the need to make Krishi Vigyan Kendras more vibrant to solve the problems of farmers.Vice-chancellor Prof Harinder Kumar Chaudhary elaborated about major research and extension achievements of the HPAU which has enabled farmers of the state to get national-level awards in the recent past. He said that Krishi Vigyan Kendras have initiated work to produce seeds of wheat and mash.He said the work has been imitated to conserve traditional seeds and get these registered.He said special effort has been made to rejuvenate farm research in tribal areas and discussed issues like preparedness for adverse effects of climate change, vocal for local and high-end research facilities in HPAU like phototron and Shiitake Mushroom Unit.Director of agriculture NK Dhiman said that research work should be done to reduce the cost of production and natural farming was a good alternative for it.As a slight increase in temperature can reduce crop yields by 5-10% so work on cropping patterns with low water requirements and temperature stress-tolerant varieties should be expedited, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-agriculture-minister-exhorts-scientists-to-develop-integrated-farming-models-101640723402429.html

The work didn’t even stop during the pandemic. The bridge will further prove beneficial for the farmers,” said the official.“The construction of the bridge will provide fast connectivity to the locals in Lahaul and Spiti district while it will facilitate army vehicles to carry heavy war equipment to the border areas,” said an official of the BRO.“These bridges on the alternate route to Leh will prove to be of great help to our soldiers posted in Jammu and Kashmir and Leh. The local people would also get the benefit of these bridges and would further strengthen the socio-economic relations between the people of Lahaul-Spiti’s Keylong valley and Leh and Ladakh,” said Jai Ram Thakur, adding that moreover heavy military vehicles would pass through this route conveniently and local people would get the facility to transport their farm produce like apples, potatoes, peas, almonds and other crops to markets. This bridge would also contribute significantly to increasing the economy of Kinnaur district, he added.

An order to this effect was issued by the secretary (education) Rajeev Sharma. The accused was booked for sexual harassment and stalking under Sections 354-A and 354-D of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on December 24 after the victim and the college’s women cell lodged FIR against him at the Rohru police station.

She recorded the conversation and filed a complaint to the women’s cell of the college. Director higher education Amarjeet Kumar Sharma said the department had several verbal complaints against the principal in the past too.

Punjabi speaking areas which were left out of the state at the time of its reorganisation in 1966 should be transferred back to it and the state’s riparian rights restored.”The SAD president, who was addressing a rally in favour Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Kamaljit Chawla in Gurdaspur, promised to establish a cooperative sugar mill in the town. He also said that the PGI Satellite Centre at Ferozepur which had been secured by him for the state, will be inaugurated by the PM. On the ‘letter bomb’ controversy, Badal said, “Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal owes an explanation for his actions. Apparently, he was betraying the Kisan Andolan by trying to make secret deals with the Centre. The matter should be probed.”Asked about the alliance of the BJP with Captain Amarinder Singh’s Lok Congress Party and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s SAD (Sanyukt), Badal said, “Combining one non-entity with another doesn’t make any difference to the final product. A zero hundred times over is still a zero. Punjabis know their arithmetic. This alliance will not make any difference to state politics”.Taking a dig on Pradesh Congress President Navjot Singh Sidhu , the SAD president said, “As if being a misguided missile was not bad enough, Sidhu is now shaming Punjabis by publicly resorting to vulgarity in his maverick outbursts. Sidhu has nothing to offer Punjab, except poison, hatred, limitless ego and arrogance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-should-transfer-chandigarh-punjabi-speaking-areas-to-state-sad-president-sukhbir-badal-101640722442662.html

The committee will study the pattern of traffic movement and other aspects and suggest feasible solutions to resolve the problems being faced by commuters at the toll plaza, said officials. The decision to form a committee was taken by Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who along with a team of officials, inspected the Sirhaul toll plaza on Tuesday. “We have decided to form a team of traffic and NHAI officials, who shall study the issue in detail, along with road safety officers, and make suggestions to resolve the congestion. The proposed changes in traffic movement and design will be tested on a trial basis, and if successful, implemented there,” said Garg. As per the Gurugram traffic department, the traffic jams are caused at the Sirhaul toll plaza due to a toll operated by the Delhi government which charges toll and green tax from commercial vehicles. Ravinder Tomar, DCP (traffic), who was present during the inspection, said that it was important that lanes on both sides of the highway at Sirhaul are equal. For vehicles moving from Gurugram to Delhi, the space is less, he said, adding that . three lanes on the left side of the toll were not being used and these must be used frequently. Garg said that the district administration will also meet the top NHAI officials and other authorities concerned so that a solution can be found out. According to NHAI officials, the toll plaza at Sirhaul has been established on the directions of the Supreme Court to collect toll from commercial vehicles entering Delhi. They also said that shifting the median was not a feasible solution, but agreed to work with the district administration to resolve the issue of congestion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-panel-to-look-into-traffic-mess-at-sirhaul-toll-plaza-101640721482106.html

Chairing a meeting of the district task force at mini secretariat, Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg also called for strict action against commercial activities in residential colonies. During the meeting, RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said that seven illegal colonies being developed in Farrukhnagar have been identified and action would be taken against them by January 15. “We have already issued notices to these colonisers and asked them to reply by January 4. It is unlikely that satisfactory reply would be submitted by them as these colonies are illegal,” he said. Garg directed the task force to prevent illegal colonisation and also commercial activities in private colonies as these put pressure on infrastructure and also hamper the lives of common citizens. “The illegal colonies must be identified at the initial stage and stopped from coming up. Commercial activities also create a lot of issues in residential areas and must be stopped,” he said. Bhath also said that the drone survey of illegal colonies, which is being carried out to identify the status of unauthorised areas, has covered 3,000 acres and eventually it will cover all the unauthorised colonies in the district spread over 12,000 acres. “The drone survey has been carried out in New Palam Vihar and Garhi Harsaru, and presently it is going on in Bhondsi,” he said. The officials from the department of town and country planning (DTCP) also informed the meeting that a large number of commercial establishments are running in residential areas in DLF Phase 1 and 2, and Sushant Lok 1, 2 and 3. Violators are being identified and notices issued to them. “It has also been decided that in case of new constructions in private licensed colonies, if an owner makes violations at the initial stage of construction then DTCP will write to power department and recommend that electricity connection should not be issued,” said Bhath. The DTCP, in collaboration with the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and other departments, will also carry out anti-encroachment drive against the violators in Saraswati Kunj colony. “A large number of complaints have been received regarding encroachments and illegal constructions and it has been decided to clear these in the next two weeks,” said Bhath. Deputy commissioner Garg also said that since the state government has come out with a new policy for guest house regularisation, it was imperative upon all the operators to follow the rules and get themselves registered with the authorities. “A detailed survey should be carried out to identify the guest houses within a month and action should be taken against those which are illegal,” said Garg. In a related development, the enforcement wing of the DTCP carried out a demolition drive in Mahenderwada village in Bhondsi and two colonies being developed separately on five acres and one acre were demolished. The DTCP officials said that four under construction houses, 15 plinths, sewer lines and road network were demolished as these colonies were being carved out without any permission or license from the authorities. “We had issued notices to the plot owners to stop construction but they failed to do so, following which action was taken,” said Bhath.

On Monday, the maximum and minimum temperatures in the city were at 20.3°C and 11°C, respectively.On Tuesday, Gurugram received 1mm of rainfall, according to the weather bulletin issued by Meteorological Centre Chandigarh, a regional centre of IMD. Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre Chandigarh, said, “From Wednesday, the weather will start getting clear but the region is likely to experience dense fog. Cold wave conditions are also likely to start within two to three days and will continue till the mid of first week of January.” IMD on Tuesday said that cold wave conditions are likely to prevail over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh from December 31 till January 2. Dense fog in isolated pockets is very likely over Punjab and Haryana during the next three days, it predicted. The weather officials said that there would be no significant change in the minimum temperature during the next 24 hours, but after that a fall by two to four degrees is likely for subsequent two days. The IMD on Monday issued a yellow alert asking authorities to be prepared and predicted dense fog for south Haryana region, including Gurugram and Faridabad, for December 29-30 and cold wave for December 31 and January 1.

Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said, “From December 31 onwards, the direction of winds may change to north-westerly due to which cold wave conditions will be created. If the winds are slow, then level of air pollution can also increase. Over the next few days, there are frequent but weak western disturbance activities, due to which peak winters have not been experienced yet with prolonged stretch of cold wave.” Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Gurugram recorded ‘poor’ air quality for the second consecutive day.

During a district administration’s meeting held on Tuesday on preparations to handle the Omicron variant of Covid-19, district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav said that vaccination centres for children will be set up at all medical facilities across the district. He also said that both private and government hospitals should complete all the vaccination related arrangements on time. “There are about 175,000 adolescents in the age group of 15 to 18 years in the district. They would be vaccinated as per the guidelines of the central government. For this, the hospitals should ensure a separate counter while following all Covid-19 safety protocols on their premises. The immunisation of children who are 15 years or more as on January 1, 2022, that is, those born in 2007 or earlier, would start from January 3,” said the chief medical officer.

The active caseload now stands at 378 in the district, of which six are hospitalised and 372 are under home isolation, the officials said.Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who chaired the meeting on Tuesday, said that hospitals should avoid giving any wrong information with regard to the Omicron variant as it can create panic among people. “Hospitals should admit only seriously infected patients and should not unnecessarily admit a person who can be cured even by staying in home isolation. Till now, only one Omicron patient has been confirmed in Gurugram district, so people should not panic,” said Garg. While directing the representatives from different hospitals who attended the meeting, the deputy commissioner said that they should provide correct information to the district administration regarding vaccination, availability of beds and oxygen and other health facilities. “The proper details by hospitals help provide better health facilities to the people. Hospitals should also take special care of safety of the health care staff working there and ensure that they get the precautionary dose on time.

29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: AAP’s Chandigarh surge sets alarm bells ringing for SAD, Cong||CHANDIGARH : The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is gung-ho in Punjab after its scintillating debut in the Chandigarh municipal corporation on Monday where it trumped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and party’s Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann, who both campaigned in the municipal polls in Chandigarh, lost no time in terming its 14 seats out of 35 to emerge as the single-largest party as a “sign of the coming change” in Punjab where the state elections are just weeks away. Much-needed morale boosterThe AAP’s surge in Chandigarh, the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, will serve as a much-needed morale booster for the party. The AAP had made a stunning debut in Punjab in 2014 winning four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats and took the number two position in the 2017 state polls, but then failed to meet heady expectations as it plunged into disarray. The party is now slowly trying to get its act together. Helping it find traction is a raft of freebies announced by Kejriwal and the campaign for “ek mauka” (chance). At the same time, it is also an alarm bell for the two traditional players, the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which are beset with their own set of problems. The ruling Congress is hamstrung by internal squabbling, particularly the tussle between chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu over the chief ministerial face of the party. The Akalis, on the other hand, are worried about the sacrilege and drug issues, which proved to be their nemesis in 2017, dominating the poll narrative, besides the impact of 22 farmer organisations’ decision to jump into the poll ring on its pockets of support in peasantry. Win not an indicator of public mood in Punjab The win could not have come at a more opportune time for the party, but the attempts to project it as a sign of change in Punjab seem far-fetched. Despite their strong links, Chandigarh, seen by many as a microcosm of Punjab, cannot be taken as the bellwether of the agrarian state. Ashutosh Kumar, a professor of political science at Panjab University, says that the Chandigarh win will send a strong message to Punjab because its (city’s) soul is very much Punjabi, but it cannot be construed as an indicator of the public mood there. “People of Punjab are looking of an alternative. If the AAP wants to put up a strong challenge, it has to project a good CM-face and avoid the mistakes of 2017,” he adds. Sanyukt Samaj Morcha a challenge for AAP In the previous state elections, besides micro-managing the campaign from Delhi, the party had not named the CM-face and was targeted by its rivals for trying to impose “outsider Kejriwal” on the state. Again, Kejriwal and his team are steering the election campaign. Another challenge for the party is the emergence of the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), a political party floated by 22 farmer organisations, which has thrown its hat in the ring. Guru Nanak Dev University’s former head of political science professor Jagrup Singh Sekhon said the AAP was beginning to get support in rural area as an alternative to people fed up with traditional parties, but it will now have to compete with the SSM which has a strong presence at booth level in every village. Given the challenges it faces, the AAP will need much more than a booster dose to revive the groundswell of support it had around the same time five years ago and that helped it make an impact in its first electoral outing in the state polls.

Five cases of loot and robbery were registered against the suspects at the Expressway and Dankaur police stations this year, said the police.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida, said that the Expressway police got a tip about the suspects’ movement near Jaypee Hospital in Noida Sector 128 on Monday night. “Police signalled their Maruti Swift Dzire car, with no number plate, to stop for checking. Soon, the suspects opened fire at the police team and tried to escape, but failed to do so,” he said, adding that Deepak suffered a bullet injury in his left leg during an encounter with the police, which broke out after they resisted their arrest.Police have recovered two countrymade guns, three live cartridges, two used cartridges and a stolen car from the possession of the suspects. The five arrested men revealed during interrogation that they used to offer lift to people in their car and then rob them at gunpoint. On October 31 this year, Deepak and Sumit were arrested from Dankaur in connection with a robbery case. “They had robbed a man of ₹1 lakh in Dankaur on October 28. Police arrested the duo, and sent them to jail. But, after being released from the jail on a bail in November, they were again involved in such crimes,” Singh said.The suspects were produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/5-held-for-robbing-commuters-in-noida-greater-noida-on-pretext-of-offering-lift-101640719924320.html

29-12-2021||Mumbai||35 Amur falcon birds take a halt in Palghar district||Mumbai: The birdwatching community of Vasai-Virar was in for a treat to witness a flock of 35 Amur falcon, a champion migratory bird known as the world’s longest travelling raptor, basking in the warmer climes of Gogte saltpans between Nala Sopara and Vasai. The place is a halt for the avian beauties to rest, fatten up and take another journey towards South Africa and other warmer regions.Palghar-based birder Pravin Babre captured the winged beauties in its glory that generated a lot of enthusiasm among other birdwatchers in the area. One of them is Amol Lopes who informed that the iconic bird undertakes long migratory journeys from colder regions like Siberia, Russia, China among others to warmer places like South Africa, India and eastern nations. The Amur falcon can cover about 22,000 km annually.“The migrating Amur falcon flies at night too, crossing vast oceans to stop in Nagaland and Bangladesh to fatten up before staging for overland flights across Peninsular India,” added Amol Lopes.Subsequently, they cross the Indian Ocean to East Africa non-stop over 3,000 kms, flying day and night. This falcon is an “elliptical migrant” because its route back home is largely overland to the northwest. The avian beauty is sized between 21 cm to 31 cm, feeds on grasshoppers, dragonflies,and insects and is abundantly found in Pangti, Wokha district, Nagaland, which is protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. This is their favourite halt for at least a few weeks. Lopes also informed, “We have created the Vasai Birds app and since 2012 till date we have documented more than 310 bird species in the Vasai-Virar belt and birdwatchers post any new sightings on the app for fresh updates.”The Gogte Salt pans are made of shallow watered salt pans and two major lakes - Chulne lake and Gass but five years from now the salt pans will vanish due to concrete jungles coming up and thus the birds habitat will be in danger, worry bird watchers as the salt pans provides food and shelter to many migratory and resident species of birds.Adesh Shivkar, founder member of Mumbai Bird Watchers’ Club and a bird expert said, “The name of Amur falcon derives from areas of North Mongolia, East Siberia which is also called Amurland. The bird is vulnerable to poaching as during their migration, poachers would kill an average 20,000 birds per day for its meat in Nagaland which has now stopped.”Shivkar also shared that in Nagaland, poachers would trap the Amur falcon by poisoning their prey-fish- during the stopover period and after environmentalists protested to the Nagaland government, the poaching has stopped and now the same poachers are working as bird guides and spreading awareness about the need to protect and conserve the falcons.The birds settle in Goa, Mumbai, Gujarat, Kerala and western coasts to fatten up and then fly to South Africa crossing the Arabian Sea and in the return trip take a different route, said Shivkar, adding “We need to save the birds’ passageway such as the Gogte saltpans as it an important ecosystem and habitat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/35-amur-falcon-birds-take-a-halt-in-palghar-district-101640719864100.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Wrong info on route permits:HC dismisses PCS officer’s plea against chargesheet||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has refused to quash a chargesheet issued to PCS officer Gurpreet Singh Thind by the government in September 2019 regarding allegations of wrong information on grant of route permits to a government lawyer in the high court.The high court bench of justice MS Sindhu observed that it is nowhere alleged that the impugned chargesheet has been issued on account of any bad faith or ill-motive of the competent authority. Since the inquiry officer has already been appointed, it would not be appropriate for the court to conduct a roving inquiry and examine truthfulness of the allegations levelled against petitioner by way of judicial review, the bench added.Thind, was secretary, Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Patiala in 2019. The allegations against Thind are that based on a note from him on January 25, 2019, the state’s counsel told the court that the secretary, transport authority, has no authority to frame a joint time-table of buses, whereas in December 2018, the state transport commissioner, asked the secretaries to frame/approve a joint a time-table.It was also alleged that the reply in the high court was handed over without getting it vetted from the advocate general office. The government counsel made a statement before the court based on the reply in question, which resulted in the high court passing a stay order in the matter involving private transporters. This further resulted in undue benefit to the private transporters, as per the government. Thind had told the court that the draft reply was prepared in view of urgency, but it was not filed. The reply also referred to December 2018 instructions. Thus, he cannot be held responsible for the stay order. The government had informed the court that after consideration of his reply to the chargesheet, the inquiry officer was appointed on August 2021 and disciplinary proceedings were on. Thus, it is not appropriate for the court to interfere with the matter at this stage. The government also said that the adverse remarks recorded in the annual confidential report have been ordered to be treated as advisory. Dismissing the plea, the court observed that normally a chargesheet is not to be quashed at the threshold. “It is the function of disciplinary authority to find out the correctness or truth of charges, thus to deal with the chargesheet on merits at such an early stage would be premature, unless the same has been issued by a person lacking competency or jurisdiction,” the court said, adding that fair treatment has been accorded to Thind and it cannot be said that respondents are bent upon to victimise him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wrong-info-on-route-permits-hc-dismisses-pcs-officer-s-plea-against-chargesheet-101640719801873.html

29-12-2021||Lucknow||Unwarranted behaviour of lawyers can erode faith of public in judicial system: High Court||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has pointed out that the unwarranted and uncalled behaviour of lawyers has the potential of eroding the faith and trust of public in judicial system. Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyay and Justice Narendra Kumar Johari made this observation on December 24 while disposing of an old contempt petition against 12 lawyers of Gonda district. Out of them, only six are alive today, and all are senior citizens. “What we notice in present times is the uncalled for and unwarranted conduct/behaviour of lawyers which has the potential of eroding faith and trust of public in the judicial system,” said the court. The petition was filed on the basis of a letter written on August 17, 2001, by then district judge of Gonda to then registrar general of the high court to initiate contempt proceedings against 12 lawyers. In the letter, it was alleged that these lawyers were involved in unruly behaviour on the court campus on November 14, 2000, and December 1, 2000. The case was registered in 2001, but notices were issued to the lawyers in 2011. During the hearing of the case, the counsel for lawyers pointed out that the case was based on a hearsay story and since the inception of this suit, six out of 12 lawyers had passed away. He also apprised the court that the lawyers, who are alive, have tendered an unconditional apology to the court. After considering all aspects of the case, the court observed: “Considering all these aspects of the matter, especially the fact that the respondents have tendered their unconditional apology and that they are very old practising lawyers and also that Contempt Petition No.1463 of 2002 has already been disposed of without even issuing notices, we are of the opinion that this matter now needs to be given a quietus.” “We, thus, do not think it necessary to pursue this matter further. We accept the apology tendered by the respondents and discharge the notices of contempt issued against them,” said the court. “However, before parting with the matter, we would like to put on record our anguish and concern emanating from the reports which this court receives almost on daily basis about the conduct and behaviour of the advocates,” observed the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/unwarranted-behaviour-of-lawyers-can-erode-faith-of-public-in-judicial-system-high-court-101640719562795.html

Meanwhile, the police have recovered the car used in the crime and constituted five police teams to nab the assailants. The car used by criminals was traced near a canal in Harduaganj area late on Monday night. It was looted from Farah police station area of Mathura district on October 14, police said.“We have recovered more than 100 CCTV footages and they are being scanned to find clues about the shooters. With the matter being inter-district issue, police teams are also being sent at all possible spots to nab the criminals. Five police teams have been constituted and those involved the murder will be soon behind the bars,” said Kailanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Aligarh, on Tuesday. “The trader Sandeep Gupta was in his car with his driver and an employee while his both gunners, private and that of police, were not with him. They were in separate car which also had manager of Gupta. Suspects are being interrogated to reach the culprits,” said Kuldeep Singh Gunawat, SP (City), Aligarh. Police were primarily working out on enmity theory and believed that it was the work of hired shooters chasing the victim trader, he added. On Monday evening, the cement trader Sandeep Gupta, who was in his car, stopped for a while on his way, when the accused, three to four in number, in another car got down and fired at the trader from close range hitting him on face and neck. The trader was rushed to trauma center in Aligarh but was declared dead. The trader’s body was sent for postmortem and it reached Aliganj town on Tuesday.

29-12-2021||Noida||Noida: Register criminal cases against those who dump untreated sewage, says NGT||In a strongly worded judgment on December 23 against untreated sewage and waste being dumped in Kondli and Shahdara drains , the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the Inspector General of Meerut zone to register criminal cases against the violators.The green court also reprimanded the Noida authority for providing misleading information and allowing occupancy in societies that have not set up their sewage treatment plants yet.“It has come out during interaction with the CEO, Noida, that as against the claim of STPs of 72 out of 95 group housing societies being functional, the stand of state PCB is that only 12 were compliant. There is also a contradiction in the narrative in the report of the Noida authority on the one hand and details mentioned in the annexures to the report,” said the NGT order.The order said the court was informed by the Noida authority that partial occupancy certificates are issued by the authority to facilitate builders to sell flats, which, according to NGT “prima facie amounts to offence”.“This policy will have to be reviewed to effectuate the mandate under the EC/Consent conditions read with Water and EP Acts. Though STPs were required to be functional before occupancy, they are either not installed or are non-functional or non-compliant. Compliance is proposed in the distant future extending upto four years, without specifying the accountability/liability of the PP responsible for the situation for continuing violation in the meantime. Granting partial or completion certificates must be compliant with EC/Consent conditions,” the court said.The court also pointed out that the reports submitted by Noida authority during the hearings seem to show “compliance” but that has not been the case. On the contrary, the reports seem to portray violations of environmental norms by developers.“It is shown that various sewer lines are lying choked or/are overflowing, which obviously results in water pollution. This situation can hardly be held to be satisfactory, though colour of compliance has been given, which, on scrutiny, can hardly be called compliance. On the other hand, this amounts to absolving the non-compliant Project Proponents (PPs) of statutory obligations under the EC/Consents and profiteer by law violation which inter-alia amounts to an offence under Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA Act, 2002),” said the order.The NGT was hearing a case filed in 2017 by residents of Sector 137 in Noida claiming that untreated sewage was being dumped by Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad in the Kondli and Shahdara drains, polluting these drains and irrigation canals that eventually merge with the Yamuna river.Noida authority officials explained that more work than was reported to the NGT has been done within the last six months, hence has not been highlighted in the order.“There are 97 Group Housing Societies in the city, all of which are now connected to the central sewage network. Over 70 of these are fully functional and compliant now. The rest actually have technical issues. Four Amrapali projects were given occupancy because of court orders and 11 smaller, older societies have submitted that they do not have the space for separate STPs. Others have been given a deadline of January for the completion of work. The court appreciated a lot of our work during the final hearing. Whatever gaps remain, we will fulfill soon,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida authority.The NGT asked the authority to impose penalties that act as a “deterrent” against the dumping of untreated waste and use the amount for fixing environmental issues. According to the order, “Compensation has to have a deterrent element having regard to financial capacity so that the law violation is not encouraged. Compensation amount needs to be credited to a separate amount for restoration and improvement of the environment.”It also asked the authority to prepare a time-bound plan for connecting all 30 of its sewage drains, only 12 of which seem to be properly functional as of now.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has been asked to maintain the water quality of the irrigation canal (Kondli drain) as per the Water Act. It also has to ensure the regular monitoring of performance of terminal STPs as well as of group housing societies STPs. The UPPCB will also ensure that Khoda Nagar Palika sets up the required STP.Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, said, “We have already imposed penalties on the Khoda Nagar Palika and are trying to ensure compliance in the area. We will ensure all NGT orders are followed.”Delhi authorities have been asked to ensure that no waste water enters Noida from Kondli.According to the applicant of the case, Abhisht Kusum Gupta, a resident of Sector 137, Noida, “This is a path-breaking judgment. While most authorities have taken action to improve the situation, Khoda Vikas Parishad is the major cause of concern. It is discharging 20 MLD of sewage water in the drains, because of which whatever efforts are made by Noida becomes nil and leads to much wastage of resources. Why should Noida scavenge the dirt of other bodies? This area needs more focus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-register-criminal-cases-against-those-who-dump-untreated-sewage-says-ngt-101640719501960.html

The work on the fourth phase will start soon.

She also sought strict action against the singer, artists and the music label responsible for “obscene” picturisation and release of the devotional song. The music video Madhuban was released by Saregama Music on last Wednesday and features Sunny Leone in the party number sung by Kanika Kapoor and Arindam Chakraborty. The song was originally sung by Mohammed Rafi for the 1960 film Kohinoor. It has received around 10 million views of YouTube. During her visit to Sangam city on Tuesday, Swami Himangi Sakhi of country’s only monastic order of transgender seers said that people of today’s new generation should learn the meaning of Radha Rani dancing in Madhuban in devotion to lord Krishna. The song was originally sung by Mohammed Rafi for film Kohinoor (1960). It has been beautifully picturised in it but the artists have ended up shooting it in an obscene manner which is unacceptable,” she added. Talking to media persons at a guest house in Naini, Himangi Sakhi said that such videos should be banned and the actor along with others involved in it must tender a public apology. “The song should also be deleted from YouTube and other such online mediums. We cannot tolerate obscenity in the name of ‘Radha Rani’. The dance video has hurt the religious sentiments of the entire Hindu community,” she claimed. The Maha Mandaleshwar also warned against using Sunny Leone for picturising devotional songs in any manner. “She has acted in numerous indecent films and now she is trying to associate herself with devotional songs, which is not right. I demand that Saregama India should immediately delete the song or we will move court against the company,” she warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-transgender-high-priest-calls-for-ban-on-sunny-leone-s-latest-video-album-101640719088440.html
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||BJP’s Gupta and JJP’s Babli sworn-in as Haryana ministers||Two Haryana MLAs – BJP’s Kamal Gupta and JJP’s Devender Singh Babli – were sworn in as cabinet ministers by governor Bandaru Dattatraya at Raj Bhawan on Tuesday.The state government now has 14 members in the council of ministers. The newly-inducted ministers are likely to be allocated portfolios by Wednesday. Their induction will also necessitate shuffling of portfolios. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Singh Chautala, who holds at least seven top-of-the-line portfolios, will certainly have to shed a couple for his party colleague Devender Babli.BJP’s Kamal Gupta, a medic who was chief parliamentary secretary (CPS) health and medical education in the previous BJP government will be a contender for the health portfolio held by state home minister Anil Vij.Gupta took the oath of office and secrecy in Sanskrit while Babli read it out in Hindi.Constitution allows only 13 ministers in HaryanaAs per Article 164 (1A) of the Constitution, there can be a maximum of 13 ministers including the chief minister in the Haryana council of ministers.The constitutional provision says the total number of ministers, including the chief minister, in the council of ministers in a state shall not exceed 15% of the total number of members of the legislative assembly. This implies that Haryana, which has a 90 member House, cannot have more than 13 ministers including the chief minister.However, successive governments have been flouting the constitutional cap by rounding off the 13.5 figure and inducting 14 ministers, including the chief minister.Following Tuesday’s inductions, the BJP now has 10 ministers including chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, while its post-poll ally JJP has three ministers including deputy chief minister Dushyant Singh Chautala. Rania MLA Ranjit Singh is the lone independent MLA inducted as a minister.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP won only 40 of the 90 seats, thus falling short of a simple majority. Subsequently, it formed the government with the support of 10 JJP MLAs and independents.Caste equation and political compulsionsThe BJP has inducted Hisar MLA Kamal Gupta in the cabinet to give representation to the Vaish community and Hisar district. The cabinet did not have a single minister from the Vaish community and Hisar before Gupta’s induction.The JJP, on the other hand, has tried to contain the dissent among its MLAs by inducting Babli, a prominent dissenting voice along with Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam. The induction of Babli, a Jat, also holds political significance for the JJP since the party wants to strengthen its support base in Fatehabad, a district bordering Dushyant’s home district Sirsa.His induction in the cabinet will also mean a downer for state BJP’s former president Subhash Barala, whom Babli defeated by over 50,000 votes from Tohana assembly constituency in 2019 polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjps-gupta-and-jjp-s-babli-sworn-in-as-haryana-ministers-101640719086905.html

Scattered, light to moderate rain, thundershowers are very likely at isolated places; over the northern and central part of Uttar Pradesh on December 29,” as per the warning. Director of state meteorological department JP Gupta said, “We have alerted the district authorities across the state regarding the forecast. We are also monitoring the change in weather closely. The rain will lead to a drop in minimum temperature across UP in coming days.” While the night temperature across UP stayed around 10 degrees Celsius, the day temperature recorded a marked drop.

29-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad residents experiencing ‘poor’ to ‘severe’ air quality for two months||Ghaziabad has been recording “poor” to “severe” air quality over the past couple of months. The city last experienced “moderate” air on October 26.An air quality index (AQI) reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.This winter has been Ghaziabad’s worst in terms of pollution for the past three years. According to official data from the UP pollution control board (UPPCB), Ghaziabad experienced 17 “moderate” days during the three winter months of October, November and December in 2019 and four in 2020.Records indicate that this year, the city experienced only 10 “moderate” days, all in the month of October. So far, pollution levels have failed to come down below the “poor” category in November and December so far.“The pollution levels remain high. Initially, it was due to the impact of stubble burning in neighbouring states during the Diwali festival and now it is due to meteorological conditions and local pollutants. On our part, we have made efforts to trace and penalise those who violate norms. We carry out regular field inspections to check local violations,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.According to 4pm air quality index released by the Central Pollution Control Board, Ghaziabad on Tuesday recorded an AQI reading of 286 in the higher end of the “poor” category while Greater Noida and Noida recorded AQI readings of 288 and 274, respectively, both in the “poor” category.Ghaziabad on Tuesday witnessed a drizzle, which UPPCB officials said may help bring down suspended pollutants in the air and improve air quality on Wednesday.Ghaziabad is also listed under the 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh and funds of about ₹61.5 crore ( ₹615 million) from the Fifteenth Finance Commission were allotted to the city exclusively for the purchase of equipment and taking measures to improve air quality. The funds were allocated in December last year as well as in July this year, said officials.The officials of Ghaziabad municipal corporation said due to some delays on account of the lockdown, agencies were not getting the required supply in time.“We have floated all the tenders and almost 75% of the different measures and equipment have been taken up or received. It is likely that the rest of the equipment will arrive within a week,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.Officials said that the list of procured equipment/works was not readily available.Using the funds, the corporation planned to get 30 big air filters and put them in public places; six higher capacity anti-smog guns with a capacity of 6,000 litres each; revamp 200 parks; convert 579 vehicles to CNG and develop a city forest near the New Bus Adda Metro station, among other measures.The funds were also to be utilised for the paving of dusty roads with greenery and stones.Environmentalists said that the pollution scenario in the city has gone from bad to worse over the past several years.“If meteorological conditions and external pollution sources cannot be controlled, special efforts are needed to keep a tight check on local pollution sources. Ghaziabad remains high on PM2.5, which is largely attributed to vehicular emission. Further, the construction activities and the bad condition of roads have also aided the city’s pollution levels. If there is no strict enforcement at the local level, the conditions will remain similar the next season too,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and lawyer.PM 2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns. Experts consider it the primary pollutant in the region.
29-12-2021||Chandigarh||Channi extends ₹17,000 per acre relief to basmati growers||Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday decided to extend relief of ₹17,000 per acre to basmati growers whose crops have been damaged due to hailstorm during the past kharif season. The CM took the decision after marathon discussion with the Kisan Majdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which also announced to take back its “rail roko” agitation. During the discussions with the KMSC delegation led by its state president Satnam Singh Pannu on a host of issues, Channi urged them to shun the path of agitation, stating that his government was already sensitized to their hardships and concerns. “The stir has already adversely impacted the supply of urea and DAP across the state, accentuating their woes especially during the current Rabi season,” he told them. They also deliberated at length the cases registered against farmers at Delhi and by Railway Protection Force during farmers’ agitation, debt waiver, providing jobs and compensation to the families of the farmers who sacrificed their lives during the agitation, compensation for crop damage, crop insurance and making the payment process easy for “abadkars” (farmers who have been tilling the land in occupation since long without any ownership rights). Channi also assured the delegation that he would soon take up the matter with home minister Amit Shah for prompt withdrawal of cases registered against farmers by Delhi Police as well as the RPF during the yearlong agitation against black farm laws. Acceding to another demand of the delegation, the CM said to ensure farmers get remunerative price of their produce, the state government would soon come out with a policy for covering all those crops under the state MSP, which are currently not covered under MSP regime by the Centre. He also welcomed the idea of delegation to create a Basmati Trading Corporation to ensure export of basmati across the globe with twin objective of providing remunerative prices for their crops and to give a major push towards crop diversification. On both issues, the CM asked chief secretary Anirudh Tewari to conduct a detailed study before taking a final call on this count. Agriculture Minister Randeep Singh Nabha, ACS, revenue, VK Janjua, financial commissioner, agriculture DK Tiwari and director, agriculture, Gurvinder Singh were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-extends-17-000-per-acre-relief-to-basmati-growers-101640718901751.html

There is a charging station at Akbarpur-Behrampur in Vijay Nagar with 12 bays for charging,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC).Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to flag off the bus services virtually, said the officials. “Each of the buses will have a capacity to cover a distance of 120 kilometres in a single charge. The buses will have an option for charging from a single point, which will take nearly two hours for being fully charged, at the 12 bays. They will also have a double point charging facility, which will take just one hour to fully charge the batteries,” Singh added. An entity named ‘Ghaziabad City Transport Services Limited’ has also been formed to oversee the operations of the e-buses, which will be the first state-run city transport service in Ghaziabad. The entity will be headed by Meerut commissioner Surendra Singh, and officers from the UPSRTC and the Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC).

Government schools in Uttar Pradesh reopened secondary classes on August 16 and primary classes on September 1 this year.According to the government directives, the Ministry of Education, Government of India, issued orders for modifications of the existing SOPs or guidelines for physical classes.“The state government has directed schools to continue regular classes, but with stringent implementation of Covid protocols and guidelines in order to control the spread of Covid at educational institutions,” said Singh.According to the Covid guidelines, thermal screening of every student will be done before entering the school, and no student or teacher will be allowed to enter the school without wearing a mask.Students will be allowed to enter the school only with the permission of their parents. Schools will have to take consent from the parents before students can start attending classes. Schools will have to arrange online classes for students who do not wish to attend physical classes. School managements will also have to sanitise the premises every day, before the arrival of the students and after closing the schools. Hand sanitising will have to be improved in schools, and activities like prayer meetings, cultural and sports events are allowed only with social distancing protocols.There are specific guidelines for elderly employees of the schools and those suffering from chronic diseases as they are at a higher risk of being infected. The education department has ordered all the schools to be vigilant towards old aged employees, pregnant women and those who suffer from serious diseases because of this, said the officials.“Schools will not involve such employees at work where they have to be in direct contact with the students. If any student or employee has any symptom like cough, cold, or fever, schools will have to inform the district education department immediately and get medical attention for those people,” according to the order.It has also directed the district education department to seek a report from all schools regarding full vaccination of their teachers and employees. “Schools have to submit reports about full vaccination of their teachers to the district education department by next week. Directions regarding the same have been issued to private and government schools in the district,” said Singh.Medical experts, meanwhile, said that the order came as a “precautionary measure”. “As children up to 18 years of age have not been vaccinated so far, the education department has ordered special precautions in schools. Parents should also educate their children about the importance of following Covid protocols. With the latest order, it is the government’s effort to control the spread of the virus and avoid affecting education for the students,” said Dr Sunil Awana, president of Indian Medical Association, Noida chapter.Manoj Kataria, founder of Gautam Budh Nagar Parents Welfare Society (GPWS) said, “Parents are anxious to send their children to schools as Covid cases are on the rise. While students of secondary classes can be trusted to follow the Covid guidelines, many parents of primary school students have not given their consent to send their child to attend physical classes. We hope the district education department can enforce the guidelines stringently”.
29-12-2021||Pune||HC directs chief secretary to conduct hearing in PCB’s ₹459 crore tax dues case||Pune: Acting on the orders of Bombay High Court, the chief secretary of Maharashtra has called the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) chief executive officer (CEO) for a hearing at his office on January 11 in connection with the pending Goods and Services Tax (GST) dues of over ₹459 crore. After hearing counsel for parties in the case, the court has granted relief prayed for by the petitioners and the PCB has been given an opportunity to make representation within a period of two weeks to the chief Secretary. Maharashtra has been directed to dispose of the representation within two months after giving an opportunity to the petitioners of being heard. PCB is facing the worst financial crisis in its history with developmental works worth crores of rupees being hit due to fund shortage, including basic work like maintenance of gardens and ground level health department staff. Prior to 2013, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had been collecting octroi and PCB was getting its share from PMC. Subsequently, the state government abolished octroi with effect from April 1 2013 and octroi compensation to the board was stopped. As per government of Maharashtra notification in 2013, PMC started collecting Local Body Tax (LBT) instead of octroi within its jurisdiction with effect from April 2013. There is no revenue sharing agreement between PMC and PCB from April 1, 2013. Under Section 71 of the Cantonments Act, 2006, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) authorised the board to impose LBT through a resolution dated June 4, 2015 and the board was able to generate revenue to the tune of ₹88 crore per annum. On April 12, 2017, GST was enacted by the central government and implemented with effect from July 1, 2017. The introduction of GST has resulted in a subsummation of taxes, including octroi, LBT, entry tax, entertainment tax, which were earlier used to be collected by local bodies cum authorities and or PCB. This has led to considerable revenue loss to the Board. PCB has been consistently taking up the matter with higher authorities, state and central governments for obtaining due share of GST. The matter has also been taken up by the principal director, Defence Estates; Southern Command, Pune; General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C), Southern Command, Pune with the state government of Maharashtra for release of GST Compensation. The elected members of the board had also met the finance minister with a request for releasing the GST compensation share. But despite vigorous efforts made till date the due share of GST compensation has not been provided to the board, Pune. Due to annual revenue loss to the tune of ₹90 crore, a self-sufficient cantonment board has become deficit. Due to non-receipt of GST compensation, the board is finding it difficult to perform the statutory duties as per the provisions of the Cantonments Act, 2006. Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Defence Estates (DGDE), a few days ago has released a ₹19 crore non-recurring grant-in aid to the Pune, Khadki, and Dehu Road cantonment boards to help them tide off the financial crunch. Pune cantonment has been given Rs12 crore, while Khadki and Dehu Road cantonments will receive Rs3 crore and Rs4 crore. PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “The grant is yet to be credited in the board account and will help in meeting salary expenses and other spending of the board administration.” PCB seeks compensation of revenue loss The board administration has maintained that with the introduction of GST, the tax base corresponding to LBT that PCB used to collect has subsumed under the tax base of the GST and is concurrently taxed by the Union and state governments. Since Cantonment Board has no longer access to the tax base (corresponding to LBT), under the federal structure, demand of PCB for compensation of revenue loss from the state government is justified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hc-directs-chief-secretary-to-conduct-hearing-in-pcb-s-rs-459-crore-tax-dues-case-101640717581650.html

These three districts account for 54.32% of the total active Covid cases reported in the state, as of Monday. Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO) of Ghaziabad, said, “Many travellers, who came from other states, have tested positive for the virus, and the others are contacts of infected patients. So, there is a rise in the number of cases reported in December, but almost all the patients are asymptomatic... We have also ramped up testing at 42 government facilities for Covid treatment, and soon, the opening and closing timings for these hospitals will be increased.” On Tuesday, Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad reported 28 and 10 fresh Covid cases, taking the active caseload to 82 and 65, respectively. “There is an increase in the cases as testing facilities in the National Capital Region (NCR) districts of Uttar Pradesh are multiple times higher than other districts in the state. With increased testing, we are tracing positive cases and containing them at an early stage. Majority of the patients are symptomatic,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.

Experts, meanwhile, said these two districts have a large population of working-class people, who have to travel on a daily basis. “That is why the spread of infection. The district should enhance testing facilities and trace more positive cases so that those could be contained and the spread of the infection could be checked,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). Among the 10 fresh cases reported on Tuesday, were a 10-year-old girl from Indirapuram, who returned from the UK on December 19; four members of a family from Nehru Nagar; and one patient each from Ramprastha, Vasundhara, Crossings Republik (with a travel history from Mumbai on December 23), Shalimar Garden and Raj Nagar Extension.

PMC along with the Centre’s Energy Efficiency Service Limited (EESL) plan to generate the solar power and utilise it. The plant is planned to come up in Marathwada or Vidharba region on government land. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “It is decided that SPV would invest twenty percentage and 80 percentage would be raised through loan for erecting solar plant. In the twenty percentage share, PMC would bear 26 percentage and SPV would invest 74 percentage share. It is expected that the total solar project cost would be ₹250 crore. PMC would need to give Rs12.48 crore as investment. Even it is mandatory to PMC that it would need to purchase at least 51 percentage energy generated through the plant.” Rasne said, “As per existing rate, PMC is purchasing energy from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited at the rate of Rs7.23 per unit. It is expected that PMC would buy energy at Rs3.40 per unit from SPV and the rates would be stable for next 20 years.

29-12-2021||Lucknow||BSP would protect ‘sanatan dharma’ : Mishra||Lucknow: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said on Tuesday that if voted to power, the BSP would protect ‘sanatana dharma’. It would open all the Sanskrit institutions closed under the BJP government to promote and propagate ‘sanatana dharma’, he said. Addressing a public meeting in Khajani reserved assembly constituency in Gorakhpur district, Mishra said there was pact between the Bharatiya Janata Party and Samajwadi Party to stop the BSP from coming to power in the 2022 assembly election. The BJP and SP leaders were aware of the fact that BSP chief Mayawati would take action against those who indulged in lawlessness and corruption when both the parties were power. But the people had made up their mind to make Mayawati next chief minister of UP, he said. That the BJP government had failed to control crime could be gauged from the fact that policemen killed a trader in a hotel. Instead of taking action against the culprits, senior police officers threatened the family members of the victim, he said. Mishra said to bring crowd in the rallies, the BJP was misusing the government machinery whereas the SP had promised tickets to several candidates on a seat. Instead of distributing smartphones and tablets during the pandemic, the BJP government was distributing the gadgets when elections were close. This clearly showed that the BJP was not interested in giving jobs to the youths but to get their votes, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-would-protect-sanatan-dharma-mishra-101640716507128.html
29-12-2021||Lucknow||PM inaugurates Kanpur Metro, becomes its first passenger||KANPUR Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the first passenger of the Kanpur Metro rail after he inaugurated the completed section of the project on Tuesday. The 9-km section from IIT-Kanpur to Motijheel was completed in a record two years’ time, said officials.Modi, along with Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, travelled in the beautifully decorated train from IIT-Kanpur to Geeta Nagar crossing station in the city. The PM stated that the Metro train was a memorable experience for him. “Kanpur Metro would not only address the longstanding complaint of congestion on roads but would also be immensely beneficial in urban mobility,” he said. The PM also flagged off the first Metro train ferrying 150 school children who watched him on the giant screen installed at the station and cheered for him. The entire length of the Kanpur Metro rail project is 32 km and is being built at a cost of over ₹11,000 crore. Kanpur Metro is the fastest built Metro project in the country as it was completed before the deadline of 26 months, stated officials. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath started the construction work of the Kanpur metro project on November 15, 2019, and the trial run took place on the 9-km IIT-K to Motijheel priority corridor on November 10, 2021, in less than two years. The priority corridor has nine stations, each 80 metres long. Work on the extension of this project was going on at a rapid pace.A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said improving urban mobility had been one of the key focus areas of the PM. Before boarding the train, the PM inspected the Metro rail project. Managing director of UP Metro Rail Corporation Kumar Keshav briefed him about the various aspects of operations in Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-inaugurates-kanpur-metro-becomes-its-first-passenger-101640716503655.html

Health officials said that all the fresh Covid cases were reported during random sampling, surveillance and screening at hospitals, with no international travellers among them.“Districts like Noida and Ghaziabad are closer to Delhi, and therefore, more people are vulnerable to get infected. However, it is not a matter of concern yet. The number of Covid cases are increasing everywhere across the country, but the positivity rate in the district is still low. People only need to ensure that they follow Covid protocols properly,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO). He also said that about half the people who tested positive on Tuesday were domestic travellers, and may have got infected during travel. All the patients are asymptomatic and are in home isolation. Cases have been consistently reducing since June. 51 cases were reported in August, which reduced to 48 in September, 43 in October, and again increased to 61 in November. District officials said that “testing has been increased” to track and treat the patients at the earliest. “It is a good thing that most of the patients are asymptomatic. They are in isolation. The same strategy will continue... With the New Year’s Day around the corner, ensuring Covid protocols is a challenge. We hope there is self-regulation among the people. Also, strict enforcement is in place in case of violations,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. He said that the health department officials have been asked to increase random testing and contact tracing of the positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-reports-28-fresh-coronavirus-cases-in-a-day-highest-in-past-six-months-101640716441758.html

29-12-2021||Lucknow||Urdu poet ‘Akbar Allahabadi’ shown as ‘Akbar Prayagraj’ on UPHESC website||PRAYAGRAJ Renowned Urdu poet, ‘Akbar Allahabadi’, (1846-1921) is now ‘Akbar Prayagraj’, as per the official website of the Uttar Pradesh Higher Education Services Commission (UPHESC), an autonomous body functioning under the state government. Allahabad district was renamed Prayagraj in 2018 by the Yogi Adityanath-led state government.The official website of Prayagraj-based UPHESC (www.uphesc.org) shows updated name of Urdu poet Syed Akbar Hussain, popularly known as ‘Akbar Allahabadi’ as ‘Akbar Prayagraj’. The name change has been made in the ‘About Allahabad’ section of the portal. ‘Akbar Allahabadi’ is not the only famous literary personality whose pen name has been changed on the website. The ‘Allahabadi’ suffix to the names of all writers/poets has been changed to ‘Prayagraj’ on the portal. These include Rashid Allahabadi (born 1944) and Tegh Allahabadi (1930-1970) on the list of Urdu poets from the Sangam city who have been named after Akbar Allahabadi. They are now listed as ‘Tegh Prayagraj’ and ‘Rashid Prayagraj’. The website informs: “Akbar Prayagraj is a noted modern Urdu poet, and Nooh Narwi, Tegh Prayagraj, Shabnam Naqvi and Rashid Prayagraj have their origin in Prayagraj.” UPHESC secretary Vandana Tripathi said that the “error” in the information on the website had come to light on Tuesday and a correction was now being made through the agency that designed the website and manages it for UPHESC. She reiterated that the “name change” of the famous poets was an inadvertent error. However, this “faux pass” did not go down well with litterateurs and poets of Prayagraj. Noted writer and poet Imtiyaz Ahmad Ghazi, who owns the Guftgu Publication in Prayagraj, dubbed it a major “error” for a commission entrusted with the task of selecting principals and teachers for government-aided degree colleges of UP. “No one has the right to change the name of any individual. Even if the names of the cities have been changed, name of a writer or poet’s pen name cannot be altered by anyone. This should be corrected immediately,” said Ghazi.“The commission has made no changes on its website in this regard. The information has been given on the site by some mischievous elements. It is being amended accordingly. This act of mischievous elements is being investigated by the cyber cell and strict legal action will be taken against those responsible,” said Shivji Malviya, deputy secretary, UP Higher Education Service Commission, in a communication.

And they lie. Tell us if the cash found in the walls of a house (of a trader in Kanpur and Kannauj) is of the BJP or not. The cash is not of SP, it is of BJP. You all saw (on TV and papers) that in a house (in Kanpur and Kannauj ) huge cash was discovered (by directorate general of GST investigations). There was so much cash that several currency-counting machines were requisitioned and still the counting continues on the fourth day today.” He said: “This is the biggest cash discovery ever in UP. Take out the call details (of the trader) and it will be proved that the cash is related to the BJP. And the BJP should also tell us, if so much cash was found, then did the demonetisation not fail? If not, how come so much cash was discovered at a BJP person’s house? Baba ji’s (Yogi) government will not survive now. People will uproot it in the 2022 (UP assembly polls”. Calling the BJP government and its top leaders’ liars, Akhilesh said that recently he heard chief minister Yogi Adityanath saying that lakhs were given jobs and crores got employment under his government. “We are people of ‘puraney khayalat (conventional people) and we still believe that Yogis and Babas do not lie. So now tell me, did any of you get jobs? This government has started distributing smartphones and tablets. Did any of you get them? Attacking the BJP government over Covid, he said: “This government ran away from its responsibility and left people to die. This government is responsible for the Covid deaths. People did not get medicines, beds, or oxygen. Unnao’s people saw dead bodies floating in the Ganga.” He said that now change was necessary for the state as there could not be a bigger liar than the BJP. It lied to farmers about doubling their income and to youth about jobs, he said. Calling the Kanpur Metro a gift by his party’s previous government to the people of Kanpur, he said: “This government continues re-inaugurating already inaugurated projects and re-lays foundation for already founded projects. Kanpur Metro is one more in the series as the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has inaugurated it today in Kanpur. The project was founded by the SP government. Today, I announce that on returning to power, the SP government will extend the Kanpur Metro to Unnao across the Ganga river.” Akhilesh Yadav also announced on Tuesday that if his party was voted back to power in UP, it would give ₹5 lakh compensation to kin of any cyclist who died in a road accident and also to the kin of anyone killed in a bull attack. Bicycle is the election symbol of the Samajwadi Party. Akhilesh made the announcement standing atop the roof of his Vijay Rath (a Bharat Benz bus) in Unnao during his Vijay Rath Yatra in the district, sandwiched between Kanpur and Lucknow. Akhilesh said that the previous Samajwadi Party government had built bicycle tracks, but the BJP government ruined them. “For safe passage to cyclists, the SP government had built bicycle tracks in Unnao also. But the BJP government ruined them. Cyclists die in road accidents. On coming to power, our government will give ₹5 lakh to the family of any cyclist who dies in a road accident anywhere in the state. Also, the new government will give ₹5 lakh aid to anyone who dies in a bull attack. Just recently, near here, an elderly woman died after a bull attacked her,” he said. 
29-12-2021||World||'Tsunami' of Covid cases may lead to collapse of health systems, says WHO chief||A "tsunami" of Omicron and Delta Covid-19 cases will pile pressure on health systems already being stretched to their limits, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Wednesday.The WHO said the Delta and Omicron variants of concern were "twin threats" that were driving new case numbers to record highs, leading to spikes in hospitalisations and deaths.The WHO said new global cases had risen by 11 percent last week, while the United States and France both registered record daily case numbers on Wednesday."I am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference."This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers, and health systems on the brink of collapse."He said the pressure on health systems was not only due to new coronavirus patients, but also large numbers of health workers falling ill with Covid.'Moral shame'The WHO reflected on the fight against Covid-19 in 2021 and hoped that next year would see an end to the acute stage of the pandemic -- but warned that it would rest on greater vaccine equity.The WHO wanted 40 percent of the population in every country fully vaccinated by the end of the year and has a target of 70 percent coverage by the middle of 2022.Tedros announced that 92 of the WHO's 194 member states were going to miss the 40 percent target."This is due to a combination of limited supply going to low-income countries for most of the year and then subsequent vaccines arriving close to expiry and without key parts like the syringes," he said."It's not only a moral shame, it cost lives and provided the virus with opportunities to circulate unchecked and mutate. In the year ahead, I call for leaders of government and industry to walk the talk on vaccine equity."While 2021 has been hard, I ask everyone to make a New Year's resolution to get behind the campaign to vaccinate 70 percent by the middle of 2022."Misinformation and populismTedros slammed the attitude of richer countries accusing them of hogging the weapons to combat Covid-19 -- and leaving the back door open for the virus."Populism, narrow nationalism and hoarding of health tools, including masks, therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines, by a small number of countries, undermined equity, and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of new variants," he said.Meanwhile, disinformation had been a constant distraction in 2021, hampering efforts to beat the pandemic."In the huge waves of cases currently seen in Europe and in many countries around the world, misinformation which has driven vaccine hesitancy is now translating to the unvaccinated disproportionally dying," he said.Tedros lamented that while there were 1.8 million recorded deaths in 2020, there were 3.5 million in 2021 -- and the true number would be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-worries-for-collapse-of-health-systems-over-tsunami-of-covid-cases-101640796528962.html
29-12-2021||World||US hits new record for daily Covid tally since January, logs 265,427 new cases||The United States has reached its highest-ever average of new Covid cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as the Omicron variant spread at a blistering pace.The moving seven-day average of new cases was 265,427 as of Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak of 251,989 set in mid-January 2021, a tracker maintained by the university showed.Ahead of Johns Hopkins releasing the data, Harvard epidemiologist and immunologist Michael Mina tweeted the count was likely the "tip of the iceberg" with the true number of cases likely far higher, because of a shortage of tests and results from home tests not being included.The heavily-mutated Omicron strain, which according to government modeling accounted for around 59 percent of national US cases in the week ending December 25, is the most transmissible seen to date.It is frequently able to bypass prior immunity conferred by vaccination and prior infection.Though the rate of severe outcomes appears to be lower, Omicron is already overwhelming previously stretched hospital systems throughout the country, with health workers leaving in droves because of burnout.Almost 9,000 patients are being admitted every day, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), still some way short of the peak of 16,500 per day seen in January, though this is a lagging indicator.Around 1,200 people were dying on average every day on December 23, the day before data collection was disrupted by Christmas holidays.In January, deaths peaked at an average of 3,400 a day.Experts are hoping the US Omicron wave will be more like a "flash flood" as seen in South Africa, where it was first reported in mid-November but where cases have been receding since more than a week.The latest milestone comes as the CDC shortened recommended times that people should isolate after a positive test from 10 to five days, so long as they do not have symptoms and continue to wear a mask.The move was praised by airlines and the hospitality industry, but public health experts criticized the decision to omit a requirement for a negative Covid test -- even via rapid antigen, which correlates well with infectiousness.More than 820,000 Americans have died from the pandemic, making the United States by far the hardest-hit country in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-new-record-for-daily-covid-tally-since-january-logs-265-427-new-cases-101640788867328.html
29-12-2021||World||States in Australia mull putting cats under lockdown. Here's why||Many states in Australia will soon ask cat owners to keep them locked inside their homes, or at least within the premises. The reason? These feline hunters have been hunting hundreds of native animals.According to ABC News, one cat is responsible for more than 180 native animal attacks. It further reported that around 450 native animals, most of them small birds and quendas (a type of bandicoot), are brought the WA Wildlife hospital near Perth each year after an encounter with a cat.The report also mentioned about a boobook owl, who had to be euthanised due to a chip fracture to its elbow joint after a cat encounter. The owl was brought to the hospital by the owner of the cat, who found the injured bird in the pet’s mouth.The doctors said that severity of the injury affected the owl’s ability to fly.The hospital’s operations director Dean Huxley told ABC News that more than 5,000 animals are admitted to the facility each year suffering from injuries consistent with a cat attack.One of the reasons, he said, is he clearing of habitat which leads these animals to areas dominated by cats, thereby resulting in such calamities.So, in order to save endemic wildlife from extinction, the authorities in Australia are implementing “cat curfews”.In Adelaide Hills in South Australia, cats a banned from 8pm to 7am. In other parts of the country, like the city of Greater Bendigo in Victoria, owners have been asked to keep the cats on their properties or face fines.Australia’s capital Canberra plans to place all the cats under lockdown from mid-2022. In Western Australia, Fremantle is leading the push for cat containment, with a proposal to ban cats from all public areas.Cat breeders like Pamela Lanigan agree with government’s move to ban cats in public places. But she points out that much of the harm to wildlife hadn’t been done by pet cats but those which are stray or “loosely owned” by several households.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/states-in-australia-mull-putting-cats-under-lockdown-here-s-why-101640779467981.html

Canada has also crossed the 2mn mark in total infections since the coronavirus crisis commenced in 2020.Meanwhile, as cases increase sharply, many provinces have closed gyms, nightclubs and bars, while other establishments, like restaurants have to operate at 50% capacity. The worst-hit province of Quebec, with 12,833 new cases, is trying to deal with the problem by taking the radical step of allowing some infected healthcare workers to remain at their stations.“If we had the staff we needed, we wouldn’t have to implement this measure,” according to the Montreal Gazette’s translation of Quebec’s health minister Christian Dubé’s remarks in French.He explained the provincial system was in a “vice” where there were more cases while fewer healthcare workers were available. However, the announcement was criticised by unions representing healthcare staff over the measure. Meanwhile, another member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Cabinet has tested positive for Covid-19. Labour minister Seamus O’Regan tweeted he took a rapid test and tested positive. He will remain in self-isolation. O’Regan’s case may be a breakthrough since he also stated he has received three vaccine doses.Last week, Canada’s foreign minister Melanie Joly had also tested positive, after undergoing a rapid test.As cases reach new highs each day, several provinces, including Quebec, have accelerated their administration of booster doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/driven-by-omicron-variant-canada-in-the-grip-of-rising-covid-cases-101640779344275.html
29-12-2021||World||China recommits to Covid Zero amid surging Xi’an outbreak||Chinese officials renewed their commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 even as they battle what is becoming the biggest and most protracted outbreak since the virus emerged in Wuhan two years ago.Health officials vowed not to waver in their efforts to quash any domestic resurgence and to prevent the virus from crossing borders at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. The government limited entry into the capital city on Friday for anyone with a travel history to a border county within the previous two weeks, even if there haven’t been any cases in those places. Authorities will act “at the fastest speed and with minimal cost,” said He Qinghua, an official with the National Health Commission.New Covid-19 cases continued to emerge in the western Chinese city of Xi’an, which the government locked down last week. The numbers eased a bit after hitting a record on Tuesday when repeat testing of its 13 million residents identified several previously undetected chains of transmission.Xi’an reported 151 infections on Wednesday, down from 175 on Tuesday, as residents have been asked to stay indoors and driving is banned. The outbreak spread from a few dozen cases in early December to roughly 150 a day after the city was locked down last Thursday, the most dramatic curb China has enacted to stymie Covid since closing off Wuhan and the broader Hubei province in January 2020.Five rounds of mass testing have detected more than 900 infections thus far in Xi’an. The outbreak, which was initially traced to a flight from Pakistan, spread quietly throughout the community in its early days. Its ability to evade detection by contract tracers and to permeate every corner of the city is what led worried officials to enact the lockdown.  China’s Plane-Cleaning Rule Spurs U.S. Talks After Aborted TripThe Xi’an outbreak shows the challenge China faces in eliminating the virus as part of the so-called Covid Zero strategy it has pursued since the start of the pandemic. The approach that features mass testing, aggressive contact tracing, quarantines and sealed borders to prevent infections from seeping in from overseas kept most of the country virus-free throughout the pandemic. It remains the best strategy for China, despite doubts about its economic and emotional costs, said Liang Wannian, the seasoned epidemiologist that overseas the country’s Covid response. His comments came in an interview with the Paper, a Shanghai-based media outlet. Lingering CasesThe arrival of the more contagious delta variant has challenged the status quo by proving capable of slipping through those barriers and triggering more frequent domestic flareups since May this year. The prolonged struggle against delta has raised questions about whether such a containment strategy will hold up against omicron, and even more infectious strain. The emergence of omicron doesn’t mean China will have to change tack, but rather will require more forceful implementation of the current Covid playbook, Liang told the Paper.While China has detected a handful of imported omicron infections from international travellers, the variant has yet to spread domestically. Officials are ramping up defences at border towns by creating so-called buffer zones. Those areas will have more checks and tighter restrictions to reduce the chance of the virus escaping into the community and causing domestic flareups, according to Liang. What Covid Therapies Exist, and What Omicron Changes: QuickTakeExperts warn the latest outbreak won’t be under control until mid to late January, just days before the Winter Olympics begin in the capital Beijing. Earlier this week Xi’an started citywide disinfection, while residents have been asked to stay home and only have one member from each household leave every other day to shop for groceries. Authorities have also suspended all domestic flights and banned private cars on the street.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-recommits-to-covid-zero-amid-surging-xi-an-outbreak-101640772721443.html

It added that acting editor-in-chief Patrick Lam, who was earlier arrested, had resigned and all employees have been terminated."Because of the current situation, Stand News will stop operating immediately," the outlet said in a statement.Steve Li, senior superintendent of the national security police, accused the media outlet of publishing articles that incited hatred towards the Hong Kong government between July 2020 and November 2021, which included news reports and blog posts."They described Hong Kong protesters as 'being disappeared' and 'violated'... These are malicious allegations without any factual basis," Li told a press conference.The seven individuals were arrested under a British colonial-era law for "conspiracy to publish seditious publication".Around lunchtime on Wednesday, national security police could be seen hauling boxes from Stand News' office. Li said they seized computers, phones, documents and HK$500,000 ($64,100) in cash.The national security unit froze about HK$61 million ($7.8 mn) worth of assets from the media outlet, one of the largest sums it has ever frozen, Li said.More than 200 officers were deployed to search the outlet's newsroom with court authorisation to seize journalistic materials, police said.An AFP reporter saw Stand News' Lam being led handcuffed into the office after his arrest.Police also arrested former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen, as well as four board members who resigned in June, according to local media.Li would not rule out further arrests, and said some individuals not in Hong Kong had been put on a wanted list.'Editorially independent'Announcing its closure, Stand News thanked its readers, saying it was established as a non-profit in December 2014 to "take a stand in Hong Kong"."Stand News was editorially independent, and was dedicated to protecting Hong Kong's core values such as democracy, human rights, freedom, rule of law and justice," the outlet said.The Committee to Protect Journalists described the raid as "an open assault on Hong Kong's already tattered press freedom" and called for charges to be dropped.Stand News is the second Hong Kong media company targeted by the authorities after Apple Daily, which shut down in June after its assets were frozen under the national security law.Li denied that police were targeting reporters and the media, saying that news outlets will not face the law in Hong Kong if their journalists write "unbiased" reports.Shortly before dawn, Stand News broadcast live on Facebook that national security police were outside the door of deputy assignment editor Ronson Chan, who had several devices confiscated but was not arrested.The former Stand News board members arrested Wednesday are Hong Kong pop star Denise Ho, barrister Margaret Ng, Christine Fang and Chow Tat-chi, according to local media reports.Li confirmed to AFP that, in addition to the arrests, police visited and searched the homes of four people connected to Stand News.International outcryDuring the 2019 democracy protests, police clashed with several of the outlet's reporters while one journalist -- known for her Facebook live broadcasts -- captured footage of a mob attack at a train station, continuing the feed even as the assailants turned on her.Hong Kong has long served as a regional media hub, though it has tumbled down press freedom rankings in recent years as Beijing asserts greater control over the city.Following reports of Wednesday's raid, Taiwan's ruling party accused Beijing of destroying Hong Kong's democracy and freedom.The Hong Kong Journalists Association and the Foreign Correspondents' Club -- representing local and international media workers respectively -- both said they were "deeply concerned" by the arrests and called for press freedom to be respected.Meanwhile, exiled activist Nathan Law tweeted that the arrests illustrated the persecution of journalists and media that "dare to challenge them and speak the truth".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-stand-news-shuts-down-after-police-raid-arrests-101640767460719.html

Petersen said in a post last week that he had been learning about McDonald’s struggle with french fry shortages in the country. McDonald’s Holdings Co. Japan said Dec. 21 that it would only offer small sizes of french fries after flooding at a Vancouver port and the Covid-19 pandemic cut off key supplies for the staple menu item. Footage from a local television report showed customers forming long lines at one of the stores in Tokyo to get their last orders of the larger portion fries before the ration went into effect.The fast-food company has said it expects the issue to be resolved by New Year’s Eve and that it was arranging alternative shipment options like airplanes. McDonald’s Holdings Co. Japan couldn’t confirm or deny it’s using Flexport to import its potatoes. The sale of medium and large size fries will resume as planned on Dec. 31, a spokeswoman said by telephone on Wednesday. Flexport’s Petersen didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The shortage isn’t just limited to Japan. In New York, iconic burger joint J.G. Melon said in an Instagram post last week that it was suspending sales of its cottage fries due to supply-chain issues. Flow of products from cream cheese to chicken tenders has also come under strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-planes-to-fly-potatoes-to-ease-japan-s-french-fries-deficiency-101640766976503.html

Others included in the list were - Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan, and disgraced Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, reported OCCRP.OCCRP said Ghani deserved an award because he "deserted his people leaving them to misery and death."Drew Sullivan, a co-founder of OCCRP who served as a judge on the panel, said that Ashraf Ghani deserves such an award due to his corruption and incompetence."Ghani certainly deserves an award, too. He was breath-taking in both his corruption and his gross incompetence. He deserted his people, leaving them to misery and death so he could live among the corrupt former state officials in the moral cesspool that is the UAE," said Sullivan.A panel of six journalists and scholars who study and report on corruption selected Lukashenko as the man of the year. It included Rawan Damen, Director General of Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ); Will Fitzgibbon, senior reporter with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ); Boyoung Lim, a senior editor at the Pulitzer Center; Louise Shelley, an author and endowed professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University; Paul Radu, award-winning cross-border investigative reporter, co-founder, and Director of OCCRP; and Drew Sullivan."It was a banner year for corruption, but Lukashenko stood out from the crowd," said Sullivan.Lukashenko, 67, has clung to power in Minsk since 1993, rigging elections, torturing critics, and arresting and beating protesters, all with the aid and approval of the Kremlin, reported OCCRP.Assad led Syria into a destructive civil war and has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars while clinging to power. Erdogan has overseen a corrupt government that has laundered Chinese funds for Iranian oil using state-owned banks. Kurz was the leader of the Austrian People's Party (OVP) who, along with nine other politicians and newspaper persons, was accused of embezzlement and bribery, added OCCRP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/occrp-former-afghan-president-ghani-listed-among-most-corrupt-people-of-2021-101640763689324.html

The active cases stand at 10,186.The daily cases have been surging in the Middle Eastern country since last Sunday. On Tuesday, 1,846 more people were detected as Covid-19 positive while one patient died and 632 recovered from the viral disease.At the start of this month, daily cases were below the 50-mark.The UAE so far managed to avoid Covid-19 restrictions unlike other countries in the world.According to Bloomberg, the country has started administering booster doses to its population but has only covered a little over 30%. This booster administration is low despite the UAE having a high vaccination rate globally.Meanwhile, another country in the Middle East, Oman, has made two doses of vaccination mandatory for entering public places, offices. According to a report by Onmanorama, this mandate also applies to foreigners above 18 years that are entering Oman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abu-dhabi-tightens-entry-requirements-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-uae-101640760389978.html
29-12-2021||World||Antibodies that can block Omicron variant identified: Report||Scientists have identified antibodies that neutralise Omicron and other variants of coronavirus by targeting areas that remain essentially unchanged as the virus mutates.The research, published in the journal Nature, may help design vaccines and antibody treatments that will be effective against not only Omicron but other variants that may emerge in the future."This finding tells us that by focusing on antibodies that target these highly conserved sites on the spike protein, there is a way to overcome the virus' continual evolution," said David Veesler, an associate professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in the US.The Omicron variant has an unusually high number of 37 mutations in the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter and infect the human cells.It is thought that these changes explain in part why the variant has been able to spread so rapidly, to infect people who have been vaccinated and to reinfect those who have previously been infected."The main questions we were trying to answer were: how has this constellation of mutations in the spike protein of the Omicron variant affected its ability to bind to cells and to evade the immune system's antibody responses," Veesler said.To assess the effect of these mutations, the researchers engineered a disabled, nonreplicating virus, called a pseudovirus, to produce spike proteins on its surface, as coronaviruses do.They then created pseudoviruses that had spike proteins with the Omicron mutations and those found on the earliest variants identified in the pandemic.The researchers first looked to see how well the different versions of the spike protein were able to bind to protein on the surface of cells, that the virus uses to latch onto and enter the cell. This protein is called the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor.They found the Omicron variant spike protein was able to bind 2.4 times better than spike protein found in the virus isolated at the very beginning of the pandemic."That is not a huge increase but in the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, mutations in the spike protein that increased affinity were associated with higher transmissibility and infectivity," Veesler noted.They also found that the Omicron version was able to bind to mouse ACE2 receptors efficiently, suggesting Omicron might be able to "ping-pong" between humans and other mammals.The researchers then looked at how well antibodies against earlier isolates of the virus protected against the Omicron variant.They did this by using antibodies from patients who had previously been infected with earlier versions of the virus, vaccinated against earlier strains of the virus, or had been infected and then vaccinated.The team found that antibodies from people who had been infected by earlier strains and from those who had received one of the six most-used vaccines currently available all had reduced ability to block infection.Antibodies from people who had been infected, recovered, and then had two doses of vaccine also had reduced activity, but the reduction was less, about fivefold, clearly demonstrating that vaccination after infection is useful.Antibodies from people, in this case a group of renal dialysis patients, who had received a booster with a third dose of the mRNA vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer showed only a 4-fold reduction in neutralising activity."This shows that a third dose is really, really helpful against Omicron," Veesler said.All but one antibody treatments currently authorised or approved to be used with patients exposed to the virus, had no or had markedly reduced activity against Omicron in the laboratory.The exception was an antibody called sotrovimab, which had a two- to three-fold reduction of neutralising activity, the researchers said.However, when they tested a larger panel of antibodies that have been generated against earlier versions of the virus, the researchers identified four classes of antibodies that retained their ability to neutralise Omicron.Members of each of these classes target one of four specific areas of the spike protein present in not only SARS-CoV-2 variants but also a group of related coronaviruses, called sarbecoviruses.These sites on the protein may persist because they play an essential function that the protein would lose if they mutated. Such areas are called "conserved."The finding that antibodies are able to neutralise via recognition of conserved areas in so many different variants of the virus suggests that designing vaccines and antibody treatments that target these regions could be effective against a broad spectrum of variants, Veesler added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibodies-that-can-block-omicron-variant-identified-report-101640762505870.html

Footage from public broadcaster NHK showed Tokyo's main airports were packed, while public highway data showed a 39 km (24 mile) traffic jam heading southwest of the capital.Officials in Osaka confirmed five Omicron cases at a nursing home, believed to be the first cluster of the variant in Japan, Kyodo news agency reported on Tuesday.Community transmission of Omicron has been found in eight prefectures so far, according to a Jiji news agency tally. The variant may comprise 90% of COVID-19 cases in Osaka by early next month, according to a projection released on Tuesday by Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura.Concerns that Omicron may be more infectious and evade vaccine protections have prompted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to accelerate Japan's booster shot programme and maintain some of the world's strictest border restrictions.New COVID-19 infections have ticked up in recent weeks, reaching 385 nationwide on Tuesday. Even so, serious cases and deaths have stayed low, aided by a vaccination push that has fully inoculated almost 80% of the population.Japan has seen just 28 COVID-19 related fatalities in December, on course for the lowest monthly tally since July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-prepares-for-omicron-spread-with-the-onset-of-new-year-s-week-101640760587003.html
29-12-2021||World||Asia takes precautions against Omicron, but a surge may be inevitable||Much of Asia has largely managed to keep omicron at bay even as the variant rages in other parts of the world, but the region that is home to most of the globe's population is bracing for what may be an inevitable surge.Strict quarantine rules for arrivals and widespread mask wearing have helped slow the spread of the highly contagious variant in Asia. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Thailand quickly reinstated entry and quarantine restrictions in recent weeks after relaxing them in the fall.But cases are mounting, and experts say the next few months will be critical. Those fears have been amplified by doubts about the effectiveness of the Chinese-made vaccines used in China and much of the developing world.“Once the pace picks up, its upsurge would be extremely fast," said Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top medical adviser to Japan's government.In India, which has been getting back to normal after a devastating COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year, omicron is once again raising fears, with more than 700 cases reported in the country of nearly 1.4 billion people.Australia is already dealing with multiple COVID-19 surges, with a state leader saying Wednesday that “omicron is moving too quickly."Elsewhere, Thailand has topped 700 cases, South Korea has more than 500 and Japan, over 300. China, which has some of the strictest virus controls in the world, has reported at least eight.Only four cases have been reported in the Philippines, where people flocked to shopping malls ahead of Christmas and to Mass in the biggest Roman Catholic nation in Asia. Some hospitals have even begun dismantling COVID-19 wards in a move experts say could prove to be premature.Japan managed to delay the spread of the new variant for about a month largely thanks to its reimposition of entry restrictions, mandatory COVID-19 tests for all arrivals and the isolation of all passengers on a flight if anyone tested positive for omicron.But the barrier was broken last week when the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed in the neighboring cities of Osaka and Kyoto. Experts are urging the government to prepare for an imminent wave of infections by increasing testing, speeding up booster shots and preparing more beds at hospitals.“We want to believe the omicron cases could be mild, but its fast-paced infections could quickly multiply the number of patients and could still overwhelm hospitals,” Omi said.Taiwan, where wearing a face mask is near universal in major cities, has started to offer booster shots of the Moderna vaccine and is urging people get a third shot before an expected influx of people returning home for Lunar New Year at the end of January.Preliminary research has shown that booster shots of the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines offer continued, though diminished, protection against omicron.However, a Hong Kong University study that has yet to be published found that China's widely used Sinovac vaccine does not generate enough antibodies to protect against omicron, even with a booster shot, according to a university news release. Hong Kong offers both the Sinovac and Pfizer vaccines.Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment. Chinese officials have said their vaccines are still effective.“Our inactivated vaccines are still rather reliable and cover a range of antigens. Therefore, they won't be completely ineffective against omicron,” Zhong Nanshan, a top government doctor, said at a public forum.Some countries that relied on the Chinese vaccines are turning to others for boosters.Thailand, which largely used Sinovac and Sinopharm, another Chinese vaccine, is offering booster shots of AstraZeneca or Pfizer. Indonesia, where Sinovac has been the mainstay of a campaign to vaccinate its 270 million residents, is offering a Moderna booster for health care workers. The government is also planning boosters for the general population in January, though it hasn't said which vaccine.China's attitude toward the virus, omicron or not, is to stop transmission in its tracks, and the country appears to be getting even tougher with the approach of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.Officials locked down the city of Xi'an, a city and administrative area of 13 million people last week, amid a delta outbreak that has infected hundreds of people. On Monday, they ordered everyone to stay at home until another citywide round of testing was completed.Residents complained on social media about the sudden ban. Many were relying on instant noodles and other packaged food. Some worried how they would get enough food in the coming days, especially fresh vegetables.China quarantines those arriving from abroad for weeks, depending on the province, with three weeks being the most common.How China's zero-COVID-19 policy will play out at the Olympics is a major question. Athletes and visitors will not be allowed to leave the Olympic zones, and those attending such as officials, journalists and venue staff will be tested every day.To contain a deadly delta-driven surge in South Korea, the government this month restored its toughest distancing rules with a four-person limit on private gatherings and a 9 p.m. curfew on restaurants.Health experts predict it's only a matter of time before omicron comes.“Omicron has such a high transmission rate that it's too obvious that it'll become the dominant variant in South Korea at some point,” said Jaehun Jung, a professor at Gachon University College of Medicine in South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-takes-precautions-against-omicron-but-a-surge-may-be-inevitable-101640758930174.html
29-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: Global Covid-19 cases top 1 million for second straight day||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has pushed the global cases of Covid-19 to above one million for second straight day, news agency Bloomberg reported. The world has been grappling with the coronavirus disease for two years now, but there has been little relief. And the Omicron variant threatens to bring back lockdown-like situation again.The first day when global tally topped the million mark was Monday. More than 1.44 million Covid-19 cases were recorded across the world, which smashed the prior record after factoring out a day in December 2020 when Turkey backdated a significant number of cases.The Covid-19 infection is surging across the United States, which recorded nearly half of the million cases across the world in the last 24 hours. California is the worst hit region in the US, recording 86,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours.An outbreak of Omicron exploded in Australia too, which saw record hospitalisations. New infections in Sydney and surrounding parts of New South Wales state skyrocketed to more than 11,000, up from 6,000 a day earlier. Victoria state also reported a record 3,700 cases, up by more than 1,000 from the previous record set on Tuesday.This prompted Prime Minister Scott Morrison to schedule an emergency national cabinet meeting.China has already locked down Xian over rise in Covid-19 cases. The 13 million people in the city have not been able to leave their homes for a week and are virtually dependent on deliveries of necessities.Xian reported 151 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, or nearly all of the 152 cases nationwide, bringing the total number of local Xian cases to nearly 1,000 during the Dec. 9-28 period. No cases of the Omicron variant have been announced in the city.France reported a record high of 179,807 new confirmed coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period on Tuesday, one of the highest one-day tallies worldwide since the start of the pandemic.It is the highest number of new daily infections in Europe, according to data on covidtracker.fr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-global-covid-19-cases-top-1-million-for-second-straight-day-101640758495572.html

The man was involved in a racketeering case and escaped from the police in 2018, the report said, without giving his name.Confined to a hiding place, the man experienced increased mental stress and deteriorating health, the report said. He is in criminal detention now.China launched a Covid contact-tracing mechanism across the country early in the pandemic, and continues to use stringent measures that include mass testing, traffic control and targeted lockdowns to contain the virus. A data-based “health code” system installed on residents’ mobile phones shows whether someone is at risk of being infected, thus cannot travel across regions or enter public areas. Local authorities in eastern China’s Zhejiang province, where Hangzhou is located, and neighboring Shanghai tightened Covid prevention rules after a Covid resurgence hit the area in November. This isn’t the first time China’s Covid-control measures brought in a fugitive. A 48-year-old man from the western province of Gansu reported himself to Hangzhou police last year, citing restrictions on his activities without an identification card and health code, the China News Service reported on May 5, 2020. The man had fled police 24 years earlier for suspected homicide, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-covid-rules-lead-fugitive-to-surrender-after-three-years-101640756290960.html

Here's how||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been wreaking havoc in many parts of the world, especially the United States and Europe. In the US and the United Kingdom, it is already the dominant strain, overthrowing Delta.The US recorded more than 500,000 cases in a single day on Tuesday, the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. The total cases have exceeded 54 million.Europe too has been grappling with rising Covid-19 cases due to fast-spreading Omicron variant.

So far, more than 700 Omicron cases have been reported in the country of nearly 1.4 billion people.Like other Asian countries, India too has implemented strict measures to check Omicron’s spread. National capital Delhi has banned large gatherings for Christmas and New Year’s, and many other states have announced new restrictions, including curfews and vaccination requirements at stores and restaurants.A surge maybe inevitableSince Asia is home to most of the globe’s population, experts say the surge in Covid-19 cases is inevitable.

29-12-2021||World||Hong Kong sends 200 police to raid pro-democracy news outlet||More than 200 Hong Kong police raided pro-democracy media outlet Stand News and arrested six people connected to it, the latest actions likely to fuel concern about press freedoms in the city.  Those arrested Wednesday for conspiring to publish seditious materials under the colonial-era Crimes Ordinance include acting Editor-in-Chief Patrick Lam and former Editor-in-Chief Chung Pui-kuen, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. Denise Ho, a singer who testified about Hong Kong before the U.S. Congress, and ex-lawmaker Margaret Ng were among former Stand News board members arrested, the Post said, along with Chow Tat-chi and Christine Fang Meng-sang. Ho’s arrest was confirmed on her verified Facebook page. The government said in a statement that six current and former senior employees of an online media company, age 34 to 73, were arrested on sedition charges, without providing names. Police had a warrant to search and seize journalistic materials, it added in a separate notice.The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the raid and called for the release of those detained. “The arrests of six people associated with Stand News amounts to an open assault on Hong Kong’s already tattered press freedom, as China steps up direct control over the former colony,” said Steven Butler, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must release the six and drop all charges against them immediately, if Hong Kong is to retain any semblance of the freedoms that its residents enjoyed only a few years ago.”The government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously denied that local media is under political pressure, saying it is “firmly committed to protecting and respecting the freedom of the press.”The wave of arrests came a day after Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-closed Apple Daily, and six of his former staffers, were charged with conspiracy to produce and distribute seditious publications. The 74-year-old former media mogul, who also faces national security charges, has become a focus of the government’s probe into the pro-democracy opposition.Stand News emerged as one of Hong Kong’s most critical independent media outlets after its founding in 2014, with reporters and camera crews a near-constant presence documenting democracy protests in 2019. The outlet had braced for police scrutiny after the Apple Daily shuttered earlier this year, leaving Stand News as one of the last Chinese-language outlets providing coverage critical of the government. It announced in June that it would purge opinion pieces from its site and stop accepting subscriptions and sponsorships.Ronson Chan, a deputy assignment editor with Stand News who is also chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, said in an impromptu press conference outside his apartment that police searched his home Wednesday morning, taking away his computer, press pass and bank card.The journalists’ association said in a statement posted to its Facebook page that it was “deeply concerned” by the arrests and raid on a news organization. “HKJA urges the government to protect press freedom in accordance with the Basic Law,” it added, citing the city’s mini-constitution that enshrines free speech. Since Beijing passed a sweeping national security law last year, in the wake of 2019’s mass anti-government unrest, Hong Kong has imposed strict limits on what speech is allowed. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam suggested in July that a “law needs to be introduced” to police what the media publishes. The city’s public broadcaster, Radio Television Hong Kong, has had hard-hitting programs canceled and former staff have accused the organization of purging voices critical of the government.A reporter in April was convicted for making a false statement as part of investigation into a gang attack during pro-democracy protests in 2019, a rare prosecution of a journalist performing a once-routine search. Security Secretary Chris Tang in September accused the HKJA of having biased political views and favoring pro-democracy news organizations like the Daily and Stand News, something it denied.Some 46% of Hong Kong-based journalists polled by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club said they were considering leaving the city last month. Hong Kong ranked 80th in Reporters Without Borders’s latest press freedom index, down from 54th a decade ago.“Stand News has always conducted professional reporting.

It also limited the size of gatherings at private homes and restaurants to six people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-some-covid-ve-workers-will-continue-to-work-in-this-canadian-province-101640745294206.html

A total of 625 people in the state, which includes Sydney, are in hospital, including 61 in intensive care units. Testing centres in the state continue to be under heavy demand with some results taking longer than 72 hours. Most of Australia has shifted toward living with the virus, relying on vaccines and a growing arsenal of treatments. While recent studies have raised hopes that omicron symptoms may be less severe compared with the delta wave, some health experts have warned that the health system will still be under strain should too many people get infected with the new variant. Victoria, the second-most populous state, also saw new cases on Thursday jump to a record of 3,767..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-sees-hospitalizations-hit-record-as-omicron-surges-101640744550345.html
29-12-2021||World||California first state in US to top 5 million Covid-19 cases amid Omicron surge||California became the first state to record more than 5 million known coronavirus infections, according to the state dashboard Tuesday, which was delayed by the holiday weekend.The grim milestone, as reported by the California Department of Public Health, wasn’t entirely unexpected in a state with 40 million residents poised for a surge in new infections amid holiday parties and family gatherings forced indoors by a series of winter storms.The first coronavirus case in California was confirmed Jan. 25, 2020. It took 292 days to get to 1 million infections on Nov. 11 of that year, and 44 days from then to top 2 million.California’s caseload is also ahead of other large states. Texas had more than 4.4 million and Florida topped 3.9 million as of Sunday.California has recorded more than 75,500 deaths related to Covid-19.The state has fared far better than many other states that are dealing with a coronavirus surge, with areas in the Midwest and Northeast seeing the biggest jump in cases and hospitalizations amid frigid temperatures that have kept people indoors.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists California as a place with “high” transmission of the virus, along with nearly everywhere else in the country. But in the last week California averaged 16.4 new cases per 100,000 people, less than a third of the national rate.Meanwhile, coronavirus related hospitalizations have been rising slowly in California, up about 12% in the last 7 days to 4,401. That’s less than half as many as during the late summer peak and one-fifth of a year ago, before vaccines were widely available.On Tuesday, San Francisco announced it was canceling its New Year's Eve fireworks show because of the rising caseload, while Contra Costa County in the Bay Area announced that it would require masks to be worn in all public indoor places as of Wednesday. Previously, some vaccinated people had been allowed to remove them.The timeline of Covid-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travelers from China, where the outbreak began.The Feb. 6, 2020, death of a San Jose woman was the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community.On March 19, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding.It is unclear how many of the newly reported cases were attributed to the omicron coronavirus variant. Much about omicron remains unknown, including whether it causes more or less severe illness.Scientists say omicron spreads even easier than other coronavirus strains, including delta, and it is expected to become dominant in the US by early next year. Early studies suggest the vaccinated will need a booster shot for the best chance at preventing an omicron infection but even without the extra dose, vaccination still should offer strong protection against severe illness and death.With cases surging, the nation’s largest state-based health insurance marketplace urged more than 1.1 million uninsured Californians to sign up by Friday for subsidized coverage that would then start with the new year.Covered California said the average cost of an intensive care coronavirus hospitalization is $127,000, but estimated that 85% of those eligible for the state-brokered health insurance can get coverage free of charge, with government assistance.Those who sign up after Friday will have their coverage start on Feb. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-first-state-in-us-to-top-5-million-covid-19-cases-amid-omicron-surge-101640740387992.html

They had a warrant to seize relevant journalistic materials under a national security law enacted last year.The arrests happened early Wednesday and searches of their residences were underway, police said.Police did not identify those who were arrested but online outlet Stand News posted a video on Facebook of police officers at the home of a deputy editor, Ronson Chan, to investigate the alleged crime. Chan is also chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association.The arrests come as authorities crack down on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. Police charged former newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai with sedition on Tuesday. His Apple Daily newspaper shut down after its assets were frozen.They also follow the removal of sculptures and other artwork from university campuses last week. The works supported democracy and memorialized the victims of China's crackdown on democracy protesters at Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-arrest-6-journalists-for-sedition-101640740510117.html
29-12-2021||World||Omicron risk remains high; variant surpasses Delta in UK, US: 7 things WHO says||The World Health Organization has categorised the risks related to the Omicron variant as very high in its Covid-19 weekly epidemiological update released on Wednesday. South Africa, the country which first detected the variant on November 24, is seeing a decline in the number of Omicron cases, the WHO report said, possibly indicating that the surge is over for the time being.Here are 7 new observations made by the WHO in its weekly report:1. The overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high.2. Consistent evidence shows that the Omicron variant has a growth advantage over the Delta variant with a doubling time of 2-3 days3. Omicron cases are increasing rapidly and the variant has become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom and the United States.4. A decline in the incidence of cases has now been observed in South Africa.5. The rapid growth rate is likely to be a combination of both immune-evasion and intrinsic increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant6. Early data from the United Kingdom, South Africa and Denmark suggests there is a reduced risk of hospitalisation for the Omicron compared to the Delta variant.7. Preliminary data suggest that monoclonal antibodies may be less able to neutralise the Omicron variant.The overall number of Covid-19 cases increased by 11% in the week between December 20 and 26 as compared to the previous week, with the US region reporting the largest increase (39%), followed by the African region (7%). The South-East Asia region continued to report a decrease in the new cases, the WHO observed.Though Omicron is leading to fewer hospitalisation, Covid-19 hospitalisations in New Tork state are accelerating at a rate that hasn't been seen since the early days of the pandemic, reports said. On Tuesday the state said hospitalizations rose by 647 to 6,173, marking the largest daily increase since early April 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total number of New Yorkers hospitalized with the virus remains far below last year’s peak of almost 19,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-risk-remains-high-variant-surpasses-delta-in-uk-us-7-things-who-says-101640736393900.html

The patient had tested negative following an RT-PCR test three days ago after remaining in isolation.Rising Covid-19 cases across the country amid the Omicron outbreak, especially in major regions such as Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Karnataka, among others, have caused state governments to impose new restrictions and night curfew ahead of New Year.Rajasthan has mandated Covid-19 vaccination for entering public places from January 31 onwards. Similar moves have already been brought in by Haryana and Punjab, among others.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said a Covid-19 negative report or proof of double vaccination is mandatory for attending parties or entering restaurants in the coastal state.Besides, night curfews during the ongoing festive week have been announced by most state authorities.

Vajpayee threw a spanner in the works of the BJP on Thursday by announcing his decision to give up electoral politics and projecting outgoing party chief L.K. Advani and Pramod Mahajan as ‘Ram’ and ‘Lakshman’ who would lead the party in future.Vajpayee’s comments at a public rally at Shivaji Park do not amount to an endorsement of Rajnath Singh, widely perceived to be the leader to whom Advani will hand over the baton upon demitting office.His remarks couldn’t have come at a worse time for the party which is already rocked by sex tapes, internal rivalry and the cash-for-query scandal.Later, in an interaction with newsmen, Advani merely smiled when he was asked about Vajpayee’s comments about him and Mahajan. Advani said he came to know of Vajpayee’s decision to retire from electoral politics on Thursday morning.Vajpayee, however, is likely to remain leader of the NDA and of the BJP parliamentary party till the next Lok Sabha polls, due only in 2009.Senior party leaders and delegates to the conclave are likely to plead with him not to leave the party in a lurch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-december-30-2005-vajpayee-says-no-more-elections-for-him-101640796265591.html

He was 83.Das was 22 when he was posted at Lungla post near the China border when the assignment came his way. Narendra Chandra Das was a rifleman of the 9 Platoon of 5 Assam Rifles back then. “Late Havildar Naren Chandra Das was the lone surviving warrior of the Assam Rifles among a band of seven Bravehearts who had successfully escorted and accompanied His Holiness Dalai Lama to Indian Soil in 1959,” Assam Rifles director general Lt Gen PC Nair said in a message on his death.“His valiant deeds and indomitable warrior spirit continues to inspire the scores of young sentinels of the northeast. I, on behalf of the Assam Rifles family pray to Almighty God that the departed soul rests in everlasting peace,” the Assam Rifles chief said.“Guards of Assam Rifles Platoon no. 9 had brought the Dalai Lama from Zuthangbo and handed him over to five of us at Shakti. We brought him to Lungla from where he was escorted on his onward journey to Tawang by another group of guards,” Naren Chandra Das recalled after he came face-to-face with the Dalai Lama at an event in Assam’s Guwahati on April 2, 2017.The Tibetan spiritual leader thanked Das, and invited him as a guest of His Holiness at the Tibetan Government-in-Exile headquarters in Mcleodganj, Himachal Pradesh, the following year to an event commemorating the start of the Tibetan spiritual leader’s 60th year in exile and to thank India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-rifles-havildar-who-escorted-dalai-lama-in-india-in-1959-dies-laid-to-rest-101640796085976.html

This kind of approach is against the rule of law and may attract appropriate penal provisions as envisaged under law," Singh said, adding the SIT is still probing the case.It said the government had ordered a magisterial probe into the incident and all such persons making statements should have approached the inquiry officer with genuine evidence they have, for corroboration or contradiction."The SIT constituted in the instant case is still investigating the matter, all such persons are once again advised to provide any type of evidence if they have regarding the incident so that every aspect of investigation is covered and concluded on merit," the statement said.Earlier in the day, the father of Amir Magray, one of the four persons killed in the Hyderpora encounter in Srinagar, rejected the police probe which suggested that his son was a militant, and said he is moving the high court seeking the return of his body.The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) has said the police briefing was only a repetition of the "old story" and it does not even slightly give any objective picture of the incident. Demanding a judicial inquiry into the incident, it said there is a strong public perception that the civilians killed in the incident were made human shields by security forces.A Pakistani terrorist and three other persons were killed in Hyderpora on November 15 and police had claimed that all the slain men had links to militancy. The families of the three, alleging foul play, had said that they were innocent leading to a massive uproar in the Valley, prompting police to order the inquiry.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderpora-encounter-sit-warns-of-legal-action-for-speculative-remarks-101640792265741.html

29-12-2021||India||Defence ministry restricts import of 351 more items for ‘Make in India’ push||NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday announced curbs on the import of 351 systems and components under a staggered timeframe beginning December 2022 to boost indigenisation in defence manufacturing and to ensure foreign exchange savings of ₹3,000 crore a year.This was the third such list issued by the defence ministry in the past 16 months as part of efforts to make India a hub for developing and manufacturing military hardware. The ministry issued a separate list of 2,500 imported items that it said had already been indigenised. The curbs on the import of 351 items – including components such as a missile approach warning sensor, shells, propellants, electrical parts, missile containers, a torpedo tube launcher and a gun fire control system – will kick in over the next three years. The import of 172 systems and components will be stopped from December 2022, while curbs on another batch of 89 items will come into effect from December 2023. The import of a further 90 items will be stopped from December 2024. Once the restrictions take effect, these items can be procured only from Indian industries. “A positive indigenisation list of sub-systems/assemblies/sub-assemblies/components has been notified by Department of Defence Production, Ministry of Defence, as part of the efforts to achieve self-reliance in defence manufacturing and minimise imports by Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs),” an official statement said. “This Aatmanirbhar (self-reliance) initiative will save foreign exchange approximately equivalent to ₹3,000 cr every year,” it added. The defence ministry announced in August 2020 that India will stop importing 101 weapons and military platforms such as transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines, cruise missiles and sonar systems by 2024. A second list issued in May this year restricted the import of 108 more weapons and systems such as airborne early warning systems, tank engines, radars and next-generation corvettes. These measures are in addition to other steps taken by the government to boost defence manufacturing. In May 2020, the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit under the automatic route in the defence sector was hiked from 49% to 74%. In October, the government dissolved the four-decade-old Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and amalgamated 41 factories under seven new state-owned companies to manufacture defence hardware ranging from munitions to heavy weapons and vehicles. India is among the world’s largest arms importers, and the armed forces are expected to spend about $130 billion on defence purchases over the next five years. The government plans to reduce dependence on imported hardware and is backing domestic manufacturers to produce weapons and platforms that can be used by the Indian military and exported to other countries. The defence ministry has set a target for a turnover of $25 billion in defence manufacturing in the next five years, including exports worth $5 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-restricts-import-of-351-more-items-for-make-in-india-push-101640788224912.html

These dumps are located on public and private.Sawant said an estimated 10 to 20 million metric tonnes of low-grade iron ore was lying at different locations outside the mining leases, and could sustain mining activity in Goa for the next four to five years.“The state government has formulated a policy for regularisation of mining dumps on government and private land and related issues. Those who were valid lessees and who had paid the money to the government (as a penalty for illegally dumping on government land), will be allowed to export,” Sawant said.Back in 2013 the Goa government amended the Land Revenue Code to regularise iron ore dumps at locations outside the mines by paying a penalty. A total of ₹200 crore was collected back then.Sawant said those who paid the penalty will be allowed to export the ore under the new policy after paying royalty to the government and getting necessary approvals from authorities including the Indian Bureau of Mines, the body mandated to inspects mines to ensure regulations are followed.The government will take over mining dumps where the penalty wasn’t paid and auction the ore.The chief minister said the Centre’s policy allows for disposal of “overburden or waste rock mineral below the threshold value and which is generated during the course of mining or beneficiation of minerals or any minor mineral extracted along with the mineral for which the lease is granted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-help-resume-mining-says-goa-cm-on-new-policy-to-export-iron-ore-dumps-101640778323928.html

29-12-2021||India||A food delivery army is being prepped to cater to orders on New Year’s Eve!||If you tried to order in last New Year’s eve, you would remember the phenomenal delay there was on that fateful evening! Well, the night curfew and the sudden rise in number of Covid cases this year have ensured that a lot of us will be again ordering in food on New Year rather than heading out for dinner and drinks. This time, however, the restaurants, food delivery partners and even home chefs promise that the delivery is going to be a lot better.All hands on deckThe employees of food delivery partner Zomato will also be pitching in to deliver orders on time. “We have tried to predict and accommodate the influx of orders for the New Year’s eve. Last year we received more than 4,600 orders in a minute, and this year we expect it to be more. Each New Year, we are overwhelmed with the demand, which puts significant pressure on our delivery partners, restaurant partners and the system at large. This year, we have Zomans (our employees) volunteering to deliver orders and helping the customer support across chat, email and social media. This is beyond their regular work profile. Besides, we have always had emergency SOS services for our delivery partners in case of SOS support and road side assistance. We are also working with the authorities to ensure our delivery partners are equipped with the right road safety and Covid gear,” says a spokesperson from the company. Nothing like too many cooks!Some restaurants are focussing on increasing the number of chefs so as to accommodate the surge in orders that is preordained. “The night curfew does put the staff in a challenging situation. However, we have ensured that we are now competent enough to tackle the huge demand of orders, we have increased the number of chefs and staff to prepare the orders,” says Shyam Thakur, founder, MoMo King. And Jasleen Marwah, a Mumbai-based home chef who runs Namak Swaad Anusaar, says, “I have two chefs who will come in from Kashmir to meet the orders on New Year. With three of us, we will be able to manage. Also, we will close the orders much before, and start prepping on December 30. The final cooking will happen on December 31, so that we can accommodate everyone.” Cooking in batchesFor home cooks, the situation shall be very challenging as most of the food is made personally by them, in their kitchens. “Since I work alone, days like these do get overwhelming,” says Snigdha Sheel, a home chef from Dwarka, adding, “I’m sure the demand will be a lot this year due to the night curfew. So, I’ve decided to cook only limited meals, and that too in batches. I have a package, which has about five or six dishes, which will all come together as one meal. People can order these meals, and I’m not serving anything other than these meals for 31st. Also, all orders will be on first come basis, and I plan to not take more than 10 orders, to be able to deliver quality food while it’s hot.”Extended delivery hours“We have surplus staff for New Year’s eve. There’s a rush during a definite timeline window, right before the curfew starts and we always try to utilise our managers and stewards to help the kitchen team in packaging and processing those orders quickly in such situations,” says Alok Ranjan, founder, Gaon Restaurant. Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra from Massive Restaurants, which has eateries across India, adds: “We are retrofitting two kitchens to start delivery. Louis Burger will be geared up for serious increase in volumes and we are increasing delivery hours till 3am. We are also ramping up new cloud kitchen openings and are hopeful that at least two more will be operational before December 31, as they are near completion. We are also providing backups for order delays by hiring our own delivery partners.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-food-delivery-army-is-being-prepped-to-cater-to-orders-on-new-year-s-eve-101640774845156.html

These decisions are taken independently by the SPG without taking views of the protectee. "The widespread discussion on the security features of the protectee's car is not in national interest as it puts in public domain a lot of unnecessary detail. This only threatens the life of the protectee," the source added. Officials asserted that Modi has not given any preference on which cars to use and noted in this context that Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the past used Range Rovers which were actually procured for the then prime minister.Cars manufactured by BMW are among those used by the prime minister over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maybach-added-to-pm-modi-s-security-detail-routine-replacement-govt-sources-101640765007300.html

The family members had no idea about the money and after much difficulty, those underground bunkers were unearthed, witness Amit Dubey told ANI. The raids were concluded on Wednesday, reports said.During the raids, the agency seized ₹194.45 crores of cash, 23 kg gold and 600 kg sandalwood. Reports said Jain has admitted that the cash was related to the sale of goods without the payment of taxes. Jain has been sent to 14 days of judicial custody by a Kanpur court.Zakir Hussain, Additional Director of DGGI said, "We have concluded our 'panchnama'. We have recovered gold, handed it over to DRI, but the probe is on. The gold which was recovered in Kanpur is separate...here, we recovered about ₹19 crore cash. As per higher officials, this is the biggest cash recovery.""The statement of Peeyush Jain has been recorded wherein he has accepted that the cash recovered from the residential premises is related to the sale of goods without payment of GST," the agency said."The evidence collected during the searches conducted in the last five days are being investigated thoroughly to unravel the tax evasion," it added.The raid ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh grabbed eyeballs not only because of the huge amount of money, the photos of which went viral, but also Jain's alleged link with the Samajwadi Party. Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, however, said the agency raided "the wrong P Jain" and both are in the perfume business. The businessman who launched Samajwadi perfume is not Peeyush Jain, but Pushpraj Jain, Akhilesh said. "Due to the mistake of Digital India, it got its own businessman raided," Akhilesh said.PM Modi on Tuesday referred to the raids and said, "Boxes filled with notes have stumbled out. I was thinking they will say that this was also done by us. The people of Kanpur understand business and trade well. Before 2017, the perfume of corruption that they had sprinkled all over Uttar Pradesh is there for everyone to see."(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-in-underground-bunkers-raids-on-kannauj-businessman-conclude-101640758359235.html

The rise in the cases, according to this prediction, should have started by December 15.> The National Covid-19 Supermodel Committee projected that the third wave is expected to peak early next year. The members said the daily caseload is expected to increase once Omicron starts replacing Delta as the dominant variant.> South African doctor Angelique Coetzee who first identified the Omicron variant recently said India will see a surge in Covid cases, primarily driven by the Omicron variant but the infection will be mild. "India will see a surge in Omicron-driven COVID-19 cases and simultaneously there will be a high-positivity rate.

Assembly elections are due in the state in 2024.“Cast one crore votes to Bharatiya Janata Party and we will provide liquor for just ₹70. If we have more revenue left, then, will provide liquor for just ₹50,” Veerraju said while addressing a rally in Vijayawada on Tuesday, news agency ANI reported.The BJP is aiming to dislodge the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government, headed by Jagan Mohan Reddy, in the next assembly elections. The “Praja Agraha Sabha” (a meeting to express people’s anger) in Vijayawada was organised by Andhra Pradesh BJP where former Union minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar urged the people of the state to “put an end to the corrupt and destructive rule of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government” in 2024.He described the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and YSRCP as family-dominated parties, and said both indulged in massive corruption.Veeraraju, meanwhile, claimed that the BJP is the only party capable of pulling down the corrupt Jagan government. “We are confident of forming the next government in the state,” he said.The YSRCP had swept the 2019 assembly polls in the state, winning 151 of the 175 seats. The TDP could only manage to win 23 seats, while the BJP drew a blank.In 2014, Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP has emerged victorious by winning 102 seats. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s party was at number 2, and won 67 seats.Since taking over as chief minister, Jagan has reversed many policy decisions of the previous TDP government. He cancelled several infrastructure projects, took back land allotted to companies and in January 2020, cleared a proposal to have three capitals – Vishakhapatnam (executive), Amaravati (legislative) and Kurnool (judicial).The three-capital plan, however, got entangled in legal troubles and is hanging in thin air. The high court ordered status quo on the capitals, thereby stalling the government’s plan. The chief minister then withdrew the two bills on the three capitals in the state legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cast-1-crore-votes-to-party-get-liquor-at-rs-70-andhra-pradesh-bjp-chief-101640753978987.html

The army earlier rescued over 1,000 tourists stranded near the India-China border in eastern Sikkim on Sunday.“The weather was warm in Lachung till Tuesday evening. The weather changed suddenly and [the temperature] dipped below zero [degrees Celsius], resulting in massive snowfall since the early hours of Wednesday. This would surely attract more tourists,” said Bikash Tamang, a driver who ferries tourists.Residents said roads leading to tourist destinations such as Nathu La, Gurudongmar, Yumthang and Tsomgo lake were covered with snow and become slippery and dangerous to drive.In Sandakphu, the highest point in West Bengal, the temperature dropped below zero degrees Celsius. “Places such as Tiger Hill, one of the most popular places in Darjeeling to watch the sunrise and Mt Kancendzonga, receive snowfall.

The minister said his son did not do anything wrong, did not utter any unparliamentary word and the episode took place outside te House. Nitesh did not refer to anyone in particular, Narayan Rane said. The incident took place last week for which the Sena members have been seeking suspension of Nitesh Rane.Here is what happened:  #WATCH Video emerges showing BJP leader Nitesh Rane taunting Maharashtra min Aaditya Thackeray as he enters Vidhan Bhavan on December 23Shiv Sena's demand for Nitesh Rane's suspension from the Assembly led to brief adjournment of the session y'day (Video source unverified) pic.twitter.com/3qYfrd6UjkLast week, Nitesh Rane was sitting in the Vidhan Bhavan premises when Aaditya Thackeray was going inside the building. Nitesh Rane made 'meow' sound looking in the direction of Thackeray. Shiv Sena members demanded Nitesh Rane's suspension over the incident. "Aaditya Thackeray, being a dignified man, walked away ignoring Nitesh Rane. We will not tolerate the insult of our leader," Shiv Sena MLA Suhas Kande said.Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said in the Assembly that Nitesh Rane will be reprimanded for his comments. But suspending a member for an incident that happened outside the house is not right. BJP leader Chandrakant Patil too wondered why the incident that took place outside the Assembly was being discussed in the Assembly. "Did Nitesh Rane take any name?" Patil said.On Tuesday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said MLAs should maintain decorum and follow parliamentary protocols in the Assembly and Vidhan Bhavan premises. "We don't represent animals. Making fun of others and making sounds of animals is betrayal of the people's trust in you," Pawar said, referring to the 'meow' incident.Nitesh Rane has come under fire in an attempt to murder case. On December 18, Santosh Parab, a Sena functionary from Kankavli in Sindhudurg was attacked. Parab is a close associate of Sindhudurg District Cooperative Bank chairman Satish Sawant, who was defeated by Nitesh Rane in the 2019 assembly polls on the Kankavali seat. The district bank's election is slated for December 30. "Nitesh is being falsely implicated in a case. (IPC) Section 307 (attempt to murder) has been invoked in a case where the complainant had bruises. Nitesh was not there when the incident occurred,” Narayan Rane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-unparliamentary-word-narayan-rane-on-son-nitesh-rane-meowing-aaditya-thackeray-101640748314505.html

Hinduism is the union of various Indian cultures and traditions with diverse roots and no founder, while Hindutva is a homogenous racial-territorial category propagated by Savarkar, the post said.Comparing the origin of Hinduism and the Hindutva, the post says Hinduism is thousands of years old, while Hindutva was first proposed as a political idea in 1923 by Savarkar. Hinduism has many texts including the Vedas, the Puranas etc while Hindutva has one central political pamphlet, 'Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?" published in 1928. two years ago. Still relevant! @RahulGandhi @INCIndia https://t.co/FwTtzkFCnsThe post shared by Tharoor, the writer of Why I am a Hindu, says, unlike Hinduism, Hindutva is monolithic, more like Islam and Christianity. Hindutva is exclusive and the practitioners actively hate and fear other religions and oppose the traditional secular Hindu way of life.Also Read | Those who bow to PM’s wrong decisions follow Hindutva: Rahul Gandhi at Cong meetThe post comes amid the ongoing controversy over Hindu versus Hindutva. Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said people who bow before the wrong decisions of PM Modi are the ones who follow Hindutva ideology. “Those who believe in the ideology of Hindutva bow before anyone — they bowed before the British and they bow before money because there is no truth in their hearts,” Rahul Gandhi said.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said the country needs to understand the Hindu versus Hindutva debate started by Rahul Gandhi. “Rahul Gandhi started a debate on Hindu versus Hindutva, and there is a need to understand its meaning… The crux was that on one hand, there is a Hindu whose great values have been there for centuries, whose expressions are of love and brotherhood and the forces which are doing politics in the name of Hindutva, their becoming Hindu is pseudo, they are fake Hindus,” Gehlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-shares-old-post-of-hinduism-versus-hindutva-says-still-relevant-101640743357158.html

The second is that the safety follow-up should be extended to nine months, ANI reported.On December 10, the committee reviewed the data provided by Biological E, which had presented its revised clinical trial protocol for the conduct of phase 3 clinical trial for the administration of booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine containing receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen of SARS-CoV-2.Corbevax, a two-dose vaccine, is India's first indigenously developed protein subunit vaccine which has been included in India's arsenal of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on Tuesday after it got the DCGI nod.

The police are verifying the complaint before taking further action.”City police have also issued “strict warning” to the organisers of Tuesday’s event against any hate speech.“Police have given stern warning to the organisers of the event against any similar incident,” said police superintendent Swatantra Kumar Singh. “We don’t want any disturbance in the law and order situation in the holy town before elections,” he told reporters.

India is a land of story tellers. If you see Marvel comics, its fictitious but in India, people can provide real life stories.”Assembly polls are scheduled to be held in UP in 2022.Hailing the work carried out by PM Modi is his consitutency of Varanasi, Thakur said: “Kashi has developed highways, airports and ports. PM has also created history by revamping the corridor of Vishwanath dham.”This, Thakur said, has brought streams of visitors to one of India’s oldest cities.This will not just boost religious tourism, but also augment local industries, the minister added.

He said those who confront challenges are Hindus and those who run away from problems out of fear are the ones who follow Hindutva.“Those who believe in the ideology of Hindutva bow before anyone — they bowed before the British and they bow before money because there is no truth in their hearts,” he said, virtually addressing the concluding session of the three-day Congress training camp on Tuesday.Also Read | India a country of Hindus, not Hindutvavadis: Rahul GandhiHe also said a prime minister from the Congress would have resigned had China occupied Indian territory “whereas the RSS people are engaged in hiding the violation of India’s borders by China under the Modi regime”.He alleged that those associated with the RSS are spreading hatred and fear in the country, and said the Congress will fight this effort and not step back an inch. “This is our Laxman Rekha (strict boundary, a classical allusion to the Ramayana,” he said. “The BJP’s Laxman Rekha is power and for the sake of power, they have always been changing the Laxman Rekha of their ideology, whereas Congress’s Laxman Rekha is truth and we Congressmen stand where there is truth,” said Rahul.Sharing his experience of visiting Naini jail, where Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru was imprisoned during freedom struggle for over a decade, he said when Nehru was released from the jail, he in the visitor book thanked the jailers as he learned a lot during his imprisonment.There was no hatred and revenge anywhere in the statement of Nehru against those who imprisoned him, whereas Veer Savarkar in his book mentioned that he was most pleased when five of his companions together beat up a Muslim youth with sticks, he alleged.“All religions including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are the paths to attain the truth. For us, religion is the way to attain truth, but the religion of Hindutva is to make our religion a means of attaining power,” said Gandhi.BJP spokesperson Mukeshj Pareek said Rahul Gandhi has made baseless statements against RSS and Hindutva to misguide people. The RSS is known for serving the country and the society, and does not require any certificate.He said Gandhi, “with his half knowledge about Hindutva”, is indirectly seeking political mileage. “It is not hidden from anyone that Gandhi and his party believe in appeasement and accordingly behave like that”.Pareek said baseless charges on Veer Savarkar shows their narrow mindset. Praising Congress leaders, especially Indira Gandhi have set records of toppling elected governments, and he should also speak about them, he said.
29-12-2021||India||Hyderpora encounter: Businessman was used as human shield by Pakistani terrorist, says SIT||A Special Investigation Team (STI) of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday ruled out any foul play by security forces in the November 15 Hyderporaencounter, in which three civilians were killed, claiming that one of the deceased was killed by a foreign terrorist while the other died after he was used as a “human shield” by the extremists.Deputy inspector general of police Sujit Kumar, who is heading the SIT, said businessman Altaf Ahmad Bhat died after he was used as a “human shield” by Pakistani terrorist Bilal Bhai alias Hyder, who was also killed in the encounter with security forces. Bhat (48), Mudasir Gul (43) and Amir Magray (in his 20s), were killed along with two terrorists – one foreign and one local – in the encounter in Hyderpora area of Srinagar last month. While police claimed that the civilians were over ground workers (OGWs) of terrorism, the deceased’s families alleged that they were used by security forces as human shields during the gunbattle.Police had buried the bodies in Handwara, around 70 km away from Hyderpora, without the participation of their families. The bodies of Bhat and Gul were, however, handed over to the families after continuous protests. Addressing reporters here, DIG Kumar said: “The house owner was used as a human shield by Pakistani terrorist Bilal bhai. Mudasir Gul was killed by the same terrorist.”Providing further details, Kumar said that CCTV footage showed that Gul would travel in his vehicle along with the terrorist who also used to stay in his office.“We have found out that Amir was frequently visiting Bandipora. Why would someone visit Bandipora so frequently when he (his family) had fled that place in 2008?” the DIG said. The SIT head alleged that Bhat’s family did not provide any satisfactory replies about the tenants in the building during the probe. To this, Saima Bhat, Altaf’s niece, said he was the sole owner of his property, so only he was aware about certain documents like rent deed and mode of payment.Taking note of the police’s briefing, the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) -- an alliance of political parties in Kashmir -- said it was only a repetition of the “old story” and demanded a judicial enquiry into the incident. “Today’s press briefing of J-K police about last month’s Hyderpora tragic incident is only a repetition of the old story. It does not even slightly give any objective picture of this shocking incident,” PAGD spokesman Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said in a statement.He said the statement seemed to be a “concocted cover-up story”.“It will not suffice the legitimate concerns of the people at large and family of the slain victims.”“PAGD firmly believes that nothing short of a credible judicial probe will clear the doubts. The administration must, without any further delay, order a timebound judicial probe,” Tarigami said.The Jammu & Kashmir government also received the magisterial inquiry report on the encounter, details of which are yet to be revealed. On November 17, Lt Governor Manoj Sinha had ordered a probe into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderpora-encounter-businessman-was-used-as-human-shield-by-pakistani-terrorist-says-sit-101640716981669.html
29-12-2021||India||BJP holds rally against Jagan’s ‘corrupt rule’||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday called on the people to “put an end to the corrupt and destructive rule of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government” in the 2024 assembly elections. Addressing the “Praja Agraha Sabha” (a meeting to express people’s anger), organised by the BJP state unit in Vijayawada, Javadekar described the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) as family-dominated parties, and said both indulged in massive corruption and cheated the people with false promises over the years. “The people are witnessing a destructive rule of the YSRCP government. The chief minister has not fulfilled any of the promises he had made (in his 2019 election manifesto). What he is doing right now is renaming the Central government schemes and claiming them as his own by pasting his government stickers. The so-called Jagananna housing colonies are Narendra Modi colonies,” the former Union minister said. He also accused the Jagan government of ruining the state’s economy. “Before elections, he had promised to implement total prohibition in the state, but in reality, he is running the government on the revenue obtained from liquor sales,” he said. Javadekar pointed out that he had granted all the permissions to Polavaram major irrigation project on Godavari River when he was the Union environment and forest minister. “But the project is yet to be completed even after seven years,” he criticised. About the Amaravati capital region, Javadekar reminded that it was during his term, he got the forest lands transferred to the capital. “But the capital city project is in limbo, and the TDP and YSRCP were indulging in blame game over the capital,” he criticised. Alleging that corruption has reached its peak under the YSRCP regime, the BJP leader said, the ruling party leaders were making big money through smuggling of red sanders, referring to the latest Telugu movie Pushpa. He reminded that the Jagan government had disbanded a special investigation team constituted to probe into the red sanders smuggling. “There are many leaders in Andhra Pradesh who are out on bail in connection with various cases. They would soon go to jail,” he warned. Javadekar expressed regrets that there was no protection to the Hindu religious institutions in the Jagan regime. “While the Centre has taken up the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya in a big way, the Ram temple in Vizianagaram district was vandalised and a chariot of Lord Narasimha Swamy in Antarvedi in East Godavari district was burnt to ashes,” he alleged. During the rally, state BJP president Somu Veerraju blamed the TDP and YSRCP governments for the lack of development in Andhra Pradesh. He claimed that the BJP is the only party capable of pulling down the corrupt Jagan government. “We are confident of forming the next government in the state,” he said. Rajya Sabha member and BJP leader G V L Narasimha Rao said the TDP had no future in Andhra Pradesh and the YSRCP failed miserably to govern the state. He alleged that the Jagan government was diverting all the funds granted by the Centre to unproductive schemes. BJP leaders Y S Chowdary, C M Ramesh, Daggubati Purandeshwari, Kanna Lakshminarayana and others participated in the rally. Reacting to the BJP leaders’ allegations in the rally, senior YSRC leader and minister for municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayana said the BJP had hardly any existence in the state, and the meeting was only trying to prove its identity. “It appears the BJP leaders have woken up just now, two and a half years after we formed the government. If there are any lapses on our part, let them point out, instead of making wild allegations,” he said. Senior TDP leader and lawmaker Payyavula Kesav also hit back, saying that the BJP rally was only to mislead the people. “The BJP leaders in AP are working under the direction of Jagan Mohan Reddy. In the last two and a half years, they have not responded to any of the atrocities being perpetrated by the Jagan government against the people in general and TDP in particular,” he alleged. He demanded that the Central agencies should probe into the witch-hunt of political rivals in the hands of the Jagan government.

The additional public prosecutor in the plea said certified phone call details will weaken its arguments and sought original records from mobile service providers. The prosecution also wanted to examine some of the witnesses, including film producers Anto Joseph and Balachandrakumar. It also said that it wants to re-examine nine witnesses and hear some of the new witnesses in the case. It contended that there is no merit in denying the opportunity to bring more evidence in the case sticking on to mere technical reasons. The court will hear a fresh petition in the case after the vacation. Dileep is the eighth accused in the case. The victim -- an actor who worked in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films -- was abducted and allegedly molested inside her car for two hours by some of the accused, who had forced their way into the vehicle on the night of February 17, 2017, and later escaped in a busy area. The entire act was filmed by some of the accused to blackmail the actress. There are ten accused in the case and initially, police arrested seven people. Dileep was arrested subsequently and let out on bail later.During the attack, the first accused Pulsar Suni, involved in many criminal cases in the port city, reportedly told the victim that he was given a quotation and was forced to do this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-accepts-plea-issues-notices-to-all-accused-in-actor-sexual-assault-case-101640716741736.html
29-12-2021||India||Marina Beach accessible to differently abled now||People with disabilities were able to enjoy the sea closely on Tuesday after Chennai municipal corporation, with the help of disability rights activists, constructed a temporary pathway from the main road up to the shore at the Marina beach, making it wheelchair accessible.Four beach wheelchairs have been provided by the city corporation since 2019 and the Tamil Nadu tourism department has also lent its amphibious wheelchair from the blue flag certified Kovalam beach to enable people with disabilities to float in, officials said.The temporary pathway is made every December to mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which falls on December 3. Last year this was stalled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and this year it was delayed due to incessant rains in November. Civic officials are working on making this a permanent facility by using materials that are compliant with CRZ norms.“This is just amazing,” said Preethu Jayaprakash, a wheelchair user, who has spinal muscular atrophy. “We are also getting a chance to see the sea from up close.”“After a long wait in exclusion and isolation, children and adults with disabilities Chennai could go to the beach, look up at the blue sky, take a breath of fresh air, go up to the waters, touch the waves, relax, rejuvenate and laugh in the outdoors,” said Smitha Sadasivan, member, Disability Rights Alliance (DRA). “This pathway brings in a strong air of hope that this will soon materialise into a permanent pathway and that’s what GCC Commissioner (Gagandeep Singh Bedi) too assured today.”DRA in Tamil Nadu has been working with the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) since 2016 to execute a permanent pathway for two beaches, Marina, which is considered the second-longest in the world and Elliot’s beach.“A temporary path made of wood has been laid for 200 meters from the point of the road access up to the beach,” said an official of the GCC. “We are exploring materials that we can use to make this a permanent structure without damaging the beach’s ecology.”Based on a request from the community, the temporary arrangement has been extended up from January 3 up to 16 by the minister for municipal administration, K N Nehru, said a statement from the GCC. Besides Nehru, a couple of other ministers, MPs and MLAs also inaugurated the access to the beach on Tuesday.

The police said the girls, aged 15 and 16, were staying at the man’s house in Amabalawayal on rent for the last five years. The girls reportedly told police that in recent months they defaulted on their rent and the man used to harass them regularly. No formal complaint has been registered in the case so far, the police said. “There is no contradiction in their statement so far. We will question them separately and take the statement of the family of the victim. Neighbours told us there used to be heated arguments between them. We will get a clear picture only after questioning them in detail,” said the officer who did not want to be identified. A senior police officer of the district said the incident happened around 11 am when the man came to their room after his wife left the house. The girls told the police that there was a scuffle when he tried to sexually assault their mother, and they attacked him after getting hold of an axe. They said that it was an act of self-defence, and they got panic after he died, the police said. The police said they tried to cut the body into pieces, but when their attempts failed, they dumped the body in a nearby well, which was not functioning. Around 3 pm, they went to the police station and narrated the entire incident and surrendered. Later, the police recovered the body from the well. The body was sent for post-mortem, and other details will be known once they get the report. Minor children will be produced in a juvenile court on Wednesday, and the mother will be produced in a local court, the police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-minors-kill-man-over-sexual-assault-surrender-kerala-police-101640716621593.html
29-12-2021||India||Training material on LGBTQIA+ pulled for review: NCERT to HC||Chennai: The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has informed the Madras high court that the training material on the LGBTQIA+ community for teaching staff was taken down after being uploaded on the website because they had not followed a due procedure of review and not due to any external pressure.The Union ministry of social justice and empowerment also informed the court that they are “actively working” towards setting up at least one Garima Greh in every state and union territory for destitute transgender persons.Under the Garima Greh scheme, the transgender persons get a secure living space and care.Justice N Anand Venkatesh was hearing the case on December 23 pursuant to his landmark judgment passed on June 7 to ensure that the transgender community, including those in consensual relationships, was protected from various quarters, including police harassment. The case pertained to a lesbian couple moving court seeking protection as they were in a consensual relationship and complained of being harassed by their parents who had filed FIRs with local police saying that their daughters were missing.In the previous hearing held on December 6, the judge said that NCERT rightly posted material on its website to sensitise teachers but “in a very shocking development”, it was taken down within hours of its publication due to pressure from some quarters.In its response the educational body has said that the Department of Gender Studies, NCERT, proposed a programme, tiled ‘Development of Training Material for Teacher and Teacher Educators on Transgender Concerns in School Education’, which was approved by the Councils’ Academic and Programme Advisory Committees.A draft was ready in July. “As an academic exercise, every material developed by the NCERT undergoes various stages before being finalised and put in public domain,” the extract from NCERT’s response says, adding that every material is tried out with the target groups, reviewed by different stakeholders, inviting comments and suggestions on the draft.“Since this is a training material for teachers and teacher educators for sensitisation on such an important societal concern, it needs to be in a desired format, to be tried out through consultation with schools, teachers and teacher educators to take feedback before finalising it,” NCERT said. “Though the training material has been removed from the NCERT website, NCERT has already started the process of its internal and external review of the training programme.” NCERT plans to rollout the training module by the next academic session.Court: Cover entire community under Garima GrehOther government departments, such as the state’s legal services, also submitted a status report on the progress made in moving towards being more sensitive and inclusive to the trangsgender community. The Union ministry of social justice and empowerment informed the court that they are “actively working” towards setting up at least one Garima Greh in every state and union territory for destitute transgender persons.“The benefit under the scheme has to be extended to the entire LGBTQIA+ community and must not be confined only to transgender persons,” the court said, pointing out that transgender are only a fraction of the entire community.LGBTQIA+ is an abbreviation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual and others.“Only then can it be considered as a wholesome and non-discriminative welfare scheme benefitting persons who otherwise are being marginalised in the society. The Ministry has to bear in mind that persons from the LGBTQIA+ community as such do not have any support from their family or from the society at large. Therefore, the welfare schemes provided by the Government are their only ray of hope.”These shelter homes are currently present in Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, West Bengal and Rajasthan and are maintained by transgender community-based organisations.State to draft glossary of terms to address communityThe court in its order copy also included words and expressions in Tamil and English which the media can use to address the LGBTQIA + community. Stating that the list is illustrative and not exhaustive, the court said, “There must be a beginning where persons belonging to this community are addressed in a more dignified manner.”The court directed the additional advocate general to forward the list to the state government so that a standardised prospective glossary can be drawn up. “Once the Government publishes the same, it will have more force and will be easier to implement,” the court said. “If these words and expressions are used regularly, it will become a common practice and that will pave the way for a dignified identity for persons belonging to this community.”The court expected the government to submit this before the next date of hearing posted for February 18.

The newly eligible children will be only given Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Personnel on election duty in poll-bound states will be treated as front line workers and will be eligible to receive a third dose, the ministry said in its statement.Also Read | Personnel deployed in poll-bound states eligible for precaution dose: GovtIndia has expanded its vaccination programme to include most teenagers from 3 January, and allowed a third dose to health and front line workers, and senior citizens with co-morbidities, from 10 January. The latest advisory provides operational details to implement this.Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written a letter to the states to familiarize them with the process.“Eligibility of such beneficiaries for the precaution dose will be based on the date of administration of 2nd dose as recorded in the CoWIN system -- completion of nine months i.e. 39 weeks from the date of administration of second dose,” Bhushan wrote. “CoWIN will send reminder messages to all those eligible for precaution dose, which will be reflected in digital vaccination certificates.”Since Covaxin will be administered to the 15 to 18 year old cohort, the central government will ensure additional doses of the Bharat Biotech vaccine is sent to all states and Union territories, the health secretary said.“Union Government will share the supply schedule of ‘Covaxin’ with all the States and UTs in the next few days,” he said. “Potential beneficiaries can either register themselves on CoWIN from the 1st of January, 2022 or avail of a walk-in registration when vaccination commences from the 3rd of January. Those with a birth year of 2007 or before will be eligible for vaccination under this category.”States have been advised to ensure orientation of vaccinators on jabbing the eligible children.“To avoid the mixing up of vaccines during administration, separate CVCs (covid vaccination centres), separate session sites, separate queue (if at same session where adult vaccination is ongoing) and separate vaccination team (if at same session site) are to be strived for,” the health ministry said. “States/UTs are also advised to share their requirement of vaccine doses through district wise estimation of beneficiaries using CoWIN. They are to publicize sessions where vaccination will be available for 15-18 years age groups. Sufficient vaccines will be provided to states to cover these beneficiaries.”Children taking the shot will have to remain under observation for half an hour to monitor adverse effects, the same as all eligible people. They will be given the second dose after 28 days.States were advised to form two separate vaccination teams at every vaccination centre to avoid confusion in administration of the right vaccine.The health secretary made a special mention of personnel to be deployed on election duty in the five poll-bound states — Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur — who need to treated as front line workers as they are at high risk of catching the disease.“Personnel to be deployed in election duty in poll-bound states will also be included in the category of front line workers,” Bhushan wrote in his letter to the states.
29-12-2021||India||Urdu poet’s name changed to ‘Akbar Prayagraj’ on UP site due to ‘error’||The suffixes of renowned Urdu poets were changed from “Allahabadi” to “Prayagraj” on the website of the Uttar Pradesh Higher Education Services Commission on Tuesday, prompting officials to claim the portal was hacked. The district and city of Allahabad were renamed as Prayagraj in 2018 by the Yogi Adityanath government. The name of Urdu poet Syed Akbar Hussain, popularly known as Akbar Allahabadi, was changed to Akbar Prayagraj on the website of the UPHESC, an autonomous body under the state government. The ‘Allahabadi’ suffix of all writers or poets was changed to ‘Prayagraj’ on the portal. These include poets Rashid Allahabadi and Tegh Allahabadi (1930-1970) on the list of Urdu poets from the city. They were listed as Tegh Prayagraj and Rashid Prayagraj, respectively. “Akbar Prayagraj is a noted modern Urdu poet, and Nooh Narwi, Tegh Prayagraj, Shabnam Naqvi and Rashid Prayagraj have their origin in Prayagraj,” said the website’s “About Prayagraj” section. UPHESC secretary Vandana Tripathi said the error in the information came to light on Tuesday and a correction was now being made through the agency that designed the website and manages it for the body. She reiterated that the “name change” was an inadvertent error. Senior officials blamed the discrepancy on “mischievous elements”. “The commission has made no changes on its website in this regard. The information has been given on the site by some mischievous elements. It is being amended accordingly. This act of mischievous elements is being investigated by the cyber cell and strict legal action will be taken against those responsible,” said Shivji Malviya, deputy secretary, UPHESC. Some literary figures in Prayagraj criticised the development. Noted writer and poet Imtiyaz Ahmad Ghazi called it a major “error. “No one has the right to change the name of any individual. This should be corrected immediately,” he said.

The voucher code can be received on the feature phone also. The students will be able to redeem e-RUPI at the identified colleges or institutes for the intended purpose of fees payment, NCPI said in a release.For redeeming e-RUPI, the identified institutes will scan the QR code or SMS string displayed by the students using an Application or POS machine, and this process will remove the requirement of any physical token delivery for the students to avail of the scholarship, it said.“e-RUPI is indeed a very powerful tool for governments to use as it allows direct transfer of the benefits to the targeted beneficiary, with safety and security. The instrument ensures that the beneficiary gets the benefit as per the guidelines of the scheme. Under this initiative, each transaction is mapped with the beneficiary and the institution ensuring that the e-Voucher can be redeemed by the college where the student has enrolled,” Additional Chief Secretary, DPAR (e-governance) Rajiv Chawla said.The Karnataka government has on-boarded around 176 schemes of 35 departments of the state government on the Direct Benefit Transfer Platform.Following the successful implementation of this pilot project, the state is examining the use of e-RUPI Voucher in other schemes such as seed distribution, fertiliser distribution, micro irrigation schemes, issue of laptops to students, and Imparting skilled training, the release said.“We believe e-RUPI is a revolutionary initiative in the direction of ensuring a convenient and leak-proof delivery of schemes. This is a win-win for both students and colleges. While students receive the voucher, they can redeem it only for payment of fees to colleges/Institutes,” NPCI Chief of Products Kunal Kalawatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/erupi-payment-mode-on-anvil-for-students-in-karnataka-govt-scholarship-programme-101640716203962.html
29-12-2021||India||Bengaluru Commercial Street undergoes revamp 2nd time in 5 months||Redeveloped at a cost of ₹5.5 crore under the Smart City Project, Commercial Street, a prominent shopping destination in Bengaluru, was the last infrastructure project BS Yediyurappa inaugurated in July while he was the chief minister. But the main road began showing signs of damage just a day after the inauguration and it was repaired two months later, which HT had reported. Now, within a span of five months, the street is being renovated for the third time – cobblestones will be removed and a concrete road will be white-topped. The commercial centre in the central business district was developed by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. (BSCL) and the work began in May 2020. Despite several deadlines, the work progressed at a slow pace. However, with white-topping now being taken up, traders are hopeful of their businesses picking up at least in 2022. “The problems started just a day after it was inaugurated (in July). The next day itself, digging of the road began for repair. By then they had been repairing the road for more than six months and it had affected our businesses. We put up with it because it would help us in the long run, but after the work was done, they are digging up again. There is no planning whatsoever and what about the waste of money,” said Rajesh Jain, one of the shopkeepers on the Commercial Street. According to BBMP officials, the cobblestones were replaced after revenue and city in-charge minister R Ashok, during an inspection on August 14, ordered the contractor to replace them due to bad quality. BSCL managing director Rajendra Cholan said the technical committee and the project management consultant, who inspected the quality of the cobblestones, suggested replacement. “They found that the colour of the tiles was fading, and the tiles couldn’t handle the pressure of heavy vehicular movement. So, the decision has been taken to white-top the road,” he said. “There won’t be any extra cost for the government as the cost would covered under the original budget.” Sanjay Motwani, president of the Bengaluru Commercial Association, said traders were consulted before digging up the road for the redevelopment. “The tiles were not able to handle the traffic, so it was a good decision to have a concrete road. We are hopeful that the work will be finished at the earliest,” he said. However, a trader said the pace of work is slow. “This work began in 2020. They inaugurated it, then dug it up and even now the work is going on. No matter what the government says, this project has been a disaster. It is not just a concern of the shopkeepers but people are suffering. And so much money has been spent on this,” said a shopkeeper who didn’t want to be named. Rohan Menezes, a graphic designer and commuter, said traffic jams on the road have been a big problem. “The work has been going on this road for months now. Because the work has been going on this street for so many months and a lot of people come here to shop, traffic slows down on this street. This always leads to traffic pile-ups and adjacent roads getting jammed. I have to take a road next to the commercial street to get home but I’m stuck in traffic because there is a traffic pile-up on commercial street,” said Menezes.

The witness, who is related to Lt Col Prasad Purohit, one of the accused in the case, was declared hostile by the prosecution as he retracted his earlier statement and became the 15th witness to turn hostile. Till now, the prosecution has examined around 220 witnesses. The witness, whose identity was not revealed, told the Special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court that he was threatened by ATS officers Param Bir Singh (who later became Mumbai police commissioner) and deputy commissioner of police, who were then posted with the Maharashtra ATS. “They told me our story is ready you just have to take names of people we tell you. They had even threatened me, if I don’t take the names, will have to face consequences. They had detained me for several days,” the witness told the court while he was cross-examined by Purohit’s counsel. The witness told the court that five names were given to him and he was asked to mention them in his statement. “You can lodge a complaint against the officers if you were tortured. Do you need police protection?” judge Prashant R Sitre asked the witness. Special NIA public prosecutor Avinash Rasal pointed out to the court that the witness never lodged a complaint about being tortured by the agency. The witness earlier told the Maharashtra ATS that he was associated with Abhinav Bharat, a right-wing group whose name has been allegedly linked to the blast conspiracy. He also said that he arranged several programmes with Purohit to attract young people and even took an oath to form a Hindu nation. On September 29, 2008, six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Nashik’s Malegaon town, located about 200 km from Mumbai. The accused in the case include Lok Sabha member Pragya Thakur, lieutenant colonel Prasad Purohit, Sudhakar Dwivedi, major (retired) Ramesh Upadhyay, Ajay Rahirkar, Sudhakar Chaturvedi and Sameer Kulkarni, all of whom are out on bail.The trial in the 2008 case is being conducted before NIA special judge PR Sitre and began on November 2, 2018. The prosecution has submitted a list of around 286 witnesses that include doctors, police officials, forensic experts and witnesses. On October 30, 2018, the court framed charges against all the seven accused for terror activities, criminal conspiracy and murder. The accused face trial under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). HT tried to reach out to Param Bir Singh for a comment but could not get one immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malegaon-blast-was-forced-by-ats-to-implicate-yogi-rss-leaders-says-witness-101640715661449.html

Delhi is dependent on the river Yamuna, the second largest tributary of the Ganga, for its domestic, industrial and agricultural needs. Yamuna, being one of the sacred rivers in the country, is often the site of rituals and rites. Last rites of the dead are often performed at its banks, and the practice of immersion of idols is among the major reasons why the river is so polluted.
