As many as 15 million people in Maharashtra are yet to take even a single dose of the vaccine, while the state’s full vaccination or the two-dose coverage has reached 48%, which is below India’s average of 50%. The state’s target adult population is 91.5 million. By Tuesday evening, the state had administered over 120 million doses - more than 76 million people had received at least one dose and 43 million people had received both the doses, according to the CoWin dashboard. The need for vaccination has been repeatedly stressed upon by medical experts in the light of the emergence of the highly mutated Omicron variant. A pool of unvaccinated population can be a reservoir for the virus and its transmission, warned experts. “Clusters of the unvaccinated population will act as a driver of the transmission,” said virologist Dr T Jacob John. “It’s not good news if a state has a large pool of unvaccinated population, in addition to the below 18 population that is not yet eligible for the vaccines. The virus is constantly looking for susceptible hosts and such a pool can lead to a surge in cases,” he said. According to John, the state government should leave no stone unturned to vaccinate people with first doses, get people to take their second doses on time and start thinking about booster doses and vaccinations for the below 18 population. Barring three districts- Nandurbar, Nanded and Beed- all other districts have achieved first dose coverage above 70%. The threat of the Omicron variant has also driven many people to take their shots, said health officials. For Maharashtra to achieve the year-end target, the state will have to administer 625,000 first doses every day till December 31. “The pace of the vaccination has picked up since the past 10 days and we have been administering nearly one million doses daily,” said the state’s immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai. “About 65% of the daily doses are first doses. We have directed all field health workers to keep visiting the homes of people who are yet to be vaccinated and ensure that they take the jabs. We are also setting up call centres in districts to send reminders to people who have missed out on their second doses,” he said. “People must understand that vaccines may not offer 100% protection but in case one contracts the infection, the vaccine will definitely lessen the severity of the disease,” said Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15-million-yet-to-get-a-jab-in-state-101638901754007.html

Anshu Awasthi, a UP Congress spokesman, said: “It was the Congress government that had built the Gorakhpur fertiliser factory, but BJP government scrambled to take credit for it and is now spreading false propaganda through advertisements even as the farmers were queuing up for fertilisers and were being run over by vehicles (referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident of September 3). In 2022 UP Assembly polls people will reduce BJP to below 50 seats”. “This factory, was commissioned by the then Prime minister Indira Gandhi on April 30, 1968. It was one of the five units of the Fertilisers Corporation of India (FCI) and had employed lakhs of people directly and indirectly. But the anti-people and anti-farmer government of BJP at the centre announced the closure of the factory on July 18, 2002. Not just this, the BJP government at the centre then had closed five other fertilisers factories--in Bilki Sindri (Jharkhand), Thalchar (Odisha), Ramagundam (Telangana), Korba (Chattisgarh) and also the Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation Limited factories in Durgapur, Haldia, and Barauni--all the factories established in Congress regimes”, said Awasthi. Awasthi claimed in 2008, the Congress-led UPA-1 government had initiated the process to restart all those fertiliser factories and had even waived off loans and interest of ₹10,644 crore on them. Fact fileThe fertilizer factory of Gorakhpur was started on 20 April 1968 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It operated till 1990 until an accident halted the factory’s functioning. On 10 June 1990, there was a sudden leak of ammonia gas in the factory. An engineer was killed in this incident. For decades there had been demands for reopening the factory.

07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC to govt: Does religious panel have to look into minuscule issues?||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said there is no clarity as to whether the religious committee, constituted by the lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, is required to look into the removal of encroachments that are of minuscule nature, while hearing a plea over the removal of a makeshift temple at south Delhi’s Defence Colony.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a plea by a resident of the area who has sought to remove the encroachment, prima facie agreed with the petitioner’s counsel who submitted that once the authorities have taken a stand to demolish a structure, a different view cannot be taken by sending the matter to the religious committee.“There is no clarity as to whether the religious committee, purportedly constituted under the orders of the L-G, is required to examine encroachment of such minuscule nature merely because certain idols are placed on the spot. There is also merit in submission by the senior counsel for the petitioner that once the respondent had undertaken before this court that steps were being taken to demolish the structure, a different view cannot be taken,” the judge said.It also asked the home department of the Delhi government to file a report in this regard, saying before passing any order, it has to peruse the file so that no untoward situation is created later on.The court directed the station house officer (SHO) of the area concerned to depute an officer for 24 hours at the site and furnish a report with details of visitors to the structure, including those who collect offerings made by passersby.Viraht Saini, a resident of Defence Colony, sought the removal of the makeshift temple in front of his property, claiming that it obstructed his right of way. The plea said during the Covid-19 pandemic, someone had built the structure illegally on the pavement of Bhishma Pitamah Marg, right in front of his house.The plea also claimed that taking advantage and shelter of the illegal construction, people gather there and resort to rowdiness and gambling.In October, the Delhi government had told the court that it will demolish the alleged encroachment.However, the court, during the proceedings, noted that the matter has now been referred to the religious committee and since the government has not given any clearance for the demolition, the counsel representing Delhi government was not in a position to state anything.The judge also pulled up the additional SHO of the area who was present in the court and said it was because of his laxity that the situation had arisen.On a specific query from the court, the police officer said it was a small structure, situated on the roadside, under a tree. He also submitted that there was no specific date to ascertain when the structure came up. He added that a “new look” has been given to the structure by painting it. “Beat constable kya karte hai? Koi bhi kisi ke niche (under the tree) kuch bhi laga lega? (What does a beat constable do? Can anyone erect a structure anywhere they want?),” the court said.The matter will be heard next on December 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-to-govt-does-religious-panel-have-to-look-into-minuscule-issues-101638901516505.html
07-12-2021||Pune||Health dept paper leak: Five more including Latur health dept admin officer arrested||PUNE: The Pune police cyber cell on Tuesday arrested five persons including Latur health department’s chief admin officer for their suspected role in the Maharashtra Health Department’s recruitment exam paper leak, taking the tally of total number of arrests in the paper leak case to 11, said officials. Judicial magistrate first class AS Mujumdar with Public prosecutor (PP) Vijaysinh Jadhav later remanded the five arrested to police custody till December 11. Among those remanded to custody on Tuesday is Prashant Shankarrao Bundgire, 50, chief administration officer of Latur public health department. While Bundgire is suspected to be the main source of the leak, nine others are suspected to have been part of a chain that supplied money to him by charging anywhere between ₹ 5-7 lakh for the leaked paper, according to the police. The police are investigating when and how Bundgire accessed the question papers which are stored in a strongroom before the examination. A private company called Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL) has been given the contract to conduct these examinations. Those arrested along with Bundgire on Tuesday have been identified as Udhav Nagargoje (36), a teacher at Beed zilla parishad; Dr Sandeep Jogdand (36), medical officer at Beed mental hospital; Shyam Mhaske (38), helper at Sri hospital in Neknur, Beed; and Rajendra Pandurang Sanap (51), a clerk at rural government hospital in Bhoom, Osmanabad. The first to be arrested was Vijay Murhade from Ambad in Aurangabad, followed by Anil Gaikwad (31), Suresh Jagtap (28) Baban Mundhe (48) and Sandeep Bhutekar (38). While Jagtap is in judicial custody, all others are in police custody till December 9, according to PP Jadhav. The next one to be arrested was Prakash Misal (40) a sailor of the Indian Navy posted in Mumbai. He was produced in court on Monday and remanded to police custody till December 10. According to the cyber-crime police station officials, Dr Jogdand and Mhaske have confessed to have paid ₹10 and 5 lakh, respectively, for the paper directly to Bundgire. Nagargoje and Sanap are relatives and Sanap works in the same department as Bundgire, according to the police. The two relatives were looking for easy access to the paper for the people in their family who were aspiring to crack the Group D paper. However, Sanap is allegedly facing a previous charge of corruption in his department, and is not on good terms with Bundgire, according to the police. Therefore, Sanap and Nagargoje approached Dr Jogdand for help accessing the paper. While Dr Jogdand allegedly paid for Sanap and one candidate of his own, Mhaske formed another chain of payment to Bundgire, as per the allegations. Whereas Murhade, Gaikwad, and Mundhe formed another chain of payment through a man who is still on the run. Furthermore, once Sanap, Nagargoje, and Dr Jogdand got their hands on the paper, they allegedly tried to sell it for ₹ 6-7 lakh each, according to the police. They have all been arrested in a case registered under Sections 406, 409, 420, 120(b), and 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 6 and 8 of Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractices at University, Board or other specified examination act, 1982 at cyber police station of Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/health-dept-paper-leak-five-more-including-latur-health-dept-admin-officer-arrested-101638901452471.html
07-12-2021||Mumbai||CAG questions BMC over traffic study for Coastal Road works||Mumbai The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), the country’s apex public expenditure auditing body, has questioned the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) over its traffic estimates for the ambitious Mumbai Coastal Road Project (MCRP) and stated in its report that scrutiny of records revealed that a “detailed and proper analysis of traffic for Mumbai Coastal Road Project was not done”.The CAG submitted its report to the BMC in July 2021, a copy of which was accessed by HT. The CAG asked the BMC to clarify whether Metro services (existing as well as under construction) were considered while preparing its traffic study. It also pulled up the BMC stating that some of its estimations “appeared to be imaginary”.“The CAG had raised certain points in regards to the traffic study of Coastal Road project. However, we had satisfactorily responded to them. We are complying on all the points that have been raised by the CAG,” said a senior BMC official from engineering department of Coastal Road who did not wish to be named. A brief backgroundIn 2009, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) conducted a Comprehensive Transportation Study (CTS) that first mooted the need for a coastal road. Two years later, in 2011, a Joint Technical Committee, under the chairmanship of the Municipal Commissioner of the BMC, recommended a 35.60 km-long Coastal Road consisting of roads based on reclamation, bridges, elevated roads and tunnels on the western side of Mumbai. This was meant to run from Kandivli to Nariman Point. The BMC commissioned a traffic study of the Coastal Road in 2015 and started work on a 9.98 km stretch from Princess Street flyover to Worli — referred to as the southern part of the Coastal Road — in October 2018.“The Coastal Road Project is divided into two parts: the southern and northern parts. Though the report was prepared for 35.60 km, only the southern part of the Coastal Road for 9.98 km was taken up for execution by the BMC,” the report stated.Pain pointsAccording to the CAG, the BMC did not take proper consideration of the cost benefit ratio, average daily traffic report, car ownership and population growth and account for the Metro corridors in the city.“It was observed that there are works related to 15 Metro lines spanning a network of 356.972 km with 226 stations in pipeline. Out of which line-1 (11.07 km) was made operational in 2014. A total of 88.88 km of Metro network falls under the southern part of the city. It was estimated (in January 2019) that there will be a daily ridership of 4.50 lakh with an annual ridership of 12.60 crore. It was observed that MSRDC and MMRDA had considered the Metro network and its ridership while computing the traffic on the northern part of the Coastal Road,” the report said. “However, there is no specific consideration and analysis on the Metro network (southern part) as such the actual traffic which usually prefers local train services, BEST to private vehicles would opt for Metro services only as an alternative to cars/taxis. The department [BMC] was asked to clarify whether Metro services (existing and ongoing) were considered while preparing traffic study for Coastal Road Project. The actual traffic that would be diverted to Coastal Road to remove congestion from the existing roads was called in for an audit,” the CAG report stated.The CAG acknowledged that the Coastal Road would be used by fast-moving four wheelers like cars and taxis, but two and three-wheelers, which account for a chunk of the traffic in this southern section would not be able to use the Coastal Road.“Two and three wheelers account for 20% of the actual number of cars that are not allowed on southern part of this road. This indicated that the entire project was designed mainly for fasting moving vehicles as half of the traffic would be using Western Express Highway and Freeways,” the CAG noted.The CAG report called into question the BMC’s estimates. “It was observed that in main traffic report, the car ownership per 1000 population was pegged at 139 (2011), 204 (2021), and 266 (2031) and thereafter it would stabilise at 180 car ownerships per 1000 population. Further, car growth was huge during 2014-24 and 2024-34. But at the same time for corresponding years, the actual population was estimated at an average of 2% growth. These figures appear to be imaginary and the department was asked to justify the figures.” “The CAG report has raised some poignant questions regarding the Coastal Road Project. The questions challenge the justification of constructing the Coastal Road. The ridership numbers are the basis on which such mega projects are undertaken. However, now that the 10 km project is already nearing its completion, I would recommend complimenting citizens with public transportation — buses should ply on dedicated lanes on the Coastal Road. This shall increase the commuters using such costly infrastructure in its true sense,” Paresh Rawal, a public policy (Transportation) analyst, said. BMC responsesHT had previously reported that the CAG report also questioned the BMC over a sharp increase in construction cost from ₹252 crore per kilometre in 2011 to ₹1274 crore in 2018, a 405% rise. It has also raised questions over separate spends amounting to ₹200 crore in an inspection report between April 2016 and March 2020. In a press conference on Tuesday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashish Shelar said: “The CAG report has questioned the BMC on several issues ranging from over ₹200 crore expenditure towards clearing bills of contractors and consultants to the traffic study and project report prepared by the BMC for the project. The CAG has also questioned BMC as to why they have not submitted a plan on utilisation of green space that is being reclaimed to the union environment ministry? This questions the BMC’s intention on their claims to keep green space intact nearby coastal road. The BMC should come out clear by clarifying on the issue.”Responding to the allegations about irregularities, the BMC issued a statement on Tuesday.“No fraud or irregularities have been committed in the Coastal Road Project undertaken by the BMC. The allegations circulating in this regard are baseless and incorrect. BMC strongly denies all the allegations. The first allegation is no traffic analysis done and traffic study is flawed. But the draft report was published on BMC website in 2015. The DPR was finalised by M/s. Stup and E.Y. and has been peer reviewed by M/s. Frishmann Prabhu. The traffic analysis was done in the said DPR. This was also submitted to Maharashtra Coast Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) and Union environment ministry.”On the over ₹200 crore payment to contractors and consultants, the BMC said: “All payments due to the contractors are done by following due procedure as per recommendation of Project Management Consultants. As such no payment has been done to the contractors without doing the work.”On the points raised by the CAG report, the BMC said proper compliance will be carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cag-questions-bmc-over-traffic-study-for-coastal-road-works-101638901278411.html

07-12-2021||Lucknow||Expulsion of Tiwari’s kin: Fight for Brahmin votes in east UP likely to get fierce||With the expulsion of two sons and a nephew of former minister Hari Shankar Tiwari from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the fight for Brahmin votes in eastern Uttar Pradesh is likely to get fierce in run-up to the 2022 assembly election in the state. According to sources, the Tiwari family is likely to join the Samajwadi Party. If it happens, it will give a boost to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s efforts to win the support of upper castes before the crucial assembly election. The shift of the allegiance of an influential Brahmin family to the SP will also compel the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) to redraw its strategy to win the support of the Brahmin community in the eastern UP, particularly Gorakhpur region.On Monday, BSP chief Mayawati ordered expulsion of party’s sitting MLA from Chillupar assembly seat in Gorakhpur district, Vinay Shankar Tiwari, former Lok Sabha MP, Bhism Shankar aka Kaushal Tiwari and former chairman of the UP Legislative Council Ganesh Shankar Pandey on the charges of indulging in anti-party activities. While Vinay Shankar Tiwari and Kaushal Tiwari are sons of Hari Shankar Tiwari, considered a strongman of eastern UP who enjoys considerable influence over the Brahmin community, Ganesh Shankar Pandey is Tiwari’s nephew.While Bhism Shankar aka Kaushal Tiwari had won the 2009 Lok Sabha election on a BSP ticket from Sant Kabir Nagar seat, Ganesh Shankar Pandey was the chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council when BSP government was in power UP (2007-12). They were expelled after the information that trio had a meeting with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. Before revolt of the three leaders, Mayawati showed them the door, said a BSP leader. The expulsion of the Tiwaris is likely to give a jolt Mayawati’s efforts to win the support of the Brahmin community in the 2022 assembly election. Even as the BSP faced defeat in the 2012 and 2017 UP assembly elections, the Tiwaris stood firmly with the party. However, the political dominance of the Tiwari family diminished after the formation of the BJP government in 2017 as well as with the elevation of BJP MP from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. The traditional rivalry between Thakur and Brahmin communities is an important factor in deciding the fate of the political parties in the elections. While Yogi Adityanath emerged as the leader of the Thakur community, Hari Shankar Tiwari, who secured victory in the six assembly elections from 1985 to 2002, led the Brahmin community. Riding on the muscle power of Tiwari, the BSP maintained its presence in the eastern UP despite defeats in the successive assembly and Lok Sabha elections after it lost power in 2012. The Tiwaris mobilised the Brahmin community after the BSP launched the “Prabuddh Varg Vichar Goshti” across the Uttar Pradesh under party national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra in July this year. To counter the BSP move, the BJP, the SP and the Congress also launched campaign to win the support of the Brahmin community.

The move comes days after stalled work invited criticism from various quarters as it threatened to delay the project, which is already behind its schedule. The Ganesh mandals objected to the height of the viaduct at Sambhaji bridge and said that it poses hindrance to the annual immersion procession. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Tuesday said, “I respect the feelings of Ganesh mandal workers. But the option given by them is not feasible as it is costly and time consuming. Considering that the project needs to complete on time, it has been decided to continue the work as per the previous plan.” Maha Metro project director Atul Gadgil said, “The Ganesh mandal representatives submitted the proposal to build a hydraulic bridge instead of the existing plan but we gave our recommendations on the same to the mayor and the decision was taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-mayor-asks-maha-metro-to-start-work-at-lakdi-pul-101638901032767.html

A division bench of justices Rakesh Srivastava and Shamim Ahmed observed on November 30: “It appears that an organised group of advocates is indulging in extortion, money laundering and blackmailing and is creating difficulty in law and order on the court campus.” “Such a state of affairs, wherein the rule of law stands hijacked by a few anti-social elements, cannot be allowed to continue,” said the court. “In the circumstances, the police commissioner is directed to file his personal affidavit stating the details of all those cases which have been registered against advocates along with the status of investigation and trial in district Lucknow,” added the court. “The police commissioner will also revisit the cases in which the final report has been submitted and if it is found that there was some laxity in investigation and all the witnesses did not come forward due to fear of the accused persons, it would be open to him to order further investigation in accordance with law,” ordered the court. The court also ordered the district judge, Lucknow, to submit a report on cases pending against lawyers in a sealed envelope on next hearing of the case. “It further appears that a large number of cases are pending in which advocates are accused. We would like to know from the district judge as to how many cases are pending against advocates. The district judge will also submit his report giving the status of trial by the next date in a sealed cover,” said the court. The court further observed: “It has been brought to our notice that a large number of cases are pending against advocates, but nothing material is being done when it comes to investigation in such matters.” “We are informed that several advocates are indulging in land grabbing, money laundering and other anti-social activities and taking advantage of their robe to go scot free,” said the court. “It appears that the police feel apprehensive when it comes to making arrests in matters pending against advocates, and either submit a charge-sheet without accessing them or a final report,” pointed out the court. “If advocates are permitted to indulge in violence, then maintenance of peace in the society would become impossible. Advocates are the officers of the court and a few black sheep cannot be allowed to tarnish the image of the entire profession,” observed the court. The court fixed December 13 as the next date of hearing.

07-12-2021||Mumbai||Commission awaits state nod for OBC census||Mumbai: More than five months after the state constituted a 10-member team in the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC) to collect empirical data on Other Backward Class (OBC) communities in Maharashtra following a Supreme Court order in March, the commission’s proposal is still awaiting the government’s nod. MSBCC officials said the state was yet to take a decision on the state-wide census proposed by them, and has instead proposed a change in the original terms of reference, seeking to limit the exercise to a sample survey. “The SC has pointed to the lack of empirical data. As the Centre has refused to conduct a caste census, the state government feels we cannot go against this policy by launching our own exercise. Hence, it is working on amending the original terms of reference given to the MSCBC in June by limiting this to just a sample survey. These revised terms of reference are awaited. However, a sample has its limitations and cannot be used to credibly establish backwardness and the ward-wise population. Thus, a legal tangle is awaiting us,” an MSBCC official who did not wish to be quoted, said. Vijay Wadettiwar, the minister heading the Vimukta Jati Nomadic Tribes, OBC and Special Backward Class welfare department, could not be contacted. The department’s principal secretary Indra Mallo said the issue was “under the active consideration of the government”. Some changes were proposed to the terms of references, she said. The SECC would have generated data about the socio-economic backwardness of various communities and helped restore political reservations for OBCs in local self-government bodies like municipal corporations, councils, Zilla Parishads and gram panchayats. At present, the Central government collects data only for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the decadal census and has refused to enumerate other populations in the 2021 census. The Centre has expressed its inability to share empirical data from the 2011 census with the state citing flaws in it. This would have enumerated the numbers of each caste group across religious denominations. The apex court on Monday struck down an Ordinance brought out by the state in September which granted up to 27% political reservation for OBC community candidates in local body polls, after the SC had struck down a section in the state’s law, which granted full reservation of 27% to OBCs, on grounds that it led to a breach of the 50% ceiling on reservations when taken together with existing reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) candidates. On March 4, the apex court had further directed the state to conduct a “contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness of the concerned group” before deciding on the quantum of reservation to be granted to OBC communities. Following this, the state constituted an MSBCC team on June 29. The commission finalized the empirical data collection norms for a socio-economic and caste census (SECC) by July-end. The census, which was to be launched almost a century after it was last undertaken in British India, was expected to cost around ₹435 crore and cover all households. The MSBCC sent a letter to the state on July 28 also stating its infrastructure and manpower needs to conduct the survey. However, as the survey would have taken several months to complete, and a slew of local body polls are slated to be held in the coming months — district council elections in Bhandara and Gondia as well as bypolls in 4,500 gram panchayats across the state on December 21; elections in 23 municipal corporations, 27 district councils, 298 panchayat samitis, 320 nagar panchayats and nagar councils between February and December 2022 — the state passed an Ordinance to ensure political reservation, albeit in a reduced quantum, for OBC candidates. However, on Monday, the SC ordered that local body polls in Maharashtra will be held without political reservation for OBCs and said that the collection of empirical data should have been collected first. A former member of the MSCBC charged that one reason for the hurdles in the SECC was that the challenges it would pose to the established social and political order by showing that the numbers of backward groups was higher than expected. A ballpark estimate of the OBC population, based on the 1931 census, indicates that the communities account for nearly around 53% of Maharashtra’s population. In Maharashtra, OBCs are divided between 350 Hindu and non-Hindu classes (19% reservations) and Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJNT), which covers about 50 groups (11% quota). In 2011, the Centre had, with the help of the Office of the Registrar General of India (ORGI) conducted the SECC which studied the socio-economic status of rural and urban households and ranked households based on predefined parameters. It covered all castes and communities, including those who fell in the OBC category. However, on September 21, the Centre refused to share the data claiming it was riddled with errors. “As far as Maharashtra is concerned the analysis of SECC data pertaining to Maharashtra showed that out of the total population of 10.3 crores (103 million), population with “no caste” was 1.17 crore (11.7 million), whereas the total castes enumerated were as many as 428,677. Pertinently, as against more than 4.28 lakh (428,000) castes which have been enumerated in the SECC 2011, in the state of Maharashtra, the existing castes which are published in Maharashtra in SC, ST and OBC categories are only 494,” the 59-page affidavit filed by R Subrahmanyam, secretary ministry of social justice and empowerment, stated. “Considering the aforesaid, it is apparent that the caste enumeration in SECC 2011 was fraught with mistakes and inaccuracies. A further analysis further showed that more than 99% of the castes enumerated had a population of less than 100 persons,” the affidavit added further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/commission-awaits-state-nod-for-obccensus-101638900434111.html

The deceased, identified as Sameer Shaikh alias Lalbadshah Husain Manoor, 32, is a resident of Kalubainagar locality in Phalenagar area of Ambegaon Pathar in Katraj. Along with a man named Mehboob Saifan Bulargi, 33, to whom Shaikh allegedly owed money, a minor boy claiming to be 17 years of age, and two men identified as Nilesh Sunil Kumbhar, 30, and Sufian Faiyaz Chauri, 19, were also arrested by the police late on Monday. The three have been remanded to police custody till December 14 by Judicial magistrate first class PS Jondhale. An illegal weapon was recovered from their possession, said officials. “There was a financial dispute between them, that’s true but to indulge in such violence over ₹2.5 lakh seems suspicious. It is one of the reasons we asked for custody remand. One other reason is also to identify if there was a bigger conspiracy and if other people were involved in this plot,” said public prosecutor Girish Bargaje. Manoor was shot dead while he was sitting on a red Royal Enfield Bullet in front of an eatery called Rohit Wadewale. The four men arrived on two two-wheelers and fled in the direction of Katraj dairy. Mehboob Bulargi had given a construction project to Shaikh and had paid ₹17 lakh for it. Work of ₹10 lakh was completed, and Shaikh returned ₹5 lakh through irregular payments. But Bulargi was asking for the final payment of ₹2.5 lakh which Shaikh was avoiding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/three-in-pune-police-custody-for-shooting-builder-in-katraj-101638900432607.html

Reduced timings irk Pune residents||PUNE Morning walkers in Pune were in for a shock when they were asked to leave the public gardens before the closing time. On Tuesday, two incidents came to light when morning walkers including senior citizens were turned away at Ahilyabai Holkar garden and Katraj Upper lake garden. Abhijit Patharde, a banker who usually visits the Ahilyabai Holkar garden said, “The staff at the garden asked people to leave the premise at 9 am citing the PMC guidelines. The timings are 6 am to 10 am and 4 pm to 7 pm. Residents’ want the parks to be opened for a longer time, however the timings have been reduced.” Many residents complained that local level staff is acting arbitrarily on opening and closing timings. “Considering the winters, the PMC should consider extending the garden timings to 11 am. The gardens are being shut early and the PMC must look into the mater,” said Avadhoot Kulkarni, a resident. Ashok Ghorpade, garden superintendent, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), “The official timings post-covid for all the gardens are 6 am to 10 am and 4 pm to 7 pm. We have not given any instructions to the gardens to close the gates early and will look into the matter.” According to PMC garden department officials, over 180 out of 204 gardens have reopened in the city. Corporator Vasant said, “I have requests from many residents to increase the timings as it would be great for senior citizens and young people to enjoy the sun during the winter but one has to follow the covid rules and also wait for PMC to take these decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/not-a-walk-in-the-park-reduced-timings-irk-pune-residents-101638900132462.html
07-12-2021||Lucknow||People will reject BJP’s ‘politics of hatred’: Jayant||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Chaudhary on Tuesday formally announced his party’s alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and said if they came to power in Uttar Pradesh next year, the first work will be to build a memorial for “martyrs” of the farmers’ protest. Assembly polls are slated to be held in Uttar Pradesh early in 2022. Slamming the BJP government in the state for the recent leak of a government competitive examination question paper and subsequent cancellation of the test, he said because of such incidents youngsters were not getting appointments and they had to migrate and work in other places.“The BJP will get a befitting reply from the people in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls next year as they have understood its politics of hatred. The BJP talks of ‘hatred’ and our ‘Babaji’ (a reference to CM Yogi Adityanath) starts with Aurangzeb and ends with the ‘Kairana exodus’,” he said while addressing a joint rally with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in Dabathua village of the district. During the last assembly polls, the BJP had claimed that many Hindu families had migrated from Kairana town in fear of criminals. The claim of migration has been contested by some political parties.The RLD leader also said, “Babaji becomes angry very fast. You have never seen him smiling. He smiles only when he is with ‘bacchde’ (calves). I ask you people to free him so that he can play with his calves for 24 hours. He cannot handle government files.”Hailing the farmers’ agitation, he said, “I appreciate farmers for winning a big battle and forcing (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji, probably for the first time, to bow before them.” He was referring to the repeal of three central farm laws that had triggered a year of protests.“Our party had announced to construct the memorial in Meerut but now Akhilesh ji and I are together. The first work our double-engine government will do is to construct a memorial for martyr farmers, who died during farmers’ protest here in the land of Chowdhury Charan Singh,” Chaudhary added. He also accused BJP leaders of insulting the farmers and not uttering a single word to pay tribute to those farmers who died during their stir.“In Lakhimpur Kheri farmers were crushed. Over 700 of them died during the agitation (against the laws),” he said. During violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 this year, eight people, including four farmers and two BJP workers, were killed. Chaudhary asked people to be there in Aligarh on December 23 on Kisan Diwas for another rally. December 23 happens to be the birth anniversary of former PM and Chaudhary’s grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh.Addressing the gathering, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav remembered Chowdhury Charan Singh, Babasaheb Dr BR Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia and farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait and highlighted their contribution to making an egalitarian society. “Now, the BJP will be wiped out from the state. This time there would be sunset of the BJP forever in western Uttar Pradesh,” he said. “’Kisanon ka inquilab hoga, 2022 me badlav hoga’ (There will be revolution by farmers and change in 2022),” Yadav said.Raising the farmers’ issues, he said, “Farmers are fighting for their rights and they want that the government should listen to them. However, they were crushed under the jeep of a BJP minister and his supporters ( a reference to Lakhimpur Kheri violence).”He reiterated that farmers should be given their rights and a decision should be taken on minimum support price (MSP). The SP leader also accused the BJP of not taking decisions which were beneficial for the farmers and assured them that his alliance (with RLD) would ensure their rights. Yadav also said growing prices of essential commodities and fuel had made peoples’ life difficult. He further said RLD and SP workers would help in strengthening harmony among people and assured people if voted to power, the SP-RLD government would give relief in electricity bills to the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/people-will-reject-bjp-s-politics-of-hatred-jayant-101638899952347.html

BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik blamed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi for the Supreme Court’s decision.

07-12-2021||Lucknow||No Omicron variant in Vrindavan Covid samples||Agra : Much to the relief of the health authorities in Mathura, none of the seven samples of foreign devotees sent for genome sequencing from Vrindavan contained Omicron virus. All seven tested positive for Covid -19 due to the Delta variant, common during the second wave. “We are still to get it in writing but it was confirmed by authorities in Lucknow in a telephonic conversation that there was no case of Omicron in Mathura district till date. All seven samples of foreign devotees testing positive for Covid -19 were sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing and authorities there communicated on phone that none of the seven had Omicron,” said Dr Bhoodev, deputy chief medical officer in Mathura. “All seven Covid positive cases were of Delta variant,” said Dr Bhoodev who informed that presently there were 14 active Covid cases in Mathura, including seven foreign devotees and seven Indians. Isolation period of three positive cases ended on Monday, including the woman from Lithuania who was the first to be tested positive in a Vrindavan ashram. “In all, 10 foreign nationals from an ashram in Vrindavan had tested Covid positive but samples of the initial seven cases were sent for genome sequencing. These people came from different nations, including Lithuania, Russia, USA, Spain, Switzerland and Austria and landed in India on or about November 15. They were here in Vrindavan as Krishna devotees,” said Dr Bhoodev. Out of the 10 people testing Covid positive, three returned home before their reports came. “The first of these cases surfaced on November 25 and was recorded on the Co-WIN portal on November 27. These samples were dispatched through courier to Lucknow on November 28,” the deputy CMO said. In Agra, a footwear manufacturer tested positive for Covid-19 on November 20 after returning home from Poland. Besides, a non-resident Indian from Spain tested positive last Thursday. He had arrived in India in October and was preparing to move back to Spain and got his RT-PCR test done. Dr AK Srivastava, CMO, Agra, informed that two others tested positive in Agra but had no travel history. Yet all four samples were sent for genome sequencing and the reports were yet to be received. . 
07-12-2021||Pune||Fines for illegal banners, hoardings in Pune will now be attached to property tax||PUNE Public display of commercial or political hoardings, banners and painting on the walls in non-designated areas of the city will invite a hefty fine from property owners as the Pune Municipal Corporation made amends to its advertisement policy. According to officials, if the advertising firm or the owner is unable to pay fine for an illegal hoarding, then the fine will be collected from the owner or property tax holder of that private land. Vijay Landge, deputy municipal commissioner (license and sky sign) said, “In order to increase revenue, the PMC commissioner has introduced a new provision in the 2009 hoarding policy. The fine for an illegal hoarding is ₹50,000 and ₹1,000 to 5,000 is the fine for illegal flex, banners and flags.” At present, there are 2,200 hoardings located in various parts of the city as per corporation records. According to the 2009 hoarding policy, the city is divided into four zones and the rate for putting up hoarding is ₹222 per square feet. Corporation has estimated a revenue of ₹25 to ₹30 crore per annum. However, the PMC only receives ₹ 6 crore per annum as revenue from hoarding fees since 2018. “PMC has also made a provision to regularise hoarding by paying compounding fee. As per fees for advertisement permits for hoardings- if fees are not paid within the prescribed time, a composition amount equal 25 per cent of the permit fee for delay up to three months and equal to 50 per cent for delay of up to 6 months will be payable. For delays beyond six months, the composition amount equals 100 per cent,” added Landge. PMC losing revenue due to court case The PMC does not have any information regarding illegal hoardings in the city. The PMC had floated a tender to identify these hoardings, however the agency hasn’t been finalised yet. This is because the state government has assured the Bombay High Court that the Pune hoarding association will not take any corrosive action till court gives final decision. Langde said, “The case is pending in court from 2018. Therefore, we are not taking any action on hoardings. We are awaiting a court order. After that, we will be able to depute agencies to identify illegal hoardings and charge fines for regularising the hoardings as per the 2009 policy.” Balasaheb Ganjave, president of Pune hoarding association said, “Under the ‘one nation one tax’, we have challenged corporations and the state government to charge license fees for putting up hoarding. We are already paying 18 per cent Goods and Service Tax (GST) to the government, then why should we pay another tax to corporations? We have also challenged ₹222 per square feet rate for putting hoarding in the city. “ He further said, “At present, we are paying a license renewal fee to the corporation for one year. There are more than 2,000 illegal hoardings in the suburban areas of Pune city. Corporation needs to take action but is unable to do so due to lack of manpower.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fines-for-illegal-banners-hoardings-in-pune-will-now-be-attached-to-property-tax-101638899539905.html

07-12-2021||Mumbai||Legal opinions divided on SC staying OBC reservation||Mumbai: A day after Supreme Court stayed 27% reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) in local body polls, legal opinion is divided on whether the state would receive relief if it moves the Supreme Court to review its decision. Chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty held a review meeting on Tuesday to examine the options available to the government in the wake of the apex court’s order that only stayed local body elections in seats reserved for OBC candidates. The court further said that the government should have collected empirical data as before providing OBC reservation in local body elections in keeping with its order from March 4. Legal experts said that the state has little option left to restore the reservation. “The legal opinion was against the Ordinance as it goes against the spirit of SC order in K Krishnamurthy case in March this year. The Ordinance has been stayed for the state government’s failure to collate the empirical data which was like pre-condition to the reservation. Unfortunately the state government could not progress on the data even after issuing the order of the appointment of MSBCC on June 29. Even if the state government requested for the relief from the stay, the top court is unlikely to concede,” an official from law and judiciary department who did not wish to be named, said. State minister from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and an OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal however said that the state is looking to move the court for revising its order. “The three tests laid down by the court have been fulfilled and the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission has been appointed and it will start collecting the empirical data soon. We are however consulting the legal experts and will move court for revision [of the order],” he said. “The local body elections are being held in other states based on the ordinance issued on the similar lines we did. The ordinances issued by them are not stayed. We are also going to request the apex court to allow us to hold the polls as per the schedule subject to the submission of the OBC certificate later in due time. We expect the relief during the next hearing on December 13; 54% of the population of the state cannot be deprived of their political reservation just for technical reasons,” Bhujbal said. The triple tests for providing reservation are: establish a Commission to conduct rigorous empirical inquiry; specify proportion of reservation in light of the Commission’s recommendations; ensure reservation does not exceed 50 per cent of the total seats with SCs/STs/OBC quotas taken together. A government official said that collecting empirical data will take time as the state government is expected to change the terms of reference framed for the MSBCC appointed to collect the data. “We are tweaking it to keep in the spirit of the SC order in the K Krishnamurthy case. As such the empirical data needs to be collected through ‘rigorous investigation’ of the communities which are deprived from the political benefits. The collection of such data may take years together,” the officer said. He also said that the state government is expected to argue in the apex court that it has the interim data collected by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics and the one collected by National Sample Survey Office. The data collated by Gokhale Institute was taken while when reservation was given to the Maratha community four years ago. Meanwhile, State Election Commission stayed the polls to seats from OBC quota in the local bodies which are scheduled to be held on December 21. On September 21, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government passed the Ordinance amending two laws that govern rural and municipal local bodies, after the SC on March 4 struck down political reservation for OBC candidates in local body elections. The SC had held the reservation exceeding 50% cap unconstitutional and directed the state to conduct an empirical study on the socio-economic backwardness of OBC communities before deciding on the quantum of reservation. The decision comes days ahead of polls to be conducted in 104 district council seats and 210 panchayat samitis seats in in Bhandara and Gondia, as well as 1,802 seats in 106 nagar panchyats (that govern smaller towns) and four seats in municipal corporations across the state. Another 7,000 seats from 4500 gram panchayats are also going to poll on December 21. In all, 413 seats from district councils, panchayat samitis, nagar panchayats and municipal corporations are reserved for OBCs. The SC’s Monday order is a major setback to the MVA government as OBC communities have blamed the state government for its failure to act in time. “There is a lack of coordination between all concerned departments and the key community leaders. We could not release even ₹5 crore of ₹435 crore demanded by the MSBCC to set up infrastructure and logistic for the collection of data even six months after its constitution. Karnataka had spent ₹150 crore for such collection a few years ago. All the three ruling parties will have to pay a heavy political price in the upcoming local body elections,” a senior minister who did not wish to be named, said. “The government released the funds of crores of rupees for the Maratha community, but dragged its feet when it comes to the releasing of the funds for OBCs,” Chandrakant Bavkar, president, OBC Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, said. Hari Narke, a former member of MSBCC, said that there was lack of coordination between four departments which are concerned to the OBC reservation. “The commission has not been given manpower, funds and it has hampered the work of the commission. It is unfortunate that the ruling parties are indifferent while the Opposition BJP is acting against the interest of the OBCs.”

07-12-2021||Lucknow||AU finalises list of new foundation, elective UG courses||Allahabad University (AU) has finalised a list of seven new foundation and 14 elective courses for undergraduate students that they will be able to undertake under the new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020. Though more courses could get added to this list, now UG students will be compulsorily required to pursue select foundation and some skill enhancement/ elective courses from this list while pursuing their traditional courses on the central varsity campus as soon as the four-year UG courses or five-year integrated master’s courses get introduced, say AU officials in the know about the development.“The academic council, apex decision making body for all academic affairs of the university, has already approved these courses,” said dean (research and development) prof SI Rizvi. “With the proposed implementation of the provisions of NEP-2020 from the 2023 session, the undergraduate students will have to pursue three foundation courses in the first year (two semesters) including the mandatory ones on “nation building and social service” and one being wither “English language and soft skills” or “Indian language” (Hindi/Sanskrit/Urdu) besides one more foundation course of their choice from the list,” prof Rizvi added.He said likewise four courses in two years (four semesters) will have to be compulsorily cleared by the students from the list of elective courses. The list of “foundation courses” finalised so far includes “nation building and social service”, “health, hygiene and nutrition”, “English language and soft skills”, “Indian language (anyone of the following) Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu”, “Indian culture and heritage”, “computer applications (MS word, powerpoint, excel and other common software)” and “environmental science”.Similarly, the list of “skill enhancement courses/electives” includes “mathematics for beginners”, “health, hygiene and nutrition”, “basic electronics and artificial intelligence”, “basics of human biochemistry”, “medicinal plants”, “discoveries in science”, “introduction to Indian classical music”, “basic principles of Indian Constitution”, “disaster management”, “environmental concerns and climate change”, “introduction to Indian history”, “elements of economics”, “Vedic maths” and “courses in foreign languages”.The NEP-2020 lays stress on imaginative and flexible curricular structures that will enable creative combinations of disciplines for study and would offer multiple entry and exit points and thus remove currently prevalent rigid boundaries and would create new possibilities for life-long learning.Likewise, the NEP-2020 says the structure and lengths of degree programmes shall be adjusted accordingly by the institutions so that the undergraduate degree is of either 3 or 4-year duration, with multiple exit options within this period, with appropriate certifications, e.g. a certificate after completing one year in a discipline or field including vocational and professional areas, or a diploma after two years of study, or a bachelor ’s degree after a 3-year programme.Prof Rizvi said all new courses under the NEP at AU finalised so far have multiple entry and multiple exit options. “We are also structuring our UG programmes to the four-year format. Once the new UG programme is under way, we will restructure the master’s programme also,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/au-finalises-list-of-new-foundation-elective-ug-courses-101638898932315.html

07-12-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka reports another Covid cluster, this time in Mangaluru||A fresh Covid-19 cluster was reported in Karnataka after nine students tested positive for the infection on Monday, according to the state health department statement. The incident occurred in a college in Mangaluru, and the positive results arrived after a total of 173 samples were tested for the virus. The college has now been declared a containment zone.“We have sent samples for genomic sequencing to detect the variant. We have effectively isolated the hostel. Those students who have tested positive for novel coronavirus have been quarantined at the hostel. All those who are infected are aged above 18,” said deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada district Rajendra KV. This development comes only hours after the cluster Covid-19 cases reported in Chikkamagaluru district on Saturday witnessed a rise in the number of affected people, with 21 more students and one staffer testing positive for the virus. Following testing of 457 samples of both students and staff members in the Jawahar Navodaya School in Seegodu in Chikkamagaluru district, as many as 69 individuals, including 59 students and 10 staffers, were found to be infected with the coronavirus. Similar clusters were reported in educational institutions in Dharwad, Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Hassan and Mysuru districts, health department officials said.There has been a consistent uptick of Covid-19 clusters in the southern state, which led the state government to issue guidelines to combat the situation. According to the new norms, any area reporting three Covid-19 cases will be declared a cluster, as opposed to the earlier 10. Furthermore, both doses of Covid-19 vaccine shots have been made mandatory for people to visit apartment complexes, and if one has been marked a cluster, no one will be permitted to enter the building.The new rules hold even more significance as the state reported two cases. Meanwhile, the government has initiated action to establish a Genome Sequencing Lab in the state. The health secretary has been instructed to look into the needs of procuring the necessary equipment and experts for the purpose, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said speaking to media persons at his residence in Hubli on Tuesday.“All the districts have Covid testing labs. Genome sequencing needs expert systems and modern equipment. The spread of the new variant, Omicron, has necessitated sending test samples in suspect cases for Omicron, to genome sequence testing in NCBS. Arrangements would be made to get the test reports quickly,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-reports-another-covid-cluster-this-time-in-mangaluru-101638898633380.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||HC frees rape accused as victim, her father turn hostile||The Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed the 20-year jail term awarded to a Palwal youth, who was accused of raping a minor in May 2018.The trial court had sentenced him to 20-year jail in July 2019 even as the victim and her father had resiled from their statements. The high court was hearing an appeal against that order.The allegations from the father were that his 14-year-old daughter had been repeatedly harassed by the accused while she was going to school and on earlier occasions, he had remonstrated with the parents of the appellant, who had assured him that his son mend his ways but he did not desist and on the date in question, he enticed away his daughter and raped her.However, during trial, the girl and her father both turned hostile and claimed that no rape had taken place and that the girl was a major. The father had stated that he had reduced the age of the girl at the time of her admission in school. The trial court, however, relied on the medical evidence. The trial court had further held that the oral version regarding age of the girl could not be preferred over the school record.The accused had submitted in high court that admittedly the age reflected in the school record was not based on any evidence such as birth certificate and had been entered on the statement of the father. Further, both the father and the girl had admitted that she was 19-year-old, and not 14, and that he had intentionally gotten less age recorded at the time of getting her admission in school. Thus, the school record loses its probative value.The state counsel had told court that this is a case where the victim and her father have obviously been won over and thus, have not given the correct version of events.The court, while freeing the accused, observed that the girl had admitted that it was a consensual act, and now the controversy indeed boils down to the findings regarding her age. The admissibility of a document as evidence is one thing and the probative value thereof is different, it added. “A document may be admissible but as to whether the entry contained therein has any probative value may still be required to be examined,” the court said, adding that the girl had admitted to her age to be 19-year-old. The father too has admitted. No probative value can be attached to the school leaving certificate in view of these facts, the court said quashing trial court order and freeing the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-frees-rape-accused-as-victim-her-father-turn-hostile-101638896711966.html

Chavan added that the complaint lodged by Patil was false and motivated, and that section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) had been wrongly and arbitrarily applied in the case. He told the court that the said section was inapplicable as Patil is alive.After hearing the submissions, the bench held that the provisions of section 306 could not be applied in the case and directed the release of Khan in the event of arrest on a bail amount of Rs25,000 and sureties.The complaint was lodged following Patil’s hospitalisation after he tried to take his own life with an overdose of sleeping pills at his residence in Oshiwara.

We have raised an objection to the government’s proposal over a committee on the Minimum Support Price (MSP), there should be no condition on withdrawal of cases and compensation and job to kin of deceased farmers,” he said.“The proposal stated that a committee will be formed on the MSP in which agricultural experts, Union government officials, people from states, SKM leaders and other farm union representatives will be inducted; cases registered during agitation will be withdrawn once the agitation is called-off and compensation will be given to the deceased farmers’ families as per the state government’s norms. While the government did not reply on action against Union minister Ajay Mishra in connection with Lakhimpur Kheri violence,” he added.SKM leader Inderjeet Singh said they could not reach a consensus as government wants to hold dialogue on conditions.“We have asked the government to withdraw cases first and induct only SKM leaders in the MSP committee. Moreover, we want memorials of deceased farmers to be built, which was also not mentioned in the letter. We have urged the government to send its proposal with amendments and clarify our apprehensions,” he said.“Not only Haryana farm leaders but all farm activists were in favour of not calling off the agitation until cases are withdrawn. The government had betrayed people during the Jat stir in Haryana by harassing them after the compromise so we want cancellation of all FIRs first. We have called a meeting at 2pm on Wednesday to decide whether to call-off the agitation or change the way of protest,” he added.The SKM has clarified that they will not call-off the agitation until cases registered against farmers are not withdrawn. As per farm leaders, nearly 47,000 cases have been registered only in Haryana.One among the five-member committee, Yudveer Singh, said they have received a letter from the government and they will reply to it on Wednesday. “We have called a meeting of SKM leaders at 2pm at Singhu to discuss all issues thoroughly,” he added.On December 4, SKM formed a five-member panel to hold talks with the government on behalf of all protesting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-sends-proposal-to-skm-farm-leaders-raise-objections-over-few-issues-101638894912258.html
07-12-2021||Ranchi||‘J’khand govt undermined Guv’s jurisdiction in constituting TAC’||In a development that could further dent the ongoing tug of war over a host of issues between the Centre and Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand government, union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda has said that the state government undermined Governor’s jurisdictions in constituting the Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) and it should take corrective measures on it. Replying to a question raised by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey in Lok Sabha on Monday, Munda said he has got the issue vetted from the law ministry and is in the process of informing the state government about it. “While it is a fact that in many states the TAC is headed by the chief minister, there are other provisions wherein prior approval of the Governor is mandatory in constituting it. The Jharkhand Governor had brought this issue to notice of law as well as my ministry. We also deliberated this issue with the law ministry and we think that the Governor’s powers have been undermined. We are informing the state government to take corrective measures as per the constitutional provisions,” Munda said. The state government meanwhile said they are yet to get any communication over the issue. “We can comment only after seeing what we receive from the Centre,” said Vinay Chowbey, principal secretary to the chief minister. The Hemant Soren government on June 22 amended the Tribes Advisory Council (an advisory body that deliberate and help the government with issues related to tribes and their development in states that have areas classified under the fifth schedule of the Constitution), transferring the power of constituting the TAC from the office of the Governor to the chief minister. The state government reconstituted the TAC with the chief minister as ex-officio chairman and the state’s tribal affairs minister as the deputy chairperson. Fifteen MLAs, including three from the Opposition BJP, are also a part of TAC, besides two experts from the ST community. The Hemant Soren government has, however, maintained that the amendment has been done as per law and cited an example of Chhattisgarh where a similar exercise was done by the previous BJP government there headed by Raman Singh. The TAC chaired by the CM has also met twice ever since and the BJP members abstained from it on both occasions. The ruling JMM meanwhile stuck to its stand and justified the amendments brought by its government. “The tribal affairs minister himself said that CM chairs TAC in many states. As far as consultations with the Governor on the matters related to TAC are concerned, the state government had twice sent the file to the former Governor (Draupadi Murmu).

The role of the ECI is very clear, it takes all decisions related to even civil and police administration whenever model code is in place during elections and bye-elections. But will the ECI now even decide who would be a DC or a secretary. Then what would be the role of an elected government in a democracy? We oppose this order and request the ECI not to come up with such directions in future.”The ECI order comes based on a complaint filed by BJP Lok Sabha member from Godda, Nishikant Dubey, who alleged the Deoghar district administration of registering five cases against him in connection with Madhupur by-election with a malafide intention, the ECI has also directed the state government not to post the concerned officer as DC or any other election duty without prior permission from the commission.“…to initiate disciplinary proceedings for a major penalty against Manjunath Bhajantri, IAS, DC-cum-CEO, Deoghar by issuing charge memo to him within 15 days from receipt of this order, under intimation to the Commission, and further directs that Manjunath Bhajantri, IAS, be removed from the post of DC-cum-DEO, immediately, and should not be posted as DC/DEO or any other election duty without prior permission from the Commission,” reads the order issued by Rahul Sharma, principal secretary, ECI.Vinay Chowbey, principal secretary to chief minister Hemant Soren, said the government is getting the order examined. “We are getting the order legally examined. Any decision on it would be taken accordingly,” he said.The matter pertains to five FIRS registered with five different police stations by the district administration on October 23 against Nishikant Dubey in connection with alleged model code violation during the Madhupur by-election in April. Dubey had challenged the move and approached the ECI against the DC. The ECI through the Jharkhand CEO had sought explanation from the DC, especially seeking clarification as to why the cases were registered five months after the bypoll and without giving prior information to the Commission.Bhajantri had submitted his response defending his move, citing law points including previous court judgments. The Commission, however, rejected his defense and ordered the chief secretary on December 6 to act against the DC. The department of personnel that deals with transfers of bureaucrats is with chief minister Soren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jmm-slams-eci-order-to-remove-deoghar-dc-101638894551840.html

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana gram sachivalays fail to deliver administrative services at village-level||The initiative of setting up gram sachivalays (GS) has failed to deliver on the promise of providing basic administrative services to the rural population at the local level.A visit to many gram sachivalays revealed that the buildings are now wearing a deserted look in lack of presence of officers and there was nobody even to maintain cleanliness.“On government’s directions, we had set up gram sachivalays in an existing building and made arrangements of furniture, electricity and internet in 2016. Even a schedule for the visit of officers was prepared but not even a single visit was made and this building was used only for gram sabha,” said Yuvraj Sharma, outgoing sarpanch of Khurdban village in Yamunanagar district.In most villages, residents do not know the purpose of setting up of these buildings and they were using these sachivalays for their own purposes such as marriage programmes.Praveen Kumar, ex-sarpanch of Dhanokheri village in Karnal district, said, “The work of gram sachivalays was completed in 2019 by the panchayat department, but as of now, there is no electricity connection and the building is in a poor state.A panchayat representative of Bakali village in Kurukshetra said, “In the past two-and-a-half-years, we never saw any official visiting our gram sachivalays despite having made all arrangements of internet, electricity and other basic facilities. We don’t know why the government made a promise if it could not fulfill it.”The initiative was taken by the previous BJP government in 2015, to set up gram sachivalays at 2,294 clusters by March, 2019. As per the government’s plan, the gram sachivalays were to be set up on panchayati land with an estimated cost of ₹30 lakh, including the cost of furniture and fixture.These sachivalyas were to have enough space for housing the office of panchayat members, gram sachiv and data entry operator-cum-accountant. The development and panchayats department had promised to make these village secretariats a hub of all activities to provide all basic facilities to the rural dwellers within their villages.Officials from block to district level were supposed to sit here at least once a week for timely redressal of public grievances and even a schedule was fixed for officials including halka patwari, ADO (agriculture), JE (electricity board), JE (public health), and VLDA (veterinary) to facilitate the inhabitants.As per the data available on the website of the state development and panchayats department, so far, 1,785 gram sachivalayas have been established of which, 884 village level functionaries had shifted and operationalised the rural CSC at gram sachivalayas.Maximum 150 gram sachivalays have been set up in Karnal, 142 in Sirsa, 139 in Hisar, 128 in Nuh, 118 in Kaithal, 104 in Fatehabad, 103 each in Ambal and Bhiwani, and 100 in Yamunanagar. Even after completion of two-and-a-half-years, 558 gram sachivalays were deprived of basic facilities.The exact figures of the expenditures on these village secretariats were not available as the officials said most of the gram sachivalays were constructed by the village panchayats. But in August last year, the government had released ₹3.55 crore for construction of 69 more gram sachivalays in 11 districts of Haryana, officials said.Officials have different opinion and reasons behind failure of this initiative as many blame staff crunch and some said villagers did not focus on gram sachivalyas as the tenure of village panchayats was completed in February, 2021.“Shortage of staff is a major problem to make these sachivalyas fully operational. Most district administrations and local offices of the revenue department, public health and development and panchayat department presently have only around 40% staff, how will the officials devote time for these sachivalayas,” asked a senior official of a district administration, pleading anonymity.On why most gram sachivalays failed to serve the purpose, the director general, development and panchayats, Haryana RC Bidhan said, “This might be at some places as the panchayat elections were delayed due to the pending court case and now the BDPOs have the administrative charge as the independent panchayats could focus more.”He said the work on completion of all gram sachivalyas was going on and the government’s main focus is to make these gram sachivalyas vibrant and now the furniture is being provided to village panchayats as per the requirement and CSCs are being set up in gram sachivalyas.Additional chief secretary to additional chief secretary to government, Haryana, and financial commissioner, revenue and disaster management PK Das said he will examine why the officials of the revenue department were not sitting in the village secretariats as per schedule.Reacting to the poor condition of gram sachivalays in Kurukshetra, deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said he will issue strict directions to the DDPO to make them operational with cooperation of locals.

Three others are undergoing treatment in separate hospitals. Their families said they died of diarrhoea and other complications”, said a police official familiar with the probe team.One of the bodies was cremated by the family fearing police action; while Mandal’s body was sent for autopsy. According to villagers, Manjhi community in a nearby village is involved in manufacturing illicit liquor and sale. The victims might have purchased liquor from there and consumed it.Samastipur SP said that he would be able to share further details only after getting their autopsy reports. He added that only forensic report would be able to confirm whether they consumed hooch or not. “A probe team has been constituted under the supervision of excise superintendent and we have sought a detailed report from them,” Dhillon said.This is the second suspected hooch incident in the last one week. The sale and consumption of alcohol in Bihar was banned by the Nitish Kumar government in April 2016.

An opposition front is not possible without the Congress. What is the point of two-three fronts? It will benefit the BJP," Mr Raut, a Rajya Sabha MP of the Shiv Sena, told reporters.Asked whether opposition parties should sit together to discuss strategy versus the BJP for the 2024 national election, Mr Raut said: "I have asked Rahul Gandhi to take the lead on that."He added: "Who leads the front is something all parties have to sit and decide together."On whether the Shiv Sena is attempting to broker peace between the Congress and Mamata Banerjee, he remarked: "Sharad Pawar saab hai (we have NCP leader Sharad Pawar for that)."The meeting took place amid signs that the Congress and the Shiv Sena, part of a coalition in Maharashtra, might be inching towards a wider understanding.Congress sources suggest the Sena might back the party in the state elections early next year. Though the Sena has negligible presence in some of these states, like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the political symbolism of extending support to the Congress speaks to the surprising, newfound proximity of the two ideologically opposed parties who had struggled to come together in the first place.Two days ago, the Shiv Sena had strongly defended the Congress from Bengal Chief Minister's attacks.After meeting with Shiv Sena leaders and the NCP's Sharad Pawar in Mumbai, Mamata Banerjee had told reporters: "What UPA? There is no UPA now? What is the UPA? We will clear all issues. We want a strong alternative."The comments, suggesting that the Congress-led coalition is long past its sell-by date, provoked a strong rebuttal from the Sena in its mouthpiece, Saamna, on Sunday.Pushing the Congress out of national politics and creating an opposition grouping parallel to the UPA would only strengthen the BJP and "fascist" forces, the Sena editorial said."It is true that Mamata Banerjee finished the Congress, Left and BJP in West Bengal. But keeping Congress out of national politics will amount to strengthening the current fascist forces. It is understandable that (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi and his BJP feel that Congress should be wiped out. This is part of their agenda. But it is more dangerous when those fighting against Modi and his ideology think that the Congress should be wiped out," said the Saamna piece.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-to-decide-on-joining-upa-sanjay-raut-says-after-meeting-with-rahul-101638882117121.html

Police suspect old enmity behind the killing of Rajesh Pandey. The murder led to protests by the victim’s colleagues on the premises of Gopalganj civil court. According to Pandey’s colleague Jitendra Choubey, who was travelling with the victim, the incident occurred when they were on their way to the court from Kuchaikot Bazar. Three miscreants on two bikes intercepted them and fired indiscriminately. Pandey died on the spot. They, however, did not harm Choubey.Locals rushed him to Gopalganj Sadar hospital where he was declared brought dead. Advocate Uday Shankar Srivastava said that the association will go on indefinite strike if the killers were not arrested within six hours. On getting information Gopalganj superintendent of police (SP) Anand Kumar and other police officials rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. Police recovered five empty cartridges from the spot. “The forensics team has collected the evidence from the incident spot. The autopsy of the deceased will be conducted by a team of the medical board. Prima facie it seems to be the case of old enmity and threatening by some rival client,” said Anand. .

The 14-year-old girl, her parents and grandfather was later produced before the sub-divisional magistrate’s (SDM) office where they were legally bound under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act.The girl and her parents told the SDM that they weren’t keen on getting their daughter married but the girl’s grandfather and an aunt persuaded them to agree, police officer Soni said.The aunt was getting her son married under ‘Aata Saata’ centuries-old (exchange) practice where a family enters an alliance of their daughter only when her would-be in-laws also pledge to give their daughter in marriage to her family.Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said most complaints of child marriages received by them pertain to the ‘Aata Saata’ practice. She said instances of ‘Aata Saata’ practice have increased due to the low sex ratio in the state, which makes it difficult for men to find brides.Beniwal stressed that an increasing number of girls were, however, reaching out to the commission and district administration to seek intervention due to heightened awarness.In Udaipur last month, the commission was able to stop the wedding of a Class 7 student who was being married to a 26-year-old man under the ‘Aata Saata’ practice.

He said the shutdown was being observed peacefully with black flags flying at various locations.The tribal body has also announced a seven-day mourning period from Wednesday onwards and stated that there should be no military forces or patrolling parties during the mourning period.“For failing to abide by this decision and untoward incidents that arise during this stipulated time, they (security forces) shall be held responsible,” the KU said.“A group of 14 poor, innocent civilians lost their precious lives at the hands of the Indian Military forces. The deceased were purely villagers with no connection to any elements that may cause the slightest concern to the paramilitary forces or to the national security of India in any respect. This is an act of atrocity beyond reasoning,” the union stated in a release.It said the incident seems to be a complete failure of the intelligence source(s) and a well-calculated attempt on the innocent civilian.“The incident cannot be termed as a mistaken identity at all,” the KU asserted, rebuffing the army’s claim.The KU also wrote a letter addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind for “remedial action”. While underscoring the need for the immediate repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958 from the entire north-east region, the tribal body asked for setting up of an independent inquiry under a competent investigating agency with two members from the Naga civil society inducted in the investigating team; to identify all military forces or army personnel involved in the incident and book and punish under applicable civil court; action taken against erring official(s) at “Oting Yatong Massacre” must be put into the public domain within 30 days.KU also demanded that the 37 Assam Rifles must immediately vacate Mon district on moral ground for failing to provide security to its citizens as the military forces from other states had intruded and committed the “Oting-Yatong Massacre”.Meanwhile, state government spokesperson and minister Neiba Kronu said the state cabinet was in support of the demands made by Konyak Union to the President of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-tribal-body-imposes-day-long-bandh-writes-to-president-for-justice-101638890591461.html

07-12-2021||Mumbai||ED questions ex-chief secy for six hours in money laundering case||Mumbai The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned former Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte for over six hours in connection with the money laundering case against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Kunte was earlier summoned by ED on November 25 for answering questions related to the probe into the allegations against Deshmukh and transfers and postings of state police officers. However, he had then informed the agency that he won’t be able to join the probe due to some important meetings. Now that he has retired from the service on November 30, he visited the ED office in Ballard estate on Tuesday morning and joined the investigation. Sources said that ED is trying to collect strong evidence against Deshmukh, whom the agency has arrested on November 2 in the PMLA case, to also prove the allegations of bribery in transfer and postings of senior police officers. Presently, Deshmukh is in judicial custody. Earlier, the ED questioned transportation minister Anil Parab and Bajrang Kharmate in this case. Kharmate’s name had cropped up in the statement of dismissed API Sachin Vaze and some other witnesses in the PMLA case against Deshmukh. The anti-money laundering agency on September 30 had also questioned Kailash Gaikwad, a deputy secretary in the home department in connection with this case. Gaikwad was part of the IPS officers transfer process. The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him are false. The Central agency has alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze — who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases — collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-questions-ex-chief-secy-for-six-hours-in-money-laundering-case-101638887590869.html

A bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav directed the senior NCP leader to file an affidavit before the next hearing on December 10 explaining why the court must not take any adverse action against him for the breach of undertaking.Dnyandev Wankhede had approached the HC on Monday through senior counsel Birendra Saraf, seeking an urgent hearing. On Tuesday, Saraf submitted portions of an interview that Malik had given recently to a regional newspaper wherein he had made the alleged defamatory comments.Saraf said that though Malik had reiterated the assurance in the consent terms filed by him for re-hearing of the interim application in the defamation suit on November 29, on two instances he continued his attack on the Wankhede’s. On perusing the documents, the bench sought to know whether the statements by Malik were made in his personal capacity or as a minister. “If he has done so in his personal capacity then we will summon him here right now,” said the bench. Advocate Karl Tamboly for Malik on instructions informed the bench that the statements had been made in his capacity as spokesperson of the NCP and not as an individual. Thereafter the bench observed that prima facie it seemed that Malik has breached the assurance made before the court and directed him to file an affidavit explaining why no action of contempt of court should be taken against him for wilfully breaching the statement recorded in the order.The appeal filed by Wankhede had been filed challenging the single judge bench order of justice Madhav Jamdar in the interim application in the defamation suit filed against Malik. Wankhede had sought interim injunction against Malik from making any comments or posting anything online till the defamation suit was decided. However the single judge bench had refused to pass any order of injunction against Malik and had directed him to reasonably verify the content pertaining to Wankhede or his family before posting it.Wankhede had filed the defamation suit after Malik had posted the birth certificate of Sameer Wankhede and claimed that he was a Muslim and his father’s name was Dawood. Wankhede had claimed in the suit that the post was made by Malik as an act of revenge as his son-in-law Sameer Khan had been arrested by the NCB in January and kept behind bars for eight months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-observes-that-nawab-malik-prima-facie-violated-undertaking-to-court-asks-him-to-respond-101638887290830.html

As elected representatives of the people, irrespective of party lines, we have chosen to appeal to the government of India through the right process to bring reassurance to the people of the state that AFSPA should be repealed in our state,” the minister said.Along, who is also the Nagaland BJP unit president, assured that the state BJP will also be putting up the views and sentiments of the Naga people on AFSPA to the party’s central leadership immediately.On a query of how the recent incident in Mon district could impact the ongoing peace talks, Kronu said that the core committee on Naga Political Issue is scheduled to meet on December 9 to discuss further on the matter.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is also the convener of the North East Democratic Alliance and has had parleys with the Naga peace process negotiating parties along with CM Rio, is also expected to attend the meeting in Kohima on December 9.Kronu also said the cabinet was briefed about the action taken by the government after the killing of 14 civilians and the investigation of the special investigation team (SIT) headed by the inspector general of police.The Cabinet was informed about the ground report submitted by the director-general of police, which said that the Army personnel tried to take away bodies of six persons, who were mistaken to be insurgents.The cabinet desired that the SIT formed by the latter completes its investigation and submit a report to the government within a month, Kronu said.The government spokesperson informed that among the 30 injured in the December 4 firing incident, two persons are still under critical care in a hospital at Dibrugarh, six are undergoing treatment in Dimapur and 22 have been discharged from hospital care.“Situation (in Mon district) is now under control. I have just spoken with the deputy commissioner there,” Kronu added.The state cabinet also decided to call off the remaining three days of the ongoing 22nd edition of its iconic Hornbill Festival in solidarity with the Konyak community who lost 14 young men in the firing incidents in Mon district on December 4 and 5.“The state cabinet has decided that all activities of the ongoing Hornbill Festival should be ceased in view of the demand of the mourning announced for the deceased in the firing incidents in Mon district and the demand of various civil society not to hold the activities,” Kronu said.The Hornbill Festival, an annual ten-day cultural and tourism extravaganza in which the different Naga tribes showcase their rich traditions, began on December 1.Six tribes from Eastern Nagaland-- Konyak, Khiamniungan, Phom, Sangtam, Yimkhiung and Chang withdrew from the ongoing Hornbill Festival.According to tourism department officials, the festival had 56356 visitors during the first five days this year. In 2019, the department recorded 2,82,811 footfalls to the 20th edition of the festival. Last year, the event was held virtually due to the global Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-cabinet-to-recommend-immediate-repeal-of-afspa-after-14-die-in-botched-op-101638886511920.html
07-12-2021||Mumbai||32 ha of mangrove forests may be diverted for JNPT-Navi Mumbai coastal road||Mumbai The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) has sought to divert just over 32 hectares of mangrove forests (equal to three-and-a-half Oval Maidans) in Raigad district for its proposed 10km six-lane coastal road from Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Uran’s Nhava village to Amra Marg in Navi Mumbai. The road will pass via the under-construction Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL). The first phase of the project will connect Amra Marg to MTHL across 7.02 km, including a 1.2km Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) link. Phase two will connect the MTHL to JNPT across 3.08 km. The total cost of the project is pegged at ₹681 crore.CIDCO’s proposal has not yet received stage-1 forest clearance from the state government and has in fact been pending for almost two years. The proposal is currently being examined by the divisional forest officer (Alibaug) who, after finalising land allocation for compensatory afforestation, will forward it to the Thane Circle office for further consideration. The proposed mangrove areas for diversion are located in Targhar, Vahal and Gavan villages.In a letter dated November 8, 2021, the DCF (Alibaug) wrote to the general manager (environment) at CIDCO stating that of the 126 hectares of land it has proposed for compensatory afforestation, a significant portion already falls under the jurisdiction of the state mangrove cell’s ‘Coastal Belt Working Circle’ and does not meet the criteria for CA. “The rules under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, say that when forest land is diverted, compensatory afforestation must be carried out on land which is currently not recognised as a protected area. We will identify an appropriate location and resubmit the proposal for compensatory afforestation,” said a CIDCO official privy to the development, adding that the project has already received coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance by the state coastal zone management authority in March 2019.“This development will especially improve connectivity between South Mumbai and the proposed Navi Mumbai airport via the MTHL bridge. In the Ulwe area, service lanes are planned in addition to the six-lane carriageway so that nodal traffic can also benefit without disrupting the journeys of those travelling to and from the airport. Existing routes in the area along National Highway 4B and State Highway 54 will also be decongested as a result of this project,” said the CIDCO official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/32-ha-of-mangrove-forests-may-be-diverted-for-jnpt-navi-mumbai-coastal-road-101638886450608.html
07-12-2021||Mumbai||Orders of chief justice as master of the roster can’t be questioned: HC||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday held that as Master of the Roster, the chief justice has absolute power to assign a matter to a particular bench and the unfettered discretion cannot be called in question in any proceeding. The division bench of Justice Gautam Patel and Justice Madhav Jamdar said that it is very well settled that a litigant has the right to obtain a listing and can’t insist on listing his or her matter before a particular Bench. “To which Bench that matter should be assigned is an absolute, unfettered and untrammelled power that vests, and vests only, in the Chief Justice,” it said. The court was hearing a petition filed by eight Borivali residents, engaged in a legal battle with developer Aakar Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd. Under the administrative order of the chief justice, their matter was retained for hearing before another division bench, even after change in assignment, under which the class of matters was assigned to the bench headed by the chief justice himself. They had challenged the March 2 order of the chief justice, rejected their representation to list the matter before his bench, allowed the other bench to continue to hear the matter. Their counsel, advocate Vijay Kurle, pointed out from the Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) that after the change of Roster earlier bench can retain old matters as “part-heard” only on joint request of all the parties. Kurle submitted that though the chief justice is the master of the roster, he too is bound by terms.He maintained that no matter how wide or expansive his administrative powers as the Master of the Roster, the Chief Justice cannot deviate from the protocol. “To permit a deviation would lead to an unthinkable or chaotic situation where matters could randomly be assigned to this or that Bench without any accountability and without any transparency,” he asserted. The court, however, accepted the submissions advanced by advocate Sudeep Nargolkar, who represented the high court registry, and advocate Anuj Desai, who represented the developer, that there is no constraint on the powers of the chief justice as master of the roster and his administrative directions assigning a matter to a particular bench cannot be subjected to judicial review. “It is for the Chief Justice and the Chief Justice alone to decide whether or not a particular matter or class of matters should be taken by a particular Bench and what the composition of that Bench should be,” said the bench. The bench clarified that the requirement of adherence to roster is not only for administrative efficiency but also to guard against forum shopping and also to prevent an odd, errant Judge from wrongly keeping a matter to himself or herself. “If his authority in administrative matters of setting a roster is to be constantly called into question or sought to be restricted or trammelled because it suits a particular litigant to do so at a particular time, the entire administrative edifice would simply collapse,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/orders-of-chief-justice-as-master-of-the-roster-can-t-be-questioned-hc-101638886210533.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Marvel of science that’s gifted love and comfort||Each time I’m on a video call with my sister, our conversation is inevitably interrupted by her calls to a legion of house help. “Paani dena, Raju,” followed by an irritable “table ke peechhe kyun nahi saaf kiya, Reena?” are almost constants on every call. Under usual circumstances this wouldn’t have affected me, however, now it does. A geographical change of location has led me to transforming myself into a cook, a gardener, a cleaner in addition to a mother, a referee, and a bad cop that I already was. On hearing of my exaggerated plight, my cousin gifted me a Roomba!Now I have always been in awe of what science has enabled man to accomplish. Right from being able to gallivant to the moon to being able to communicate across the globe in seconds, science has empowered mankind to push its limits. However, the Roomba has enabled man (or woman in my case), to perch herself atop a sofa and calmly sip kahwa, while it removes every speck of dust and dirt in the house with precision that would impress the finickiest of memsaabs! Of course, every now and then it manages to get entangled in the curtains, but it promptly sends me a text on my phone, peppered with humour. I laugh as I read, “I’m stuck on a cliff, please help!” I put down my second cup of kahwa, and rush to disentangle the poor thing. As soon as it liberates itself from the endless vanes of the blinds, it gets down to business. Vroooom it goes, picking remnants on its way, going under every nook and cranny. Once it finishes its job, it goes back to the charging station, though not without informing me first. “Job completed,” it says before sashaying down and parking itself in its home charger. After relishing my tea, I go and empty its belly of muck, marvelling at it incredulously. God bless the brains of MIT. Thank you for this miracle.I have begun to cheerily greet Roomba each morning. “Aa gaye tusi?” I ask it, with great love and affection, as it goes about leaving an irresistibly clean streak in the house. Interestingly, I notice that my newfound camaraderie with the Roomba has evoked envy among my husband and children. “I chopped such fine onions the other day, I didn’t even get a thank you from you and look at the way you cosy up to the Roomba!” he says, almost accusingly. “Yes mama”, the little ones join in, “you scowl at me when I forget math tables, but you never lose your cool when Roomba foolishly entwines itself in the curtains.” Sensing the revolt, I take on a defensive tone. “But Roomba never answers me back, never delays a chore, and does exactly as I say,” I assertively side with my new friend. “Fine, we’ll be better than Roomba. You’ll see,” they announce in unison, while actually remembering to put their dishes in the sink and cleaning up after them. Well, well. The Roomba has certainly led to some healthy competition in the house. Humour aside, it feels that with all the science marvels in the world, our needs continue to remain quite primal. We all hanker after love and comfort. We crave attention from the people in our lives. With the extra hours that science helps us save, what do we do? We spend them most wisely by sipping hot cups of kahwa with our loved ones. seeratsandhu25@yahoo.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/marvel-of-science-that-s-gifted-love-and-comfort-101638885130387.html

07-12-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: A welcome stride towards making streets walkable||Pune: On November 15, 2021, an order was passed by Hon’ble Justice Najmi Waziri in the Delhi High Court. The order asks the engineers of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation to traverse the entire colony’s footpaths on a wheelchair without any aid or assistance from anyone, to test the efficacy of efforts to make the streets and footpaths user-friendly. “The constitutional guarantee of freedom of movement should not be hemmed-in by the lack of requisite civic amenities”, the order says. The concern of the high court is relevant in almost all Indian cities and has prompted the Sustainable Mobility Network of India (SUM Net) to give a call for a National Pedestrians’ Day. Pune has declared December 11 as Pune Pedestrians’ Day. Among the events planned for the day, a unique rally at the pedestrians’ plaza in Aundh would interest the honourable judge, and of course Punekars. Sugamya Aundh The “sugamya”, which means “universally accessible”, design of ITI Road, Aundh will be celebrated with the rally, in which people in wheelchairs, families with prams, and those with shopping carts and wheeled luggage are expected to participate. The street design efforts in Aundh by Prasanna Desai over the last few years have included several rounds of discussions with citizens, “Streets for People” workshops, and live demonstrations supported by Centre for Environment Education. So far about 2km of streets in Aundh have been re-designed as part of the Smart City projects and other streets have work in progress. Architect and urban designer Prasanna Desai, who has been instrumental in the Aundh street designs and the citizens’ participation efforts says, “The message of Sugamya Aundh is that all our streets can and must be user-friendly. Accessible, safe, comfortable streets are a human right.”Sugamya Aundh is part of the Pune Pedestrians’ Day, declared by the mayor, and being celebrated on December 11, Saturday, through events and refurbishment of pedestrian facilities. Vijay Kulkarni, head of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) road department, is leading the preparations for Pedestrians’ Day. “On major roads, the department is arranging to repair and clear footpaths of obstructions, trim overgrown vegetation branches on footpaths, repair subways, streetlights, and signage”, he has informed. Open street mall A central attraction will be a day-long pedestrians-only “open street mall” at Laxmi road. Punekars will be able to experience the stretch from Nagarkar Talim chowk to Umrya Ganpati as a lively space for some peaceful window or real shopping, without fear of being knocked down. PMC is requesting visitors and staff of shops and offices to avoid bringing their bikes and cars. Public transport utility Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) will arrange extra buses to help reduce traffic jams and parking woes. New pedestrian facilities At Pashan Sus road, a new cycle track and footpath have been developed by PMC as part of the “Streets for People” initiative of the ministry of housing and urban affairs. These facilities will be inaugurated on Pedestrians’ Day along with plantation at this site. The road department, with design inputs from the NGOs Parisar and ITDP, is developing safer midblock crossings including raised crossings, zebra crossings, and signage on Senapati Bapat road, and improving the footpath and junctions on Prabhat road and Gulvani Maharaj Road in Kothrud. Walking happiness index Over the past few days, students from the Aaayojan College of Architecture have been supported and guided by experts from SUM Net and NP Associates to assess eight selected streets for the safety and comfort of pedestrians. The results will be shared on December 11 and a “Walking Happiness Index” will be launched by PMC with the scores for Pune for 2021. Transport planner Pranjali Deshpande who designed the index says “Walking Happiness is a combination of the safety, comfort and pleasure of pedestrians. The index is not a technical audit. It has ten simple parameters that anyone would be concerned about while walking.” The efforts by PMC and civil society groups like Parisar and Save Pune Traffic Movement are laudable and give hope for the safety and comfort of pedestrians. There is a long way to go since Pune has around 2,000 kilometres of streets and less than 10% have been re-designed with some measure of pedestrian-friendliness. The Pedestrians’ Day is an occasion to celebrate and appreciate PMC and citizens’ collaborative efforts over the past few years and to renew the commitment to inclusive, safe streets.

He served as a deputy chief minister to Manohar Parrikar after the latter engineered a split in the Goa Congress then led by chief minister Francisco Sardinha, who himself led a faction of Congress MLAs that dethroned his predecessor chief minister Luizinho Faleiro.Naik didn’t specify reasons for his resignation but said he would speak about the issue in the evening, at his planned induction. “I have resigned as an MLA. I will speak about it later in the evening,” Naik said as he exited the Goa Legislative Assembly after submitting his resignation.Naik is the third MLA in recent weeks to resign following Luizinho Faleiro who joined the TMC and Jayesh Salgaocar of the Goa Forward who also joined the BJP.Naik was widely speculated to be joining the BJP despite ‘on the record’ denials by both the Naik camp and the BJP camp who were insisting that no final decision was taken.Congress leaders said the veteran politician has been considered persona non grata for all practical purposes by the party leadership after his two sons, Ritesh and Roy, joined the BJP in August last year.Naik, a veteran politician spent a little over two years as Goa chief minister across multiple terms whilst also having served as a member of parliament for a brief term between 1998 and 1999 representing North Goa.Naik brings with him a controversial past with the mother of murdered British teenager Scarlett Keeling testifying before the trial court that Naik, who was the then home minister under the Digambar Kamat government, was protecting his son Roy Naik, who she alleged was among those who supplied drugs to her daughter.Scarlett Keeling, a British teenager, was found dead, unclothed on the Anjuna beach in Goa with the police initially saying she died of drowning.The state BJP had earlier justified Roy’s joining the BJP last year saying, it was not the same Roy they had accused in the past of being involved in the drug trade.“There are so many Roys. This is Roy Ravi Naik. Our party has never made any allegation against Roy Ravi Naik, if you have the proof, please show me. Then I will speak,” state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said in August 2020.Besides Ravi Naik, independent MLA and minister of art and culture in the Pramod Sawant cabinet Govind Gaude who was elected with the support of the BJP is expected to join the BJP in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-mla-ravi-naik-resigns-ahead-of-joining-bjp-101638878770039.html

Police said that Faruqui’s name was removed from the promotional posters for the show, but they will get clarity on the status of the show on Tuesday after meeting the organisers and the mall management. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that they received the complaint on Monday and were reviewing it. “We will ensure that law and order situation is maintained and will discuss with the organisers and mall authorities regarding the complaint before taking any action,” he said. Yadav said they will deploy two teams at the spot to ensure no one creates a ruckus. “Anyone found unnecessary loitering around the show , strict action will be taken against that person. We will not allow anyone to create a nuisance,” he said. Arun Yadav, IT head of Haryana unit of BJP, who is a complainant in the case, said, “Faruqui has been continuously hurting the feelings of Hindu community at large on open platforms such as live performances and shows. We will not allow him to perform in the comedy show in Gurugram,” he said. The BJP leader said they have requested police not to give permission to the organisers for his presence in the show that can lead to disruption of peace in the city. Mubin Tisekar, founder of The Entertainment Factory, organisers of the show, said , “It was a joint decision of Faruqui and him that he should not perform for public safety as many messages were making rounds on social media and we do not want to land in any controversy.” Despite repeated attempts, Faruqui could not be reached for comment.Because of his alleged derogatory statements during shows, Faruqui’s multiple shows have been cancelled across the country in the past two months. The latest was the cancellation of his Bengaluru event which was scheduled on Sunday. After the cancellation, he wrote on social media, “Hatred won and the artiste lost”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-complaint-against-faruqui-show-in-gurugram-101638877448821.html

07-12-2021||Other||Gurugram: Construction activities continue despite ban, say residents||Residents have alleged that construction work in several colonies is going on despite a ban on such activities in the district. In the past few days, many residents from areas such as Sector 4, Sector 12A, DLH Phase 2, and Sector 65 have raised the matter on social media. “It does not seem like there is a ban on construction activities, as construction of houses is being done openly, causing dust pollution in the area,” said Deepak Bhardwaj, a resident of 12A. Gaurav Wahi, a resident of DLF Phase 2, said, “Construction activities are being carried out openly by some builders in our residential area. At least four to five houses are being constructed in DLF 2 despite a ban by the Supreme Court in the wake of deteriorating air quality in the National capital Region.” Last week, the Haryana government banned construction activities in 14 NCR districts of the state, including Gurugram, till further orders, in the wake of the deterioration in air quality in the region. On November 24, the Supreme Court reimposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR. The ban on construction activities in the NCR was lifted on November 22 in view of the improved air quality.The residents said that they have also noticed several incidents of solid waste burning in the past few days.On Sunday night, an incident of waste burning was reported from Sector 60, which is the third complaint from the area in the past two weeks, they claimed. Dharamvir Singh, a resident of Sector 87 who frequently reports about waste burning to authorities, said, “Waste burning is rampant in Gurugram, be it near Sector 60 or in our locality. If a patrolling team comes on a daily basis to our area, then they will see the clear violations of the Grap norms with waste being burnt almost every day.”  The Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures, which came into force in the NCR from October 15, include stringent action against open garbage burning in landfills and other spaces, regular mechanised sweeping and water sprinkling on roads with high dust, and strict vigilance to control any visible pollution, among others. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (north) of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “We will check with the agencies concerned on these violations and what action is being taken by them. We are continuously patrolling different parts of the city and fines are being imposed for all violations. Till now, fines of over ₹1.29 crore have been issued in the region this year for violating anti-pollution norms.” Meanwhile, on Monday, the air quality in Gurugram again slipped into ‘very poor’ zone. The air quality index (AQI) of the city was 306 at 4pm on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a rise from Sunday’s reading of 277.

He has been told to appear before the trial court for the hearing in his case.Taslim Ali’s lawyer Ehtesham Hashmi said it was unfortunate that the four men arrested by the police for thrashing the bangle seller got bail in 30 days but it took him more than three months to be released on bail.In his petition for bail, Hashmi said Taslim Ali hadn’t molested the young girl but was falsely implicated after he filed a complaint against a group of men who allegedly thrashed him on August 22 in Indore’s Govind Nagar area after finding out that he was a Muslim. An FIR was registered late in the night after some Muslims staged a protest outside the Banganaga police station.The following day, Taslim Ali was accused of inappropriately touching a 13-year-old girl and arrested.The first information report (FIR) registered against Taslim Ali was filed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and IPC sections 420 (cheating) and 471 (using fake documents as real ones).Ehtesham Hashmi called the FIR levelling the molestation charge at Taslim Ali “a brute abuse of power”. Hashmi said there was no mention of the molestation charge in the widely-circulated video of Taslim Ali’s thrashing. “No one uttered anything about this charge,” Hashmi added.After the video emerged, Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said Taslim Ali was using a fake identity and passing himself off as Hindu. “The man was selling bangles by changing his name. People recovered two Aadhaar cards from his possession with a Hindu name and thrashed him. But they cannot take law into their own hands, so we have registered a case against them.” Mishra said.

We will eradicate the sand mafia from Punjab and credit that money into the account of women that will cost nearly ₹10,000 crore. Still, we will save half the money that will be used in giving other facilities to people,” he said. Kejriwal was accompanied by Punjab AAP president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, former inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh and Balkar Singh, the party halqa in-charge of Kartarpur constituency of Jalandhar. “I want to tell my mothers and sisters this is Kejriwal’s guarantee and not the ghar ghar naukri card of Captain (job for every household promised by former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh). Whatever I commit, will be fulfilled,” said Kejriwal, adding that “AAP volunteers will go to every village and street of the Punjab for the registration process when the party is elected.” “There’s illegal mining going on in Chamkaur Sahib constituency of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi.

The Article empowers the competent authority to dismiss, remove or reduce in rank persons employed in civil capacities under the union or state governments without conducting a departmental inquiry.“Nagar has been placed under suspension with effect from November 18 since his arrest. There is not an iota of doubt that the defaulter has acted in the most reprehensible manner, which is not expected from a member of services,” the chief secretary’s order said.“The defaulter has exhibited grave misconduct. Such immoral activities bring severe disrepute to the state government. His continuation in service will be detrimental to public interest and discipline,” the order read.The order added that if Nagar remained posted as the HPSC deputy secretary, which is a high-level post, his associates and he could intimidate witnesses giving evidence against him.“Nagar was the custodian of all relevant records and there is no surety of sanctity of the record kept by him. Therefore, it is not possible to conduct the inquiry. The competent authority has the above reasons to believe to dispense with the departmental proceedings,” the order said.The order said search at Nagar’s residence led to seizure of ₹12 lakh cash and during interrogation he confessed that he had parked money with his associate from whom Rs. 2.10 crore cash was recovered.“Thus, ₹3.5 crore cash has been seized so far during the course of investigation. Further, a hand-written list of roll numbers of the HCS exam was recovered from Nagar’s wallet. This included the roll numbers of successful candidates. Nagar stated that he had asked for a random check of OMR sheets on pretext of verifying the correctness of the scanning and made sure that the list included the roll numbers of the candidates whose scores had to be altered,” the order said.It said interrogation of three accused has revealed that around 30-32 candidates were involved in all as per the accused (15 HCS candidates, of whom five passed, and 17 dental surgeon candidates of whom 13 had passed).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hpsc-recruitment-scam-deputy-secy-anil-nagar-dismissed-from-service-101638871388080.html

The Congress leader was referring to Yadav’s recent remarks that her party would end up with zero seats in next year’s assembly elections in the northern state, likely to take place in February-March.“Akhilesh Yadav might be an astrologer that he feels that Congress will get zero seats. We’ll see what happens,” Gandhi said, according to news agency ANI. 2 meetings took place with Congress workers on UP elections.

The experiment, however, ended in disaster, with the alliance winning just 54 seats in the 403-member assembly; while the SP won only 47 seats, Congress candidates were victorious in just seven constituencies.Further, the Samajwadi Party’s individual tally fell by 177 seats from five years earlier, as it formed a majority government in 2012, when 224 SP candidates emerged victorious.A chance meeting between Yadav and Gandhi in October led to speculations that the two parties might join hands again. However, while the Sonia Gandhi-led party decided to go alone, Akhilesh has formed an alliance with a host of parties, including Jayant Chaudhary’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and OP Rajbhar, a former ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/we-will-see-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-responds-to-astrologer-akhilesh-yadav-101638870387393.html

07-12-2021||Delhi||Unmasked weddings: Peer pressure or make-up woes?||To wear or not to wear a mask is the question that denizens have been pondering at weddings. And quite visibly, many wedding guests are letting go of the guard when turning up for #DilliwaliShaadi. Stating flimsy reasons such as the mask spoiling makeup and difficulties in devouring shaadi wale snacks, many are justifying their act. And some say that it’s mostly the peer pressure that’s to be blamed. But is that worth taking the risk? Ayushi Singhal, homemaker and an influencer mum based in Punjabi Bagh, says, “I’ve attended two weddings this season, and abhi tak I haven’t spotted anybody wearing a mask. With the Omicron threat looming large, it’s shocking to see guests at weddings deciding to not mask up. The main reason they say is that it’s super uncomfortable to dance and enjoy at a wedding with the mask on. But is that really worth the risk?” “Being a bridesmaid, wearing a mask at a wedding was quite difficult for me especially when running errands,” says Sanya Bachhan, an IT professional from Gurugram, adding, “I paid so many grands for the makeup and didn’t want it to get smudged... Earlier, mostly the bride and groom and their close family members used to unmask themselves for the ceremony. But now I see more and more people feel it’s OK to unmask to enjoy a wee bit since they are fully vaccinated.”“Jab ghar ke functions the toh we knew everyone is vaxxed and were fine with people removing their masks to socialise, but not at the wedding which has so many people,” says Sonam Malhotra, a ticketing executive from Gurugram, adding, “Don’t know how there’s a trust build up ki mask utarke sab ek saath baith sakte hain. Aisa karne se chehre toh pehchaan mein aa payenge, but how can you be sure to not carry back home the virus? It’s extremely risky what people are doing.” Sharing her experience, Samridhi Verma, a teacher based in Kalkaji Extension, recalls her cousin’s wedding saying, “It was a night event and enjoy karte time kisi ne bhi mask nahi pehena. And one of my other cousins who has asthma and came wearing a mask also let her guard down seeing others. It’s wrong to feel peer pressure.”Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

West Champaran’s Child Welfare Committee,chairperson Aditya Kumar said the search for a visually challenged beggar’s daughter from North 24 Parganas who had been trafficked from the neighbouring state with the promise of landing a lucrative job, also led to the rescue of 10 other minors. “Efforts are on to restore them with their family,” Kumar said.

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Cong doing drama over welfare promises: Capt Amarinder Singh||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday opened the office of his new party — Punjab Lok Congress — in Chandigarh, and sharpened his attack against the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government, alleging “drama” over welfare works.“They are just doing dramas. They very well know that nothing is going to happen and in just two weeks, the model code of conduct will come into force,” he said, referring to the upcoming Assembly polls. “Corruption has increased in the past two months in the state,” he added.Interacting with the reporters in Chandigarh, Singh also confirmed that talks were on with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the breakaway Akali faction led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), for a poll alliance. “Our party, Sukhdev Dhindsa’s party and BJP will have a seat-sharing arrangement. I can’t tell you the exact number... We will have an in-principle alliance,” he said.Asked whether he expected to be the chief ministerial candidate of the alliance, he said: “All alliance partners will decide on the Chief Ministerial face.”Singh quit the Congress in September this year, after his unceremonious exit as the chief minister following a bitter power tussle with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu.At the event, Singh also claimed that he was “still the number one” in Punjab politics.“I am still the number one in the state. We are getting reports from urban and rural areas of the state and there is a support building in our favour. We will do a clean sweep in the polls and form the government,” he said.
07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The rooster lives on||Times change. But things remain. Just like Old Delhi’s nameless but immortal rooster.Until before the pandemic arrived in early 2020, this rooster’s world had an unremarkable routine. Everyday, Muhammed Aijaz “Chickenwale” would run his knife through some 50 chickens in his busy meat shop in Chitli Qabar Chowk, while this wooden rooster, beautifully polished, would grace a pride-of-place spot in a corner, like a drawing-room showpiece.The rooster was actually destined for Paris. Some years ago, a French student at Delhi University received it as a gift from her philosophy professor. It was meant for the student’s mother in Montparnasse, Paris, who collected wooden roosters from around the world. But the night before her departure from Delhi, the student realised that the rooster just wouldn’t fit into her luggage. She guiltily left it behind with a friend in the Walled City. He tossed it into garbage, but his neighbour retrieved it, and gifted it to the friendly “Bhai Aijaz”.And so the rooster, intended to adorn a Parisian apartment, instead passed its days at the Walled City shop, perched atop cages packed with chickens.The second pivotal event concerning the rooster took place last year in June when the meat shop’s owner died from heart failure, aged 56. The business was taken over by his son, Muhammed Shariq, but the shop never regained its pre-pandemic buzz. The young man would be seen sitting idle with a few chickens hopping inside the cages. Meanwhile, the rooster disappeared from view.A month ago, the wind of change blew again. The enterprising Shariq, who once convinced his father to turn the paan shop into a meat shop, now converted the meat shop into a grocery, and had it inaugurated by the local municipal councillor. This afternoon, the place is looking completely transformed, gleaming with a new wallpaper. The chicken cages have given way to packets of KricKket (sic) chocolates, Maggi noodles, Nihari masala… but where’s the old rooster?Shariq instantly stretches his arm towards an upper shelf. The next moment, he is holding the rooster, coated in dust, which wafts towards the street like slow-moving winter mist. The new grocer now gladly poses with his late father’s prized possession, a souvenir of lasting continuity in his rapidly changing world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-rooster-lives-on-101638837621633.html

Women are eligible for discounts for consuming alcohol. Today more than 800 new liquor shops have been opened in residential areas, colonies and even in non-conforming zones,” the MP said.To be sure, while the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 does not mention the reduction of the legal drinking age to 21 years, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced in March that the government has decided to reduce the age bar in the new policy. A senior excise department official clarified to HT that the legal drinking age in Delhi continues to be 25 years.With the new excise policy, the state has completely exited the liquor business and has no control on discounts. Stores are free to decide and offer discounts on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/holding-liquor-bottle-package-in-parl-bjp-mp-slams-delhi-govt-s-excise-policy-101638836731245.html

07-12-2021||Delhi||Lockdown not on cards after Omicron case, says Delhi health minister Jain||A day after the first case of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was detected in the national capital, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said a lockdown was not on the cards at the moment, and that the graded response action plan to combat Covid-19 will come into action if the number of cases starts increasing, as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged residents of the city not to panic.“There is no possibility of a lockdown at the moment. The graded response action plan will be implemented if Covid-19 cases start increasing,” said Jain. The plan has levels of restrictions such as closure of restaurants, malls, offices, and educational institutes as the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive – increases. Hospitals have also been asked to scale up their Covid-19 infrastructure accordingly. The graded response action plan is a mechanism similar to one used to fight air pollution.It classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.Private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to the action plan, which was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Jain added that 27 people who are suspected to have been infected with the Omicron variant have been admitted to Lok Nayak hospital. Of them, 17 have been confirmed to have Covid-19 either through RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Test. The results of genomic sequencing for the rest are awaited.The first Omicron case was detected in Delhi on Sunday, and so far 23 cases have been genotyped across the country.The variant was first detected in South Africa towards the end of November and has since been detected in several countries.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged people not to panic because of the variant.“The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has now entered India. We are constantly receiving news regarding patients being found in this region, that region, and even in Delhi. However, I would like to tell everyone that there is no need to panic or lose sleep over it. I am constantly monitoring the situation and progress being made to deal with the possible threat of the spread of Omicron,” he said in a digital press briefing on Monday.“I held a review meeting last week as well in relation to this, where we took account of all the necessary health facilities and their status, from beds to oxygen to medicines and all other necessary equipment. We are prepared to provide all this and other required material in sufficient quantity and on time. So there’s no need to get stressed or panic. But keep doing your part – continue social distancing and never step out without wearing a mask,” Kejriwal added.On November 30, Kejriwal held a meeting to review the state’s preparedness against Covid in case a third wave emerges in the country. Kejriwal had then announced that 30,000 Covid-19 beds are ready in Delhi, with 100 beds per ward to be arranged as and when required on a two-week notice taking the total bed capacity of Delhi to over 64,000 beds. Additionally, 6,800 ICUs will also be ready very soon. Medicine stocks are currently being added, and home isolation arrangements are being strengthened. Oxygen supply and storage is being bolstered, with extra storage facilities of 442 MT, and production of 121 MT oxygen within Delhi. Additionally, telemetry devices to provide real time oxygen tracking are being installed in all oxygen facilities. Around 6,000 oxygen cylinders have been imported and 15 oxygen tankers bought to prevent oxygen shortage, the CM then said.The Delhi government has issued a Covid helpline number – 1031, to help Covid patients during any problem. This helpline number works 24x7. It employs employees in three shifts, who can attend 600 to 700 calls.Jain added that more than 93.9% of people have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and more than 61.3% both doses. He also added that the chief minister had written to the Centre urging them to ban flights from affected countries for some time to prevent the disease from spreading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-not-on-cards-after-omicron-case-says-delhi-health-minister-jain-101638834575955.html

The university’s decision comes after the recommendations to revise the rates was made by the university panel that was constituted after receiving the representation from the contractors. The details of the revised rates were sent to the university hostels after the recommendations of the panel were approved by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar. However, students have expressed displeasure over the university’s move. They said the rates have been increased and demanded the rollback. According to students, the rate for a regular meal for boys was around ₹35 which was increased to ₹40 during the lockdown and its rate has been increased to ₹43.50 now. The rate of a regular meal (mess) has been increased to ₹42 and the revised rate of the special meal (boys and girls) is ₹48 now. The revised rate for tea (readymade) is ₹10 while for coffee the rate is ₹19. The rates of a number of other eatables have been revised by the university. National Students Union of India (NSUI) PU president Nikhil Narmeta said, “First the rate of the regular meal was ₹35, then the university increased it to ₹40 and which has been again increased to ₹43.5 now. These rates are higher than any private institution and it should be rolled back.” The Students For Society (SFS) also issued a statement on Monday condemning the increase in the rates and demanded its rollback. “The mess/canteen rates are already higher and students from the marginalised sections and poor economic background find it difficult to continue their studies with such high cost of living.” Terming it an “anti-student” decision and demanding a roll back, the SFS said the decision had come at a time when the families of students are already struggling to cope up with the difficulties due to the pandemic. They also appealed to students to come forward and raise their voices against this decision of the university. University officials did not comment on the matter, however, a hostel warden said the hike was minimal and the prices in the markets had been rising.

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||50 years of 1971 Indo-Pak war: Lt Gen Tej Kumar Sapru recalls para-drop at Tangail||Captain Tej Kumar Sapru (retired as Lt Gen) was commanding a platoon at the Line of Control, Poonch, J&K, when he was informed that he was to be sent to the Eastern Front as an aide-de-camp (ADC). Fifty years later, he shares his experience of the war as he saw it, including some major victories and casualties.The Lt Gen recalls: “Maj Gen Gurbaksh Singh Gill was the GOC of the 101 Communication Zone Area (101 CZA) in 1971 on the Eastern Front. He called up the Commanding Officer to send a replacement for his ADC immediately.”He adds: “Much to my dismay, my name was forwarded for posting as the ADC. I was most unhappy to leave the battalion at that juncture, but there was no way out for me and I landed up in Shillong on November 10, 1971.”The ADC is a French term that means aide-de-camp authorised to senior field Commanders. In Army, the role of the ADC is that of a personal staff officer to the Commander, to assist him in routine personal and administrative matters.He said Gen Gill was a tough taskmaster and known to be a terror of sorts. “I by no chance was too happy being posted to his personal staff.”“What made me feel worse was that 101 CZA was not a normal regular fighting formation like a division or a corps, but primarily a static formation responsible for logistics, administration, communications, repair, supplies, provision of fuel, ammunition, etc, for the Eastern Command Theatre,” the officer said.However, on reporting at the HQ, 101 CZA, he was surprised that the 101 CZA had been involved in the training and organisation of the Mukti Bahini.In November-end as the war clouds started getting thicker, lots of trans-border actions were undertaken by the Army in conjunction with the Mukti Bahini to break the crust of the Pakistani defenses up to a depth of 1 to 3 km.The war started on December 3 evening. The 101 CZA was allotted the 95 Mountain Brigade, which was tasked to capture Jamalpur by December 9 and to be poised towards Tangail.On the evening of December 4, the 31 Baluch Company of Pakistan at the Kamalpur post surrendered to the 95 Brigade. The GOC, Gen Gurbaksh Singh Gill, took the formal surrender the next morning. However, he got critically injured in a mine blast.The para landing at Tangail and capturing the Poongli bridge by the 2 Para was another brilliant success and was a turning point of sorts. It was planned in mid-November by Gen Gill. On December 16 morning, GOC Gen Nagra sent his ADC to the GOC 36 Pak Div, Maj Gen Jamshed with a surrender message: “I am at your door and you may like to surrender.” However, while returning, he got caught up in a crossfire and died.“In spite of being the weakest force of the four main thrusts which went in, the 101 CZA was the first to reach Dacca,” he said.Lt Gen said by virtue of being an ADC, got to see and know a lot more than any junior officer would about the planning and conduct of operations in the Central Sector (from the north). “Juniors don’t get to see things from a bird’s eye view, which I was fortunate to see. Being with the GOC, I could get a fair idea of the plans and conduct of operations in the two formations,” he said.About the veteranName: Lt Gen Tej Kumar Sapru (retd)(72)Retired on November 30, 2009, as GOC-in-C of Western CommandRegiment – 4 Gorkha RiflesAwards - PVSM, YSM
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh ward number 30: Here, garbage rules the roost||Though people living in ward number 30 of the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) are residing in the centre of the City Beautiful, they rue lack of maintenance of the infrastructure and public facilities. Lack of cleanliness, choked sewers, dirty drinking water, inadequate parking space and garbage dumps alongside roads are key issues being faced by the residents.For the residents of the ward, which includes Sector 41, Sector 41 (Buterla) and sector 41 (Badheri village), development works came only when elections were due in some time. Sector 41 and Buterla were earlier part of ward number 19, along with Sector 42. On entering the ward, one can easily spot garbage piles along the roadsides in parks and at marketplaces.“The area has poor sanitation and cleanliness. Sweepers often miss their duties and do not clean roads. As a result, garbage piles get accumulated at public places inviting stray animals and health issues for residents. Also, the door-to-door garbage collection is irregular in the area. Not only this, people have to pitch in their own money to maintain the public parks as the MC is making little effort in making the ward beautiful,” said Abhey Chandel, a resident of Sector 41.Residents said the parks do not have adequate lighting facilities due to which people avoid going there in the evenings.“Councillors usually prefer to carry out developmental works in their own locality and they ignore the other Sectors of the wards. The green belts in Sector 41 are not being maintained well by the MC. The parks do not have facilities like public toilets or drinking water. Besides, the Sector also lacks sanitation and we usually see garbage dumps lying on public places. The markets also need more parking space,” said Dharampal, president, Resident Welfare Association (RWA) Sector 41 D. “The lanes and streets in Buterla are poorly built due to which dirty water enters in people’s houses in the low-lying areas. Also, the area does not have facilities like parks for children. Sweepers dump garbage on the roadsides due to which stray dogs often roam in the lanes, causing inconvenience to people. The Chandigarh MC must ensure basic facilities to the people,” said Priya Sharma, a resident of Buterla. Meanwhile, people living in Badheri village of Sector 41 do not even have access to the basic amenities. People are forced to drink dirty water and live in congested dirty lanes. “Hygiene is a big issue in the area. Garbage is not cleared from roads and parks regularly. Also, lanes are poorly built due to which water gets stagnant in the rainy season. Dangling electricity wires pose a threat to commuters. Residents of Badheri village are living in a mess,” said Bharpur Singh, a local resident.

Though the protest started around 9am, the union members blocked the light-point around 3.30pm. District vice-president of the union, Amandeep Singh said, “In 2017, the Congress government led by Capt Amarinder Singh had dissolved all the truck unions. The step proved to be retrograde as a new syndicate has emerged, which has monopolised the trucking trade, resulting in losses to both owners as well as traders. We demand that the government led by the new CM, Charanjit Singh Channi revive the unions.” The union also demanded an increase in transport rates, stating that the truckers are already suffering due to the economic downturn. Amandeep said the next strategy would be decided as per the decision taken at the state-level, and if required, the union will intensify the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-traffic-on-airport-road-hit-as-truckers-union-blocks-chhat-lightpoint-101638823912133.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Eggs, chicken get dearer as temperatures go down||With temperatures going down in the city, the consumption of chicken and eggs has started to see a rise, leading to the rates of these items to go up, President of the Sector 21 meat market association Ashish Kumar said, “Our sales increase exponentially during winters as people prefer non-vegetarian food around this time. The supply is plenty but broiler meat, which cost around ₹170-180 a kg in November, is now selling at ₹200 per kg and is likely to rise further.” The retail rate of broiler meat is pegged around ₹220 per kg as per Ashok Nagpal, a meat retailer in Sector 21. The price for leg and chest or drumsticks, which people prefer to buy, is even higher. After Covid outbreak last year and avian influenza outbreak this January, the rates of broiler meat had dipped to around ₹150 per kg. But just before the bird flu outbreak, the rates of broiler meat had gone up to ₹240 per kg due to supply shortage. The price of eggs is also on the higher side due to the same reason. Against ₹4.5 an egg in November, the rates have shot up to ₹5.5 per egg at the Sector 21 market. The retail price is around ₹6 an egg; however, it is lower if bought in bulk. Due to scarcity and immunity-building benefits of eggs, last year, its retail price had crossed ₹8 around this period. However, as per Nagpal, the supply of eggs will increase around mid-January and the price will come down again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-eggs-chicken-get-dearer-as-temperatures-go-down-101638823131197.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity area’s weekly Covid tally sees dip but experts advise caution||Tricity’s cumulative Covid-19 cases saw a 15% dip last week (November 29-December 5) as compared to the week before (November 22-November 28) though health experts say the figures are significantly higher than what was recorded in October and early November, indicating that people are showing complacency with regards to virus safety protocols. Of the 93 new cases between November 29 and December 5, 40 infections surfaced in Chandigarh while 39 were in Mohali and 14 in Panchkula. The tricity’s single-day infection tally remained in double digits on five days in the week. Mohali even logged a Covid death during this week.At the peak of the second wave in May, the tricity had recorded 46,245 cases and 790 deaths in just one month. With restrictions on public movement being put in place, the curve started flattening thereon. The weekly cases have been fluctuating ever since, but had never crossed the 100-mark, until the week ending November 28. Though the infection tally started showing an upward trend after mid-November, the positivity rate in all three jurisdictions continues to remain below 1%. In the week ending on December 5, Chandigarh had tested as many as 9,072 people for Covid-19, of which only 40 turned out to be infected, keeping the weekly positivity rate at 0.44%. In Mohali, 9,744 people were tested and 39 were found infected. The weekly positivity rate in Mohali stands at 0.40%.At 0.16%, the positivity rate in Panchkula was even lower with only 14 people testing positive out of the 8,750 tested.Mohali district immunisation officer Dr Girish Dogra said people from all age-groups are testing positive in Mohali and most of them are fully vaccinated. “The maximum cases are coming from Dera Bassi and Kharar. We have increased sampling,” he said. Dr Suman Singh, director health services, Chandigarh, said, “In UT, there are no clusters or hotspots of infection. Only family members of infected persons are testing positive. The infected people include children, youth, working class, elderly.” “Since 100% of the eligible population in Chandigarh have got the first dose of vaccine and 78% are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, all infected people are either fully vaccinated or have got one dose. The vaccination is definitely helping in controlling the severity of the infection and fatality rate as only one in 40 patients requires hospitalisation these days,” said Dr Suman, adding that complacency among people, especially in times of a new variant, can invite another surge.Senior officers from Panchkula said, “We are increasing the daily testing and requesting people to get vaccinated at the earliest. People must follow Covid guidelines to stay safe and help us control transmission.” Meanwhile, 20 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in the tricity in the last 24 hours, of which 12 came from Chandigarh and eight from Mohali. Panchkula didn’t report any new case. The last time Chandigarh recorded 12 cases was on July 2, after which the single-day count remained in single digits. Also, no new fatality was reported in the tricity on Monday.The genome sequencing report of the South African returnee, who tested positive for Covid-19 in Chandigarh on November 29, is likely to be out in a day or two. The genome sequencing reports will confirm if the man is positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The man, along with his wife and maid who had also tested positive later, are isolated at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and their health conditio||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-area-s-weekly-covid-tally-sees-dip-but-experts-advise-caution-101638822891804.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Police’s SIT visits dera headquarters in Sirsa, fails to find Vipassana, Nain||The Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) on Monday visited the Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Haryana’s Sirsa district in connection with the 2015 sacrilege cases but could not trace the sect’s administration wing chairperson Vipassana Insan and vice-chairperson PR Nain who had earlier failed to appear before it despite having summoned them thrice. SIT head inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar along with other members — Batala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mukhwinder Singh, DSP Lakhbir Singh and inspector Dalbir Singh — collected some documents, including papers related to the working of the sect, from the administration wing of the dera. They were accompanied by nearly 15 personnel, including 10-odd men of the local police led by Sirsa SP Arpit Jain. This is the first time that the Punjab Police’s SIT visited the dera in connection with the sacrilege cases. The team also visited the purported residences of three absconding members of sect’s national committee — Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri — on the dera premises. IGP Parmar said, “We checked some residential quarters besides offices in the administration wing. The dera administration assured us that they will produce Vipassana and Nain by the weekend for recording their statements. We will wait till then. Further action will be taken accordingly.” Bareta, Kler and Dhuri are the missing link in three sacrilege incidents that sparked off state-wide protests in 2015, says the SIT. The team claims that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari (Faridkot), Malke (Moga) and Gurusar (Bathinda) were given by Bareta, Kler and Dhuri to the district dera committee members after getting directions from the sect headquarters. The Faridkot police have already issued lookout notices against the three who were declared proclaimed offenders by court. Vipassana and Nain were summoned to appear at the IGP’s Ludhiana office on November 16, 26 and December 3 in connection with an FIR lodged at the Bajakhana police station in Faridkot district on June 2, 2015. The case was registered after a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of the district. The two are also facing allegations of orchestrating violence in Panchkula in August 2017. On November 8, the SIT had questioned dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for seven hours at the Sunaria jail in Rohtak district and submitted a 65-page status report in the Punjab and Haryana high court four days later. 
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana residents fume over poor-quality roadwork, call it ‘wastage of funds’||With the state assembly polls in the offing, MLAs and councillors are hurriedly commissioning developmental projects, but have failed to keep a tab on the quality of the work undertaken, which has left residents fuming over the waste of public funds. Locals say the material used to re-carpet the road in different areas, including Shastri Nagar, Model Town, Jawaddi Road, Kitchlu Nagar, and Sherpur Chowk, had started wearing down after a few days. Political leaders, including senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, have also been complaining about the alleged inferior quality of work in the past. Malhotra had submitted a complaint regarding poor roadwork in Chaura Bazar last month. Lok Insaaf Party councillor Swarandeep Chahal had alleged that inferior quality work had been done while re-carpeting the 7.5-km stretch of the Old GT Road from Sherpur Chowk to Jalandhar Bypass. The project had cost a whopping ₹11.64 crore. Chahal said,”The project had kicked off in mid-November and the material had started peeling off a few days after a portion of the road from Sherpur Chowk to Dholewal Chowk was constructed. After a complaint was submitted, the authorities have now stopped work. The MC should keep a check on the quality of work, otherwise crores will go to waste.”Balpreet Singh, a residents of Shastri Nagar (Block-B), said, “The road in our locality was constructed on November 28, but the material started wearing off the next day. Gravel is spread in the area and it seems like an inadequate amount of bitumen was used when preparing the hot-mix material. A large amount of money is spent on roads ahead of the assembly elections every five years, but no one keeps a check on quality, resulting in wastage of funds.”In mid-November, RTI activist Arvind Sharma had also submitted a complaint saying that the hot-mix material had started peeling off a day after the Ludhiana Improvement Trust finished constructing the Model Town-Jawaddi Road.Experts say two factors may be at play for the material wearing off within a few days. Council of engineers general secretary Sanjay Verma said, “The main reason is that the hot mix material may have been heated over 150°C at the plant itself. This causes the bitumen to burn and it loses its strength. The other reason can be that the material’s temperature may have dropped below 90°C, while it is being laid on the ground. The mercury is dipping ,but roads can be constructed if the temperature is above 10°C.”MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said that with the temperature falling, road construction works are taken up only after monitoring the weather conditions. “Regular monitoring of ongoing works on and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal has also written to the state government requesting third-party inspection of the roads being constructed with MC funds. If residents have an issue in this regard, they should file a complaint and corrective steps will be taken. Action will also be taken against the contractor,” said Dachalwal.Projects worth ₹270 crore approvedMunicipal corporation officials say that road re-carpeting projects worth ₹270 crore have been approved in the past year and work on them is underway. Officials had earlier landed in a soup over spending ₹212 crore on road repair and maintenance work from 2015 to 2020, as mentioned in a reply to a RTI application filed by a city-based activist. Officials, however, said that the entire amount was not spent on repairs but re-carpeting projects and other maintenance works were also included.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-residents-fume-over-poor-quality-roadwork-call-it-wastage-of-funds-101638822351080.html

The five electric poles were to be uprooted from the Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road. While offering chyavanaprash to PSPCL chief engineer Bhupinder Khosla, the NGO members said, “This will help the PSPSL to remember things they have long forgotten. Due to the electric polls, development work on the stretch has been affected and city residents are bearing the brunt for the same. Rahul Verma, a member of the NGO, said, “When the project was initiated at least 2,000 trees were chopped off without delay around the Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road. However, despite submitting a fee for the same, the PSPCL has not shifted the polls.” In a sarcastic dig, Verma also said that the chief engineer should also be presented a trophy for enhancing citizens’ patience. Despite repeated attempts, Khosla could not be reached. Others present on the occasion were Naresh Bansal, Vijay Arora, Satpal Singh and Jagdeep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-two-year-wait-ludhiana-ngo-offers-chyawanprash-to-pspcl-chief-engineer-to-jog-his-memory-101638822233675.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: As rebels group together, parties step-up efforts to placate them||With a grouping of rebel candidates cutting across party lines taking shape and strong prospects emerging of a photo finish in the three-cornered Chandigarh municipal corporation election results, parties are going into an overdrive to placate rebels.Around 12 rebel candidates from Aam Aadmi Party, Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party have so far indicated to put up a joint front against the three parties. They are in talks to formulate a common manifesto in addition to supporting each other on the ground. The parties fear that even in their individual capacities, the rebel candidates can hurt the victory chances of their official candidates.Only three days are left for withdrawal of names. The parties are offering higher level posts, better deals in future, and even getting Delhi-based senior leaders to call up rebels.If the rebel candidates don’t budge, the parties won’t hesitate to raise objections with the state election commission (SEC) about their nominations. On Monday, SEC scrutinised the nomination papers, and some rebel candidates had to run around to clear various objections raised by political parties to their nomination papers.Prem Pal Chauhan, a former organisational secretary of the Congress, who is now contesting as an independent candidate from ward 15, said, “A senior Congress leader on Monday offered me the post of general secretary and also cited my long bond with party so that I withdraw my candidature.”Stating that he wouldn’t budge under the party’s pressure, Harbans Singh Saini, who had been a Congress member since the ‘70s and also served as the vice-president of Chandigarh Indian Trade Union Congress (INTUC), said, “Party colleagues are being sent to convince me to withdraw, but the way the party is being run now is against its own principles.” Congress is facing nearly 12 rebel candidates in different wards. Three of its functionaries even joined the AAP as its candidates after grand old party rejected their claims to party tickets.BJP rebel candidates are also being pursued by the party to rethink their decision to contest against the party as independents. It is also facing challenge of around 10 rebel candidates.Former member national executive committee, SC Morcha, BJP, Narendra Pal Chaudhary, who is a rebel candidate from ward 26, said, “Two senior BJP leaders (Delhi-based) called me up and asked me to meet them on the nomination issue.”Chaudhary couldn’t meet them on Monday. “Later I got to know that one of the party’s candidates has raised objections on my nomination papers. All my day was spent on clearing those objections,” said Chaudhary.Meanwhile, a senior AAP leader conceded that the party is also facing a major rebel candidate challenge. “We are in constant talks with them. In some wards, a difference of 100-200 votes will decide the winner. A rebel candidate will definitely hurt in such scenario.”The pressure is starting to tell also on some candidates. After being denied the AAP ticket from Ward 4, an angry Sahil Chawar, AAP’s youth state general secretary, was gung-ho on working to defeat party’s official candidate.But after getting several calls from the senior party leaders, he is now rethinking his decision. “Local party officials and a senior leader from Delhi called me and assured me of better prospects within the party. They also said there is no point in working against the party when I worked so hard for it all these years,” said Chawar.Papers of 102 candidates rejectedChandigarh: The nomination papers of 102 candidates were rejected on Monday after scrutiny of papers.A total of 214 candidates are left in the fray. The final tally of candidates will be known after the last date of withdrawal of nominations, December 9. A spokesperson for the state election commission said, “The nominations papers of covering candidates and independent candidates were rejected. In some cases where multiple nomination papers were filed by a candidates, one was accepted and rest rejected.”Ward 19 and 21 had five rejections each, the maximum from any ward. The voting will be held on December 24. Results will be declared on December 27.

She said she was either detained at her house and whisked away by police every time she planned a protest.Scores of PDP workers joined her in the protest at Jantar Mantar.“Kashmir has become a prison where people are not allowed to express their opinion. They are being repressed since August 2019 and what surprises me is how the government is busy portraying that everything was hunky-dory in the valley with the help of some of the paid media,” she told reporters.In August 2019, Jammu and Kashmir special status under Article 370 of the Constitution was abrogated and the state was bifurcated into union territories.The former chief minister denied the charge that she raised questions on every police action. “Whenever there is an encounter and a militant gets killed, nobody questions but when a civilian gets killed, only then people come out and start asking questions,” she said.Carrying a placard that read “Kashmir is in pain”, Mehbooba said, “You have seen what happened in Nagaland where 13 civilians were gunned down. An FIR has been lodged immediately. Why does the same not happen in Kashmir as well? Though I do not have much hope that anything is going to come out of these enquiries but still the government is seen acting.” She alleged that corruption was at its peak in Jammu and Kashmir, local residents were being deprived of jobs and blood of innocents was being spilled on roads.“I have come here to tell the people of this country that if they don’t wake up even now, the day is not far when the nation of (Mahatma) Gandhi and (B R) Ambedkar will get converted into (Nathuram) Godse’s country and after that we all will be helpless,” she said.Several photo journalists requested Mehbooba to remove her mask for a better picture but she replied with a visible smile on her face, “if I remove the mask, I can be booked under UAPA immediately”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mehbooba-stages-dharna-at-delhi-s-jantar-mantar-says-kashmir-in-pain-101638822050891.html

Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (Fico) president Gurmeet Singh Kular and general secretary Rajeev Jain met PSPCL (central zone ) chief engineer Bhupinder Khosla and demanded the withdrawal of the penalty notices. Kular said, “Teams of the PSPCL have been carrying out raids on industrial units regarding power intensive units, and have issued a penalty notice for ‘unauthorised use of electricity. We strongly oppose the raids and request that the department issue a warning first and if the corrections are still not made then the department should issue penalty notices. Unauthorised use of electricity does not affect the revenue of PSPCL as much, and the industry is ready to pay the difference in tariff.”FICO general secretary Rajeev Jain said that the industry, particularly micro, small and medium enterprises, are already struggling for their survival due to the losses incurred due the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. During this hour of crisis, imposing raids is unjustified as it will burden the industry, which operates on a limited margin of profit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/withdraw-125-cr-penalty-notices-ludhiana-industrialists-body-to-pspcl-101638821990771.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||PU murder case: Chandigarh police to move court for narco test||After groping in the dark for 32 days, the Chandigarh Police is set to move court to seek permission for narco test of a suspect in the murder of Seema Goyal, wife of Panjab University (PU) professor BB Goyal.The professor’s wife was found dead at their residence on PU campus on the morning of November 4. Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “We will be writing to the court to seek permission for a narco test of victim’s husband to bring out the truth.”It may be mentioned that on the night of murder, Prof Goyal and his wife were alone in the house while their daughter had gone to a friend’s place. Prof BB Goyal had told the police that he had found his wife’s body, with her hands and legs tied up with a cloth, on the ground floor of the house around 7.30am. He told the police he had slept in another room upstairs the previous night and when he woke up, he found the main door locked from outside. Mesh removed from inside suggests forensic report Police have decided to go for a nacro test after the forensic report suggested that the mesh of the doors of a bedroom and kitchen were removed from inside. SSP Chahal added “We are getting another opinion on the forensic report as well.” “The evidence gathered so far is inconclusive and has pointed towards an insider’s job. The forensic report does not clearly state whether the mesh was removed on the night of murder. So to solve this puzzle, permission for narco test will be taken,” said a senior officer of Chandigarh police. Post murder PU enhances security The murder in one of the high-security areas on campus has prompted authorities to enhance security arrangements. A source in the university, on the condition of anonymity, stated that night patrolling has been increased since the murder. “Earlier vehicles entering the campus were checked, but now instructions have been issued to note down the registration numbers as well, especially when vehicles leave campus post 11pm. The resolution of CCTV cameras has also been increased to this effect,” said a university official.

Randhawa, who was at the Patiala central jail to attend a function, said, “ I am picking ‘thorns’ planted by former chief minister Amarinder Singh as his government kept the drug report in an envelope for four-and-a-half years.” He announced to start petrol pumps in 11 jails in the state to “raise funds for the welfare of inmates”. The minister, who also holds the home portfolio, said the state government has decided to grant amnesty to prisoners on the occasion of 400th birth anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur and it would be approved soon. He honoured the winners of the 3rd Punjab Prison Olympics-2021 Games at the central jail. “The government decided to hold these games in jails to give a chance to inmates to become good citizens through sportsmanship. We should promote “functional literacy” among prisoners with ‘Sikhiya daat’. The prisoners who are remorseful shall be allowed to sit with their family members in a room and go through the process of catharsis,” he said. The prison reforms initiated under the leadership of CM Charanjit Singh Channi will transform all the jails in the next two years, he added. He announced to launch a skill development project at the Kapurthala jail on December 10 to make the inmates skilled.

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt in a deep slumber: High court on drug probe||Chandigarh The high court on Monday said the Punjab government has been in a “deep slumber” and wondered why it has not acted upon on findings in drugs cases. The current dispensation, on its part, squarely blamed Captain Amarinder Singh-led previous government for not pursuing drugs cases in a speedy manner, and admitted before court that there was no embargo for the government to take “action” in these cases.Supreme Court lawyer Dushyant Dave and state’s advocate general DS Patwalia told a high court bench that they have advised government to take “action”.At one point when they termed previous government’s response to the cases as “lazy”, the high court bench of justice AG Masih and justice Sandeep Moudgil observed that state had been in “deep slumber” and it wondered why it has not acted upon.The court was hearing a 2013 petition on drugs menace in Punjab. The issue before the court right now is to whether sealed cover reports lying with it are to be opened or not. The reports are on the role of high-profile politicians and police officials in drugs cases. But no substantive hearing has taken place on the issue since mid- 2018, when the last set of reports was filed. Fresh trigger came in August 2021 when Navkiran Singh, an intervener in the matter, filed an application demanding that sealed cover should be opened and state be directed to take action.Prior to this, Punjab’s stand has been that sealed cover reports have been filed before court and any action pursuant to the reports is to be taken after same are opened and on court’s directions.“I have been saying all along, there was no impediment from court to act on reports. The previous advocate general was of the view that ethically, we should wait for court order. Now the new advocate general and SC lawyer have said there was no embargo from the court in taking action. Even now the court says we also wonder why the state did not act,” Navkiran Singh said after the hearing. Now the matter stands adjourned for Thursday, when court will again take up the matter of opening of sealed cover reports.No relief to MajithiaShiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia got no relief from the court on Monday. His counsel, senior advocate, RS Cheema reiterated that Majithia be made a party to the case as his image was being tarnished by his political opponents by linking him to drugs cases. His political opponents were targeting him only for reaping political benefits when the Vidhan Sabha elections are just round the corner, Cheema said specifically naming deputy chief minister, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. However, court did not issue notice on his application nor passed any other order.The court made it clear that it was not concerned about “individuals” and what was happening outside the court. It is a public interest matter and court would proceed with it in larger public interest, the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-in-a-deep-slumber-high-court-on-drug-probe-101638821451755.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Will contest from Amritsar North assembly seat, says AAP’s Kunwar Vijay Pratap||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh on Monday said he will contest the upcoming Punjab assembly elections from the Amritsar North constituency.His party, however, is yet to make any announcement in this regard. Addressing a press conference following an event in Gurdaspur, Kunwar Vijay said, “It was decided the very first day that I will fight from Amritsar North. A formal announcement will be there, but there is no confusion.”Former BJP minister Anil Joshi, who recently joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), represented the Amritsar North segment twice before he lost to Congress’ Sunil Dutti in the 2017 polls. On Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s protest outside AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arwind Kejriwal’s residence, he said, “It will be better if Sidhu protests outside his own CM’s house. Sidhu should get his promise on the eradication of drugs implemented by the state government. If he gets the issue of drugs resolved then we will feel that he really is sympathetic to the cause of Punjab. Even his own government is not listening to him.”Slamming former CM Amarinder Singh, the AAP leader said, “He never came out of his farmhouse during his tenure of four-and-half-years as CM. If the BJP does enter into an alliance with him, it will be an indication that the national party has no leader and agenda for Punjab. People will reject such an alliance. Amarinder in 2017 announced that that was his last election. It will be unfair if he contests once again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-contest-from-amritsar-north-assembly-seat-says-aap-s-kunwar-vijay-pratap-101638821450462.html

Prof Dr Mohammad Salim Khan, head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, and nodal officer for Covid, said there was a mild spike by the October end, which continued in November owing to social gatherings and weddings. “There were violations of social distancing norms during the wedding season in Kashmir. Hence cases increased to some extent by October end. It was a mild spike,” he said.Kashmir contributed a substantial number of Covid cases and deaths than the Jammu division. The Valley has reported 84% (3,884 infections) of the total 4,603 cases in November in J&K. And of the 44 deaths in the union territory, the Valley saw 35 fatalities due to the virus.

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Will soon approach Centre for opening of trade with Pakistan via Attari: Punjab CM Channi||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday announced that he would soon write to the central government and meet Union home minister Amit Shah to press for opening trade with Pakistan via the integrated check-post (ICP) at Attari “to boost the state’s economy”. In his address during the 15th Edition of the Punjab International Trade Expo (PITEX) in Amritsar, Channi asked that if trade can be carried through sea then why was it not being allowed via the land route. Acceding to the demand of the PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Channi announced that the foundation stone of a convention centre for PITEX over an area of 10 acres would be laid within a week for carrying out activities to promote trade and industry in the region.Underlining the significance of the cross-border trade, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu described Amritsar as Asia’s biggest mandi. “It will open new avenues of prosperity for Punjab as trade and business activities can be carried with 34 countries,” he said.State medical education and research minister Raj Kumar Verka and Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla were also present on the occasion. CM dedicates five chairs at GNDUAt Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, chief minister Channi dedicated five chairs after Valmiki, Bhai Jaita (Baba Jiwan Singh), Kabir, BR Ambdekar and Makhan Shah Lubaana. Addressing the gathering, he said the ‘Punjab Model’ of his government was based on ensuring quality education and employment opportunities for all.“Our government has already set the wheels in motion to bail out the universities from financial crisis,” he said.He, however, asked the university administration to evolve a viable mechanism for reducing fees of various courses. Sidhu said it was the Congress that gave Punjab its first scheduled caste CM since independence. “This is a revolutionary step in line with the Constitution,” he added. ‘Punjabis will give Kejri a befitting reply’Addressing a rally in Ranjit Avenue locality of the city, Channi said the Punjabis will give a befitting reply to the arrogance of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for what he called “challenging their dignity and honour by making derogatory remarks against our daughters and sisters”. He also accused former CM Amarinder, Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal and the BJP of “clandestinely harming the state’s interests with an eye on the forthcoming assembly polls. The three were hand in glove and would continue to pursue their politically motivated agenda in future too.Earlier, Channi announced a sports complex after fourth Sikh master Guru Ramdas in the Amritsar North constituency. An internal cricket stadium will be named after Sidhu’s father Bhagwant Singh Sidhu, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-soon-approach-centre-for-opening-of-trade-with-pakistan-via-attari-punjab-cm-channi-101638820975362.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal: Missing trekkers found dead near Dharamshala||Police rescuers found the bodies of two trekkers on Monday, a week after they went missing in the foothills of Dhauladhar mountains near Dharamshala. The deceased have been identified as Naveen Kumar, 44, a resident of Dari and Harsimaranjeet Singh, 34, of Gurdwara Road locality.Dharamshala station house officer (SHO) Rajesh Kumar said prima facie, it appears they died after falling from a cliff. However, the police are exploring all possible angles, he added. Their bodies have been brought to Dharamshala and the autopsy will be conducted on Tuesday. The trekkers had left Dharamshala towards Thatharna on a bike on November 29. Their family members had lodged a missing person’s complaint after the duo didn’t return home. A search operation was launched thereafter. They were last seen at Thatharna by some locals and from their phone call details, police found out that they were planning to scale 4,550-metre-high Kundli pass and cross over to Chamba. The police had sent a ground rescue unit towards Kundli pass both from Dharamshala and Chamba side and a helicopter sortie was conducted by the Indian Air Force as well.It is worth mentioning that after back-to-back tragedies in Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts involving trekkers in September and October, the Kangra district administration had banned trekking on mountain passes of 3,000m and above on November 11. Kangra has around a dozen mountain passes across the Dhauladhars, which are widely used by shepherds to cross over to either side with their herds. In recent years, trekking activities through these passes have increased.Previous mountain tragediesSeptember 12-13: Three trekkers die near Manimahesh Lake in ChambaSeptember 24-25: Two trekkers die and 15 others rescued at Khamengar Pass in Lahaul-SpitiOctober 18-19: Seven trekkers die after being caught in a snowstorm over the Lamkhaga Pass bordering UttarakhandOctober 25: Three trekkers die in a snowstorm on Buran Pass while trekking from Rohru to Sangla in Kinnaur; seven rescued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-missing-trekkers-found-dead-near-dharamshala-101638820850497.html

He had managed the Congress’ successful campaign in the 2017 polls and devised programmes such as “Punjab Da Captain” and “Coffee with Captain” to drum up support for the party during the polls.The top court was hearing an appeal filed by Labh Singh, a retired boxing coach, and Satinder Singh, an advocate, who had contended that Kishor is an expert in organising elections and is assisting parties in various states. The appeal had stated that the appointment of Kishor as principal adviser in the rank and status of a cabinet minister at the cost of public money is not permissible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-disposes-of-plea-against-appointment-of-prashant-kishor-as-punjab-cm-adviser-101638819889894.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Amarinder, BJP to discuss seat sharing formula||The first formal meeting between Captain Amarinder Singh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to cement an alliance ahead of the Punjab assembly elections will take place on Tuesday, with Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat likely to attend lunch at the former chief minister’s farmhouse near Chandigarh.According to senior BJP leaders and the former CM’s close associates, Shekhawat — who is the election in-charge for Punjab — is likely to discuss the possible seat sharing for the alliance between the saffron party, Amarinder’s newly formed Punjab Lok Congress and Akali Dal (Sanyukt) led by Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. Also read: ‘Winnability sole criterion for Punjab Lok Congress ticket’On Saturday, Union minister Amit Shah had stated that talks were on between the three stakeholders. Even Amarinder confirmed the same while opening his party office in Chandigarh on Monday.However, this will be for the first time that the BJP and Amarinder will sit across the table to formally discuss their election strategy and seat-sharing formula. BJP national vice-president Saudan Singh is likely to accompany Shekhawat.It is learnt this will be a crucial meeting ahead of Amarinder’s proposed meeting with Shah and BJP national chief JP Nadda, in which the seat-sharing formula will be given the final shape.According to a few close aides of Amarinder, he has already worked out a seat-sharing strategy in which his party will focus mainly on rural areas. The BJP is likely to stake a claim to at least 45 seats, including all 23 seats from which it used to contest in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), revealed a senior party functionary.
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Congress in dilemma as it’s Bajwa vs Bajwa in Qadian||After dropping hints of his return to the political landscape in Punjab over the past couple of days, Rajya Sabha member and former state Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa made it official on Monday by announcing that he will be contesting the upcoming assembly elections from his home turf Qadian.The seat is presently held by his younger brother Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, who just four days back staked his claim by organising a show of strength.“The party high command wants me back in the state politics and has given the green signal,” said Bajwa while talking to media as he kicked off meetings with his supporters at Qadian on Monday. “I will contest the assembly polls from my home seat Qadian. I will like to spend rest of my life with my people.”By throwing his hat into the ring, Bajwa Senior has not just put a question mark on Fateh Jung’s fate, but also thrown wide open the already two-cornered contest between chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for the top post if the party manages to win the assembly elections. “Apart from working with four chief ministers in Punjab as a minister, I have been a member of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha. This is rarest of the rare honour that I have got. I will bring my experience that I gained while being on various key posts in New Delhi as well as Punjab for the betterment of the state,” said Bajwa.Stating that he wants to change the “destiny of Punjab”, Bajwa said: “I can contribute towards bringing a second green revolution here, since I am a member of the standing committee on agriculture. My party always gave me the opportunity to speak first in the Parliament on behalf of the Opposition on the issue of farm laws. I am very proud of it.”I am here to stay, says Fateh Jung“The contest will be within the Congress, none else, as no other party is in a position to compete with us,” he said, on being questioned about his main contender in the polls.When asked about the fate of his younger brother, he said, “Only God knows it.” Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was the chief guest in the rally held by Fateh Jung at Qadian last Thursday, had backed him, stating: “Fateh will win from his constituency with a huge margin.”However, Bajwa, who once represented erstwhile Kahnuwan assembly segment that was largely subsumed by Qadian during delimitation about a decade ago, stayed away from the rally. On Monday, the younger brother skipped the meetings addressed by Bajwa. Bajwa’s wife Charanjit Kaur had also remained the MLA from Qadian from 2012 to 2017. Meanwhile, without naming his elder brother, Fateh Jung said: “I am here to stay. The Qadian people elected me with an overwhelming majority. I served them for five years. How can someone who has not been here for the past 12 years barge in and stake claim to the party ticket. I organised a massive rally on Thursday last week with 50,000 people. The state party president (Sidhu) was also there and asked the people of Qadian to reelect me. People responded to that call overwhelmingly.” Earlier, Bajwa had started his political activities in Batala and announced to contest the polls from there, but got a jolt after Amarinder Singh, who he had backed in the feud with Sidhu, resigned from the post of chief minister in September.With a change of guard, his two loyalists were removed as chairmen of the Batala Improvement Trust and market committee, days after he got them appointed to these posts. He ended his political activities in Batala with immediate effect. Meanwhile, responding to a query regarding Amarinder’s possible alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party, Bajwa said: “If Captain could not keep on riding a horse, who will let him ride on it again?”

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Congress names poll teams in Punjab, does a balancing act||The Congress on Monday made key appointments in its election team for the coming assembly elections, seeking to bring on board all leaders in its faction-ridden Punjab unit.Party president Sonia Gandhi named former state president Sunil Jakhar as chairman of the campaign committee, Rajya Sabha member Ambika Soni as chairperson of the election coordination committee, and Partap Singh Bajwa as chairman of the manifesto committee.The party also nominated Jakhar as a member of the screening committee, which will pick candidates; the other members of the panel are Ajay Maken, its chairman, and Chandan Yadav and Krishna Allavaru.Harish Chaudhary, in charge of state affairs, Navjot Singh Sidhu, state party head, and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi as legislative party leader have been named as ex-officio members of the screening panel. The appointments were announced in a statement signed by Congress general secretary KC Venugopal.Jakhar was upset after the September reshuffle when Channi was made chief minister. Jakhar was among those reported to be in the running to replace Captain Amarinder Singh but the party made a surprise pick, Channi. The head of the party’s Punjab unit, Sidhu, whose appointment set the stage for Singh’s exit, was also reported to be in the running.“It is to be seen how the leaders, particularly Sidhu and Jakhar, who have been opposed to each other, will coordinate particularly at the time of declaration of candidates for the elections,” a party leader said on condition of anonymity.The upcoming weeks will be an acid test of the party’s ability to keep its flock together, especially when Amarinder has floated an outfit to contest the polls along with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Akali Dal’s breakaway faction. 
07-12-2021||Mumbai||Supreme Court stays OBC reservation Ordinance||Mumbai: A fortnight before the district council elections in Bhandara and Gondia as well as the bypolls in 4,500 gram panchayats across the state, the Supreme Court on Monday stayed an Ordinance that would have permitted up to 27% political reservation to candidates from Other Backward Class (OBC) communities.The top court passed the order while hearing two pleas, including one assailing the provisions of an Ordinance that permitted political reservation to OBC candidates uniformly throughout Maharashtra in the concerned local bodies.“The State Election Commission shall desist from proceeding with the Election Programme already notified in respect of reserved seats for ‘OBC category only’, in the concerned local bodies,” a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar said, but made it clear that the election process for the other seats would continue.On September 21, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government passed an Ordinance amending two laws that govern rural and municipal local bodies, after the SC in March struck down a section that granted 27% political reservation for OBC candidates in local body elections. Since the state also provides reservation to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC and ST) candidates, the 50% cap on reservation was often breached. The SC had held that this was unconstitutional and directed the state to conduct an empirical study on the socio-economic backwardness of OBC communities before deciding on the quantum of reservation.The SC bench on Monday observed that the reservation granted by the Ordinance could not be implemented unless a Commission was set up, and data was collected regarding the adequacy of representation in each local body. “That is the first step which ought to have been done,” the bench observed.The state set up a 10-member Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC) in June to conduct the survey, but the survey is yet to begin. In July, MSBCC sent a letter to government listing out manpower, infrastructure and budgetary needs to conduct the survey, estimating that a budget of ₹435 crore (subject to revision) be permitted.OBC communities form a crucial chunk of the electorate for all three ruling parties — Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) — and the MVA coalition government cleared the Ordinance with an eye on upcoming local body elections slated for December 21 and between February and December 2022.Ruling party leaders said that they would need to find a way out of the conundrum. NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik said that the state government will study the ruling. “We are of the opinion that the elections should not be held without the quota to OBCs. The Ordinance was issued with intent of keeping it intact. We will study the order and take steps required. The (Opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party) who are basically against the reservation in the country are fuelling the entire dispute to keep the issue burning. They are pretending to be in support of the backward classes, but are actually against reservation.”“The state government is not serious about OBCs or Marathas. The MVA government did not provide adequate resources to the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) to collate the empirical data as ruled by the apex court. Had the government begun the process of empirical data, the SC perhaps would not have stayed the Ordinance. This is a conspiracy of the ruling parties to keep the OBC away from the political reservation for next five years. BJP would not allow the elections to the local bodies to be held without the quota,” said Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.Chandrakant Bavkar, president, OBC Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, said that the MVA government should take the responsibility of the ruling. “The MVA government and its leaders are entirely responsible for the ruling. The MVA government constituted MSCBC in March but did not provide it resources, manpower or funds in last six months. The commission is currently defunct for various reasons.”The top court on Monday stayed the notifications issued by the State Election Commission (SEC) in November reserving up to 27% of the seats for OBC candidates in district council, nagar panchayat and gram panchayat elections.“Ten out of 53 and 13 out of 52 seats in Gondia and Bhandara councils respectively are reserved for OBC candidates. We will have to stay the elections only for those seats until the final order given by the apex court next week. The bodies can be formed in these district councils without holding polls for OBC seats as the required number of members to elect their chairman is two third of the total strength,” an official from the SEC said.The apex court observed that the state government brought the Ordinance without following the triple test laid down in Vikas Gawli versus State of Maharashtra case.The counsel appearing for Maharashtra told the bench that the provision in the Ordinance is in conformity with the decision of the apex court and it is only providing for reservation to the category of backward class citizen up to 27 per cent.Observing that it is “not impressed” by this argument, the bench said that without setting up the commission and collating contemporaneous empirical data to ascertain the extent of reservation required to be provided local body-wise, it is not open for the SEC to provide reservation for OBC category despite the statutory provision in that regard.“That is only an enabling provision, but to be given effect to only on complying the triple test. The first step of collating empirical data has not been completed so far,” it said.The triple tests are: establish a Commission to conduct rigorous empirical inquiry; specify proportion of reservation in light of the Commission’s recommendations; ensure reservation does not exceed 50 per cent of the total seats with SCs/STs/OBC quotas taken together.On March 4, the SC struck down the 27% reservation to OBC candidates under the Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act (1961) on the grounds that it resulted in a breach of the 50% cap on reservation. Amid the uproar by the OBC communities over the quashing of the quota, the MVA government amended the legislation alongside another — the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats — to ensure up to 27% reservation in the forthcoming elections.Between February and December 2022, the state will see elections in 23 municipal corporations, 27 district councils, 298 panchayat samitis, 320 nagar panchayats and nagar councils.

The former minister, who had quit the Union cabinet in solidarity with the protesting farmers, also demanded that the minimum support price (MSP) should be fixed for all crops and made a statutory right. Speaking to mediapersons outside the Parliament on Monday, she said, the farmers laid down their lives while participating in a peaceful and democratic movement in the larger interest of the farming community: “The House should express solidarity with this cause and also regret the hardships the farmers had to undergo to get their just demand for repeal of the three agricultural laws accepted by the central government.” Harsimrat also stressed that the central government should give legal shape to MSP and ensure all crops were purchased, be it by the government or private agencies.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier, as head of a committee, championed the cause of making MSP a statutory right and the government should not delay accepting this demand,” she added. She demanded that all false cases registered against farmers in Delhi, as well as other states of the country, be withdrawn: “All this should be done speedily so that farmers can call off their agitation and return home.” She further said if the Centre had listened to the Shiromani Akali Dal earlier and not passed the three farm laws, 800 precious lives could have been saved. Also, by not listening to its alliance partner, Harsimrat said, the BJP had also spoilt its image and earned the wrath of the farming community. Answering a query, she added that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal should first implement the promises he was making in Punjab in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/acknowledge-martyrdom-of-farmers-harsimrat-urges-parliament-101638819175316.html

We gave him this name because he was born along the border,” said Nimbu Bai. But since the birth of her son on December 2, she and her husband, Balam Ram, have been struggling to return to Pakistan with their five children, as their latest was born in India and does not have the required documents.The couple was among 99 Pakistani Hindus, who had been stuck in Attari for over 70 days due to lack of necessary documents. Many of them had come to India on pilgrimages to Haridwar and Jodhpur before the lockdown in March last year, while some came in 2018 and overstayed their visas. While the rest of them managed to return to Pakistan on Monday, the couple and their five children will have to wait longer till the infant’s documents are readied.According to Punjab Police’s protocol officer Arun Pal, when Nimbu went into labour, she received help from women in Attari. “On Monday, all the other Pakistani Hindus crossed over to Pakistan via the Wagah border, except the newborn and his family. The Pakistani officials have refused to accept the baby without the necessary documents,” he added.Among the pilgrims, another Pakistani citizen, Lagya Ram, had named his son “Bharat” when he was born in India in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stuck-at-attari-border-for-70-days-pakistan-woman-names-newborn-border-101638819172864.html

07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Recruitment of assistant professors: After HC stay on hiring, Punjab orders inquiry into ‘paper leak’||After the Punjab and Haryana high court recently put a stay on the recruitment of 1,091 assistant professors in Punjab government colleges till December 13, the state government has also ordered an inquiry into allegations of paper leak.Minister of higher education Pargat Singh has directed principal secretary Krishan Kumar to carry a minute inquiry into the complaints received from applicants.The process to recruit assistant professors, being carried out after 19 years, hit a legal roadblock after applicants moved the high court. The civil writ petition alleged that the question papers of Punjabi and mathematics were leaked well before the exams were conducted from November 20 to 22.Punjabi University, Patiala, and Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, were assigned the task to set paper for humanities and science subjects, respectively. The examination centres were also set up in both these universities. The result of examinations was declared on November 28.The petitioners alleged that “research scholars and students of professors who set the examination papers were favoured and they cleared the entrance test”.In its interim decision, the court ordered the Punjab government that “appointment, if any, shall be subject to the final decision of the petition”.Pargat said he had called the advocate general on Tuesday to discuss the legal matters pertaining to the case.“We have already stalled the recruitment process for Punjabi subject for which the department received complaints of paper leak. For other subjects, the legal team will put forward its case in court,” he said.The minister added that the inquiry had been ordered to ensure that the examination was conducted in a fair manner.“The principal secretary has been asked to submit the report at the earliest. If found guilty, the defaulters will face stringent action,” he said.‘No question of paper leak’Meanwhile, in its statement, Punjabi university ruled out any discrepancy in holding the said examination. Dr Gurpreet Singh Lehal, the coordinator for the Punjabi exam, said a highly confidential process was followed for setting the question paper. “A panel of nine experts from five universities from Punjab and other states was formed to create a database of 600 questions. Each expert independently created their set of questions and no expert was aware of the other eight’s questions. The task of creating the final question paper was accomplished by randomly selecting 100 questions from the question bank through a computer program,” he said.He added that there was no question of leakage of the questions by the subject experts, as no one knew the final questions selected by the computer program.On Saturday, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal had demanded an immediate inquiry in the alleged multi-crore assistant professor recruitment scam, claiming that not only were all the rules and procedures set aside to recruit the chosen ones after leakage of exam papers, but crores also changed hands. 
07-12-2021||Gurugram||Namaz row: Hindu, Muslim groups propose new sites||The district administration on Monday said they have received a proposal from Hindu and Muslim groups recommending that the Friday prayers should be held at 12 religious sites and six other places instead of the current 20 designated sites. Officials aware of the matter said that the proposal was submitted jointly by members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti and Gurugram Imam Sanghathan led by Khurshid Rajaka, who is also the national convener of Muslim Rashtriya Manch. However, another Muslim group, Gurgaon Muslim Council, said it did not agree with the arrangement.In the last three months, right-wing groups in the city have opposed and tried to disrupt Friday prayers in sectors 47, 12, 37 and Sirhaul village -- sites designated by the district administration for Friday prayers. However, the Hindu groups have maintained that namaz should not be held at public places, and instead be offered at only mosques. “We are moving towards resolution of the issue, and on Monday evening members of Hindu and Muslim groups submitted the proposal in which they have agreed to resolve their differences by mutual agreement. We will examine the proposed sites, and feasibility of the proposal, and implement it after it is found acceptable to the stakeholders. It will be ensured that sentiments and interests of every community are safeguarded,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram.Rajaka said they have submitted that Friday prayers may be offered at 12 religious places that include mosques and Waqf Board properties located “away from population”. However, the location of these sites and mosques was not specified in the proposal. “We want to ensure peace and brotherhood among people. We have requested the district administration that six large sites be allotted where prayers can be offered without hindrance, and we are ready to pay rent for them. Praying at public places is not allowed as per the Constitution and no government will permit either Hindus or Muslims to do so. We want to find a middle path and resolve this matter,” said Rajaka. However, the Gurgaon Muslim Council said they did not subscribe to the proposal put forward by Gurugram Imam Sanghathan. Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson for the Gurgaon Muslim Council, said that the Muslims of Gurugram reject any such agreement, and added that a press conference would be held on the matter on Wednesday.“We are getting reports that right-wing group, Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, has once again colluded with Muslim Rashtriya Manch which got some maulanas (clerics) along with them and conspired to state that ‘Juma namaz’ (Friday prayers) will not take place at any open places in Gurugram approved by the administration since May, 2018,” Ahmed said. The members of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti said they have been demanding that the prayers should be held only at religious places and not in public spaces. “The Muslim community has put forth this proposal, and we endorse it as it will ensure prayers are offered only at religious places. The six open sites sought by the Muslim community would also be located away from residential pockets,” said Rajiv Mittal, spokesperson, Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti. On November 5, Hindu groups held a Govardhan Puja at a designated namaz site in sector 12A, and a havan was organised at another site in sector 37, to disrupt Friday prayers.

So, these miscreants carry out such crimes in neighbourhood areas and escape to the densely populated area. They often live in crowded areas and keep a low profile.”Sachin is wanted in a case of loot in Noida, said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Noida. “We are also interrogating the four suspects detained. We have made a dossier based on their interrogation details, and also identified other suspects involved in street crimes. We also recovered some motorcycles without number plates from the Khora colony during the Monday search... A police team will routinely conduct similar enforcement exercises there,” he said.Abhay Kumar Mishra, deputy superintendent of police, Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram, said that this was the third such operation in Khora Colony this year. “Several such miscreants live in this colony as it is densely populated. So, we conducted a joint search here. The Noida police team is interrogating the suspects at present,” he said.Dhiraj Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Ghazipur police station in Delhi, said, “Our police team also conducted the search as the suspects also commit such crimes in Delhi.”According to the Noida police, officers hold meetings with its counterparts in Ghaziabad and Delhi to share information and criminal records of wanted suspects on a daily basis, to improve the law and order across the national capital region (NCR). The Noida ADCP said that nearly 20 to 25 street crime cases are reported in the city every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/1-arrested-after-raid-in-khora-colony-to-arrest-suspects-in-street-crimes-101638818210685.html

The incident occurred on November 20 and came to fore after the pradhan of Kamhera village brought it to the notice of SSP (Muzaffafarnagar) Abhishek Yadav on December 4 through a WhatsApp message.SSP Yadav deputed police officers to verify the charges and conduct an inquiry. After seeking complaints from two parents, the SSP sent SHO of Purkazi Vinod Kumar Singh to the police lines as punishment. “He was sent to police lines on charges of delay in initiating action in the case,” said CO Krishan Kumar, adding that two parents had given their complaint in this regard and a case under Section 354 of the IPC and Pocso Act had been registered against the two school owners.The case was registered against school owners on the basis of the complaints given by two parents, said police. “One of them has been arrested and raids are being conducted to arrest the other accused,” said Kumar. Investigation was in progress to verify the charges as parents of 15 girls had not given any complaint so far. The parents alleged that the girls were called to the schools for practical classes and later asked to stay over to complete the practicals. “They were served intoxicated khichdi and molested,” they added.All the girls belonged to poor families and were allegedly threatened of dire consequences, if they shared the incident with their families.

Further, the Ministry of HRD has made efforts to make NCERT books mandatory for CBSE affiliated schools... As a result, there was a sudden rise in demand for the NCERT books. Unscrupulous elements exploited the situation by getting printed pirated books and hooked in sellers by offering them higher profit margin. This is when information was received that a publication unit involved in printing of pirated NCERT books is operating in the trans-Yamuna area. The offset unit was publishing pirated NCERT books for various subjects of classes 6-12. A team was immediately formed to crack the case,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-25-year-old-arrested-for-selling-pirated-copies-of-ncert-books-online-101638817909624.html
07-12-2021||Pune||PMC stays construction work around SPPU main building||PUNE The building construction department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given a stay order on ongoing barricading work around the main building of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). For the last few weeks, the entire main building premises has been closed with barricading of iron grills, gates and stone. It was opposed by several student organisations as the university building is a ‘heritage building’ and needs permission from the PMC building construction department to do any development works around it. As per the notice sent by the PMC building construction department division 6 to SPPU on December 3: “As per the application given by the university for compounding and barricading work around the main building of the university, permission was given on certain terms and conditions. While under section 8 of these terms it was necessary to take the permission to do any development around the heritage building and till that time work cannot be started. As there was no permission taken by the building construction department, it is instructed to give a clarification in this regard and till that time work should be stopped.”Kamlakar Shete, a student and vice-president of Yuvak Kranti Dal, a student organisation, said, “The barricading around the main building is done to stop students and citizens going around the main building area and so we have opposed it. The first right on university and its buildings is of students and we along with other student organisations oppose it strongly. In fact, university should spend funds for the development of student-related works and not to barricade heritage buildings like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-stays-construction-work-around-sppu-main-building-101638817789835.html

Passengers are facing several difficulties while boarding or when exiting from this side of the station. The main entry gate is closed, and the road is full of potholes, with no proper arrangements for auto. Toilets are closed. Despite repeated complaints to the railway administration no corrective measures have been taken. “I traveled from Pune railway station two weeks ago and wanted to board a train in the evening. As it was convenient for us to go through the second entry gate, we arrived there. First the road was jam-packed when we entered, then there were potholes on the road due to which it was difficult to walk and most importantly, the elevator was not working so we had to carry our luggage on the stairs,” said Vipul Alekar, a passenger. Woman passenger Surekha Malpani said, “We a group of women traveling from Pune railway station and were waiting at the second entry gate for our other relatives to come. There are public toilets but they are closed. For women especially its very difficult. And then an elderly woman had to walk through all the across the FOB to a platform to use the toilet.” Karan Makwana, another passenger said, “There is a huge space which is barricaded at this second entry gate premises, where autos can be parked and is closer to the main FOB going towards the railway station. Also the big entrance gate is closed and the side lane road is for outgoing vehicles. As there are no wardens or police to monitor the vehicles, vehicles come randomly from any side and it creates traffic congestion.”This second entry gate was started in a bid to ease the burden on the main entrance of the Pune railway station. Pune railway division spokesperson Manoj Jhawar said, “There are development works going on at the second entry gate and the potholes are regularly repaired. The main entrance was closed due to the pandemic and when things normalise it will open again. Same with the toilets on this side of the station. If passengers demand, then they will be opened up for public use.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/passengers-complain-of-poor-facilities-at-second-entry-gate-of-pune-railway-station-101638817730316.html
07-12-2021||Delhi||Civic polls effect? Delhi govt, civic bodies say no parking hike anytime soon||Hike in parking fee — a measure mandated by the Delhi government’s own parking policy of 2019 and also as an emergency step in the graded response action plan (GRAP) to curb air pollution— will not happen in Delhi anytime soon, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Monday, even as the city is choking on the worst spell of pollution in at least six years. “It is true that parking rates in Delhi will not be increased anytime soon. The parking policy otherwise mandates a steep hike in parking charges in Delhi to discourage the use of private vehicles and promote public transport. But, keeping in mind the severe financial hardships faced by people owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi government has decided against any hike as of now,” Gahlot told Hindustan Times. At least three officials from the Delhi government and municipal corporations said the reason for deferring a hike is not just the pandemic. “The municipal body elections are around the corner— it will likely be scheduled for sometime in April. Hence, parking fee will not be increased anywhere in the city because it is a politically sensitive matter,” said an official, on condition of anonymity. A steep hike in parking fee has been mooted by transport and pollution experts as a deterrent to discourage the use of private vehicles, which will help lower vehicular emissions, one of the major local pollution sources in Delhi. As per the Supreme Court mandated GRAP to tackle air pollution, the municipal corporations should have already increased the parking fee by “three or four times” across the city as air quality has remained in the ”very poor” category (AQI 301-400) for several days now, including on Monday when it was 322. But, there has been no change in parking rates. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said the municipal body is not planning to increase the parking fee either under the GRAP measures. “We have no proposal for increasing the parking fee before us. The provision to increase the parking fee to deter usage of vehicles does not make sense. If a person own car worth ₹30-40 lakh, they will have no problem in paying ₹40-50 extra,” he argued.The national capital has 3.3 million four-wheelers and 7.3 million two-wheelers. Nearly 500 new cars are added every day to the city registers, the government figures show.To discourage the use of private vehicles, the Delhi government, on September 25,2019, notified the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019. As per the policy, new parking rates were to be fixed by the base parking fee (BPF) committee, headed by the transport commissioner. In October 2019, the BPF committee, which has officials from the government and the municipal corporations, came up with a formula that could make parking a car in a popular area such as Connaught Place (CP) for a 10-hour workday cost as much as ₹1,000.The panel suggested that the base fee for four-wheelers be ₹10 per hour and ₹5 per hour for two-wheelers. While the proposed minimum rate may appear less than the existing fee of ₹20 and ₹10 per hour for the two categories, the base fee was supposed to be multiplied depending on four parameters— parking spot, duration, location, and time of day. For instance, the committee “recommended that the multiplication factor based on location of the parking may be varied from 1 to 3, which will be decided by the civic agencies after careful consideration of the location”, read the report prepared by the BPF committee. Areas such as CP, Lajpat Nagar and Karol Bagh, which record heavy traffic, were to be in the most expensive bands.These recommendations were to be approved by the apex monitoring committee, headed by Gahlot. However, it was kept in abeyance and HT has learnt that in a review meeting held on October 22, the minister made it clear to the committee that there shall be no hike in parking fee until further orders. In December 2018, the government’s transport department had approved a sharp increase in one-time parking charges on new vehicles. But days later, Gahlot directed the transport commissioner to withdraw the order.Leader of the house in south corporation, Inderjeet Sehrawat, said parking fee is not likely to be increased any time soon. “The rates were last increased by four times in November 2017 as a part of action plan to combat the deteriorating air quality. The hike remained in effect between November 9 to 16 that year,” he said. A senior official from SDMC said the fourfold hike was found to be unproductive as people started parking outside designated parking areas, defeating the purpose behind the hike. While issuing the rate hike withdrawal order, the south MCD stated that as a result of the rate hike, “chaotic traffic conditions had occurred and traffic jams were reported from many areas, though a considerable portion of the authorised parking areas remained vacant.” ----With inputs from Paras

We had sent all 16 samples for genome sequencing which includes three of whom had returned from Nigeria and others who are close contacts, We have got the results of 10 while six are awaited.” Although the new variant, Omicron, is considered to be highly transmissible, study on its severity continues. The country-wide presentation which was made by the central health ministry and shared with state officials states: “As of December 3 Epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if Omicron is more transmissible (eg, easily spread from person to person), compared to other variants, including Delta variant. As far as the severity of the disease is concerned, preliminary data suggests an increase in the rate of hospitalisation in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. The initial reported infections were among university students — younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease — but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of Covid-19 can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is key.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/all-seven-omicron-positive-patients-in-pune-report-mild-or-no-symptoms-101638817553936.html
07-12-2021||Pune||MSRTC strike keeping rural students from attending schools, colleges||PUNE For Ganesh Nanaware and his friends its been difficult to reach their junior college for the last few days, as they are dependent on the ST bus service, which due to an ongoing strike of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) are off the roads; especially those connecting rural areas. Thousands of students from schools and colleges in Pune district travel to schools and colleges by ST buses on student concessions, or even a free service by the MSRTC. Now after Diwali, almost all schools and junior colleges in rural Pune have begun offline classes. “My junior college is at Nasrapur and I stay at Alande village in Bhor taluka. We go by ST bus to school, but for the last few days I have had hardly attended class as someone from my family has to drop me to college,” said Ganesh, a Class 11 student. Another student, Reshma Chavan from Maval taluka said, “I have not gone to school for a single day after the Diwali vacations and it is the same with my other friends in the village. It is an important year, Class 10, and we need to attend school, but my father won’t allow me to go alone and he cannot private transportation. I take notes from my friends who attend school and hope this MSRTC strike ends soon and we can go back to school.”Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic,aAt least 1,200,000 students traveleed daily by ST buses across Pune district. The bus service was efficient and used to run in the interior parts, so students were able to go to schools and colleges. “Currently there is very less attendance in school after the Diwali vacation. The main reason is the MSRTC workers strike and subsequently, the closed ST bus service. Daily, around 10 to 15 students come to school in a class of 50 students. So we have to take both online and offline classes for students who cannot attend school,” said Prakash Dhawade, principal of a private school and junior college in Junnar taluka, Pune district. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We are aware about the situation and how students are suffering as they cannot attend offline classes. Its entirely a state-level decision and we hope MSRTC workers end their strike soon. Alternate arrangements of private tourist buses and vehicles have been made by the state transport department, so on major routes these buses are running. Now MSRTC workers are also joining work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-strike-keeping-rural-students-from-attending-schools-colleges-101638817495901.html
07-12-2021||Delhi||1984 riots: Sajjan Kumar charged with two murders in Saraswati Vihar||New Delhi: A Delhi court has charged former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar for the murder of a man and his son in west Delhi’s Saraswati Vihar during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, saying that prima facie he was not only “a participant of the mob but also led it”.The family members of the deceased -- Jaswant Singh and Tarun Deep Singh -- had alleged that a mob led by Kumar burnt the two men alive on November 1, 1984. They alleged that Kumar “instigated and abetted the unruly mob”. The complainants also alleged that the mob also set their house on fire.Kumar is currently lodged in a city jail after his conviction in another murder case related to the riots. On Friday, additional sessions judge MK Nagpal said his view regarding Kumar’s participation “is much stronger and the allegations, along with material, gives rise to grave suspicion”. The order was made available on Monday. The court charged Kumar with murder, rioting, unlawful assembly, arson, attempt to culpable homicide, dacoity, voluntarily causing hurt, and causing mischief and robbery.The judge, however, dropped the charges of attempt to murder, saying that there was no such common intention of the mob to kill the victim, as some participants of the mob itself had taken away or dragged the female victims to a nearby house for shelter and to save them from being killed by the crowd.The court, however, added section 308 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), saying that the injuries suffered by the three female victims prima facie appear to have been inflicted with blunt objects, and with an “intention or knowledge that if their death was caused as a result thereof, then the accused and every other member of the above mob would have been guilty of the offence of culpable homicide”.The court also dropped charges of destruction of evidence against Kumar, and directed him to appear on December 16 to complete further procedures.The first information report in the case was registered on September 9, 1985 on the basis of an affidavit by the complainant. During the investigation, the police filed a final report before a magistrate court. The case was directed to be sent as untraced (case in which a closure report is filed) in 1994 after the court held that evidence collected by the investigating officer was not sufficient to initiate prosecution against any particular person.In 2015, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT), constituted by the central government to reinvestigate the cases of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, decided to reopen the case.The SIT was formed, the team re-examined 293 cases which were closed by the Delhi police. Of the 293 cases, the team filed closure reports in 233 cases, citing lack of evidence. In 52 cases, the team filed reports in which the victims or the accused were not traced and started a probe in eight cases. Of the eight cases, the police filed a charge sheet in five and Kumar was named an accused in three cases.Earlier, on December 17, 2018, the Delhi high court set aside Kumar’s earlier acquittal in one of the cases and convicted him for murder, rioting and provoking a mob. The case relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Raj Nagar part-1 area in the Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1 and 2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.
07-12-2021||Kolkata||TMC team headed to Nagaland returns from Kolkata airport, says Sec 144 imposed in Mon||KOLKATA: A five-member team of the Trinamool Congress ordered to travel to Nagland by party boss and Wet Bengal chief minister chief minister to speak to the families of civilians killed over the weekend returned from the Kolkata airport after learning that prohibitory orders have been imposed in Mon district in Nagaland, 300km from state capital Kohima, TMC leaders said. “After we reached the Kolkata airport and were about to take a flight to Jorhat, from where we had plans to head towards Mon, we came to know that the district administration has issued prohibitory orders. We came to know that movement of all vehicles, barring emergency ones have been restricted and we won’t be allowed to go there,” TMC member of parliament Prasun Banerjee said.The team comprising four Trinamool Congress parliamentarians including Prasun Banerjee, Sushmita Dev, Aparupa Poddar, Santanu Sen and former Mizoram advocate general Biswajit Deb, was scheduled to head for the north eastern state to speak to the families of the victims. Poddar, who tweeted two photographs of the TMC team at Kolkata airport to take the flight, called the prohibitory order “another act of subversion of rule or (and) law & democracy”. She alleged the order under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure was designed to bar the TMC delegation travelling to ground zero of the botched up security operation.Protests erupted on Sunday after 14 civilians were killed by army soldiers who appeared to have mistaken them for militants in Nagaland’s Mon district. The Mon district administration imposed a curfew in the town and prohibited movement of all non-essential vehicles in the district. Entry into the district was also prohibited and mobile internet services were suspended in the region, a district official said. An Indian army statement said it “deeply regretted” the incident and its aftermath, adding that “the cause of the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated at the highest level and appropriate action will be taken as per the course of law.” Banerjee’s prompt direction to party leaders to reach the Nagaland district came against the backdrop of the Trinamool Congress’s efforts to expand its footprint beyond Bengal.While it has already landed in Tripura and Goa, it has become the largest opposition party in Meghalaya on account of 12 Congress legislators, including former chief minister Mukul Sangma, switching sides and joining Mamata Banerjee’s party.Elaborating the party’s expansion plans, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee recently said the Trinamool plans to set up working units in at least 15 states within the next one year.As part of this effort, Mamata Banerjee’s party sent a delegation of five TMC MPs - Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Sushmita Dev, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Pratima Mondal and Dola Sen – to meet families of farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh.Banerjee also sent her emissaries to meet the farmers at Singhu border in Delhi when they were protesting against the three contentious farm bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-team-headed-to-nagaland-returns-from-kolkata-airport-says-sec-144-imposed-in-mon-101638817429628.html
07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro to deposit ₹1,000 crore in escrow over arbitration case with Rinfra||The Delhi high court on Monday permitted the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to deposit ₹1,000 crore in an escrow account within 48 hours, towards the arbitral award of around ₹4,600 crore that was won by a consortium headed by Reliance Infrastructure Limited, which previously operated the Delhi Airport Express Line.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told justice Suresh Kait that DMRC would be able to pay only ₹1,000 crore to Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited, as the Delhi Metro was facing a “financial crunch” and undertaking a “sudden liability” would impact the public interest.The SG also offered to take over any bank debts of the subsidiary — to the extent of the award money ( ₹4,600 crore, as per DMRC calculations).Mehta said authorities were working on a solution, adding that as per their calculation, the amount liable to be paid was approximately ₹5,000 crore, way lesser than the DAMEPL’s claim of ₹7,163 crore. “We are working out possibilities….Even if we have to pay, we may have to borrow (from banks). If it can be looked into, we can take over your (DAMEPL) debt (and) we will take care of the banks. DMRC can take over the debt and we will deal with the banks,” Mehta said.The court was hearing DAMEPL’s execution plea for the arbitral award won against the Delhi Metro.The DAMEPL terminated the concession agreement in October 2012, citing a failure of the DMRC to cure defects in the structure supporting the Airport Metro Express Line. DMRC invoked the arbitration clause in its contract with the consortium.As per the contract signed on August 25, 2008, the DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding the depot, and the balance, including the project system works, were to be executed by DAMEPL, a joint venture of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Infra and a Spanish construction company Construcciones Y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles.In 2017, the arbitral tribunal awarded damages to Reliance Infra, a ruling that was upheld by a single judge bench of the Delhi high court in 2018. Later, in 2019, a division bench of the high court set aside the award after which Reliance Infra approached the Supreme Court.In September this year, the apex court set aside the division bench judgment of January 15, 2019, and upheld the arbitral award in favour of DAMEPL, saying there was a “disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards”. In November, the Supreme Court also dismissed the DMRC’s plea seeking a review of its judgment.On Monday, senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, appearing for DAMEPL, argued that the DMRC must first deposit 50% of the total award amount with the court.Mehta said it was “not possible” for DMRC to deposit half the awarded amount. “Anything beyond ₹1,000 crore, we may have to borrow from the banks,” he said. The court then directed that the DMRC deposit ₹1,000 crore in an escrow account within 48 hours and asked the counsels for DAMEPL and DMRC to take instructions on the final payable amount under the award. The case will next be heard on December 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-to-deposit-1-000-crore-in-escrow-over-arbitration-case-with-rinfra-101638817371630.html
07-12-2021||Chandigarh||Kin of martyrs honoured on 50th anniversary of Indo-Pak War||To commemorate 50 years of India’s victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the 3 PB Girls Battalion of NCC Ludhiana organised a felicitation ceremony at Kundan Vidya Mandir on Monday to honour the next of kin of the bravehearts who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.This programme was attended by commanding officers and officers of different units of NCC Gp HQ, Ludhiana, NCC Officers, PI Staff and 200 cadets from different schools and colleges of the district.Suresh Kumar Pathak, brother of EAP-3 SK Pathak and Talwinder Singh, nephew of LWTR Harnek Singh, were felicitated during the function.The programme started with the lighting of the lamp and paying of floral tribute to the bravehearts followed by patriotic song, skit and dance by NCC cadets. The programme culminated with the singing of The National Anthem.In his address, Colonel Aman Yadav, Commanding Officer of 3 Punjab Girls, Ludhiana, acknowledged the sacrifice of our valiant soldiers and their near and dear ones and urged the cadets to remain vigilant and leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety and security of our motherland. He said that the sacrifice made to secure the frontiers of the country was the greatest of all.‘Superheroes still fresh in our memories’Ludhiana Though the brave hearts had attained martyrdom 50 years ago during the 1971 India-Pakistan War after a Pakistani Submarine had destroyed INS Khukri at the coast of Diu in Gujarat, but the kin stated that they are still with them and considered superheroes by many generations.Suresh Kumar Pathak, 64, younger brother of EAP-3 SK Pathak, said that he was merely 13-year-old when his elder brother attained martyrdom.“I still remember my elder brother was on leave for his marriage. Soon after, while we were still celebrating, he received an emergency message and left the house to join duty. Around 22 days after that, he attained martyrdom,” said Suresh. He runs a grocery store in Dhandhari and said that his elder brother had joined the navy after completing his engineering diploma.A gate in memory of the martyr has been installed at the main entrance of the village. For 25 years, they used to organise village sports tournaments in his memory. But, as the city was developed and the grounds were turned into colonies, the tournaments were discontinued. “Even the children of the village know about him very well and feel proud,” he added.Talwinder Singh, nephew of LWTR Harnek Singh, said that it was an honour for him to attend a function to remember the sacrifice of his uncle.Harnek Singh was 21-years-old when he had attained martyrdom. Talwinder stated that his uncle was unmarried when he laid down his life in the 1971 war and a statue has been installed at Pabbian village near Chaukimann in his tournament. Also, a kabaddi tournament is organised in his memory every year. Talwinder’s father is an ex-Army officer who told him stories about his uncle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kin-of-war-heroes-honoured-on-50th-anniversary-of-indo-pak-war-101638817369857.html

07-12-2021||Pune||Finland and Nigeria not part of Central government’s ‘at risk’ countries’ list||PUNE With seven confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, Pune now has the highest number of such cases in the state, however, all these cases have been reported from the countries not on the “at risk” list. The central health ministry had earlier included only three countries, but now it has been revised to include a total of 11 countries. The list still does not include Finland and Nigeria from where the persons with Omicron had returned. While passengers returning from these 11 countries are subject to RTPCR tests twice and home quarantine, for other passengers a sample of two per cent of randomly selected samples would undergo RTPCR tests. Back in March of 2020, when Pune reported the first Covid case on March 9, a Pune resident had come from Dubai. It took another 8 days for the administration to include Dubai and the UAE on the ‘high risk’ list, despite the fact that at the time, of the 33 confirmed Covid-19 cases that the state had recorded, 18 had a travel history to the UAE, or had a close contact with one who had travelled to the UAE. On April 6, the state government issued a letter to all the health officials in the state with regards to testing international passengers, which revised the list of ‘at risk’ countries from three to 11. This includes South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel and also the United Kingdom. As per the revised guidelines, travellers arriving from these nations are subjected to post-arrival RTPCR tests. Positive travellers are isolated in a separate facility and a sample is sent for genome sequencing. If positive for Omicron, strict isolation and treatment protocol is on, till the person tests negative, while the passengers who do test negative have to be under home quarantine for seven days and retested on day eight. If negative, they will be then allowed to self-monitor for the next seven days in home quarantine. For other passengers, the guidelines state that 2% of passengers from international flights will undergo a RT-PCR test on arrival. They will be allowed to leave after giving the sample. If they do test positive, then the samples would be sent for genomic surveillance and treatment would begin as per standard protocol. If negative, then they would be advised self-health monitoring for the next 14 days. However, without adhering to the list of at-risk countries and focusing on only those passengers, the district administration team got in contact with all the travellers who came from various countries and took their samples for RTPCR tests. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health officer said, “We have found the Pune Omicron positive case through field surveillance which includes testing and tracing over 433 international passengers who came into the city before the restrictions could be put into place. Of these, 220 have already been tested for RTPCR, of which only two tested positive for the infection. The rest of the reports are pending and as we get more information we are testing more. In fact, we have no one on our list of the 433 international travel returnees who have come from one of the three at- risk countries mentioned by the state government. All of them were from random countries.” Senior assistant medical officer Dr Laxman Gofane said, “We had about 138 travellers who had returned from various countries of which 86 have been tested. Of these, seven tested positive for the infection and nine of their close contacts have tested positive as well. The rest are negative. We are testing all passengers who have returned from international travel irrespective of the country that they have come from.” The timely intervention of the team helped report early cases of Omicron among people who had come into the city before the restrictions could be put into place. All these positive patients are currently institutionally quarantined. Pune city Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “Despite the fact that the person has no symptoms and has been fully vaccinated we have even RTPCR tested all the residents in the building in which the person was living. We collected a total of 25 samples and all of them tested negative for the infection which is reassuring.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/finland-and-nigeria-not-part-of-central-government-s-at-risk-countries-list-101638817255277.html
07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up police for failing to install CCTV cameras in Chandni Chowk||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday pulled up the state police for failing to install over 300 CCTV cameras in the Chandni Chowk area and warned that it will seek answers directly from the city police commissioner if the work is not completed at the earliest.Noting that the police’s affidavit, on the action taken to clear unauthorised vendors, was silent on the installation of CCTV cameras, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the court’s directions were falling on deaf ears and directed police to positively take necessary steps before February 28, failing which it said Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana will be asked to present himself before the bench.“This is only to get the job done, otherwise it’s falling on deaf ears. Let somebody come and explain. It’s not dawning on you. Today you are not even able to tell us if you have moved your little finger to do anything about this. What steps have you taken since the last date on this aspect? Have you taken a single step? It’s not somehow seeping into your minds that this has to be done. What do we do? We are compelled to pass these orders. We don’t like to call all these high ranking officers here. And we dare say, when we pass these orders, everything will start moving. These officers will also wake up,” the bench remarked.The court was hearing a plea by Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal seeking direction to the authorities to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from the no-hawking and no-squatting area in Chandni Chowk, which has recently undergone redevelopment.On November 10, the Delhi Police had sought a week’s time to seek and report instructions on installation of CCTVs and removal of encroachments.The police filed an affidavit highlighting the steps taken to remove illegal but the court noted that there was no mention about the installation of CCTV cameras.Senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, appearing for the petitioners, said that the order for installation of CCTVs was passed in 2019. The court asked the police to take immediate steps in this regard and also said that anybody encroaching upon public space must be removed. It further asked the municipal corporation to prepare a street vending plan. “Anybody and everybody who is encroaching upon must be removed, our directions are very clear. We are not asking you to carve out any exception for the members of the petitioner association. You (North MCD) are not understanding the problem. If you take up a (street vending) plan, this situation can be defused. So first set the ball rolling and formulate a plan,” the bench said.“All of you are making a complete mess on this law, I don’t know what is happening,” said justice Sanghi, while listing the issue of removal of illegal hawkers on January 20.The court directed that experts be nominated from Shahjanabad Redevelopment Corporation, School of Planning and Architecture, and IIT Delhi immediately without any delay in the matter relating to preparation of the street vending plan.It also asked Delhi Police to take steps for removal of encroachers and illegal vendors from the area and directed the police and North MCD to continue with their anti-encroachment drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-pulls-up-police-for-failing-to-install-cctv-cameras-in-chandni-chowk-101638817130901.html
07-12-2021||Pune||15.6 mn in state yet to take first Covid vax dose; 8.5 mn due for second dose||PUNE Maharashtra has 15.6 million people in the state who are yet to take their first dose of the Covid vaccine. Also, as of December 4, 8.5 million people who took their first dose of Covishield are yet to take their second due shot of the vaccine and 1.26 million are yet to take the second shot of Covaxin. Pune accounts for the highest number of second dose beneficiaries due for Covishield. The state government has now written to the districts which have reported the least number of beneficiaries taking the vaccine like Thane, Nashik, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Nanded and Solapur where the number of first-dose beneficiaries is due even though the vaccination process was started months ago, to use call centers and other mechanisms to call beneficiaries to come forward and take the second shot, and also to increase first-dose vaccination. The state and central government had set multiple deadlines earlier to ensure that 100% of the eligible population gets their first shot of the vaccine, first by Dussehra and then by November end. However, even as of December 4, of the 91.4 million eligible beneficiaries, 75.9 million have got the first shot, which means 15.6 million are yet to take their first vaccine. Some of the districts which have the highest number of beneficiaries who have not yet taken the first dose include Thane (1,517,864), Nashik (1,247,277), Jalgaon (963,616), Ahmednagar (925,758) and Nanded (922,498). Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary has written to the district collectors stating, “About 1.55 crore persons are yet to receive even the first dose of Covid Vaccine. This number is very huge and equal to the eligible population in some of the smaller states in our country and it being a very large cohort can generate critical mass and drive a third wave of Covid. Number of remaining beneficiaries who are yet to receive the first dose is enclosed. Field officers are requested to please take steps to cover these beneficiaries at the earliest. Particular attention is requested to Thane, Nashik, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar’ Nanded and Solapur Districts, where this number is very large.’ Although in Pune more than 98% of the eligible beneficiaries have got the first dose, the district also has the highest number of beneficiaries awaiting to get their second dose, as over 1.21 million people who took the first shot and are eligible to get the second shot have not taken the vaccine. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “Yes, it is true that we have the highest number of beneficiaries due for their second dose and we are working on it. Most of these beneficiaries are due in urban areas. We have launched a door-to-door vaccination scheme to increase our coverage. If people do not come forward, then we may have to take stern steps but as of now we do not have any such plans and we should not spell it out. There could also be an issue of data entry which also needs to be checked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/156-mn-in-state-yet-to-take-first-covid-vax-dose-8-5-mn-due-for-second-dose-101638817129753.html

07-12-2021||Pune||Omicron in Pune: Parents have mixed feelings about schools reopening||PUNE The question of schools reopening remains moot as the Omicron variant of Covid has been found in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Parents have a mixed response about the decision to reopen. Earlier, the reopening of schools was delayed till December 15 by local authorities due to the threat of Omicron. Pratibha Shinde from Dhayari said that worldwide, pre-primary and primary schools are functional. “Students from preprimary and primary should start with their offline classes. The learning loss of students from this age group is tremendous. We will not see the effect now, but later when these children grow, we will see the effect,” said Shinde. “In fact in London, secondary and higher secondary schools were continuing online, whereas primary school was offline. There should be a system in India wherein students are safe in offline school as well. In my opinion, schools should start offline as soon as possible. Newer variants are likely to come again. Everytime they do, we cannot confine the children to the home. Young kids are facing a variety of issues like mobile addiction and mental health problems. These can be addresses only if schools reopen offline,” said Shinde. She added that as malls and offices are opened now, schools should reopen too. “Many parents are in a fix about where to leave their children while they go to office. We are reopening malls and office nows. So schools should be reopened, where all Covid protocols are taken care of. Children’s safety is most important, but closing schools is not the answer,” said Shinde. Milind Telawne, another parent from Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said that schools can continue to function online. “This would be better as students are not vaccinated. If any student tests positive, who will take the responsibility for the child’s safety. Also, internationally online education system has been working since the pandemic began. Now, the State government should focus on providing good online education to students by generating good content,” said Telawne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/omicron-in-pune-parents-have-mixed-feelings-about-schools-reopening-101638816949690.html

However, Prayagraj Mela Authority (PMA) is determined to ensure that seers, pilgrims and devotees visiting the fair get best of the facilities, said officials. With the aim of better management of facilities, the PMA has entrusted the responsibilities to high-ranked officials this time around. In this process, perhaps for the first time an IAS official—Sheshmani Pandey—has been made the Mela Adhikari of the annual religious fair and administration is even mulling over a proposal for appointing SDM ranked officials for each sector of the tent city, informed a senior district administration official aware of the development. The arrangements in Magh Mela 2022 are expected to be managed on the lines of Kumbh and Mahakumbh. “The need for senior officials to be placed as sector in-charge of the different sectors of the Magh Mela along with other department comes in wake of the fact that there is a dearth of senior officials in the PMA,” said the official. In past, barring Kumbh and Mahakumbh, a SDM ranked officer had been made the Mela Adhikari while gazetted officers used to overlook the sectors. Now, as Paush Purnima, the day when the month long Kalpwas would begin on January 17, authorities have expedited the work pertaining to providing various facilities to the pilgrims coming for camping in the mela area. Meanwhile, the Mela Adhikari inspected different ongoing preparatory works at the mela area on Monday. Works like construction of the pontoon bridge, levelling of ground and checking erosion of the banks are being taken up on high priority by the mela administration. “We have ensured that the two important pontoon bridges will be completed by December 15 while the rest will be ready by December 31. Moreover, the uneven ground, besides the vast bank of river Ganga is being levelled so that seers and Kalpwasi gets ample land to put up their tents in Mela area,” said the Mela Adhikari, Shesh Mani Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-magh-mela-2022-to-be-held-on-a-smaller-scale-due-to-covid-19-scare-101638816837425.html

07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Despite light rain, air quality remains very poor||The air quality index (AQI) remained in the ‘very poor’ category -- increasing from 305 on Sunday to 322 on Monday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin -- despite light showers in the Capital early Monday morning.The Safdarjung observatory, which is considered representative of Delhi, received 0.8mm of rainfall till 8.30am on Monday, while Ayanagar received 1.2mm.While an improvement in air quality is forecast in the next 24 hours, the IMD has also predicted a drop in temperatures, with the minimum expected to return to single digits by the weekend, and the maximum dropping to 21-22 degrees Celsius (°C) as cold north-westerly winds start blowing from Tuesday.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 24.8°C on Monday, one degree above normal, and the minimum was recorded at 15°C, six degrees above normal.IMD scientist RK Jenamani said while the minimum temperature tends to rise under the influence of a western disturbance, wind direction will once again change to northwesterly from Monday night and Tuesday morning, bringing colder winds towards Delhi. “There has been snowfall in the higher ranges and these cold winds will now blow towards Delhi, bringing a drop in both minimum and maximum temperatures. We can expect cold day-time temperature by the end of the week too,” he said.According to IMD’s seven-day forecast, Delhi’s minimum temperature will start hovering around 9-10°C range from Wednesday onwards, and the maximum temperature is expected to drop to 22°C by Sunday.Gufran Beig, project director and founder at the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), said wind speed will be good on Tuesday too, which will increase ventilation, but warned that the drop in temperatures will reduce the mixing height and have a negative impact on dispersal of pollutants.“Wind speed will remain good but AQI may remain in the ‘very poor’ range for the next few days,” he said.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said as per forecasts, air quality could improve to the “poor” or “moderate” categories in the next two days as surface winds pick up.“However, as we approach peak winter, minimum temperatures are likely to drop gradually leading to a more stable atmosphere and low mixing height. This will trap pollutants closer to the surface, resulting in ‘very poor’, and occasionally ‘severe’, air quality levels,” she said.IMD’s forecast shows Delhi is expected to record shallow fog on Tuesday morning, with the maximum and minimum hovering around 24°C and 12°C, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-despite-light-rain-air-quality-remains-very-poor-101638816769473.html

When professional criminals and mafia used to live, there was fear in the minds of the poor and businessmen as they didn’t know whose house will be seized by which mafia,” the CM said. “The BJP government ensured action against criminals and mafias and ensured development,” the chief minister said. After laying foundation stone of 32 development projects worth ₹76.14 crore, the chief minister also advised Akhilesh Yadav to get vaccinated. “The SP chief used to call corona vaccine as the vaccine of BJP and Modi ji. Even ‘abbajaan’ has been vaccinated and now he too should get himself vaccinated because corona’s new variant (Omicron) has arrived. May be, after getting himself vaccinated, he will start speaking the truth,” the chief minister said. After distributing certificates of various schemes among the beneficiaries the chief minister accused the Samajwadi Party leader of neglecting his constituency. “We had visited Azamgarh thrice during the corona period to inspect medical and other facilities here and if people were getting proper care and treatment. BJP office bearers and workers were engaged in service of the people but Azamgarh MP was absent. He was nowhere to be found. During the first wave, when I asked about the local MP I came to know that he had gone to England. During the second wave, I was told that he had gone to Australia. The people of Azamgarh did not elect him to go to Australia and England,” the chief minister said. “Though SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was the MP from Azamgarh when there was a SP government in the state. But development was confined only till Saifai. Azamgarh remained backward and mafia’s wealth increased under SP’s rule. People like Azam Khan used to harass Dalits,” the chief minister said. “Today, the opposition feels the pain if bulldozers run on the properties of mafia. He alleged that when the opposition parties were in power, the food grains of the poor were eaten. The poor did not get anything. People lived in an atmosphere of fear,” he said. After Sagri, the CM also visited Lalganj area in Azamgarh and inaugurated 37 development projects costing 122.43 crores there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sp-made-azamgarh-a-stronghold-of-criminals-yogi-to-akhilesh-101638816413795.html

Of the seven Omicron cases, six patients are from Pimpri-Chinchwad and belong to one family. Three of the six returned from Lagos, Nigeria, on November 24. Pawar said that the state government is closely monitoring the situation. “Central government should adopt a strict approach towards patients who are coming from outside (abroad) in various states. It should be checked at international airports whether rules are being followed or not,” said Pawar. Last week, the centre pulled up the Maharashtra government for imposing additional restrictions on international and domestic passengers. After a letter was issued by the Union health secratary Rajesh Bhushan, the state government revised its norms. Currently, South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe are categorised as high-risk countries by Maharshtra. The state government has clarified that the restrictions imposed by the government of India from time to time shall act as minimum restrictions to be imposed on all international and domestic air passengers. “Last year, in the month of March, a couple came from Dubai infected. Then their driver got infected and Covid started to spread. Now as well, only one or two patients have been found positive for Omicron in the various states. Now the close contacts of the family have also been found to be infected by the variant,” said Pawar. Pawar also asked the Union health ministry to clear the air about this new variant and take a concrete decision on a booster dose. Pawar said: “There are different thoughts expressed on this variant. So, WHO and the Union health ministry should clear the stand on it. Many who have taken two vaccine doses have been found infected with this variant. So, do we need a booster dose? Many doses are available now. A decision should be taken about this as soon as possible at national level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-should-be-strict-with-international-passengers-ajit-pawar-101638816349409.html

Doctors from across hospitals took out a march on Monday demanding “justice”.The agitation is going on in the backdrop of cases of the new Sars-CoV-2 omicron variant being detected across the country. So far, Delhi has confirmed one case with 27 others suspected to have the infection being in isolation at Lok Nayak hospital.The NEET-PG examinations that usually take place in May were delayed because of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country. The exams were finally conducted in September, but the counselling was postponed because of a batch of petitions in the Supreme Court demanding reservation for candidates.The health ministry had initially assured the doctors that all documents relating to the case that were to be submitted by the government would be given by December 1 and there will be efforts to fast-track the hearing. A delegation of doctors met the union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, but decided to continue the strike until the government issues a written assurance.“He (the health minister) mentioned that the ministry of health and family welfare will try to get the case regarding NEET-PG 2021 counselling, and the case pertaining to reservation policy delinked to expedite the process. He, however, informed that since the matter is sub-judice, he had limited role to play and asked the RDA (resident doctors association) to call off the agitation based on the verbal assurance. The RDA representatives informed the health minister that the agitation will continue till a written assurance is given,” read a letter by the resident doctors of RML hospital.At Safdarjung hospital, director general of health services Sunil Kumar urged the doctors to call off the strike.A meeting of all state representatives was held on Monday evening and the doctors decided to continue the strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiemergency-services-hit-as-resident-doctors-strike-enters-day-10-101638815929653.html

The maximum punishment under these sections entails a jail term of up to ten years.The court fixed December 22 to pronounce the sentence. “It is great to share that the first conviction order has been issued today in respect of north-east riot cases,” the PRO office of the deputy commissioner of police (DCP)/North-East said.A detailed copy of the order was not uploaded on the website of the district court till late Monday evening. Yadav was arrested in June 2020, and the charges in the case were framed on August 1, 2021. There were 12 prosecution witnesses who were examined during the trial.According to the prosecution, Yadav was an “active member of the riotous mob” and took active participation in vandalising and setting on fire the house of a 73-year-old woman named Manori on the night of February 25.The woman, who was the complainant in the matter, alleged that a mob of around 150-200 rioters attacked her house when her family was not present, and looted all the articles including their buffalo.Earlier, in July, a city court passed its first judgment in the riots cases, and acquitted a man accused of rioting, unlawful assembly, and dacoity.

You have to find out that once lockdown was imposed, thereafter (if) the persons were moving here and there and had visited these places even when there were prohibitions,” said Justice Gupta.The judge also said that “instead of half baked replies”, it should give proper details for the court to pass the order.“The problem is there is no investigation done in the matter,” the court remarked.The court was hearing a bunch of pleas by 60 Indian nationals seeking to quash the FIRs registered against them for giving shelter to the foreign Tablighi Jamaat members during the pandemic in 2020.On Monday, the court directed the deputy commissioner of police (Central) to file a detailed affidavit in the case.

Sohail Madan, centre manager, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) at Asola, said the animal was captured on one of the 22 camera traps inside the sanctuary. “There has been indirect evidence of a striped hyena in 2018 and 2017, when we found pug marks, but this is the first photographic evidence of the animal in a long time,” said Madan.The cameras were installed inside the park in March this year as part of the census of all mammals inside the sanctuary. The census aims to cover the mammalian diversity inside the sanctuary which is spread across an area of 2,782 hectares.Nisheeth Saxena, chief wildlife warden, forest and wildlife department, confirmed the sighting and said that the animal is likely to have come from the Aravalli belt in Haryana. “Over the last few years, we have been observing striped hyenas and their pug marks during the winter. This year too, one such hyena has been captured on a camera trap. It is possible that there were more,” he said. Experts said striped hyenas are nocturnal omnivores and can survive on small mammals, insects and fruits too. They said these animals typically prefer a scrub forest, which the Aravalli landscape offers.Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park in North Delhi said hyenas are scavengers and can live close to human settlements. “They are scavengers, and the Indian hyena is generally known to not live in packs. We have seen them survive close to human settlements where there is plenty of waste, including carcasses and meat that gets dumped with garbage,” said Khudsar. He said the sighting of the animal was a good sign for the animal habitat.Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forest (south), said striped hyenas have similar food habits as the golden jackal, which is found in large numbers at Asola. “The animal was last seen around 2015 in the Dera Mandi area. It is found across the Aravalli hills, but sightings on the Delhi side are rare,” he said. In September, the camera traps at the sanctuary also captured a leopard, spotted barely 250 metres away from the office of the DCF (south).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhistriped-hyena-spotted-in-asola-bhatti-sanctuary-after-three-years-101638814429371.html

07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to organise plays on Ambedkar||The Delhi government will organise plays on the life of Dr BR Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, next month “to spread his teachings”, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday.Making the announcement in a digital press briefing on Mahaparinirvan Divas, which marks Ambedkar’s death anniversary, the CM said, “To spread his teachings and to let everyone know about his inspiring life, the Delhi government will organise a mega play from January 5 at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium. The play will be shown about 50 times, each will be free for the public. The play will be of international standards. So, I request all of you to watch it once it starts next month.”“We are celebrating the 75th year of Independence. I want every child and adult to know about the life of Ambedkar ji. At that time he was the first Indian to have a doctorate, and he had not one, but two doctorate degrees, both from abroad. He was also the chairman of the seven member drafting committee of the Constitution of independent India. He also contributed to eradicating the social scourge of untouchability in India,” Kejriwal said.The musical play will be based on Ambedkar’s life, his thoughts, his ideas and ideology and will have the most famous artists and experts take part in it, the government said in a statement, adding that they are preparing a 100-feet wide stage and setting up a production of international standards. The entry will be free to all so that each and every child can watch the show and seek inspiration from his life.“If I say that Babasaheb was the most educated person in the history of India, I don’t think I will be making any erroneous statement. I have never heard or read about anyone who had devoted themselves to education more than he did... He did one doctorate from America, one from England. And that too when he came from a very underprivileged background. When he was studying abroad, there was a time when his grant was put on hold so he had to drop everything and come back. He could only go back after somehow making monetary arrangements for his education. It is so tough for one to get admission in universities abroad even today and then there was Babasaheb who managed to get two doctorates in his time and became the first Indian to do so. He was very fond of reading and in fact even knew nine languages,” Kejriwal said.He had a personal library named Rajgir that boasted 50,000 books and was perhaps the largest in the whole world, the chief minister added.The Delhi government is already running the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana to extend quality education to the underprivileged, the statement read.“The Kejriwal government has taken a resolve to uplift the downtrodden sections of the society. In that direction, it has made sure that all students from the SC/ST/OBC/EWS society get support for taking up higher education and pursuing professional careers under the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana. Under this scheme, meritorious students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and EWS categories receive free coaching from private institutes for competitive exams such as JEE, NEET, CLAT, civil services, banking, railways, SSC among others. If a kid from a family earning less than ₹8 lakh per annum is talented, they no longer have to face the hurdles of poverty. The Kejriwal government provides them free coaching. The Kejriwal government also provides a stipend of ₹2,500 to the beneficiary students so that they do not face problems in their commute,” the government statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-organise-plays-on-ambedkar-101638813710129.html

We will launch the scheme by December end,” said the official.In a bid to ensure that these flats are sold out, the DDA has decided that the returned flats will be sold at old rates.A majority of the flats are in the Lower Income Group and Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category and a bulk of the flats were returned by allottees of the 2017 and 2019 scheme, said a DDA official requesting anonymity.Past schemesUntil 2010, the DDA has always received an overwhelming response to its housing schemes. In 2010, over 16,000 flats, located in Dwarka, Narela, Rohini and Mukherjee Nagar, among others, were put on sale for which DDA received close to seven lakh applications.In 2014, the land-owning agency had put on sale over 25,000 flats, mostly in Lower Income Group category located in Narela and Rohini. The DDA received close to a million applications for these flats. But due to reasons including the small size of the flats, its location and lack of transport connectivity, close to 12,000 were returned by allottees mostly in Narela.Since then, DDA has launched three housing schemes and relaxed the norms allowing amalgamation of flats, but it has not been able to generate a good response.In 2019, DDA launched a housing scheme with close to 18,000 flats (mostly for LIG and EWS categories). But due to tepid response, it had put only 10,294 flats on sale of which it could sell 8,438. Even then, nearly 5,000 flats were returned by the allottees.“We have now proposed a Metro corridor in the area for which funds will be given by the DDA. We are also trying to redevelop the area by making a proper plan for effective utilisation of vacant plots in the area to bring in more economic activity which will result in housing demand,” said a senior DDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/79-of-returned-dda-flats-located-in-outer-delhi-s-narela-union-minister-101638813349084.html

Curfew was lifted specifically for the localitty where the funeral was held, deputy commissioner Mon Thavaseelan K told HT.On Monday, for the second day, solemn street protests and candle-light marches were held across the state for the victims. A police officer described the ground situation as “tense but under control”.A six-hour ‘bandh’ (shutdown) called by Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) to protest the killing passed off peacefully, despite minor skirmishes between students and security forces in some places.Speaking to reporters, NSF president Kegwayhun Tep and general secretary Siipuni Ng. Philo said the shutdown was to protest the shooting down of civilians and in solidarity with the family of victims.“The sole purpose of this bandh was to display our grief, our anger and our sentiments ... Naga people are free people and we have every right to defend what we have,” they said.During the six-hour bandh, the NSF also put up banners and placards some of which read, “We stand in solidarity with our Naga brethren – The innocent civilians who were brutally killed at Oting village, Mon district”, “Nagas have every right to live in peace”.In Mokokchung district, the Ao Students Conference condemning the “massacre of innocent civilians” held a silent procession demanding justice and revocation of AFSPA.Besides, the six-hour shutdown call of NSF, other civil societies and tribal bodies also imposed bandh in the respective areas with Dimapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries enforcing total bandh in Dimapur for 12 hours and Lotha Hoho imposing band in Wokha district.Addressing a mass funeral service held in Mon for the 14 victims, Rio said the state continues to be declared a “disturbed state” every year due to the vexed Naga political issue and insurgency.On the killing of the 14 civilians, Rio asked people to have faith in the state government and said the special investigation team (SIT) will probe every angel and action will be taken under all the accused. He assured that protection under AFSPA will not apply for the first time.“The army has admitted that they made a mistake and the whole world is watching the developments,” he said.The chief minister also mentioned that the commander of the army’s 3 Corps headquarters had personally asked him to convey to the Naga public that the army will also be conducting a proper inquiry into the shooting and punishment will be given.Rio said the sacrifice made by 14 innocent Konyak-Naga brothers will never be forgotten and December 4 and 5 will remain black days for all Nagas.He said this while referring to the decision of Konyak Union (the apex tribal body of the district) which had declared to observe these two days as “Black Day” every year. The Konyak Union had termed the shooting incidents an atrocity beyond reasoning and a deliberate crime against humanity.The CM also announced ₹5 lakh as ex-gratia to the victims’ families and added that the Central government will give ₹11 lakh. He assured a government job to each to the victim families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tension-prevails-in-nagaland-following-death-of-14-in-botched-security-op-101638807768752.html

07-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: North MCD draws ₹515 crore plan to curb road dust||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has formulated a five-year, ₹515-crore pollution mitigation plan that includes relaying unpaved roads in areas such as the Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, a freight hub, and buying more mechanical sweepers -- steps that are primarily aimed at curbing dust pollution in the areas managed by the civic body.Last month, a study of air quality across 39 monitoring stations in the capital by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) showed that the top six areas that recorded worst air quality between November 1 and 8 were under the North civic body. Overall, 16 of the 39 areas came under the North MCD.The north civic body maintains the largest geographical area in the city (604.54 sq km out of 1484 sq km) among the three municipal bodies.A senior civic body official who is aware of the plan said that the corporation plans to buy equipment such as mechanical sweepers, anti-smog guns and road repair machines worth Rs25.44 crore.The official explained that the funds for the project will be managed through urban development fund (that is given by the central government) and money received under the national clean air action plan. “We have assessed our needs in terms of the area that needs to be covered and we will need more mechanical road sweepers, anti-smog guns and road repair machines,” a second official who oversees the anti-pollution drives said.The official said that the North MCD plans to procure six mechanical road sweepers, 12 truck-mounted anti-smog guns, 6 CNG trucks mounted anti-smog guns and one automatic road patch repair machine. The north corporation currently operates a fleet of 18 mechanical road sweepers and 128 water sprinkling tankers.Dust remains one of the key pollution components in Delhi. A study by the IIT Kanpur has shown that dust from roads, digging and agriculture accounts for the highest suspended particulate matter sources in Delhi, contributing 38% of PM2.5 and 56% of PM10 in Delhi. It is estimated that more than 131 tonnes of dust is generated everyday in Delhi with construction sites, loose soil, road dust and poorly maintained roads being some of the key contributing factors.The mitigation plan, a copy of which has been seen by HT, incorporates the need for upgrade and maintenance of 15 decentralized waste management facilities and existing machinery/equipment over the next five years.Some of the most dust pollution prone areas include Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar Phase-2, Kailash Park, Manohar park, Moti Nagar, Kirti Nagar, Ram Nagar and several unpaved stretches in Narela region, civic officials said.With close proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi transport Nagar, Alipur has emerged as a new pollution hot spot, the first official explained.“Under phase-2 of the project, ₹58.5 crore revamp of Sanjay Gandhi transport Nagar has been proposed. A, B, C block and phase 1 are being covered in the on-going phase for which funds have been received from central urban development fund and work orders worth ₹50.33 crore have recently been issued,” the official added.Chhail Bihari Goswami, the leader of the house in North MCD, did not comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-north-mcd-draws-rs-515-crore-plan-to-curb-road-dust-101638726874365.html

We must tackle Covid-19 and HIV in parallel," WHO Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti said.Covid has also slowed HIV screening rates because of restrictions of movements.UNAIDS last week warned that HIV infection rates were not decreasing fast enough to reach the goal of eradicating AIDS by 2030.According to data released at the annual International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (ICASA) currently being held in South Africa's port city of Durban, only nine African countries are on track to meet the target in the next four years.The countries are Botswana, Cape Verde, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe."This scorecard is a wake-up call for African governments to stay focused on ending AIDS," Moeti said.South Africa, the country with the world's highest HIV prevalence at 20.4 percent, is hosting the week-long annual meeting bringing together scientists, politicians and activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiv-infections-drop-in-africa-but-covid-hampers-fight-who-101638901136089.html

07-12-2021||World||Google sues 2 Russians, 15 others for alleged organized crime scheme||Alphabet Inc.’s Google is suing two Russian nationals it claims are part of a criminal enterprise that has silently infiltrated more than a million computers and devices around the world, creating “a modern technological and borderless incarnation of organized crime.”In a complaint being unsealed Tuesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Google names two defendants, Dmitry Starovikov and Alexander Filippov, as well as 15 unnamed individuals. Google claims the defendants have created a “botnet” known as Glupteba, to use for illicit purposes, including the theft and unauthorized use of Google users’ login and account information.A botnet is a network of internet-connected devices that have been infected with malware. When summoned together, they can do the bidding of a hacker, often with the devices’ owners not realizing their machines have been hijacked. A swarm of devices can jam traffic at websites, run malware to steal login credentials, sell fraudulent credit cards online and grant unauthorized access to other cyber criminals.The Glupteba botnet stands out from others because of its “technical sophistication,” using blockchain technology to protect itself from disruption, Google said in the complaint. At any moment, the power of the Glupteba botnet could be used in a powerful ransomware attack or distributed denial of service attack, Google said.It’s the first time that Google is going after a botnet, a spokesperson for the Mountain View, California-based company said in an email. “We are taking this action to further protect internet users and to send a message to cyber criminals that we will not tolerate this type of activity.” The spokesperson said the company worked with the US Department of Justice on the investigation. The Department of Justice declined to comment. Starovikov and Filippov couldn’t immediately be located for comment.The tech giant brought the action to court to “create a legal liability for the cyber criminals,” the spokesperson said. To bring “to light their identities and the infrastructure they are using.” Google said Starovikov and Filippov were connected to Glupteba by the servers used to set up their Gmail addresses. “Glupteba is notorious for stealing users’ credentials and data, mining cryptocurrencies on infected hosts, and setting up proxies to funnel other people’s internet traffic through infected machines and routers,” Google’s General Counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado and Google Vice President of Engineering Royal Hansen wrote in a blog post. In June 2020, security firm Sophos published a report on the Glupteba malware, noting it “was able to continuously thwart efforts at removing it from an infected machine,” researcher Luca Nagy wrote at the time. “Glupteba also takes a variety of approaches to lay low and avoid being noticed.”Google said it was bringing the action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, as well as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act and others, to disrupt the botnet, prevent it from causing further harm, and to recover damages.Some of the most notorious cybercriminal gangs have ties to Russia, which has been accused of providing them with safe haven. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied responsibility for any hacking attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-sues-2-russians-15-others-for-alleged-organized-crime-scheme-101638891427146.html
07-12-2021||World||China gives doles to motivate couples to have 3 children||Chinese provinces have started announcing a slew of supportive measures, including childbearing subsidies and tax cuts, to motivate couples to have three children to prevent a steep decline in the birth rates in the world's most populous country.China’s national legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC), had formally endorsed the three-child policy in August, in a major policy shift to address the deepening demographic crisis in the country.It passed a revised Population and Family Planning Law, which allows Chinese couples to have three children, in an apparent attempt to address the reluctance of the Chinese couples to have more kids due to mounting costs.More than 20 provincial-level regions of China have completed modifications to their local childbirth regulations since the country passed an amendment to its Population and Family Planning Law in August.Localities including Beijing, Sichuan and Jiangxi have rolled out supportive measures highlighting increased leave for couples, such as offering parental leave, extending maternity leave and marriage leave, and increasing paternity leave, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Monday."Government should play a leading role in sharing the cost of childbearing," National Health Commission official Yang Wenzhuang said, calling for more supportive measures in nursery services, childbearing subsidies and tax cuts.The amendment to the Population and Family Planning Law allows couples to have three children and stipulates supportive measures. It also cancels relevant restrictive measures, including fines for couples who violate the law to have more children than they are permitted.China permitted all couples to have two children in 2016, scrapping the draconian decades-old one-child policy which policymakers blame for the demographic crisis in the country.The decision to permit the third child came after the once-in-a-decade census showed that China’s population grew at the slowest pace to 1.412 billion amid official projections that the decline may begin as early as next year.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population above 60 years grew to 264 million, up by 18.7 per cent last year.Adding to the crisis was the decline of marriages in the country. The number of marriage registrations in China has fallen for seven consecutive years and hit a 17-year low last year, figures from the recently released China Statistical Yearbook 2021 showed.A total of 5.87 million couples got married in China in the first three quarters of 2021, down slightly from the same period of last year, according to data released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.It is expected that the number of marriage registrations in China will continue to decline in 2021, according to recent official media reports.Outlining the reasons for the falling marriage registrations, He Yafu, a demographic expert, identified decline in the number of young people in China as one of the reasons.The population of the post-80s, post-90s and post-2000s in China has been on the decline, he said.Also, the desire of young people to get married has generally fallen due to reasons such as the high work pressure and the great improvement of women's education level and economic independence, he told state-run China Daily earlier.Another major reason is the unbalanced ratio of male and female population. In China, men outnumber women by 34.9 million as per the seventh National Census.Among them, there are 17.52 million more men in their 20s than women of marriageable age.In addition, the high cost of living, including soaring housing prices, is also a big obstacle to young people wanting to get married and have children, he said.In China, marriage and childbirth are closely linked, and the proportion of children born out of wedlock is low, He said. So the decline in marriage registration is bound to have a negative impact on the birth rate, he said.

07-12-2021||World||Facebook sued for $150 billion by Rohingya refugees over Myanmar violence||Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are suing Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook, for $150 billion over allegations that the social media company did not take action against anti-Rohingya hate speech that contributed to violence.Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are suing Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook, for $150 billion over allegations that the social media company did not take action against anti-Rohingya hate speech that contributed to violence.|#+|A US class-action complaint, filed in California on Monday by law firms Edelson PC and Fields PLLC, argues that the company's failures to police content and its platform's design contributed to real-world violence faced by the Rohingya community.In a coordinated action, British lawyers also submitted a letter of notice to Facebook's London office.Facebook did not respond to a Reuters request for comment about the lawsuit. The company has said it was "too slow to prevent misinformation and hate" in Myanmar and has said it has since taken steps to crack down on platform abuses in the region, including banning the military from Facebook and Instagram after the Feb. 1 coup.A Myanmar junta spokesman did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on the legal action against Facebook.In 2018, UN human rights investigators said the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fueled the violence.A Reuters investigation that year, cited in the U.S. complaint, found more than 1,000 examples of posts, comments and images attacking the Rohingya and other Muslims on Facebook. Almost all were in the main local language, Burmese.The invective included posts calling the Rohingya or other Muslims dogs, maggots and rapists, suggested they be fed to pigs, and urged they be shot or exterminated.The posts were tolerated in spite of Facebook rules that specifically prohibit attacking ethnic groups with "violent or dehumanising speech" or comparing them to animals.Facebook has said it is protected from liability over content posted by users by a US internet law known as Section 230, which holds that online platforms are not liable for content posted by third parties. The complaint says it seeks to apply Myanmar law to the claims if Section 230 is raised as a defense.Although U.S. courts can apply foreign law to cases where the alleged harms and activity by companies took place in other countries, two legal experts interviewed by Reuters said they did not know of a successful precedent for foreign law being invoked in lawsuits against social media companies where Section 230 protections could apply.Anupam Chander, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said that invoking Myanmar law wasn't "inappropriate." But he predicted that "it's unlikely to be successful," saying that "it would be odd for Congress to have foreclosed actions under US law but permitted them to proceed under foreign law."More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar's Rakhine state in August 2017 after a military crackdown that refugees said included mass killings and rape. Rights groups documented killings of civilians and burning of villages.Myanmar authorities say they were battling an insurgency and deny carrying out systematic atrocities.The International Criminal Court has opened a case into the accusations of crimes in the region. In September, a US federal judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down.The new class-action lawsuit references claims by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who leaked a cache of internal documents this year, that the company does not police abusive content in countries where such speech is likely to cause the most harm.The complaint also cites recent media reports, including a Reuters report last month, that Myanmar's military was using fake social media accounts to engage in what is widely referred to in the military as "information combat."Mohammed Taher, a refugee living in the camps in Bangladesh that are home to more than a million Rohingya, said Facebook had been widely used to spread anti-Rohingya propaganda."We welcome the move," he said by phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-sued-for-150-billion-by-rohingya-refugees-over-myanmar-violence-101638885163757.html

07-12-2021||World||US will ‘pay’ for diplomatic boycott of Olympics: China||China on Tuesday accused the US of violating the Olympic spirit by announcing a diplomatic boycott of February’s Beijing Winter Games, warning Washington that it will “pay for its practices”, in a new diplomatic feud that’s certain to further strain ties already at the lowest point in decades.The White House on Monday said government officials would boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of China’s human rights “atrocities”, although American athletes are free to compete at the Games, which are to begin on February 4.Reacting strongly to the boycott, the Chinese foreign ministry said Washington is attempting to interfere with the Winter Olympics “out of ideological prejudice and based on lies and rumours”.China opposes the boycott and would take “resolute countermeasures”, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday without offering details.“The US will pay a price for its practices. You may stay tuned for follow-ups,” Zhao said.The boycott “seriously violates the principle of political neutrality of sports established by the Olympic Charter and runs counter to the Olympic motto ‘more united,’” Zhao said.Zhao urged the US to stop bringing politics into sports, adding that the boycott went against Olympic principles.According to Reuters, China’s embassy in Washington called the boycott “political manipulation” that would have no impact on the Games as no invitations had been extended to US politicians.The White House had called China’s human rights record “egregious” on Monday.“US diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC’s egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang, and we simply can’t do that,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a daily press briefing.“The athletes on Team USA have our full support,” Psaki added.“We will be behind them 100% as we cheer them on from home,” Psaki was quoted as saying by Reuters.The US diplomatic boycott comes less than a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Joe Biden talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges like climate change as the two leaders met for more than 200 minutes via video link in November, the first such meeting since Biden became president in January.Ties between the countries in recent years have been deeply acrimonious over wide-ranging issues including alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, Beijing’s crackdown on the democracy protests in Hong Kong and Washington’s ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as interference in its internal matters, and trade.Meanwhile, countries like Canada, Australia and Japan were still discussing internally their positions on the Games.New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson said his country would not send government officials but that decision was based largely on Covid-19 concerns and preceded the US boycott, according to agency reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-pay-for-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-china-101638875228621.html

Her sentence was later reduced from four years to two years.MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld and any development that undermines these processes is a matter of deep concern."We are disturbed at the recent verdicts. As a neighbouring democracy, India has been consistently supportive of the democratic transition in Myanmar," Bagchi said."We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. Any development that undermines these processes and accentuates differences is a matter of deep concern.""It is our sincere hope that keeping their nation's future in mind, efforts would be made by all sides to advance the path of dialogue," Bagchi said.Myanmar was rocked by massive protests after the military seized power in a coup on February 1. Hundreds of people, including children, were killed in the consequent crackdown against the protesters by the forces.Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), was among the key people detained by the military following the coup.

Shaped like a coffin, the euthanasia device allows its occupant to bring the oxygen level inside the glass capsule down to a critical level with just the blink of an eye, according to an Independent report citing the machine's creators.Also Read | Save a life! Read these signs for suicide preventionAs per the publication, the entire process takes less than a minute and allows the person to die “relatively peacefully and painlessly”. It is the latest example of advances in euthanasia machines, which are devices specifically engineered to allow an individual to die quickly with minimal pain in countries where voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide is legal.Although there is an ongoing debate about the ethics of euthanasia and the use of such devices, there are countries that have legalised voluntary death keeping in mind terminally ill patients who may be recommended for the same by either a physician or the person wishing to die. In Switzerland, for example, assisted suicide is legal and approximately 1,300 people were reported to have used the services of euthanasia organisations, such as Dignitas and Exit, last year. However, both of these organisations use ingestible liquid barbiturate drugs to induce a deep coma followed by death.Also Read | How to help a friend deal with depression and suicidal thoughtsThe Sarco ‘suicide machine’ was invented by Dr Philip Nitschke, dubbed ‘Dr Death’, and is short for “sarcophagus”. True to its name, the device literally serves as a tomb for its occupant, as the biodegradable capsule can detach itself from the base of the machine in order to serve as a coffin.The device has expectedly faced heavy criticism, specifically due to its nature wherein nitrogen flows into the capsule, displacing oxygen, leading to death. While some have drawn comparisons with a “gas chamber”, others have lambasted its futuristic design – noting that it “glorifies” suicide.However, with the Sarco machine passing legal scrutiny in Switzerland, its creators are likely to put it up and ready for operation in the country from next year, according to reports.--India suicide hotlines:Lifeline Foundation (Kolkata)+91 33 2474 4704+91 33 2474 58862474 5255AASRA (Navi Mumbai)+91 22 2754 6669ROSHNI (Secunderabad)+91 40 7904646Saath (Ahmedabad)+91 79 2630 5544+91 79 2630 0222SNEHA (Chennai)+91 (0) 44 2464 0050The Samaritans Sahara (Mumbai)+91-22-2307 3451Sumaitri (New Delhi)2338 9090||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-approves-euthanasia-device-for-painless-death-101638861581650.html
07-12-2021||World||Anil Menon, son of Indian immigrant, among 10 new Nasa astronaut trainees||NASA announced Monday its 10 latest trainee astronauts, who include a firefighter turned Harvard professor, a former member of the national cycle team, and a pilot who led the first-ever all-woman F-22 formation in combat.The 2021 class was whittled down from a field of more than 12,000 applicants and will now report for duty in January at the Johnson Space Center in Texas, where they will undergo two years of training."We're going back to the Moon, and we're continuing on to Mars -- and so today we welcome 10 new explorers," NASA administrator Bill Nelson said at an event to welcome the recruits."Alone, each candidate has 'the right stuff,' but together they represent the creed of our country: E pluribus unum - out of many, one," he added.The 10 candidates, who range in age from 32 to 45, will learn how to operate and maintain the International Space Station, train for spacewalks, develop robotics skills, safely operate a T-38 training jet, and learn Russian to communicate with their counterparts.After they graduate, they could be assigned to missions aboard the ISS or deeper into space, including NASA's planned return to the Moon later this decade under the Artemis mission, which will include the first woman and person of color to set foot on lunar soil.The field was open to US citizens who hold a master's degree in a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) field -- the first time such a requirement was added -- and passed an online test. The master's degree requirement could also be met by a medical degree or completion of a test pilot program.Childhood dreams"I first became interested in becoming an astronaut at a very, very early age," said Jessica Wittner, 38, a lieutenant commander in the US Navy who is a test pilot and aerospace engineer."I was that little girl in school who would play with rockets in the park by the house and loved science class."Others include fighter pilot Nichole Ayers who has more than 200 combat hours and is one of a few women currently flying the F-22 jet. In 2019 Ayers led the first all-woman formation of the aircraft in combat.Christopher Williams, 38, is an assistant professor of medical physics at Harvard University."I was splitting my time between helping to research better ways we can target radiation therapy for cancer, and then actually working as part of a multidisciplinary team to treat patients," said Williams, who holds a doctorate in astrophysics from MIT and has served as a volunteer emergency medical technician and firefighter.Anil Menon, 45, is a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force who was previously SpaceX's first flight surgeon before an earlier stint at NASA.A physician born to parents from India and Ukraine, he was a first responder during the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, 2015 earthquake in Nepal, and the 2011 Reno Air Show accident.Christina Birch, 35, holds degrees in mathematics and biochemistry and molecular biophysics, as well as a doctorate in biological engineering from MIT.She left a career in academia to race as a track cyclist on the US team, qualifying for the Olympics and winning World Cup medals in the team pursuit and Madison race.NASA's last class graduated in 2017.

07-12-2021||World||Biden, Putin to get on high-stakes video call today with eye on Ukraine||US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, are expected to get on a high-stakes video call on Tuesday, where the leaders are expected to address diplomatic ties over the escalating conflict in Ukraine. According to news agencies, Biden intends to warn Putin that if he orders the Russian forces placed on the border to attack Ukraine, the United States and its European allies may move to cut his country off from the international financial system, called SWIFT, and sanction top Russian banks and many of the president's closest associates.The Biden-Putin phone call today is, in many ways, significant for both the future of US-Russia relations as well as for international geopolitics shaping up power relations between two of the most powerful and influential nations in the world.It is not yet clear exactly how detailed the conversation will be, but people familiar with the matter told the Bloomberg news agency under the condition of anonymity that the consequences of the video meeting today are likely to spill over to the markets and the economy, as the US is already weighing Russia's ability to convert rubles for dollars and that of investors to buy Russian debt on the secondary market. The most drastic option, of course, would be to bar Russia’s access to the SWIFT financial payments system, but that is likely to wreak havoc on the lives of ordinary citizens.The Biden-Putin call comes amid high tensions over Russia's bid to invade Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops, according to the US intelligence, in the coming year. Although Russia has denied plans to go to war, its president has made it quite clear that he's willing to invade Ukraine – his forces did so in 2014 – to protect what he sees as “vital national security interests”.The US, however, does not want to commit its troops to Ukraine just yet, a senior Biden administration official confirmed, adding that attempts are on instead to help Ukraine and send more forces and capabilities to NATO allies bordering Russia.Biden’s Tuesday call with Putin, which will be the two leaders' fourth conversation and quite possibly the US president's highest-stakes leader-to-leader conversation since he took office in January, may now set the course for Ukraine’s ability to remain a fully independent nation. It is also expected to address other issues that the US may have with Russia, including the threat of cyberattacks and continuing disputes over Russia’s provision of energy to Europe.For Putin, though, the goal is partly the meeting itself: He gains legitimacy and international sway the more he interacts with Biden, demonstrating Russia’s continued prowess on the global stage. It’s a strategy that has worked for him, evidenced by the four conversations he’s had with Biden since January, more than most world leaders.A key challenge for Biden is one of force posture -- he will have to persuade Putin that stepped up economic pressure would bring the sort of pain that previous sanctions regimes haven’t, while essentially conceding that the use of US forces isn’t really on the table.According to a foreign diplomacy expert cited by the Bloomberg agency, the Putin-Biden video call today is akin to a “Russian roulette, Putin-style” – solely a matter of who blinks first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-to-get-on-high-stakes-video-call-today-with-eye-on-ukraine-101638843959245.html
07-12-2021||World||Nations on high alert as Covid variant spreads||Russia has confirmed the first two cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the country in travellers who returned from South Africa, health officials said on Monday.Russia restricted entry for all foreigners travelling from countries in southern Africa and required all Russian nationals returning from South Africa or neighbouring countries as of Thursday to quarantine for 14 days because of the new variant.Namibia has detected the Omicron variant in 18 of 19 samples sequenced between November 11-26, its health ministry said on Monday.Although the southern African country has sequenced relatively few samples, the finding suggests the variant first flagged by neighbouring South Africa and Botswana late last month, and since labelled “of concern” by the World Health Organization, is also highly prevalent in Namibia.Separately, Pakistan on Monday banned travel from 15 countries, including The Netherlands and South Africa, except under certain conditions, and tightened up travel restrictions on 13 other countries in wake of the threat of the new variant.Croatia confirmed on Monday its first two cases of Omicron, the state health institute said.“We are not sure about the source of the infection as neither of those two people had travelled abroad. We believe they got infected at a business meeting at which both participated,” said Bernard Kaic, an epidemiologist at the state health institute.Japan confirmed on Monday its third case of the new omicron variant as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida vowed to take strict measures based on a worst-case scenario of a possible resurgence of infections.Chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that the third confirmed case is a man in his 30s who tested positive upon arrival from Italy at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on December 1 and has since been isolated.However, initial data from South Africa, the epicentre of the outbreak of the Omicron variant, don’t show a resulting surge of hospitalisations. “Thus far, it doesn’t look like there’s a great degree of severity to it,” Anthony Fauci, US President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on Sunday, while cautioning it’s too early to be certain.Meanwhile, Italy tightened curbs on Monday on people still not vaccinated against Covid-19, limiting their access to an array of places and services.Under the new rules, only people who have been vaccinated or have recently recovered from Covid-19 can access indoor seating at bars and restaurants, visit museums, go to cinemas and clubs and attend sporting events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-on-high-alert-as-covid-variant-spreads-101638840708715.html
07-12-2021||World||Omicron vs Delta: Battle of coronavirus mutants is critical||As the Omicron coronavirus variant spreads in southern Africa and pops up in countries all around the world, scientists are anxiously watching a battle play out that could determine the future of the pandemic. Can the latest competitor to the world-dominating Delta overthrow it?Some scientists, poring over data from South Africa and the United Kingdom, suggest Omicron could emerge the victor.“It’s still early days, but increasingly, data is starting to trickle in, suggesting that Omicron is likely to outcompete Delta in many, if not all, places,” said Dr. Jacob Lemieux, who monitors variants for a research collaboration led by Harvard Medical School.But others said Monday it’s too soon to know how likely it is that Omicron will spread more efficiently than Delta, or, if it does, how fast it might take over.“Especially here in the US, where we’re seeing significant surges in Delta, whether Omicron’s going to replace it I think we’ll know in about two weeks,” said Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.Many critical questions about Omicron remain unanswered, including whether the virus causes milder or more severe illness and how much it might evade immunity from past Covid-19 illnesses or vaccines.On the issue of spread, scientists point to what’s happening in South Africa, where Omicron was first detected. Omicron’s speed in infecting people and achieving near dominance in South Africa has health experts worried that the country is at the start of a new wave that may come to overwhelm hospitals.The new variant rapidly moved South Africa from a period of low transmission, averaging less than 200 new cases per day in mid-November, to more than 16,000 per day over the weekend. Omicron accounts for more than 90% of the new cases in Gauteng province, the epicenter of the new wave, according to experts. The new variant is rapidly spreading and achieving dominance in South Africa’s eight other provinces.“The virus is spreading extraordinarily fast,” said Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute. “If you look at the slopes of this wave that we’re in at the moment, it’s a much steeper slope than the first three waves that South Africa experienced. This indicates that it’s spreading fast and it may therefore be a very transmissible virus.”But Hanekom, who is also co-chair of the South African Covid-19 variants Research Consortium, said South Africa had such low numbers of Delta cases when Omicron emerged, “I don’t think we can say” it out-competed Delta.Scientists say it’s unclear whether Omicron will behave the same way in other countries as it has in South Africa. Lemieux said there are already some hints about how it may behave; in places like the United Kingdom, which does a lot of genomic sequencing, he said, “we’re seeing what appears to be a signal of the exponential increase of omicron over Delta.”In the United States, as in the rest of the world, “there’s still a lot of uncertainty,” he said. “But when you put the early data together, you start to see a consistent picture emerge: that Omicron is already here, and based on what we’ve observed in South Africa, it’s likely to become the dominant strain in the coming weeks and months and will likely cause a surge in case numbers.”What that could mean for public health remains to be seen. Hanekom said early data from South Africa shows that reinfection rates are much higher with Omicron than previous variants, suggesting the virus is escaping immunity somewhat. It also shows the virus seems to be infecting younger people, mostly those who are unvaccinated, and most cases in hospitals have been relatively mild.But Binnicker said things could play out differently in other parts of the world or in different groups of patients. “It’ll be really interesting to see what happens when more infections potentially occur in older adults or those with underlying health conditions,” he said. “What’s the outcome in those patients?”As the world waits for answers, scientists suggest people do all they can to protect themselves.“We want to make sure that people have as much immunity from vaccination as possible. So if people are not vaccinated they should get vaccinated,” Lemieux said. “If people are eligible for boosters, they should get boosters, and then do all the other things that we know are effective for reducing transmission -- masking and social distancing and avoiding large indoor gatherings, particularly without masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-vs-delta-battle-of-coronavirus-mutants-is-critical-101638841226364.html
07-12-2021||World||Malaria deaths rose by 69,000 in 2020 due to Covid-19 disruptions: WHO||Healthcare disruptions linked to the coronavirus pandemic helped malaria kill 69,000 more people in 2020 than the previous year, but a worst-case scenario was averted, the World Health Organization said on Monday.In total over 627,000 people globally - most of them babies in the poorest parts of Africa - were killed by malaria last year compared with 558,000 in 2019, the WHO said in its annual malaria report.The number eclipses the 224,000 people reported having died from the coronavirus in Africa since the start of the pandemic.About two-thirds of the additional malaria deaths in 2020 were due to coronavirus restrictions disrupting prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malaria, the WHO said.But efforts to maintain health services despite the challenges meant Sub-Saharan Africa did not see the doubling of malaria deaths in 2020 that the WHO had warned was a possibility.Instead, the number of deaths in the region rose 12% compared with 2019, according to WHO data.“Thanks to urgent and strenuous efforts we can claim that the world has succeeded in averting the worst-case scenario of malaria deaths,” said Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO's global malaria programme.Experts hope the fight against malaria might gain considerable ground following the WHO's recommendation in October that RTS, S - or Mosquirix - a vaccine developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline should be widely given to children in Africa.“With increased funding, access to life-saving tools, and robust innovation in new tools to stay ahead of the evolving mosquito and parasite, we can accelerate transformative action and end malaria within a generation,” said Abdourahmane Diallo, chief executive of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria advocacy group.“We are now at a critical juncture, and I urge global leaders for renewed commitment and investment,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaria-deaths-rose-by-69-000-in-2020-due-to-covid-19-disruptions-who-101638838573335.html
07-12-2021||World||Biden may sanction Russia's top banks if Putin invades Ukraine||The US and European allies are weighing sanctions targeting Russia’s biggest banks and the country’s ability to convert rubles for dollars and other foreign currencies should President Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The sanctions -- including against some of Russia’s biggest banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund -- are among the options that President Joe Biden may spell out when he speaks with Putin on Tuesday, according to the people. The US could also restrict the ability of investors to buy Russian debt on the secondary market, they said. The options were described by two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The most drastic option would be to bar Russia’s access to the Swift financial payments system, but that would wreak havoc on ordinary citizens so officials are more inclined to go after Russia’s ability to convert rubles into dollars, euros, or British pounds, the people said. The Biden-Putin call comes with tensions high over what US intelligence has told allies could be a plan to invade Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops in the coming year. Russia has denied plans to go to war but has also said US and European nations should scale back their support for Ukraine, establishing de facto “red lines” that include barring the former Soviet republic from joining the NATO alliance. It’s not clear how much detail Biden will share with Putin on the possible sanctions that would follow an invasion, and most of the actions would be contingent on agreement from allies. Overall, the measures Biden is considering are part of an American effort to claw back some of the leverage Putin has amassed over Ukraine and, more broadly, the US and its European allies. The Russian leader has made clear that he’s willing to invade Ukraine -- his forces did so in 2014 -- to protect what he sees as vital national security interests, and he has shown a willingness to tamper with energy markets by threatening to cut supplies to Europe.Why Russia-Ukraine tensions are so hard to defuse“The reason Putin has so much leverage is he’s clearly willing to pay the price,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, said of past US moves to sanction Russia that had little effect. “But we’ve got loads more ammunition, there’s lots of stuff we could do. It’s just that no one has ever believed we would go to those lengths.”Biden’s Tuesday call with Putin, which will be the pair’s fourth conversation since the US president took office in January, is also meant to provide a way to defuse tensions that have crested again after an earlier Russian troop buildup in the spring first raised fears of war. “The goal here is to signal lots of action up front so you don’t have to do it, but making sure the threat is credible,” Rojansky said.A senior Biden administration official, speaking to reporters on Monday, made clear that the US doesn’t want to commit its troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. At the same time, the official said the US would help Ukraine and send more forces and capabilities to NATO allies bordering Russia. The official also declined to detail the steps the US would take if there’s a Russian invasion.How Europe Has Become So Dependent on Putin for Gas: QuickTakeThe call will help determine whether Biden’s desire for a functioning relationship with Russia is possible or whether the dynamic will just ricochet from crisis to crisis -- including cyberattacks, the potential invasion of Ukraine, and continuing disputes over Russia’s provision of energy to Europe. Last week Biden previewed his interest in taking a tougher approach, saying, “What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a tweet Monday that he had spoken with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and they “agreed to continue joint & concerted action.”Blinken tweeted that he assured the Ukrainian president that “US support for Ukraine is unwavering” and “there will be serious consequences for any escalation from Russia.”From the Biden administration’s view, a more positive turn of events could see the US having a stable relationship with Russia -- one where the two nations’ embassies and consulates are fully staffed, and where Russia helps bring Iran around to the idea of rejoining the 2015 deal that put limits on its nuclear program. The US could also play some role in getting Moscow and Kyiv to finally adhere to the 2015 Minsk agreements that were meant to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end.Putin’s GoalFor Putin, the goal is partly the meeting itself: He gains legitimacy and international sway the more he interacts with Biden, demonstrating Russia’s continued prowess on the global stage. It’s a strategy that has worked for him, evidenced by the four conversations he’s had with Biden since January, more than most world leaders. Russia has played up the significance of the encounter, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying it will be the equivalent of an in-person meeting and more substantial than a simple phone call.Putin will listen “with great interest” to Biden’s proposals on Ukraine,” Peskov said. “Let’s at least hope that the leaders will be able to get their concerns across, clearly formulate those, and respond.”Putin’s main demand -- binding guarantees from the US and its allies that NATO won’t expand farther east and won’t deploy weapons there that Russia considers a threat -- isn’t likely to get very far with Biden. The US president over the weekend rejected the Kremlin’s “red lines” over Ukraine as out of hand.But with tensions along the Ukraine-Russia border soaring, any high-level talks are helpful, said Rachel Ellehuus, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Biden will have to offer Putin some sort of an off-ramp to deescalate the situation,” Ellehuus said. On the decision to engage, she said, “It keeps people talking and avoids the worse consequence which is military confrontation.”The deliberations underscore just how intertwined Russia’s role as an energy supplier to Europe is with its security posture toward Ukraine, which has transit agreements for Russian gas. Energy is also a potential source of leverage: Continued Russian aggression could reshape the fate of the completed but not yet operational Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which the Biden administration hasn’t tried to stop even though it opposes the project.“I think Nord Stream 2 is very much on the table,” said Steven Pifer, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. Biden still has options to impose broader sanctions, he said. “There are things that you can do to greatly ratchet up the pain.”One crucial result of the call will be a better understanding of what exactly Putin wants. While US officials say the intelligence suggests Putin is planning for a major ground invasion of Ukraine, they say the administration doesn’t know with confidence what the Russian leader is planning -- and don’t believe he’s made any final decision.That uncertainty is a tactic Putin has used for a long time. A key challenge for Biden is one of force posture -- he will have to persuade Putin that stepped up economic pressure would bring the sort of pain that previous sanctions regimes haven’t, while essentially conceding that the use of US forces isn’t really on the table.“It’s Russian roulette, Putin-style -- who will blink first?” said Oksana Antonenko, director at Control Risks in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-may-sanction-russia-s-top-banks-if-putin-invades-ukraine-101638836498621.html
07-12-2021||World||UK minister confirms community transmission of Omicron variant||The UK’s health minister on Monday told Parliament that the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 is now in transmission within the community across regions of England, as he confirmed a total of 336 cases of the mutation first detected in South Africa.According to the latest data, there are now 261 cases in England, 71 in Scotland and four in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases across the UK to 336, Sajid Javid said in his statement to the House of Commons."This includes cases with no links to international travel. So, we can conclude that there is now community transmission across multiple regions of England," he said.The minister informed Parliament about the addition of Nigeria to the UK’s red list travel ban and pre-departure PCR or lateral flow tests for anyone travelling to the country starting Tuesday.“We are leaving nothing to chance. Our strategy is to buy ourselves time and strengthen our defences while our world-leading scientists assess this new variant and what it means for our fight against Covid-19," he said.Javid also updated the Commons on previously released data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) about recent scientific analysis which suggests that the window of infection may be shorter for Omicron than for the Delta variant.However, he said that there is no "clear picture" on whether the variant causes more severe disease or how it is impacted by the current vaccines being administered for Covid-19."And so we can't say for certain, at this point, whether Omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery," said Javid.From 4 AM local time on Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from a non-red list country, whether vaccinated or not, will have to show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test taken no earlier than 48 hours before departing for the UK.Javid said that the new measures, which also include every traveller having a Day 2 PCR test and isolating until getting a negative result, are temporary and will be reviewed next week.Experts have said there is increasing concern Omicron is spreading more quickly than the Delta variant, currently the predominant variant in the UK.Professor Paul Hunter from the School of Medicine at the University of East Anglia said the early signs show that the Omicron variant "will probably spread quite quickly"."And probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least," he told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-confirms-community-transmission-of-omicron-variant-101638834110366.html
07-12-2021||India||SC rejects NIA plea against bail to Sudha Bharadwaj||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the National Investigation Agency (NIA)’s petition against the bail granted by the Bombay high court to activist Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused in the Bhima Koregaon violence case, as it affirmed that only a special court was competent to give more time to the agency to complete its investigation in the 2018 case. A bench, headed by justice Uday U Lalit, held that there was no infirmity in the December 1 high court order granting default bail to Bhardwaj on account of the legal lacuna in the investigating agency seeking time beyond 90 days in filing a charge sheet in the case. “The moot question is whether the court was a competent court to grant extension of time beyond the stipulated 90 days for filing of the charge sheet. If the competence was lacking, there was no valid extension of period and the lady had already moved for bail. So, she was entitled to statutory bail...we see no reason to interfere with the Bombay high court order,” observed the bench, which also comprised justices S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi. The court warned NIA against making any extraordinary arguments in its appeal against Bhardwaj’s bail order that may cast a shadow of doubt over validity of proceedings in several other cases lodged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). “Your argument has to be in the context of whole universe of criminal case. You cannot make an argument in this case and leave it,” commented the bench, as additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, representing NIA, sought to argue that states cannot constitute courts under the NIA Act until the central government approves transfer of investigations to them. Lekhi had made this argument to buttress the point that not only a special court but even a sessions court was entitled to extend the time for filing the charge sheet. NIA took over the probe only in January 2020 while the 90 days expired on January 25, 2019. “How many such cases have you transferred? That means state which have constituted courts under NIA are without jurisdiction. That cannot be...you will be rendering your law redundant. You cannot make this argument for only this case and leave it at that. You are unduly restricting Section 22 of NIA Act (on power of states to constitute special courts). Otherwise also, you are denuding the state of its normal powers,” said the bench, rejecting Lekhi’s submissions. Several activists, lawyers and authors are facing charges under UAPA for participating in an alleged Maoist conspiracy to trigger violence on January 1, 2018, in the Bhima Koregaon village of Maharashtra’s Pune district.On December 1, the high court allowed default bail to Bharadwaj, underlining that a Pune sessions judge, who granted police a 90-day extension on November 26, 2018, to file the charge sheet, did not have jurisdiction to do so, as only a special NIA court could hear UAPA cases. The high court pointed out that the Pune sessions court was not notified as a special court under the NIA Act. There was already a special NIA court in existence in Pune at the relevant time, it had noted. Bhardwaj, who had filed application for default bail when 90 days expired, was thus granted bail by the court, which asked the activist to approach a special NIA court on December 8 for bail conditions to be set. She is currently lodged at Byculla women’s prison. But the applications of eight co-accused facing terrorism and conspiracy charges for allegedly fomenting violence in Bhima Koregaon were rejected since they had not moved for bail immediately after the expiry of 90 days. NIA moved the top court soon after the high court allowed default bail to Bharadwaj, contending that the high court failed to appreciate that all sessions courts were competent to examine the matters relating to remand and extension of time in filing the charge sheet. On Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta mentioned the matter before Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, requesting an urgent listing. He informed the court that the matter required to be heard before Wednesday, when the bail order will take effect.When the matter came up before the bench led by justice Lalit on Tuesday, Lekhi pressed that jurisdiction of the court is irrelevant for the purpose of remand. “Competence of a court is relevant only for the purpose of trial. Remand is distinct from trial and enquiry,” argued Lekhi, citing Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code that talks about remand and extension of remand.However, referring to Section 167, the bench pointed out that while the provision lays down that an accused has to be produced before a nearest magistrate within 24 hours of his or her arrest, it mentions that a court has to apply its mind in giving extra time to an investigating agency to complete its probe and file the charge sheet by keeping the accused in custody. “If the word used in proviso to Section 167 is ‘court’ and ‘not magistrate’, there has to be a legislative intent behind it. Why should we now read a ‘court’ as a ‘magistrate’? There is a hierarchy of courts under the NIA Act. If there were no intervening steps and no special courts, you, perhaps arguably, have been correct. But if there are special courts, your argument doesn’t augur well,” the bench told Lekhi. “Also, imagine a situation where a magistrate, who is not competent to try a case, refuses to grant extension of time and sets free the accused, what will you do? This would create a very inconvenient situation...A court which otherwise isn’t competent to go into a matter will be making a ruling of such a nature. Will that not do a violence to the scheme of your Act that only a competent court should go into merits of a case? That’s why it has to be construed as a special court,” the bench observed.
07-12-2021||India||‘India leading the recovery in global aviation industry’: Scindia||Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia held a meeting of the Consultative Committee of his Ministry on Tuesday to discuss Flying Training Organisations (FTOs) in the country. Scindia said that the role of India’s FTOs has become critical as the fast-growing Indian aviation industry requires a growing supply of high-quality pilots. He said that India has been one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world and it is now leading the recovery in the global aviation industry.There are 34 Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) approved FTOs in the country. Out of these 34, one FTO (IGRUA at Amethi, UP) is under the administrative control of the central government, eight are under the state governments and 25 are owned by the private sectors, according to the release.“Given the fleet projection, India may require around 9,000 pilots over the next five years implying the requirement of almost 1800 pilots per annum,” Scindia said.Scindia said, “there is a need to expand the capacity of Indian FTOs with a view to reducing the dependence on foreign FTOs.”On the measures taken to bridge the gap, Scindia said a liberalized FTO policy has been announced by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) wherein the concept of airport royalty was abolished and the annual fee was rationalized significantly for new FTOs to be set up at AAI airports.“The AAI has issued award letters for nine flying schools to be established at five airports in early to mid-2022,” the minister said.“He said that with a close collaboration between the government, regulatory authorities, FTOs, aerospace companies and the airline industry, India has the potential to become a global flying training hub by 2030,” Scindia added.The minister said that India’s scheduled airlines have a fleet of 710 aircraft, which is projected to grow to over 1,000 aircraft in the next five years.“With a new liberalized helicopter policy announced in October, a significant increase in India’s helicopter fleet is expected over the next five years,” he added, stating that on November 21, around 3.93 lakh domestic passengers flew to various places, which was nearly 98.7% of the pre-Covid average. Besides, on November 20, 3810 MT of cargo, 103% of the pre-Covid level, was transported via domestic airlines, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-leading-the-recovery-in-global-aviation-industry-scindia-101638900556622.html

The Sri Lankan public security minister Rear Admiral (Retd) Sarath Weerasekara demanded an apology from the Pakistan minister.“Pakistan's minister of defence must apologise to the people of Sri Lanka for those remarks,” Weerasekara was quoted as saying by news agency News1st TV.Khattak allegedly said that ‘murders can happen when people get emotional’ when he was asked that if the recent lifting of the ban on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) could be connected to the incident. It was the hardline Islamist supporters of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) who lynched Diyawadana, a factory manager, for opposing pasting of posters of TLP in factory premises, which contained Islamic verses and tossed them away and allegedly committing blasphemy, and burnt him in the middle of the street.The Imran Khan government earlier this year, owing to massive protests from the TLP, released more than 1,000 prisoners accused of terrorism who were part of the group. The TLP also caused damages to several cities in Pakistan when it demanded the expulsion of the French envoy following the release of Prophet Muhammad’s caricatures in France. It withdrew its demand after the prisoners were released.Pakistani media also criticised the defence minister. News agency Dawn in its editorial said that the remarks "create an impression that such killings are somehow a ‘normal’ part of growing up in a country where religion can be used to justify crime."“Mr Khattak’s remarks are deeply problematic. Such a statement from a federal minister should come as a shock, but unfortunately, we are accustomed to our public officials being in denial about the realities of extremism and violence in the country,” the editorial said.Sri Lanka’s prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa earlier this week reiterated that he hopes Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan would avenge the death of the factory manager from Kandy who was living and working in Pakistan for more than a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sialkot-lynching-pak-min-makes-controversial-remark-angers-lankan-minister-101638898994539.html
07-12-2021||India||‘Nano, auto and cycle’: Devendra Fadnavis critiques Goa Cong, then a prophecy||PANAJI: Former Maharashtra chief minister and Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said that Congress would soon be reduced to a ‘cycle party’ - a party with only two wheels, or MLAs - after the BJP receives the “blessings” of Pratapsingh Rane, one of the three remaining Congress lawmakers in the Goa assembly.Pratapsingh Rane, a 10-term legislator, is Goa’s longest serving MLA. He also holds a record for having served as chief minister of the state for a little less than 16 years across six terms between 1980 and 2007. He was the assembly speaker between 2007 and 2012.The 82-year-old veteran politician has also stayed firmly with the Congress for decades.Fadnavis suggested this could change. Pratapsingh Rane’s son Vishwajit Rane quit the Congres in 2017 after the party couldn’t form the government despite emerging as the largest party in the 40-member assembly with 17 legislators, resigned as MLA and won the bye-election on a BJP ticket. He was appointed health minister, a post he continues to hold in the Pramod Sawant government.The Congress’s strength in the assembly, meanwhile, continued to drop over the next four years and was down to four MLAs. On Tuesday,it came down further to three after Ravi Naik resigned from the assembly, the Congress to join the BJP.Former chief minister Fadnavis, who was present at the event to welcome Ravi Naik, did not miss the opportunity to take swipes at the Congress over its depleted strength in the assembly.Fadnavis said the Congress was reduced to a ‘Nano’ party with only four legislators left (after former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro) crossed over to the Trinamool Congress (TMC), and after Ravi Naik’s exit, has become an ‘autorickshaw’ party with only three legislators. He prophesied that this will also change.“Once we get Pratapsingh Rane’s blessings, it will be reduced to a cycle,” Fadnavis told the BJP event.Pratapsingh Rane hasn’t reacted to Fadnavis’ claim. It is unclear if the veteran politician will seeki a re-election, or if he will continue with the Congress closer to the polls.At the event, Fadnavis continued to take potshots at the Congres over its leadership crisis and referred to the group of 23 Congress leaders who, in August 2020, first wrote to Sonia Gandhi seeking organisational changes to take on the BJP.Some of the criticism from G23 has been that the Congress does not have a full-time president. Gandhi was named interim president in 2019.“The party which cannot find itself a leader - with Sonia saying Rahul should be the president, the G23 saying one among them should be the president, Priyanka Gandhi saying look in my direction as well and Rahul Gandhi a reluctant leader. In such a situation, leaders who have risen up from the grassroots have begun to desert the party,” Fadnavis said.To be sure, Ravi Naik’s exit from the Congress does not come as a surprise to the state unit which gave up on the politician in August 2020 after his sons ejected from the party.It is Naik’s second entry to the BJP, having once joined the party back in 2000. He was made a deputy chief minister to Manohar Parrikar after the latter engineered a split in the Goa Congress then led by chief minister Francisco Sardinha, who himself had led a faction of Congress MLAs that dethroned his predecessor chief minister Luizinho Faleiro.Naik, a veteran politician also spent a little over two years as Goa chief minister across two terms whilst also having served as a member of parliament for a brief term between 1998 and 1999 representing North Goa.Naik is the third MLA in Goa in recent weeks to resign following Luizinho Faleiro who joined the TMC and Jayesh Salgaocar of the Goa Forward who also joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nano-auto-and-cycle-devendra-fadnavis-critiques-goa-cong-then-a-prophecy-101638897552385.html

It was earlier informed that Congress interim president had formed a four-member team to visit Nagaland and submit a report within a week on the civilian deaths. Besides Gogoi, the team would comprise senior party leaders Jitendra Singh, Ajoy Kumar and Anto Antony.Meanwhile, the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress party will meet Union home minister Amit Shah in Parliament on Wednesday to hand over a memorandum seeking compensation for the families of the victims. The TMC has also asked the Centre to come clean with its position on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).Earlier in the day, the Nagaland cabinet, headed by Neiphiu Rio, decided to demand the repeal of the controversial Act that gives the armed forces to operate with impunity.The first incident in which six civilians were killed, occurred when army personnel mistook coal mine workers returning home in a pick-up van on Saturday evening, to be insurgents belonging to the Yung Aung faction of the banned outfit NSCN(K). Also read | Armed forces' excesses don't go well in democracy like India: Neiphiu RioWhen workers failed to reach their homes, local villagers went in search of them and surrounded the army vehicles. In the ensuing melee, a soldier was killed and army vehicles set ablaze. Soldiers said they fired in self-defence that led to death of another seven civilians. Rioting spilled over into Sunday afternoon when angry mobs vandalised the offices of the Konyak Union and an Assam Rifles camp in the area, setting fire to parts of the camp, police had said. At least one more person was killed, as security forces fired back at attackers. The Nagaland Police filed a suo moto FIR against the 21st Para Special Force of the Army. The army has ordered a court of inquiry headed by an officer of major general rank into the Nagaland incident. Expressing regret over the Nagaland firing incident, Shah on Monday said a probe by an SIT will be completed within a month and asserted that all agencies must ensure such happenings do not recur while taking action against insurgents.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-cong-team-to-meet-victims-kin-on-saturday-tmc-seeks-shah-s-time-101638895349132.html
07-12-2021||India||‘Highest cases of infiltration reported along Bangladesh border’: MHA||The government told the Parliament on Tuesday that the highest cases of cross-border infiltration to India has been reported along the India- Bangladesh border.The Ministry of Home Affairs said this in response to a question posed by Lok Janshakti Party MP Chirag Paswan in the Lok Sabha. Paswan sought to know whether the number of cases of infiltration has come to light in bordering areas during the last three years.In a written reply, Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Nisith Pramanik said, “128 infiltrations reported along Pakistan border, 1787 along Bangladesh border, 25 along Nepal border, 133 along Myanmar border while nil at China and Bhutan border.”He added that these cases are dealt with by the Border Guarding Forces in close coordination with other government agencies including state governments, as per the extant laws.During the Monsoon session in August, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt had told the parliament recently that there were 441 infiltration attempts made along the India-Bangladesh border in the first six months of 2021. He said that 740 infiltrators from Bangladesh were apprehended and one was killed by the security forces.India and Bangladesh share a 4,095 kilometre-long border of which around 1,116 kilometres is riverine. Bangladesh is surrounded by five Indian states – West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura – on three sides.Cross-border crimes and infiltration from Bangladesh have prompted the Indian government to adopt a multi-pronged approach to checking illegal activities while increasing surveillance along the border.When asked about whether the government proposes to constitute a special monitoring team to track and check infiltration in view of a steep rise in population ratio particularly in border areas, Pramanik said the government agencies including the Border Guarding Forces are monitoring and taking steps to check and curb infiltration.The MoS further said that the government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to contain cross-border infiltration including deployment of the Border Guarding Forces along the International Borders, erection of border fencing and floodlighting, effective domination of the borders by patrolling among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-cases-of-infiltration-reported-along-bangladesh-border-mha-101638894853120.html
07-12-2021||India||Will make every effort to unite all non-BJP parties: NCP||The NCP on Tuesday said it will make every effort to form a broad-based alliance of parties, including the Congress, to take on the BJP in 2024, but distanced itself from Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee's barbs at the grand old party.Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the NCP working committee, party spokesperson Nawab Malik said people of the country were "fed up" with the BJP government at the Centre and were yearning for change in 2024."We will make every effort to unite all non-BJP parties, including the Congress, to forge an alternative to the BJP. People want change in 2024. If an alternative alliance is formed, there will be change in 2024," Malik said, but remained silent on the leadership of such an alliance.He said NCP chief Sharad Pawar has been stressing on the need to unite all opposition parties to form a broad-based alternative to the BJP."The UPA does not have all parties. Non-UPA parties have more MPs than the UPA. If those people are not brought together, forming a large alternative will be difficult," Malik said.The NCP's remarks on an alternative to the BJP came on a day Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, days after Banerjee had declared that the UPA was dead. She had also taken potshots at Gandhi, virtually questioning the Congress's leadership of the opposition grouping.On the upcoming assembly elections in five states, Malik said the NCP was in talks with the Congress for a pre-poll alliance in Goa and Uttarakhand, while communication channels were open with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for a possible tie up in Uttar Pradesh.The NCP also adopted resolutions extending support the agitating farmers in their fight for a legal cover to the minimum support price for farm produce and compensation to the next of kin of farmers who died during the year-long protests.The party decided to launch nationwide protests on the issue of price rise, particularly the high prices of petroleum products.Malik said the internal elections of the NCP will be held next year which will be followed by a national convention in Delhi on June 9 and 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-make-every-effort-to-unite-all-non-bjp-parties-ncp-101638892833621.html

Kovind will join the 50th Victory Day celebrations on December 16.He held talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart Masud Bin Momen and met foreign minister AK Abdul Momen on Tuesday. Shringla will call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday. Following his meeting with Shringla, the Bangladeshi foreign minister told reporters in Dhaka they had discussed a number of “pending issues” between Bangladesh and India, including water-sharing and deaths in incidents along the border.The foreign minister said Dhaka had urged New Delhi to expedite the process of holding the next meeting of the joint river commission to resolve water-sharing issues. “They gave us a formula to check unwanted incidents on the frontier,” he said.He added India isn’t expected to make any move that could create cracks in the ongoing “golden chapter” of bilateral relations. “They also don’t want to see any incident that could make any kind of (crack) in Bangladesh-India relations,” he told the media. “We have to solidify this relation…it is needed for the welfare of the people of both countries,” he added.Talking to the media after his meeting with the Bangladeshi foreign secretary, Shringla said there is “no major difference in opinions” on pending issues between India and Bangladesh. “We discussed the issues but we found no major differences…There are only areas to take forward. We are looking forward to how we can work on (resolving the issues),” he was quoted as saying by BSS news agency.Masud Bin Momen said he and Shringla had a fruitful discussion on all pending issues during their meeting that lasted almost an hour, but didn’t give any details. “We also discussed how we can make our border peaceful,” he said. Among the issues that figured in the discussions were connectivity, green energy, green technology and e-commerce, Masud Bin Momen said. Cooperation between the two sides for the Covid-19 response will continue as “Bangladesh cannot be safe if India is not safe and India cannot be safe if Bangladesh is not safe”, he added.Shringla said connectivity projects between the two sides are going on well and five out of six historic rail connections have been restored and the sixth one will be completed this year. He said India wants to promote eco-friendly railway and water connectivity with Bangladesh. He added that the Indian prime minister and the president had made Bangladesh the destination for their first foreign visit following the pandemic, and this shows the bilateral relationship is passing through a “golden chapter”. Shringla also said New Delhi and Dhaka are working to arrange Prime Minister Hasina’s visit to India at the earliest. The Indian foreign secretary arrived in Dhaka a day after both countries celebrated “Maitri Diwas” or friendship day in 18 cities worldwide, including Dhaka and New Delhi to commemorate their close ties over the past 50 years. The external affairs ministry describes India’s ties with Bangladesh as one of the strongest pillars of its “Neighbourhood First” policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-shringla-s-bangladesh-visit-focus-on-bilateral-cooperation-boosting-connectivity-101638892032410.html

Spain on Tuesday gave its nod to vaccinating five to 11-year-olds.  India, which is second in the world in the cumulative tally of Covid-19 cases after the United States, has approved emergency-use authorisation to two vaccines for children - Zydus Cadila's ZyCoV-D and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, but is yet to start the vaccination processIndia's indigenous Covid-19 vaccine ‘Covaxin’ that received the WHO approval for emergency-use listing (EUL) on November 3, was given the green signal to be administered in children aged two to 18 by the expert panel of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). However, the DCGI is yet to approve Covaxin for children with the Centre informing at the ongoing winter session of Parliament recently that additional data has been sought from manufacturer Bharat Biotech and the expert panel's recommendation is being examined.Also Read | Additional data sought, expert panel’s recommendations being examined: Centre on Covaxin for kidsDr Verma noted that as soon as Covid-19 vaccine for kids is rolled out in India, as many children as possible should be vaccinated. “So, if all the adults around them are vaccinated and practice Covid-appropriate behaviour, then we can protect the children,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Besides getting jabbed and following protocols, Dr Verma said that people must conduct RT-PCR tests as soon as they develop symptoms of coronavirus.Echoing Dr Verma, senior paediatrician at Delhi's Sir Gangaram Hospital, Dr Dhiren Gupta told ANI that some “alarming reports” from South Africa - where Omicron variant was first discovered, reveal hospitalisation rates are witnessing a surge among kids aged below five. “Only vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour can prevent such infections from entering our homes,” Dr Gupta added.He pointed out that the first two Omicron cases in India, reported in Karnataka, show that they didn't spread the infection to their secondary contacts. The doctor stressed on the possibility that immunised (vaccinated) host infectivity “is less due to less viral load.”Dr Gupta highlighted that strict measures must be adopted to ensure that no adult in India escapes the vaccination coverage. These include not permitting anyone to leave their home unless vaccinated against Covid-19. “Unvaccinated human should be considered as a vehicle which is polluting roads and is injurious to other humans,” the doctor was quoted as saying by ANI.Dr Gupta said that once safety of Covid-19 vaccine jabs for children is “assured”, pediatric vaccination must be initiated in the country.India has so far reported as many as 23 Omicron cases, with Maharashtra accounting for 10 of them. On Monday, two people were found to be infected with the variant in Mumbai. A 37-year-old who arrived from South Africa and his 36-year-old friend who reached the Maharashtra capital from the US. Authorities told Hindustan Times that both the infected persons showed no symptoms and were vaccinated against coronavirus with Pfizer-BioNtech's vaccine.Other than Maharashtra, Omicron cases have been detected in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi and Karnataka.Starting December 1, India revised its travel guidelines for all international arrivals. These include mandatory RT-PCR tests for all international flyers, and an addition of seven-day quarantine for those coming from at-risk countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-must-get-vaccinated-doctors-solution-to-protecting-kids-from-omicron-101638886629149.html

The UN resident coordinator is the highest-ranking representative of the UN development system and is the designated representative of the UN secretary-general.He reaffirmed the UN’s lasting commitment to India’s national development priorities and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and thanked the government for its commitment to multilateralism while presenting his credentials on Monday. Sharp also lauded India’s leadership in implementing and localising the SDGs and for sharing valuable lessons learned on best practices with other countries.Muraleedharan welcomed Sharp and said, “India is ready to share its experience and expertise in accelerating inclusive and sustainable development through the UN-India partnership. We look forward to working closely with the UN system in India.”Sharp commended India on behalf of the UN country team for its public health measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, ambitious climate goals and commitment to ensuring that development gains reach the last mile. “Having already administered nearly one-and-a-half billion doses of Covid vaccines is an impressive milestone,” he said. “We believe that if India achieves the SDGs, the world will achieve the SDGs, and towards that, we stand firmly with India and all its people.” Sharp said his team will help lead preparations for the next UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, outlining the collective UN team offer of partnership. The UN presence in India consists of 26 agencies, funds and specialised programmes.Sharp, a US national, has more than 25 years of experience in sustainable development.

07-12-2021||India||RLD, SP alliance to kick out politics of hatred in UP, says Jayant Chaudhary||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Chaudhary on Tuesday announced that he will be aligning with the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Hinting earlier on several occasions that his outfit would ally with the SP, Chaudhary said if the coalition is elected to power it would construct a memorial for the farmers who died during protests against the contentious agricultural laws.The RLD leader criticised the Uttar Pradesh government over the deaths of farmers and also highlighted the recent case of paper leak and exams being cancelled owing to that. He accused the Yogi Adityanath-led government of forcing young people to migrate to other states for better jobs. “The first work our double-engine government will do is to construct a memorial for martyr farmers, who died during farmers' protest here in the land of Chowdhury Charan Singh,” Chaudhary was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Chaudhary also accused the BJP of spreading hate. “The BJP talks of ‘hatred’ and ‘our Babaji’ starts with Aurangzeb and ends with the Kairana exodus,” Chaudhary said in an apparent reference to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.He also urged the people of the state to relieve the Uttar Pradesh chief minister of his responsibilities. “Babaji becomes angry very fast. You have never seen him smiling. He smiles only when he is with calves. I ask you to relieve him so that he can play with his calves 24 hours. He cannot handle government files,” Chaudhary remarked. He also lauded the farmers for their fight that led to the repeal of the three controversial laws.The SP is working towards presenting itself as a strong alternative to the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. While the Congress and the BSP continue to form alliances with smaller partners, the SP is working with the RLD and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party in a bid to hurt BJP’s electoral chances in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rld-sp-alliance-to-kick-out-politics-of-hatred-in-up-says-jayant-chaudhary-101638880665834.html

Rahul raised the issue earlier, too, and criticised the Modi government for not keeping data on deaths of farmers.“Around 700 farmers died in farmers’ agitation. The prime minister apologised to the farmers and accepted his mistake. On November 30, the agriculture minister was asked a question: ‘How many farmers died in the agitation? The agriculture minister said he had no data,” Rahul said.He cited examples of the Punjab government and claimed that it paid compensation of ₹5 lakh each to more than 400 farmers and gave jobs to 152 farmers. He earlier offered the government his list which he claimed contained names of the deceased farmers.“I want the farmers to be given their rights. The prime minister has already apologised. Now, farmers should get compensation and jobs,” the Wayanad MP said.Meanwhile in a letter to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the government said that it will withdraw all cases against the farmers barring those of rape and murder. The farmers’ body will hold another meeting tomorrow to decide the course of the protests.“The government proposed that they will agree to our demands and that we should end the protest but the proposal is unclear. We have our apprehensions which will be discussed tomorrow at 2pm. Our movement is not going anywhere, will be here,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Farmer leaders told HT that the Centre agreed to take farmers and stubble burning out of the purview of NCR anti-pollution law and to withdraw the Electricity Amendment Bill. People familiar with the developments told HT that the farmers are likely to take out a victory march before returning to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-asks-centre-to-compensate-kin-of-farmers-who-died-in-protests-101638887667897.html

Mehbooba Mufti says no lawyer to defend arrested J&K students||People's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday said she feels the country is changing from what Mahatma Gandhi had envisioned to one that his assassin Nathuram Godse may have aspired to.Citing the change in reaction to cheering for and celebration of India-Pakistan matches over the years, the former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister slammed the arrest of three Kashmiri students in an engineering college in Agra for allegedly cheering for Pakistan following India’s defeat during a group stage match between the two teams in the recently concluded T20 World Cup.Mufti, who addressed an interactive session organised by the Indian Women Press Corps (IWPC) in Delhi, recalled a cricket match between the two teams when Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) co-founder Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the country’s Prime Minister.“I remember a cricket match between India and Pakistan during Vajpayee ji's era, where citizens of Pakistan were cheering for India and citizens of India were cheering for Pakistan,” she said, adding that former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had also once praised the then Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.Also Read | Mufti demands release of J-K students arrested for celebrating Pak cricket winHowever, she said, today, there was not a single lawyer ready to defend the three Kashmiri students who were arrested in Agra recently. “So, it feels like Gandhi's India is turning into Godse's India,” Mufti was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Godse had assassinated Gandhi on January 30,1948.The Kashmiri students were arrested in the UP town following a complaint lodged by a BJP Yuva Morcha leader, Gaurav Rajawat. As per the first information report (FIR) filed, the students used anti-national slogans like “Bharat desh ke tukde honge” and applauded Pakistan by raising slogans such as “Pakistan Zindabad”.Also Read | Mehbooba stages dharna at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar, says Kashmir ‘in pain’Soon after the incident, Mufti had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling for his intervention in the matter.In the letter, the PDP chief said that a cricket match between the two countries was “solely a source of entertainment” for Kashmiri people but resulted in the youngsters getting booked for “simply choosing to cheer the winning side”.Mufti had written that patriotism and a sense of loyalty need to be nurtured with compassion and cannot be forced by “wielding the baton or by the barrel of a gun”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhi-or-godse-s-india-mufti-says-no-lawyer-to-defend-kashmiri-students-101638871144230.html

Das told the high court that the tribunal did not amend its verdict when he pointed out the error.The two-judge bench comprising justices Kotiswar Singh and Malashri Nandi on Monday set aside the tribunal’s ex-parte order, holding that it was illegal.“After going through with the details of documents submitted, we have learnt that the petitioner never received any notice from the concerned foreigners’ tribunal and as such, the ex-parte order is illegal and liable to be set aside,” the bench said.The high court also noted Jantu Das’ assertion that he has “sufficient” documentary evidence to establish his Indian citizenship.Das told the high court that the notices were being sent to another person named Sukesh Das, whose father’s name was the same as his father. The high court noted that there was no evidence before the court to indicate that Sukesh Das was related to Jantu Das. The high court ordered the foreigners’ tribunal in Assam’s Cachar district to hear the case afresh from January 1, 2022. “We are of the opinion that the petitioner may be afforded another opportunity to appear before the learned foreigner’s tribunal. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the present petition is allowed by setting aside the impugned ex-parte order dated 18.09.2017 passed by the learned member, Foreigners Tribunal-4th Cachar at Silchar,” the high court said.There have been several instances where the foreigners’ tribunal orders have been cancelled or paused by the high court, often on grounds that the tribunal did not give sufficient opportunity before delivering its verdict.Like Sukdev Ree of Assam’s Hailakandi district, a 65-year-old tea garden worker, who was declared a foreigner in 2016 and served imprisonment for three years. The Gauhati high court found the tribunal’s order incomplete and told the Hailakandi foreigner’s tribunal (FT) to hear the case again on December 3, 2021. Ree died a fortnight before he was scheduled to appear before the tribunal on the high court’s orders to establish his citizenship.Social activist Kamal Chakraborty, who accompanied Ree’s family to court on December 3 to continue the legal battle, said, “Isn’t it unfair that court declares Indian citizens as foreigners when they miss a date or fail to appear. Effort should be made to ensure the tribunal hears both sides before deciding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notices-sent-to-wrong-address-gauhati-hc-cancels-foreigners-tribunal-order-101638881410030.html

Hoping that justice is done: Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio pic.twitter.com/IaEr4heGSCAn elite military commando unit shot dead six coal miners returning to their homes in Mon district of Nagaland on Saturday, believing they were targeting insurgents. Another eight people were killed by the troops when they were confronted by a furious crowd, with a soldier also killed and three army vehicles set ablaze.A senior minister in Rio’s cabinet said that besides the 14 deaths, two seriously injured are undergoing treatment in neighbouring Assam, and six are being treated in Dimapur.Rio said, ““Through AFSPA, the excesses made by the armed forces do not go well with the people in a democratic country like India… It is a good thing that they (Centre) admitted to having made the wrong judgement through the tip... Hoping that justice is done.”“People have spoken very strongly about the unfortunate incident. At today's state cabinet meeting, we decided to ask GoI to repeal AFSPA not only in Nagaland but Northeast (altogether),” the chief minister was further quoted as saying.Earlier in the day, the state cabinet called off the ongoing Hornbill Festival in protest against the killings.

Nagaland groups and political parties are now seeking a repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which they describe as the root of the problem as it shields the armed forces from prosecution while carrying out anti-insurgency operations in the northeast.The state government had also cancelled the events at the festival on Monday to pay homage to the dead as they were laid to rest. However, with pressure mounting from civil organisations to call off the festivities, and with most of the tribal bodies withdrawing from the event to express their solidarity with the Konyaks, the government decided to cancel the remaining three days of the festival.Also Read: Nagaland lawmaker KG Kenye slams Afspa, compares it with ‘licence to kill’Government spokesperson Kronu asked the general public and government employees to help the entrepreneurs who had set up stalls at the festival site by purchasing their products. He also said that perishable goods will be allowed to be sold at the festival venue to help such traders.According to tourism department officials, the festival had around 40,000 visitors during the first five days. In 2019, the department recorded 282,811 footfall at the 20th edition of the festival. Last year, the event was held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-civilian-killings-hornbill-festival-cut-short-by-3-days-101638873188609.html

07-12-2021||India||Nagaland lawmaker KG Kenye slams Afspa, compares it with ‘licence to kill’||The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, also known as Afspa, should be repealed immediately as it is “tantamount to a licence to kill” and it has only created animosity between the people and the government, claimed Naga People’s Front leader and Rajya Sabha MP KG Kenye on Tuesday. His remarks came in the aftermath of the killings of 14 civilians in Nagaland over the weekend during a botched counter-insurgency army operation and subsequent violence.Condemning the killings by the Indian Army’s 21 Para Special Forces, who have been named in a police FIR, the lawmaker said, “I want to awaken the conscience of the nation that this Act is detrimental to the national interest. It has been of no use except [to] create animosity… It is the culprit for the excesses being committed by the armed forces. The special powers are being abused. It (the Afspa) tantamounts to being a licence to kill.”Kenye told HT that the Afspa, which has been in place in Nagaland since 1958, has been used with “impunity, killing innocent people, and there is no law to prosecute them”.Also Read: TMC team headed to Nagaland returns from Kolkata airport, says Sec 144 imposed in MonOn Monday, amid growing clamour for the law to be scrapped, union home minister Amit Shah expressed regret over the killings and told Parliament that the firings were a consequence of “mistaken identity”. He also said that the security forces had to shoot “for their own safety and to disperse the crowd”.Kenye welcomed Shah’s comments, saying, “The circumstances as per his description are yet to be authenticated. But as for the government expressing sincere regrets, is something we are glad for. For the first time, a man of his stature on behalf of the government has taken responsibility. This is a paradigm shift.” On the impact that the episode will have on the electoral fortunes of the BJP and its ally, the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), which is in power in the state, Kenye said political parties won’t bear the brunt of people’s anger since the Afspa has anyway been in place in Nagaland for years during which power has changed hands between various parties. The NPF was also a partner of the BJP in the northeastern state.“The state government does not have much role to play. The Assam Rifles is under the Centre. The state has made ex gratia payment, the CM representing voices across parties has expressed that the Afspa should be repealed,” Kenye said.The lawmaker, however, lamented that the civilian killings will undo the progress made in firming up the Naga Peace Accord. “If this continues, then people may put pressure on the parties to pull out and that would be catastrophic. After so much effort by various parties and right-thinking people, we are on the threshold of a possible amicable settlement, and within hours, the bridge of friendship has been dismantled by the armed forces. Ultimately, the biggest casualty will be national integrity,” the MP said. Apart from calling for the Afspa to be repealed, Kenye pushed for a speedy trial in connection with the weekend’s killings. “It is unpardonable and the culprits must be brought to book as early as possible, which will be the biggest consolation for everyone,” he said.

Do not associate yourself with any building built by them," he added.The minister said, "The Muslim community should come forward and hand over the white structure located in the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi complex in Mathura to Hindus. Time will come when this work will be completed."He said on December 6 (1992), ‘karsewaks’ had removed a “blot on Ramlalla” and now a grand temple is being constructed there. He was apparently referring to the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya by Hindutva mobs.Asked about the conversion of former Shia Waqf Board chairman Syed Wasim Rizvi to 'Sanatan dharma' (Hinduism), he said Muslims should follow and do "ghar wapsi" (return to Hinduism)."All Muslims in the country are converted. If they see their history, they will find that 200-250 years ago they converted to Islam from Hinduism. We will like all of them to do 'ghar vapasi',” he said, hailing Rizvi for his "courageous" step."This step is a challenge for Maulanas and Maulvis who live in the country and promote a Talabani mindset," Shukla said.He said India's basic culture is of 'Hindutva' (Hinduism) and 'Bhartiyata' and they are complementary to each other.He termed the Samajwadi Party, its founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and president Akhilesh Yadav as “anti-Hindu” and accused them of “ordering firing” on unarmed 'karsewaks' in Ayodhya.On Sunday, BJP MP Ravindra Kushwaha had said when the Narendra Modi government can repeal the farm laws keeping in mind the protests by farmers, it can also withdraw the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 to pave way for the construction of a grand temple at Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura.Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had also offered support for a new temple in Mathura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-hand-over-white-structure-in-mathura-to-hindus-up-minister-101638869435949.html

It also underlined that though the recovery in the sector continued, the demand from the corporate traveller segment was subdued as was reflected by the passenger traffic being lower by around 19% in November 2021 compared to pre-Covid levels. Domestic air traffic grew by around 15-16% with around 10.4-10.5 million passengers flying last month, compared to around 8.98 million fliers in October 2021. Year on Year figures showed that with around 80,750 departures in November 2021, airlines’ capacity deployment was around 49% higher than November 2020 when 54,132 departures were recorded, the agency said. it added that the number of departures in November 2021 was higher by around 12% compared to October 21 since Covid-19 infections demonstrated a downward trajectory. “The threat of [the] new variant, which has pushed [back] the resumption of scheduled international operations, has the potential to derail the domestic recovery too, if it becomes a source of fresh round of lockdowns/restrictions in the near term,” Suprio Banerjee, ICRA’s vice president and sector head said. Also Read | Omicron: German tests Covid positive in Madhya Pradesh, had attended a weddingTalking of the gradual recovery in the domestic sector, Banerjee said that in November 2021, the average daily departures were at around 2,700, significantly higher than 1,806 daily departures in November 2020, and higher than around 2,400 in October 2021. He added that the average number of passengers per flight during November 2021 also rose to reach around 129, against an average of 125 in October 2021. “Though the recovery continued in November 2021, demand continues to be subdued from the corporate traveller segment as reflected by the passenger traffic being lower by around 19% in November 2021 compared to pre-Covid levels,” he added.On November 26, the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) announced resumption of scheduled International operations from December 15 with some restrictions. However, the regulator had to postpone it till further notice, due to the spread of the Omicron variant. Under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM), which started from May 7, 2020, international passenger traffic for Indian carriers stood at around 5.7 million till November 30, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-threat-has-potential-to-derail-domestic-aviation-recovery-icra-101638868448107.html

The central government and Army have both said that it was a case of ‘mistaken identity’ as the security forces had laid an ambush on receiving inputs about movement of the insurgents, but ended up killing 13 civilians instead. One army jawan was also killed as angry villagers attacked the army party.  The civilian killings have once again triggered demands seeking withdrawal of AFSPA, which grants special powers to the armed forces to maintain public order in ‘disturbed areas.’ Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio, his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma, Opposition MPs in Parliament, and civil society members have all demanded that the act be immediately withdrawn from the northeastern states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-can-t-afford-this-perception-shashi-tharoor-has-this-to-say-on-afspa-101638860947835.html

Now, that he has retired from the service on November 30, he visited ED office in Ballard estate on Tuesday morning at around 11.10am and joined the investigation. Before being promoted as the chief secretary, Kunte held the office of additional chief secretary (home).People aware of the developments said that ED was trying to build a water tight case against Deshmukh, who was arrested on November 2 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in a case of extortion from Mumbai’s bars and subsequently also accused of bribery in transfer and postings of senior police officers in the state. Presently Deshmukh is in judicial custody. Earlier, the ED questioned transportation minister Anil Parab and Bajrang Kharmate in the PMLA case. Kharmate’s name had cropped up in the statement of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and some other witnesses against Deshmukh. Also Read: SC junks NIA plea against bail to Bhima-Koregaon activist Sudha BharadwajOn September 30, the anti-money laundering agency questioned Kailash Gaikwad, a deputy secretary in the state home department in connection with the transfers and postings case. Gaikwad was part of the IPS (Indian Police Service) officers transfer process.The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him were false. The Central agency has alleged that while serving as Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze — who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases — collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”. Later, through hawala channels, the money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that the two brothers later diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-ex-chief-secretary-joins-ed-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-101638861882442.html
07-12-2021||India||PM Modi's first stop in January 2022 is trusted allies UAE and Kuwait||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to open his 2022 foreign visit calendar by trip to trusted allies United Arab Emirates and Kuwait early next month.While PM Modi will visit Dubai 2020 Expo, the real purpose of the visit is to thank both the allies for standing with India during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic as well as taking care of the huge Indian diaspora in these two emirates. The UAE has no less than four million Indian passport carrying Indians and Kuwait has nearly one million Indian diaspora, who contribute to Indian economy through remittances as well as in times of need.Even though the government is tight-lipped about the entire visit, PM Modi may travel to these two countries in the first 10 days of January 2022. Special emphasis is being paid to these two foreign trips as both nations are at the heart of India’s foreign policy towards Middle-East.Since his first visit to UAE at the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in August 2015, PM Modi is totally focused on cementing ties with Abu Dhabi with foreign minister S Jaishankar returning from the UAE last Sunday. UAE is India’s third largest trade partner after US and China with the trade volumes touching over USD 60 billion. The January 2022 trip would be PM Modi’s fourth visit to the UAE, a sea change from the time that the last PM to visit the UAE was Indira Gandhi, 32 years before PM Modi.India and the UAE today have cemented their ties to a new level with the latter cleaning up all anti-India criminal and economic activity from the Gulf nation with intense cooperation in fields of cyber-security, counter-radicalisation, defence and intelligence sharing. “Just as India is focused on Singapore as a hub of diplomatic activity in the east, Abu Dhabi is the other hub in the Middle-East region for getting investments into India,” said a former foreign secretary. India recognises that UAE over the years not only has developed global infrastructure but also is a hub of diplomatic activity in Middle-East. It is also a major regional defence power as was evident when last week UAE decided to purchase 80 Rafale fighters and 13 heavy lift helicopters from France.Like the UAE, Indian ties with Kuwait are very special with the latter supplying oxygen cylinders and other medical equipment in large numbers during the second wave of pandemic in India. In fact, EAM Jaishankar flew to Kuwait with a personal letter from PM Modi to Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah for thanking Kuwait for its support and future objective of deepening ties in energy, trade, information technology and manpower sector.
07-12-2021||India||Supreme Court junks NIA plea against bail to Bhima-Koregaon activist Sudha Bharadwaj||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against an earlier Bombay high court order granting default bail to Bhima-Koregaon activist Sudha Bharadwaj. Junking the NIA's plea, the top court said that only a special court, as opposed to a magisterial court, could have extended the time investigation and detention as provided under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). According to Bar and Bench, the Supreme Court bench of justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat, and Bela M Trivedi asked the NIA why it made this application for an extension before a magisterial court when there is a separate special court at Pune, manned by special judges who ought to be hearing the NIA case. This is, incidentally, the similar ground on which Bharadwaj, who was arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case in August 2018 under the provisions of the stringent UAPA, was granted default bail by the Bombay high court last week.The high court had also directed that Bharadwaj, lodged in the Byculla women's prison, be produced before the Mumbai special NIA court on December 8, and conditions of her bail and date of release be decided.The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial located on the city's outskirts. The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists. The probe in the case was later transferred to the NIA.Although Bharadwaj is the first among 16 activists and academicians arrested in the case to have been granted default bail, the pleas of others, including poet-activist Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, and Arun Ferreira, were rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-junks-nia-plea-against-bail-to-bhima-koregaon-activist-sudha-bharadwaj-101638857633316.html

Farmers also seek justice for all those who are being falsely prosecuted in manufactured cases and for the families of the farmers, who sacrificed themselves in the yearlong agitation.”Farm unions have claimed nearly 700 farmers lost their lives during the protests and their pending demands include compensation as well as withdrawal of all criminal cases lodged against protesting farmers. However, the Union government told the Parliament last week that it has no data on farmers who died during the year-long protests against the three farm laws and therefore there was no question of compensation to their families.Also Read: Shut for 30 years, PM Modi to inaugurate ₹8,600-cr Gorakhpur fertiliser plantIn his reply on the third day of the ongoing winter session, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also said the government did not have records on the number of police cases registered against farmers in various states.In the Rajya Sabha, too, Congress MP Manish Tewari raised the issue of farmers through an adjournment motion over the Minimum Support Price, compensation, job for the families of the farmers who allegedly died during the agitation and withdrawal of cases filed against them.

07-12-2021||India||CBI court refuses bail to Yes Bank executive Mahesh Varakh||A special CBI court last week rejected the bail application of Mahesh Kumar Varakh, former group executive vice-president of Yes Bank Ltd in connection with a case of financial irregularities involving Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL).Seeking bail, Varakh’s counsel argued that the Central Bureau of Investigation had filed the supplementary charge-sheet in the case without arresting him and that the accused had cooperated with the investigations.They added that the Yes Bank board had not approved the sanction to prosecute him.With the aim to bolster his case, his lawyers added that Varakh was innocent and one of the junior most officers in the management committee of the Bank that decided collectively on sanction and disbursal of loans and Varakh only implemented their decisions, especially that of Rajiv Anand. Anand is the former business head of the bank, who was denied bail in September this year. The CBI in March 2020 registered FIRs against DHFL, DoIT Urban Ventures-- a firm controlled by Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor’s wife and daughters-- and some other entities, their directors and promoters for financial fraud. CBI alleged that Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short term non-convertible debentures of DHFL between April and June 2018 and DoIT Urban Ventures received ₹600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL for grant of the irregular loan. Kapoor was arrested in March 2020 by the CBI. CBI opposed Varakh’s bail plea contending that the accused played an active role in the financial fraud thereby causing wrongful loss of public money. The agency argued that a person if allowed bail after misappropriating huge public funds would act as encouragement to many others to commit similar crimes. Also Read | Police can’t press criminal charges against Param Bir Singh: Supreme CourtThe court said that Varakh as the group executive vice-president of the bank had higher responsibility to protect its interests but he acted on the insistence of Rana Kapoor or Rajiv Anand against the bank’s interest.The court said the facts and circumstances showed Varakh was prima-facie complicity in conspiracy with other co-accused, more particularly with Rana Kapoor and Rajiv Anand.The court also said that he played an active role with fraudulent and dishonest intention in sanctioning and disbursement of loans by ignoring various objections. “Not only this, he is a party to backdated sanction orders,” said the court. He has also not verified utilisation of loan amount which is necessary while disbursing sanction loan amounts. The disbursements were made despite no physical developments made in projects and the land was occupied by slum dwellers, the court said while denying Varakh bail.Special CBI judge S U Wadgaonkar accepted the prosecutor’s argument and rejected Varakh’s bail application, observing that in view of the gravity and nature of offence and in the larger interest of society.The court said that even if for the sake of arguments it is assumed that there was insistence from and influence used by other accused - Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor or the then business head Rajiv Anand, the accused working as Group Executive Vice-President of the Bank had higher responsibility to protect the interests of the bank. Instead, he acted on the insistence Rana Kapoor or Rajiv Anand against the interest of the bank, the court added.The court said the facts and circumstances show Varakh’s prima-facie complicity in conspiracy with other co-accused, more particularly Rana Kapoor and Rajiv Anand in the conspiracy.The court added that though the actual beneficiary of crime proceeds in the case were Wadhawan Brothers of DHFL and Rana Kapoor’s family, the accused despite being a responsible officer, played an active role with fraudulent and dishonest intention in sanctioning and disbursement of loans by ignoring various objections.“Not only this, he is a party to back dated sanction orders,” said the court. He has also not verified utilisation of loan amount which is necessary while disbursing sanction loan amounts.

07-12-2021||India||International Civil Aviation Day: Social and economic benefits of the global flight network||International Civil Aviation Day, like every other year, is being celebrated today on December 7 to highlight the role of civil aviation in 21st-century transportation, and the importance it plays in connecting people and enhancing social and economic development around the world. Marked every year since 2013, the International Civil Aviation Day intends to spread worldwide awareness regarding the contributions of the civil aviation industry and the unique role of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in helping countries cooperate and realise a global rapid transport network.Why is International Civil Aviation Day celebrated?According to the United Nations, the International Civil Aviation Day serves the purpose of highlighting the importance of international civil aviation organisations in air travel across the globe. The international UN body keeping track of this entire operation is the ICAO, which is also accountable for maintaining the safety standards of international civil aviation.As we celebrate International Civil Aviation Day, it is only fitting to emphasize continuing the efforts to reconnect the world to recover and revive the industry amid the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Why are civil aviation and the ICAO important?Economic benefits The aviation industry itself is a source of considerable economic activity, creating jobs that directly serve passengers at airlines, airports, and air navigation services providers. These include check-in, baggage handling, on-site retail, cargo, and catering facilities. Moreover, aviation directly enables jobs in the manufacturing sector (those companies that produce aircraft, engines, and other vital technologies).Apart from these, the indirect impacts include employment and economic activity generated by suppliers to the aviation industry: aviation fuel suppliers; construction companies that build airport facilities; suppliers of subcomponents used in aircraft; manufacturers of goods sold in airport retail outlets; and a wide variety of activities in the business services sector (such as call centres, information technology and accountancy).According to the UN, the contribution of aviation to the global economy is approximately equivalent to the overall GDP of the United Kingdom.Social benefitsAviation also creates unique possibilities for empowering nations and people, regardless of their geographic location. It is a means of allowing people to access what they need: improved livelihoods, food, healthcare, education, safe communities and spaces, etc. Whether it be responses to crises in hours of dire need, humanitarian aid, or leisure activities like vacations and visiting friends and relatives, aviation plays a vital role in promoting social causes and satisfying needs around the world. For all vulnerable groups, as well as for migrant communities and people living in remote and low-density rural areas, air transport services are a lifeline to enhance their social inclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-civil-aviation-day-social-and-economic-benefits-of-the-global-flight-network-101638853716819.html

The Bill proposes to alter the High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act and the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act to bring clarity concerning the date on which a retired judge becomes eligible for an additional quantum of pension. The bill further proposes to insert an explanation in sections 17B of the HC Judges Act and 16B of the Supreme Court Judges Act to clarify the government’s objective.After the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulations) Bill, 2020 or ART 2020 was passed last week in the Lok Sabha by a voice vote, the union health minister will be introducing the bill for passage in the Rajya Sabha. The bill aims to regulate assisted reproductive technology (ART) services such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) centres, sperm or egg banks etc that have mushroomed across the country. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) laid out guidelines for ART clinics as far back as 2005, however, these do not enjoy legislative backing.

07-12-2021||India||No data on Covid-related suicides among vendors, traders, businessmen: Centre||The Central government on Monday said it does not have any data on suicides among vendors, tradesmen and businessmen due to the economic toll of Covid-related lockdowns.The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) said this in the Rajya Sabha in response to a question posed by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MP Abdul Wahab. Wahab sought to know whether the government noticed that the crisis in the MSME sector as a consequence of the pandemic resulted in suicides of vendors, tradesmen, and other businessmen.“This ministry does not maintain data of suicides. The ministry has also not received any such information of suicide of vendors, tradesmen & businessmen as a consequence of the pandemic,” read the ministry’s response.In his question, Wahab had cited numbers from the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report. The latest NCRB 2020 report, released in September 2021, said as many as 11,716 businessmen died by suicide in 2020.The report said of these over 11,000 deaths, 4,356 were that of “tradesmen” and 4,226 were of “vendors”, with the rest being accounted for in the category of “other businesses”. These are the three groups that the NCRB categorises the business community into while recording suicides.Compared to 2019, deaths by suicide among the business community in 2020 increased 29%. Suicides among tradespeople, meanwhile, increased from 2,906 in 2019 to 4,356 in 2020 — a 49.9% jump, as per the official data.Also Read: 4 states, Delhi have Omicron cases in India, highest number in MaharashtraWhen asked about what was the government doing to support the families of the vendors, tradesmen and other businessmen who died by suicide in 2020, the ministry listed various schemes and programmes for the growth and development of the MSME sector in the country.“Post Covid-19, the government has taken a number of initiatives under Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to support the MSME Sector in the country, especially in Covid-19 pandemic,” read the response.The ministry further claimed that the online portal Champion, launched by the government to cover many aspects of e-governances including grievance redressal and handholdings of MSME, redressed over 40,000 grievances as of November 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-info-on-suicide-of-vendors-businessmen-due-to-covid-centre-101638850241412.html

07-12-2021||India||Koo co-founder Aprameya Radhakrishna on platform's growth, competition with Twitter, its future and more||In recent months, homegrown social media platform Koo has seen tremendous growth in India, driven by the multi-lingual support it offers and the push it received by the Indian government.Koo's user base touched about 15 million in October, with five million users added in the last quarter.From HT Archive: All you need to know about Twitter-rival KooIn an exclusive chat with hindustantimes.com, its founder and CEO Aprameya Radhakrishna talks about the idea behind starting Koo, its journey and future plans.Here is the full interview:Q. What was the intention of starting Koo? And has it succeeded in achieving the intended purpose? Take us through the journey.Aprameya Radhakrishna: The idea of Koo occurred to us while we were building our first product - Vokal - which is a Q&A platform for native language speakers. Several users of Vokal would express their keen interest to share their free-flowing thoughts, in addition to answering questions on the platform. That’s when we recognised that when it comes to expressing online, there exists an immense opportunity waiting to be tapped, especially in native languages. In a country like India - where more than 90 per cent of our population thinks and speaks in a regional language - the power of expression in one's mother tongue is truly immense. We studied existing products and realised that content in Indian languages is sparse, as most social media platforms carry an English-first approach and are built primarily for English speakers residing in urban centres. Native speakers also carry a strong desire to connect and create content, but are left out of core internet experiences due to the English-centric foundations of most platforms. Thus, we started developing Koo as a multi-lingual micro-blogging platform for Indians to express in their mother tongue and connect with their linguistic and cultural communities. We started in December 2019 and launched the platform in March 2020 in Kannada from Mandya, which is a district near Mysuru (in Karnataka). We received a thunderous response at the launch which boosted our confidence, and eventually led us to introduce Hindi on the platform in the next few months.In July 2020, we participated in the 'Aatmanirbhar App' challenge - and showcased a deeply immersive language experience for Indians. We were among the top three apps in social media out of the 7,000 startups that had participated in the challenge. And in August 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned Koo in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ address.Also Read | Koo plans to ramp up hiring, plans to be 500-strong in next yearQ. Do you think Koo app can get ahead of Twitter in India? What is the current market share of Koo?Aprameya Radhakrishna: Within 20 months of our launch - in October this year - Koo achieved a major milestone of 15 million downloads. Our first 10 million downloads happened in about a year and half, while the next five million users joined the platform in a quarter. This indicates that the Koo App is being adopted at an accelerated pace. As we move ahead, backed by our unique language features which provide an immersive experience, we are confident of outperforming ourselves and scaling at a rapid pace to hit 100 million downloads.India has tremendous potential for a platform like ours. A recent report stated that India would have over 900 million internet users by 2025. Koo is one of the most unique social products that caters to every section of the society and promotes digital inclusion. It is also a powerful platform, with some of the most prominent faces of the country using it every day. We have received a lot of love and appreciation in such a short span and we will continue to scale and cross many more milestones in the future.Q. This year, a very public spat between the government and Twitter made people sit up and take note of the Koo app and there was a flurry of activity to download it. How would you view that crisis in the larger picture of Koo's growth trajectory?Aprameya Radhakrishna: In the larger scheme of things, the growth we got during the spat will seem like a small spurt. Our growth purely reflects people's desire to express and engage online in their mother tongue. It's a large, untapped need.Q. For an average user, how is Koo different from Twitter?Aprameya Radhakrishna: Koo and Twitter are both micro-blogging platforms. That is where the similarity ends. Koo is an innovative platform that democratises the voice of Indians by empowering them to express in native Indian languages - Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati apart from English. We are working towards adding more native languages and our aim is to cover all the 22 official Indian languages. Moreover, we have a unique feature which enables creators to send their message in real-time across languages, while retaining the context and sentiment attached to the original text. This enhances a user’s reach, as the message can be consumed by people across the country in a language of their choice. Followership thus increases in a short span of time. In addition to these language features, we have communities for each language that is available on the platform. These communities celebrate the essence of their respective culture and regions. A user can engage with a community that reflects his/her interests and gain a meaningful experience.Q. Tell us something about the revenue model of Koo.Aprameya Radhakrishna: We are pre-revenue. Our priority right now is to grow the community and our tech capabilities.Q. Micro-blogging has evolved during the last decade to become a powerful political tool. How does Koo view its evolution and what role it plans for itself in this space?Aprameya Radhakrishna: There are many use cases for a product like Koo. One of them is the need for leaders and prominent personalities to stay in touch with people that want to hear from them. We enable them to do so in multiple languages - something no other does. These updates and two way conversations become invaluable when done in the language that the masses prefer.Q. What is the traffic around elections and political issues on Koo? How seriously are people taking it?Aprameya Radhakrishna: Koo is an inclusive platform for expression which is beyond politics. We have people from all walks of life including literature, sports, media, entertainment, theatre, spirituality, etc. In fact, 70-80 per cent of the content and people on Koo are totally unrelated to politics. But when it comes to politics, Koo has made significant progress in getting adopted by leaders of the ruling party and the opposition at both the national and state levels. This is because we are a transparent and inclusive platform. We have chief ministers of 17 states, various Union ministers, government departments and leaders across the political spectrum who actively Koo, and share updates on various initiatives and developments. Our multi-language features have made it easy for leaders to engage with their followers by conversing in their native language in a holistic manner.In Uttar Pradesh, which is scheduled to go to the polls early next year, we believe that with the kind of traction we are seeing in terms of onboarding of political leaders, political parties, government departments and opinion leaders, a lot of the conversation about elections and candidates etc will happen on Koo exclusively. In addition, a large number of the people of UP have started creating accounts on Koo to consume content as well as share their own opinions - mostly in Hindi.Q. For the upcoming assembly elections, have you planned anything special? Can we expect a digital-only feature that will set Koo apart from other micro-blogging apps?Aprameya Radhakrishna: Apart from the wide range of content creators and users on the platform, Koo already has several smart features that can make it the app of choice for the elections. The most unique feature is enabling people to put across their message in multiple Indian languages and connect with multiple communities at one go. Other features include our Talk-to-Type feature - which enables a user to share their thoughts without having to type. A user can merely speak out aloud and the words are converted into text, making it the easiest way to communicate on a micro-blogging platform. This Talk-to-Type feature is especially useful for people who do not know how to write the language. The Livestream feature, which was rolled out earlier this week, will create the opportunity for live discussions and debate on the platform and further enhance the experience for our users. Q. The government is gung-ho about data localisation. How is Koo addressing this issue?Aprameya Radhakrishna: Our servers are hosted in India. From our perspective, the reasons for regulations are understandable and we'll abide by these regulations respectfully.Q. Which emerging technologies and trends offer maximum challenges and opportunities to a micro-blogging app like you?Aprameya Radhakrishna: Our product framework is generic and enables open expression in the best form. We cater to the most core human needs - something that will never change. Any new technologies that better this communication are something that we'll adopt as a platform.Q. Koo is often accused of having very little global exposure and not hosting any prominent international celebrity. Your thoughts.Aprameya Radhakrishna: It's by design. Koo has been built for Indians to solve for language diversity. Our endeavour is to enable every Indian to express and share thoughts online in a language of their choice. The average Indian doesn't want to connect with international celebrities as much as they want to connect with local and national heroes they look upto and people like themselves.This is true for many countries that aren't English-first and we will take our product to all such countries to enable better connections between people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/koo-co-founder-aprameya-radhakrishna-on-platform-s-growth-and-more-101638845963935.html

07-12-2021||India||Rajiv Gandhi assassination: SC to hear case of premature release of convicts||The Supreme Court is expected to hear on Tuesday a case relating to the premature release of seven convicts currently serving life imprisonment terms for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. According to reports, the Tamil Nadu government informed the Madras high court last week that the case is likely to be listed before the apex court on December 7.The petition for premature release was filed back in 2016 by 46-year-old AG Perarivalan, one of the convicts seeking the suspension of his life sentence in the case till the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) completes its probe on the aspect of a larger conspiracy behind the assassination of the former prime minister.At the hearing of the case last year, the Supreme Court sought to know the current status of a recommendation made by the Tamil Nadu cabinet to the state's governor in September 2018 to release all the convicts under powers granted by Article 161 of the Constitution.Notably, the aforementioned article empowers a governor to pardon a convict in any criminal case.In its reply, the state government had said that the governor was waiting for the final report of the MDMA before taking a decision. Later, at a hearing on January 21 last year, the government further informed that the governor would be taking a call on the remittance petition filed by Perarivalan. However, a month later, the Union home ministry said the governor had studied all the reports available to him and recommended that the President of India would be the appropriate authority to deal with the request of premature release.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government had also filed a counter-affidavit against a similar petition by S Nalini, another one of the convicts, noting that she cannot be released without the governor's assent and that the court should dismiss the plea to release her.Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991, at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a female suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally.Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed. Gandhi's assassination was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile leader.In its May 1999 order, the Supreme Court had upheld the death sentences of four convicts -- Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham, and Nalini.In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government's recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi's widow Sonia Gandhi.On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners – Santhan and Murugan – on the grounds of an 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-sc-to-hear-case-of-premature-release-of-convicts-101638839289071.html

The cyclone weakened into a low-pressure by Monday and was expected to move towards Bangladesh, while weakening further, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).On Monday, the Odisha government directed all district collectors to furnish report on losses suffered to the standing crop in their respective districts. Minister for revenue and disaster management Sudam Marndi said he has sought damage assessment reports from all district collectors. “After a review on the damage caused due to the rainfall, financial aid will be provided to the affected persons as per the relief code norms,” said Marndi.Though Cyclone Jawad weakened into a low-pressure, it triggered heavy rainfall in the southern districts of West Bengal, particularly those in the coastal regions, since Saturday. “Till around 8.30 am on Monday, many places in south Bengal received more than 100 mm rain in the last 24 hours. Kolkata received around 70mm rain,” said an official of the regional weather forecasting centre in Kolkata.West Bengal agriculture department secretary OS Meena said the state authorities had issued an advisory well in advance, on November 30, to harvest the paddy crops. “Most of the paddy crops that were mature have been harvested. Those who had not planted the potato tubers were asked to delay the process by a week at least. We are taking stock of the situation, but the crops are insured,” Meena said.The heavy rainfall came at a time when the paddy crops were on the verge of harvesting and several farmers had planted potato tubers.“I had suffered extensive damage when Cyclone Yaas hit in May this year. Saline water from the river had gushed into the village killing all the crops. Thereafter, I grew salt tolerant paddy. They were almost ripe and were on the verge of being harvested. But the rains ruined it all. I could save only around 25% of it,” said Gunadhar Patra, a farmer in Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas.After Yaas in May 2021, around 1,200 MT of salt-tolerant paddy seeds were distributed in the three coastal districts — East Medinipur, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas. More than 38,000 farmers would have befitted from the seeds had they yielded paddy.But several farmers had complained that most of the crops got damaged, even before they could be transplanted, as heavy rains battered the districts of south Bengal in July-end, resulting in floods in some districts.“I had planted potato tubers just around a week ago. But the field is now under water because of the heavy rains. I would incur heavy losses this time. Untimely rain has cost us dearly,” said Nikhil Roy, a farmer in Gosaba block of South 24 Parganas.In Odisha, farmers in at least 10 districts sustained major crop damage as heavy rainfall submerged ripened paddy crops, officials said, adding that thousands of hectares of standing paddy have been inundated.Farmers in Ganjam, Gajapati, Jagatsinghpur, Khordha, Puri, Bhadrak, Balasore, Jajpur, Kendrapara and Cuttack districts tried hard to save their paddy crop, but could not harvest in time.“I had harvested paddy over four acres of land, but could not take it from threshing yard. The entire paddy has turned soggy,” said Arun Jena, a farmer from Balasore. “This year we started paddy crops late due to delayed rains, but now everything is gone.”Farmers in several areas were struggling to drain out the rainwater from the cultivated areas on Monday.Golekh Bihari Sahoo of Banki area in Cuttack district said he tried hard to save his standing paddy crop submerged in the rainwater. “The paddy will now start stinking,” he said.Paddy was cultivated in over 3.5 million hectares across Odisha in 2021 kharif season.Vegetable farmers have also suffered heavy losses due to the rains.Prakash Behera of Pipili block in Puri district said the cauliflowers that he had cultivated in his acre of land, were damaged. “I resorted to distress sale of some of my cauliflowers. I had to sell the cauliflowers at ₹3 per piece,” he said.A 57-year-old farmer in Ganjam district’s Uluma village allegedly died by suicide after consuming pesticides on Sunday, after standing paddy over his two-acre field were inundated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jawadinduced-rain-damages-crops-in-odisha-west-bengal-101638840376906.html

The Tamil Nadu government opened nine gates of the grand old Mullaperiyar dam on Monday night in view of the rising water level in the reservoir.This is for the first time that shutters of Idukki dam have been opened four times in three months. Many people living in the low-lying areas have been shifted.High alert has been sounded in Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts, where locals protested against the opening of the dam's shutters.Kerala water resources minister Roshy Augustine has been camping in the area since the reopening of the gates of Mullaperiyar dam. He said that the state government will move Supreme Court against Tamil Nadu's move.This was the first time that Tamil Nadu opened the gates of the dam at night and Kerala government had protested against the move. “The decision of the Tamil Nadu was irresponsible,” Augustine had said.The Tamil Nadu authorities raised the nine shutters to 120cm at 7.45pm after the water level of over a century-old dam reached 141.90 feet on Monday. Three of the gates were closed after 10pm. According to officials in Kerala's Idukki district, more than 100 families had to be shifted from Idukki due to Tamil Nadu's move.The Mullaperiyar dam, built in 1895 on the Periyar river in Idukki district of Kerala, is operated by the Tamil Nadu government for its irrigation and power needs. Kerala has been insisting on building a new dam, citing safety concerns, but Tamil Nadu is against it, saying the present structure is strong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shutters-of-kerala-s-idukki-dam-opened-after-tamil-nadu-s-mullaperiyar-move-101638839091878.html
07-12-2021||India||Supreme Court tells army to reinstate 12 women officers||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Indian Army to reinstate 12 women short service commission officers (WSSCO) who were released from service after being found unfit for permanent commission.The court declared them eligible for permanent commission (PC) and directed the army to deem them to be in continuous service without break in order to protect their financial and other service benefits. In addition, three WSSCOs, who were yet to be released, were also held eligible for PC by the court.By this decision, out of the 615 women officers considered for PC under a March 25 judgment of the top court, the WSSCOs who opted for PC and have either received or are entitled to receive it has gone up to 502.A bench of justices Dhananajya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna, while dealing with the petition filed by the WSSCOs said, “Those WSSCOs released during the pendency of these proceedings shall be deemed to have continued without any break and will be entitled to grant of PC.” The decision of the court was made easy by the army and the Centre which, nudge by the court, agreed to reconsider objections with regard to 12 WSSCOs released from army and three who were still serving.The court also added that with this order, all proceedings initiated by the women officers before armed forces tribunal (AFT) are complete. Appreciating the army for its fair stand, the bench said, “There has been a complete change of mindset at the top as we are now seeing women being provided leadership roles. We are heralding a new era in the armed forces.”Senior advocate V Mohana appearing for some of the women officers said, “The order of the court will go a long way in boosting the morale of the women officers. After being denied PC, the humiliation they had to undergo was enormous.” Supporting her, senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi said, “There has been a paradigm shift in the role of women in the armed forces. This year will be remembered for this change.”The court also recognized the efforts put in by additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain appearing for Centre and senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the army, who deliberated with the top brass of the army and ministry of defence and informed Court that the decision to reinstate the WSSCOs had the concurrence of the chief of army staff (COAS).The SC judgment of March 25 laid common benchmarks for grant of PC to WSSCOs vis-à-vis their male counterparts. The Court said that any WSSCO who qualified with 60% marks on merit and is medically fit, will be granted PC, subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-tells-army-to-reinstate-12-women-officers-101638838989344.html

The project is expected to not only bring prosperity to farmers’ lives but also create 20,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities for youths.The ₹1,011-crore worth Gorakhpur AIIMS, on the other hand, will not only benefit the population of eastern Uttar Pradesh but also a huge chunk in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Nepal with its world-class health facilities.Similarly, the regional medical research centre, worth ₹36 crore, at BRD Medical College, will facilitate the test and research of vector-borne diseases. The hi-tech lab is expected to decrease the dependency of the area on big cities for tests related to vector-borne diseases.In a related development, Gorakhpur officials confirmed that electric buses, too, will start plying across the district from Tuesday. Fifteen of these buses, flagged off by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow on October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-gift-3-mega-projects-to-gorakhpur-today-includes-fertiliser-plant-aiims-101638834379066.html
07-12-2021||India||Sikkim Global Film Festival, scheduled to start from Dec 10, postponed||Siliguri: The Sikkim Global Film Festival, which was scheduled to begin on December 10 in Gangtok, was postponed by the state on Monday in view of the uncertain situation due to Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease, people familiar with the matter said. Sikkim imposed a ban on the entry of foreigners last week. Apart from the domestic film industry, the four-day festival was expected to be attended by celebrities from several countries, according to government officials.“A high-level meeting held in Gangtok on Monday and chaired by chief minister Prem Singh Tamang took the decision to postpone the festival,” said a statement issued by the Sikkim information department.Sikkim, which shares a border with China, Nepal and Bhutan, announced a ban on entry of foreign nationals in March last year when Covid-19 cases started rising across India. Sikkim has recorded 405 deaths and 32374 positive cases till Monday.Pooja Sharma, chairperson of the Sikkim Film Production Board, said, “Preparations for the festival were almost complete. Many actors, directors and producers had confirmed their participation.”The PS Tamang government has adopted a new film promotion policy to make the Himalayan state popular among movie makers. Subsidies to the tune of ₹20 lakh for local filmmakers and ₹1 crore for those coming from other states have been announced. Those completing 75 % of the shooting in Sikkim with local people comprising half the cast and crew are entitled to the subsidy. 
07-12-2021||India||Expert panel meet on booster shots, jabs for under 18 remains inconclusive||India’s expert panel on vaccines, which met on Monday did not make recommendations either on booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines or on vaccinating those under 18 years of age, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), the central government’s expert panel on immunisation, “has not made any recommendations” on any of the issues, a government official said.As cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 rise in the country, there are increasing concerns about those who have been fully vaccinated early in India’s immunisation drive, such as health and frontline workers. This has prompted NTAGI to discuss the feasibility of providing booster or additional doses under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme.The process is likely to happen in a phased manner with those at high risk, such as immunocompromised or immunosupressed persons, receiving priority. However, more evidence is being studied and an attempt made to build consensus over the issue before a recommendation is made in this regard.NTAGI, which advises the central government on immunization, has been working on a comprehensive policy for both booster or additional vaccine doses and vaccination for those in the paediatric age group.“This may be called an additional dose, which is likely to be considered for immunocompromised people to provide additional protection as they are at a higher risk. It’s different from a booster dose that is given after the immunity wanes,” a government expert earlier said on condition of anonymity.The Centre has always maintained its priority was to vaccinate all eligible persons as fast as possible.“With high sero prevalence found in surveys conducted at the national and state-level, it can be safely said that most are well protected at the moment,” Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, said. “Giving booster shots is not required at this point. The priority should be to vaccinate all eligible persons who are still left.”HT learns that government experts are working on a list of comorbidities that could determine which child is eligible for a vaccine first. The list is likely to have those on cancer treatment, transplant cases, and those with compromised immunity, among others.
07-12-2021||India||Kerala gag order on officials kicks up row; minister denies||The Kerala health department’s order restraining officials from speaking to the media has kicked off a controversy but state health minister Veena George on Monday denied any gag order, saying some arrangements have been made for uniformity. State health services director Dr VR Raju had issued a directive on Saturday making it mandatory for all health officials, especially district medical officers (DMOs), to take permission from the health directorate before talking to the media. An explanation was also sought from Kozhikode DMO Dr Omar Farooq who shared information with the media on a United Kingdom-returned doctor whose samples were sent for testing fearing Omicron infection. Samples of his mother and maid were also sent for examination. Opposition parties and health activists deplored the move, saying it was aimed at concealing facts and the government was yet to learn a lesson from its “mistake of omitting many deaths from fatality list just to maintain its track record”. “It was forced to add more than 5,000 deaths and many such cases are waiting. If court verdict was not there these deaths would have gone unnoticed. The latest is another move to fudge facts,” opposition Congress leader VD Satheesan said, adding the government wants everything a public relation exercise. But the minister denied it. “It was not a gag order. The order was given to maintain uniformity and avoid confusion. It will also help contain unnecessary panic. It was aimed at streamlining information and facts through a single window,” George said. But health activists said instead of bringing more transparency the government was forcing curbs on health officials, real foot soldiers of fight against the pandemic. “It is yet to learn a lesson from its mistakes. The minister admitted that 7,000 deaths were left out. It is another tactic to shut the mouth of officials. It is also keeping experts in the dark to indulge in public relations exercise,” said public health expert Dr SS Lal. The Indian Medical Association’s Kerala chapter also questioned the move. “If none speak authoritatively, wild speculations will rise,” said IMA secretary Joseph Benaven. Kerala was the first state to report Covid-19 infection in the country in January 2020. The state reported 3,277 fresh Covid cases on Monday, after 45,414 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 7.21%. It also reported 30 deaths but added 138 backlog deaths and total is 41, 768. It has an active caseload of 40,730, according to the state health ministry data. The state has, so far, reported 5,157,369 cases. With 5,833 more people recovering from the virus since Sunday, the total recoveries reached 50,86,044 and the active cases dropped to 40,730, the state government release said. Many health experts and opposition parties alleged that the government was not transparent with its data and it was after records and public relations campaigns. But the ruling CPI(M) denied it. “Instead of playing the role of a construction opposition it finds fault with everything the government does,” said CPI(M) leader A Vijayaraghavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gag-order-on-officials-kicks-up-row-minister-denies-101638818871905.html
07-12-2021||India||EPS, OPS continue to hold AIADMK top posts||O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami will continue as coordinator and joint-coordinator of the AIADMK in a dual leadership set up as the party on Monday announced that they have been unopposed in the intra-party elections to the top posts as there was no other team of nominees.“These nominations were scrutinised on Sunday. Since a lone nomination was filed by Panneerselvam and Palaniswami to contest for the post of coordinator and joint coordinator and the nomination is in accordance with party bylaw Rule 2 (II), they are declared elected unopposed,” senior leader and the election commissioner for these elections C Ponnaiyan announced at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai on Monday amidst huge applause.A week ago, the AIADMK made a crucial change to the party’s bylaws for the coordinator and joint-coordinator to be elected by the primary cadre where each member casts a single vote for the dual posts. This was also to ensure that the dual leadership solidifies amidst voices calling for a single leadership and to also ensure that expelled leader VK Sasikala finds no space to re-enter either.With this, the AIADMK is said to face the ensuing urban local body polls under Panneerselvam and Palaniswami. “This election is their last chance,” said political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “It is good that they have strengthened their party internally as they are the principal opposition and a strong opposition is good for democracy.”TN parties prep for local urban body polls Meanwhile other regional parties in the state have begun preparing themselves for the elections to urban local bodies expected to be held by January next year which will fill crucial posts of mayors and municipal administrations.Elections to urban local bodies in Tamil Nadu are being held for the first time in five years – the then AIADMK government conducted elections only for local bodies in rural areas in 2019. This would also be the first state-wide elections since the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) formed the government in May for assembly elections held on April 6. Both DMK and AIADMK have already invited applications from contestants for all posts in the urban local bodies.The DMK is coming on the back of a huge victory in the rural body polls held in nine newly carved districts in October. So the chief minister MK Stalin-led DMK is hoping to continue their winning streak which is a referendum on the performance of the seven-month-old government in the state.On Sunday, Stalin addressed a gathering at the DMK party headquarters where new members including those from the AIADMK had joined his party and said that they had secured a 99% victory in the October rural body polls. “I’m aware that you have come with full confidence of winning more than 99% in the upcoming urban local body polls,” Stalin told the crowd. The party is banking on showcasing the government’s achievements so far.The DMK is also focussing on the western region, the only region which continues to support the AIADMK-led NDA alliance in the state. The AIADMK is likely to come under pressure from its ally BJP over seat sharing in this region while another NDA ally, the PMK has already decided to contest alone. The DMDK-led by actor-politician Vijayankanth quit the NDA alliance before the 2021 polls and joined TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK ahead of the assembly elections and they will also contest alone. Actor-politician Kamal Haasan who was discharged on December 4 following his Covid-19 recovery on Monday released a video urging the cadre of Makkal Needhi Maiam to work towards the upcoming polls.While Dhinakaran’s AMMK has also been holding meetings to prepare for the elections with an aim to reclaim the parent body of the AIADMK, it remains to be seen what Sasikala, who claims to be AIADMK’s general secretary, next moves would be. On Sunday, she took a pledge with her supporters at late J Jayalalithaa’s memorial on her fifth death anniversary to unite and win future elections.
07-12-2021||India||Mumbai registers 2 more Omicron cases, national tally at 23||Two people were found infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in Mumbai and neither had any symptoms of the disease, authorities said on Monday, taking the total cases of such infections in the country to 23 across five states.A 37-year-old man who arrived in Mumbai from South Africa and his 36-year-old friend who landed in the city from the United States tested positive for the variant in Mumbai, said authorities. This takes the total number of cases of the Omicron variant in Maharashtra to 10.According to Maharashtra government officials, both the patients displayed no symptoms and were vaccinated with Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. Five high-risk and 315 low-risk contacts of the patients were traced till late Monday, said officials, adding that vigorous tracing of other contacts was underway.Cases of the Omicron variant have been reported from places in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka and Delhi. The first two cases of the variant were reported from Bengaluru last week.In several states, authorities rushed to trace and test people who had come in contact with patients suffering from the Omicron variant of the virus. Scientists have repeatedly called for aggressive testing and tracing to prevent the domestic spread of the variant, which is still being studied across the world.In Gujarat’s Jamnagar, the wife and brother-in-law of a person who was found to be infected with the Omicron variant on Saturday tested positive for Covid-19 and their samples were sent for genome sequencing, said a statement released by the city municipal corporation. It added that both of them were shifted to an isolation ward.On December 4, genome sequencing established the Jamnagar patient, a 72-year-old man who arrived in India from Zimbabwe, had contracted the Omicron variant. Zimbabwe is one of the high-risk countries in southern Africa where the variant was first detected.The man, who had taken both the doses of a Chinese vaccine in Zimbabwe, is currently in the isolation ward of a hospital in Jamnagar. His wife, who came with him from Zimbabwe, and his brother-in-law, who lives in Jamnagar, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and other family members tested negative, Jamnagar’ civic body said.The municipal corporation declared the residential society where the patient’s family resides a micro-containment zone and restricted the movement of people with barricades.In Odisha, two people who arrived from abroad tested positive for Covid-19 and their samples were sent for genome sequencing to the Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar, said the institute’s director Ajay Parida.Senior health officials said 800-odd people returned to Odisha from 11 countries – United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and Israel – that were placed in the ‘at-risk’ category since November 26. About 40% of these persons were not traceable, officials said.In Goa, five people -- three from Russia and two from Georgia -- tested positive for Covid-19 and their swab samples were sent for genome sequencing, officials said. In Kerala, swab samples of a doctor from United Kingdom was sent for genome sequencing, local authorities added.In Telangana, genome sequencing of 13 foreign passengers who tested positive for Covid-19 came back negative for the Omicron variant, said director of medical and health G Srinivas Rao. He added that 1,805 passengers arrived in Hyderabad from high-risk countries in the last five days and 13 had tested positive for Covid-19.In Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur, a 28-year-old man who arrived from Germany on Sunday tested positive for Covid-19 and his samples were sent for genome sequencing, said Dr D Mohanty, incharge of contract tracing in the district.In Uttarakhand, officials said 176 samples were sent for genome sequencing. Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said that the state was on high alert though no cases of the variant were reported from the state.Much remains unknown about Omicron, which was first identified in South Africa on November 8. It was subsequently labelled as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization on November 26.Dozens of countries have imposed travel restrictions on southern African nations since it was discovered.The variant has already gained a foothold in Europe, Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe. Many governments rushed to tighten travel rules to keep the variant out.According to the India’s genome testing consortium, INSACOG, the omicron variant is characterised by 30 amino acid (building blocks of proteins) changes – of these 15 are in the receptor binding domain that connects with the human cells to enter inside and three small deletions and one small insertion in the spike protein.Experts have stressed that more time is needed to determine if cases of this variant progress to the severe stage, or if vaccines would need to be reworked to combat it.On Monday, Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said there was need to take a decision at the national level on whether a booster dose of the vaccine was required. “Is booster dose required? We have doses available today. There is a need to take a decision at the national level in this regard I think. There are different opinions about it. So, it should be told why it needs to be given or why it shouldn’t. Only experts who have researched it (the infection) can talk about it,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-registers-2-more-omicron-cases-tally-at-23-101638818634325.html
07-12-2021||India||Kerala model gang-raped in Kochi, one arrested: Police||Kerala police on Monday arrested a man and is on the lookout for three others, including a woman, in connection with a gang-rape case of a 25-year-old model in Kochi. A senior police officer of the port city said the accused were suspected to be part of a well-knit racket that produced porn and sold them to various adult sites.The arrested has been identified as Salim Kumar and has been booked under rape (section 375), wrongful confinement (section 340) and other sections. The woman was booked under charges abetment to crime and conspiracy, the police said. According to police, the model, hailing from Malappuram, was summoned by the three men on the pretext of a three-day photo shoot at a lodge owned by the accused woman in Kochi on November 28. After the second day of the shoot, the accused gang-raped her for the next two days after she denied shooting “objectionable” images and videos for the perpetrators, the police said. The accused blackmailed her that they would release explicit images, and she was let go on the promise that she would not file a police complaint, the police added.“We fear many girls might be trapped and blackmailed like this. we have recovered some videos from the lodge where she was assaulted. Since the probe is at initial stage we can’t disclose more about it,” said a senior police officer who did not want to identify himself. he also said the woman’s charges of “inept handling” will also be investigated. In her compliant she alleged that she was asked too many embarrassing questions at the Info Park police station by the station in-charge. The victim told police that the accused probably cheated many girls, especially from other states, who might have kept silent, fearing the leak of videos containing intimate scenes. The victim has alleged that the police failed to act initially, which helped some of the accused abscond. The police have denied any laxity on their part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-model-gang-raped-in-kochi-one-arrested-police-101638818569863.html
07-12-2021||India||50 students of medical college in Telangana tested Covid positive in past 3 days||As many as 50 students of a private medical college in Telangana’s Karimnagar district tested positive for Covid-19 in the past three days, a week after they attended the annual day celebrations of the college, even as the state reported 195 positive cases and one death on Monday.So far, there has not been a single case of Omicron variant among the international passengers arriving in Hyderabad from identified high-risk countries.“As many as 1,805 passengers have arrived in Hyderabad from high-risk countries in the last five days, including 535 passengers on Monday. Of them only 13 passengers tested positive for Covid-19 and their samples had been sent for genome sequencing. It was revealed that none of them had Omicron variant,” director of medical and health G Srinivas Rao said.However, the sudden spurt of 50 Covid-19 positive cases in Karimnagar medical college caused a concern in the medical and health department.Karimnagar district medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr Juveria told HT that several students of Chelmeda Ananda Rao Institute of Medical Sciences at Bommakal village on the suburbs of Karimnagar town, had undergone tests for Covid-19 after they reported symptoms of the infection.“As per the reports received by the district medical and health department, as many as 50 students tested positive for the virus as on Monday evening. A medical camp was conducted for nearly 1,000 students for the last three days and their test results are awaited, as the staff at the labs are functioning on shifts,” Dr Juveria said.The medical college had held its annual day function on November 28 and the mass gathering might have led to the spread of the disease, she said. “We came to know only after the students with symptoms underwent tests voluntarily,” the DMHO said.Soon after the reports of the students testing positive, the college authorities had suspended classes and shut down the campus. “There is nothing to panic. All our medicos are in normal condition with mild symptoms and are in home isolation,” medical college chairman Chalmeda Lakshmi Narasimha Rao told reporters in Karimnagar in the evening.He refuted the theory that the infection might have spread due to mass gathering at the annual day function as all of them followed the Covid-19 precautions. “We have a multi-speciality hospital attached to our college and several patients come there regularly. The virus might have spread from some of the patients,” Rao said.Following the sudden spurt in Covid-19 positive cases at the medical college, district collector RV Karnan, police commissioner V Satyanarayana and other top medical officials visited the premises and reviewed the situation. They enquired about the facilities available for the treatment of the positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-students-of-medical-college-in-telangana-tested-covid-positive-in-past-three-days-101638818512749.html
07-12-2021||India||How will you restore victim girl’s faith on cops: Kerala high court to government||The Kerala high court on Monday asked the state government what it proposes to do to assuage feelings of an 8-year-old girl and her father, who were accused of theft by a woman police officer in public, so as to restore her confidence in humanity and police. While hearing a plea filed by the girl’s father seeking compensation and strict action against the police officer, the single bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran came down heavily on police for its efforts to save the officer. The pink police officer (specialised force to ensure women safety), meanwhile, tendered an unconditional apology to the court and victims. But the court said it was for the girl and her father to decide whether to accept it or not. Later, her father said he won’t accept an apology at this juncture and will go ahead with his plea. “The visuals of the crying child were really moving. May be the officer did not intend to hurt her, but the court wants to see how the state has taken note of this. What does the state proposes to do for the child to restore her confidence in humanity and police,” the judge observed. During the last hearing, the video of the incident was played in the court room. The incident occurred on August 27. The girl along with her father came to see a gigantic cargo being shifted by road to Vikram Sarabhai Research Centre in the state capital. The pink police was part of police deployment to control the public. When the pink police officer misplaced her mobile phone she accused the father and little girl, who were standing near police vehicle, of stealing it. Both were questioned in public by the officer and the girl broke down during frisking. But a few minutes later phone was recovered from a police jeep and police team left the scene immediately without tendering an apology to the petrified girl. Later, the video of police officer questioning the duo went viral. After the video went viral, the police officer was transferred and asked to undergo behavioral training. When public prosecutor O Narayanan submitted the state police chief’s report in which he stated that the girl started crying when the crowd gathered around them to ridicule the officer after phone was found the court rejected this argument. “She was crying from the very beginning of the video, she was extremely terrified. This is where the cover up starts. Khaki will always go in favour of khaki,” the judge observed criticising the report of the police chief. Earlier, the court had termed her action most “horrendous and insensitive” and asked how a mother can treat a minor girl like this. The counsel appearing for police officer S Rajeev produced an application before the court in which she “whole heartedly apologised to the child”. In her application, she said the father of the child was holding a cigarette and when he saw he hid it from her so she wrongly presumed that he had taken her phone. She pleaded that she was the mother of three minor children and her husband lost job abroad and waiting there for a final settlement. “If this girl does not get justice from this court, where is she going to get it from? She has gone knocking at every commission before coming here,” the judge asked the state to file a detailed reply on next hearing on Dec 15. 
07-12-2021||India||Hyderabad: Speeding car rams into two, kills them on spot||A speeding car, being driven by a 25-year-old realtor, rammed into two men crossing a road at the upscale Banjara Hills in Hyderabad in the early hours of Monday, police said.The deceased were identified as Ayodhya Ram (26), an office assistant at Rainbow Children’s Hospital and Devendra Kumar Das (29), a cook at the same hospital.Police later apprehended Ranjit Kumar Goud, a real estate developer from Uppal area on the city outskirts, who fled the spot soon after the accident and seized his Porsche Cayenne car.Assistant Commissioner of Police (Banjara Hills division) M Sudershan told reporters that the accident happened around 1.30 am right in front of the hospital, when Ram and Das were crossing the road to go back to their homes after completing duties.“The high-end car was travelling at a high speed towards Jubilee Hills, when it hit the victims, killing them on the spot,” Sudarshan said.Even after the accident, Goud did not stop the vehicle. A police squad of the Jubilee Hills police station on night patrolling noticed the partially damaged car speeding on the road, chased it and finally located it being parked a residential complex at Road No 5 of Jubilee Hills.“On getting the alert from Banjara Hills police, the Jubilee Hills police took Goud and two other inmates of the car into custody,” the ACP said.Police booked a case under Section 304 (II) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and also under Motor Vehicles Act against Goud. “On suspicion that he was in a drunken condition, he was sent to Osmania General Hospital for an alcohol test,” Sudershan said. The bodies of the victims, both from Gopalpur in Odisha, were shifted to the OGH morgue for post mortem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabadspeeding-car-rams-into-two-kills-them-on-spot-101638818510101.html
07-12-2021||India||TRS likely to strike deal with Prashant Kishor for Telangana polls||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi is likely to join the list of various political parties in the country that engaged the services of popular political strategist Prashant Kishor for the next assembly election in 2023 and even the general election in 2024.People in the TRS familiar with the development said a senior representative of Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) promoted by Kishor, held preliminary round of negotiations with the top TRS leadership last week.“If everything works out, the party would sign an agreement with the I-PAC sometime this month on working out poll strategies for the TRS in the coming elections,” a senior party leader said on condition of anonymity.The talks are believed to be part of the initiative by Kishor to bring together all the anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forces in the country before the next general elections.Of late, the TRS has been putting up an aggressive posture against the BJP in the state as well as the Centre. It even attended the meeting of 16 opposition parties at the office of Congress leader Mallikharjun Kharge last week to protest against the suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha members.TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had been attacking the Narendra Modi government for its alleged anti-people policies, particularly with regard to agriculture laws, lack of nationwide policy on paddy procurement and power sector reforms etc.TRS parliamentary party leader K Kesava Rao said the TRS would coordinate with all the other opposition parties in the coming days as well in fighting against the NDA government.Against this backdrop, the meeting of Kishor’s team member with the TRS leadership assumed significance. “He has been on the mission of mustering support to Trinamool Congress president and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Maybe, he is trying to reach out to KCR as part of his mission,” said political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar.On the possibility of the TRS engaging the services of Kishor for the next elections, Nageshwar said KCR’s sole interest would be safeguarding power in Telangana, rather than playing any role at the Centre.“Prashant Kishore is a shrewd businessman. He chooses his clients after thoroughly studying the situation in the state so that his business interests are served,” Nageshwar said.Kishor had earlier been hired by the YSR Congress president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and had played a major role in bringing the party to victory in the 2019 assembly election in Andhra Pradesh. The association between YSRCP and Kishore is still continuing, as his team members are actively involved in the performance analysis of his government and his party MLAs.The strategist also played a major role in the formation of governments in Bihar, Punjab, West Bengal and more recently Tamil Nadu.Interestingly, Kishore also initially helped Jagan’s sister YS Sharmila to launch a regional party in Telangana in the name of YSR Telangana Party in July this year. His team members assisted her in chalking out a route map for her marathon padayatra (foot march) that commenced on October 20. However, the padayatra came to a halt after the announcement of MLC election schedule on November 10.
07-12-2021||India||Sputnik Light vaccine likely to be authorised in India soon: RDIF||The backer of Russia’s Sputnik Light single shot Covid-19 vaccine said on Monday it has presented data from additional clinical trials to India’s regulator and expects the jab to be authorised in the country soon.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, said it has also provided India’s regulator with documents for registering Sputnik M, a variant of the vaccine for adolescents aged 12-17.RDIF said these moves were part of efforts to expand cooperation between India and Russia in the fight against Covid-19. The Sputnik V vaccine is already used in India following the grant of emergency use authorisation in April this year.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said during a media interaction in New Delhi that talks on the production of Sputnik Light in India were nearing completion, though he didn’t give details.Asked about plans to begin production of Sputnik Light in India in December, Lavrov said: “The talks on Sputnik Light are about to be completed and Sputnik V is already being produced in India. We are talking about several hundred million doses per year.”There was no word from the Indian side on the matter.RDIF said in a statement: “Currently, RDIF is actively cooperating with India’s regulatory authorities on registration of Sputnik Light (the one-shot vaccine based on human adenovirus serotype 26, the first component of the Sputnik V) as a standalone vaccine and a universal booster and expects it to be authorised in the country soon.”RDIF’s partner, Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, has conducted additional clinical trials of Sputnik Light in India and “positive data” from these trials has been presented to India’s regulator, the statement added.The fund has also provided India’s regulator with documents for registering Sputnik M, which was registered by Russia’s health ministry on November 24. It is a new member of the Sputnik vaccines family and is currently being offered to international markets.The statement said that subject to a “positive decision of India’s authorities, Sputnik M could become the first foreign registered vaccine for adolescents in the country”.RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said: “Russia and India have joined forces since the beginning of the pandemic, with this strategic partnership including production of Sputnik V and Sputnik Light vaccines. A number of agreements with partners in India have helped RDIF to significantly increase our production capabilities.”“We are ready to offer the Sputnik Light vaccine and the Sputnik M vaccine for adolescents to support strong herd immunity in India and continue saving millions of lives,” Dmitriev added.Sputnik V has been authorised in 71 countries with a total population of over four billion people. RDIF has reached agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies, including Serum Institute of India, Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma, Virchow Biotech and Morepen, to produce the Russian vaccines and India is now the leading production hub for Sputnik V and Sputnik Light.The latest findings by the Gamaleya Center, the developer of the Sputnik vaccines, which are based on data from 28,000 subjects in Moscow, have shown that Sputnik Light administered standalone has 70% efficacy against infection from the Delta variant of the Coronavirus during the first three months after vaccination.The vaccine is 75% effective among subjects under the age of 60. Efficacy of Sputnik Light as a booster against Delta variant for other vaccines will be close to the efficacy against the Delta variant of the Sputnik V vaccine – more than 83% against infection and more than 94% against hospitalisation.Interim results of a study in Argentina on combining Sputnik Light and vaccines produced by AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Moderna and Cansino have shown Sputnik Light is an “effective universal booster”, the statement said.Results of a separate joint clinical trial of a combination of Sputnik Light with the AstraZeneca jab have demonstrated it “induces strong immunity and has a high safety profile”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-light-vaccine-likely-to-be-authorised-in-india-soon-rdif-101638818389671.html
07-12-2021||India||Congress and BJP both are our enemies, no talks of any alliance for now: Kumaraswamy||JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy on Monday termed both BJP and Congress as equal enemies of his party, as he tried to clarify that the saffron party leader B S Yediyurappa has only sought “cooperation” and not an alliance during the upcoming legislative council polls in Karnataka.Stating that he would reveal JD(S)’ stand on Yediyurappa’s request for support to BJP candidates in the seats, where the regional party is not contesting, on Tuesday, the former chief minister said there has been no official request in this regard from the saffron party itself.“Tomorrow (Tuesday), I will hold a press conference in Bengaluru where I will speak on all issues. I want to bring one thing to your notice, I have nowhere said that I will have an alliance with another party till now. Our national president (H D Deve Gowda) has only said that Kumaraswamy will decide on what to do, where we have not put our candidate,” Kumaraswamy said in response to a question.Speaking to reporters here, he said neither Congress nor BJP has sought JD(S)’ support so far, and only Yediyurappa has a couple of times appealed for support, where the regional party has not fielded its candidates.“Yediyurappa has also clarified that there is no alliance between BJP and JD(S) and that he has only sought for cooperation in this (council) election...alliance means openly having understanding and going for elections, here he (Yediyurappa) has sought for cooperation, where we don’t have our candidates,” he added.There is a heightened buzz over a possible pact between the ruling BJP and JD(S) for the coming legislative council polls, following full display of bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the regional party’s patriarch Deve Gowda, during their meeting in Delhi last week.The biennial election to the Karnataka Legislative Council from 20 Local Authorities’ Constituencies for 25 seats, due to the retirement of sitting members, would be held on December 10.State BJP strongman and former Chief Minister Yediyurappa has a couple of times openly sought JD(S) support in the seats where the regional party is not contesting.The JD(S) has fielded only six candidates, while the BJP and Congress are contesting in 20 seats each.Further noting that BJP is giving a fight to his party at six seats where JD(S) has fielded its candidates, Kumaraswamy said, “They (BJP) are not transferring their votes to us in this election. They want to defeat us in the seats wherever we are contesting, including Mandya.””They are also my enemies...Congress and BJP both are equal enemies to our party,” he said, as he clarified that officially BJP as a party, has not sought support.Yediyurappa too on Sunday had clarified that there was no alliance with JD(S)”There is no alliance with any party...Wherever our candidates are fielded, there we will work day and night, where JD(S) don’t have a candidate we have sought for support and nothing else, there is no need for anyone to have any misconception on this,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-and-bjp-both-are-our-enemies-no-talks-of-any-alliance-for-nowkumaraswamy-101638818331517.html
07-12-2021||India||Bommai politically weak, says Shivakumar||The Karnataka Congress on Monday called chief minister Basavaraj Bommai “weak”, saying that he faces opposition from his partymen and has been unable to contain the growing dissent and disgruntlement within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Politically he has become weak, their minister says that (Murugesh) Nirani will become CM,” DK Shivakumar, the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said on Monday.The statements come as news of simmering dissent within the BJP has come to the fore, with senior cabinet ministers openly endorsing their colleagues for the top job.Rural Development and Panchayat Raj minister KS Eshwarappa on November 30 said that Nirani can become Karnataka chief minister in the future, adding that Bommai will not be replaced.The conflicting views, people aware of the developments said, were part of a growing divide within the saffron outfit ever since Bommai, who is relatively a new entrant into the BJP, was picked to replace BS Yediyurappa in late July this year.The likes of Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator from Bijapura, has continued to make contentious remarks and even hint at “big changes” in the coming months. That action is yet to be taken against leaders like Yatnal has forced the impression that the party high command has given them a free hand just like it did against Yediyurappa.While most of the senior state leadership kept their composure despite the contentious decision, the endorsement of Bommai by Amit Shah in early September as the face of the 2023 assembly elections in the state, stirred the nest further.Bommai has been termed a “puppet” of the national party leadership by analysts, the opposition and his partymen.On his part, Bommai has continued to consult his predecessor, Yediyurappa, on every major decision, and the cabinet he currently leads, are candidates chosen by the latter.Bommai has been unable to convince the national leadership to expand his cabinet to quell some of this dissent.“Right now we are engaged in (the) legislative council poll battle and preparations for the Belagavi session of the legislature. As for ministry expansion, future courses of action would be based on suggestions from our senior leadership,” Bommai said on Monday in Hubballi, about 450 kms from Bengaluru.Facing a slew of charges of corruption, including the Bitcoin scandal and a section of contractors writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on “commission” sought by ministers, MLAs and officials even before securing tenders and beginning to work, Bommai has been at the receiving end in recent times.The loss at Hanagal in his home district of Haveri in the October 30 bypolls has also weighed on the chief minister, who has been accused of stirring up communal sentiments to deflect attention away from him.The Christian community in the state is protesting against the new chief minister and his decision to introduce a bill to ban forcible religious conversions, and a survey of all churches in the state, which the minority group has said will spoil the peace and harmony.The rise of hate crimes, communal clashes and moral policing is also attributed to Bommai and his provocative statements.The BJP will try harder now to win seats in the December 10 MLC polls and has even indicated a possible alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) to gain control over the upper house of the state legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-politically-weak-saysshivakumar-101638818330125.html
07-12-2021||India||Bengaluru: Muslim man alleges assault in police station; probe on||Bengaluru police have ordered a probe against a sub-inspector attached to the Byatarayanapura police station after a 24-year-old Muslim man alleged that he was assaulted by the police and was forced to drink urine.In a video, the man alleged that the policemen also cut his beard inside the police station. HT has verified the video and withheld the victim’s name.“They hit me with a cricket bat, they cut beard and made me drink urine when asked for water. When I told them not to cut my beard because it was part of my faith, they said the police station was not my religious centre. They hit me more than 30 times with a cricket bat,” said the man.  According to the family of the man, he was picked up over a quarrel with the neighbour and was kept in the police station, without filing a case against him, for two days. In the video, the man named a sub-inspector Harish and said he was accompanied by a police constable. “They told me that they file a kidnapping case against me and send me to jail for two years,” he said. The victim’s family members said that he was admitted to Victoria Hospital after the attack and was discharged on Monday. They also showed images of bruises on his back, thighs, and other parts of the body.Deputy commissioner of police (West) Sanjeev Patil said that a probe by an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) ranked officer has been ordered and based on his report further action will be taken. The sub-inspector has not been placed under suspension, said an official familiar with developments. The police sub-inspector didn’t answer HT’s call for comment. In a similar incident, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Karnataka Police had arrested a police sub-inspector for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to drink urine in September. Arjun Horakeri, a sub-inspector of police posted with Gonibeedu police station, was produced before a court in Chikkamagaluru last Thursday, and an additional district and sessions judge remanded him to 14 days judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-muslim-man-alleges-assault-in-police-station-probe-on-101638818270785.html
07-12-2021||India||A decision on strict Covid-19 measures after meeting: Karnataka CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said that the government would decide on imposing stricter measures to counter Covid-19, such as restricting occupancy at malls, theatres, and other public places to 50 %, after a meeting with the medical experts and other departments. Following the detection of two cases of Omicron variant in the state and reports of multiple clusters across the state, the health department officials had put forth several suggestions to impose strict guidelines to control the number of cases.The health department increased testing in many districts after several schools, and college students reported Covid positive in the past two weeks. “We have received all recommendations, so would be put before the expert committee. We will discuss all issues, such as Omicron and Delta (variants of Covid), during this meeting. Once they (experts) give their opinion, we will take further action,” chief minister Bommai said.Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said that the five contacts of a doctor who tested positive for the Omicron variant are asymptomatic. Three primary contacts – immediate family members of the doctor – and two secondary contacts, who tested positive for Covid-19, have been in isolation and under observation at a government facility over the past week. The genomic sequencing reports for the five contacts of the doctor are yet to be provided to the Karnataka health department, the minister said. “There are no symptoms in the contacts of the person infected with the new variant. They are not facing any complications or severity (of the disease). They are admitted to the Bowring hospital, and I am in touch with the director of the hospital,” the health minister said. “The mild nature of the infection in the contacts may be because they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. This is the reason why we believe there will not be severity in those who are vaccinated. Therefore we are asking people to complete two doses of vaccination,” Dr Sudhakar added. He added that the state achieved 93% first dose coverage, and 64 % of the eligible population has received the second dose. The state has 7 million vaccine doses in reserve at present. “We do not have to be too concerned with this variant. We handled the Delta variant, which had a higher level of severity. If we compare Omicron to Delta, then we are not seeing reports of severity of disease anywhere in the world. The only concern is the rapid transmissibility of the variant – to prevent this, we need people to be vaccinated,” he added. Karnataka and Bengaluru reported 301 and 162 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the active caseload to 7,067 and 5,179, respectively. While the state reported seven deaths due to the infections, taking the toll to 38,287, its capital city saw three Covid-19 related fatalities on the day, pushing its toll to 16,348, according to the daily health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-decision-on-strict-covid-19-measures-after-meetingkarnatakacmbommai-101638818269654.html

The new cluster has been identified at Jawahar Navodaya School at Seegodu near Balehonnur. A sample of 418 people, including students and staff, were tested after three students and four staff members had contracted Covid-19 on Friday, health department officials said.All students at the schools are asymptomatic, said the officials, who added that all measures have been taken to monitor them.The incident comes days after a medical college in Dharwad turned into a hotspot with over 84students testing positive for Covid-19 after attending a cultural event. Following this, similar clusters were reported in Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Hassan and Mysuru districts.“The infected students and employees have been quarantined in a part of the hostel. The school has classes 1 to 12, with more than 450 resident students on the rolls. Both teaching and non-teaching employees will stay on the campus,” said Chikkamagaluru deputy commissioner KN Ramesh.Karnataka primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh on Monday said the deputy commissioner is personally monitoring the situation at Jawahar Navodaya School. He has organised for ambulances and additional medical staff if needed, said the minister.The minister also said that the government is ready to close schools if Covid-19 cases in the state see an increase. Talking to reporters in Bengaluru, the minister said that the government is open to cancelling examinations and closing schools, however, the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), who are closing monitoring the coronavirus in the state has not recommended such requirement, he added.“We will not backtrack if a need arises to stop exams and schools. However, in the present situation, all the experts think there is no problem. If required, we will stop the exams. However, the Standard Operating Procedure is maintained very strictly in the exams because we make sitting arrangements maintaining physical distance,” said the minister.Talking to reporters on Monday, Nagesh said that the Covid clusters have been reported in residential schools in the state, and other schools have reported no such clusters. “We have not reported any cases in standard 1 to 10. One case was a report in a PU (Pre-university) college, and rest, including the clusters reported yesterday (Sunday), are in residential schools,” he said.Regarding the cases in residential schools, the minister said that he has called for a meeting with the principal secretary of the education department. “We will discuss what new steps have to be taken to control the cases in residential schools. I have also spoken to deputy commissioner’s some districts regarding the same. Also, senior education department officials have been asked to visit residential schools in their jurisdiction and take stock of the situation,” he said.Nagesh asked people not to panic as it will impact the academic activities of children. “There is no need for people to panic because this year, we started regular schools after a year of lockdown. In case schools are shut again, then it will be difficult to bring back children to the classes,” Nagesh said.He, however, assured parents that the education department will take stringent measures in case it is felt that the Covid-19 situation is going to impact children’s health.The statement comes as several private schools have suspended offline classes due to an increase in the number of clusters in educational institutes and the scare over the new variant, the office-bearers of the schools’ association said. M Srinivasan, president of Management of Independent CBSE Schools’ Association (MICSA), Karnataka, said that over half of their member schools that had resumed offline classes have reverted to offline classes. “There is a fear among parents, so these schools have gone back to online teaching and they are also holding their exams online,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-cluster-emerges-as-101-test-positive-in-karnataka-school-101638818209591.html
07-12-2021||India||After deputy CM, Uttar Pradesh minister calls for new temple in Mathura||Days after Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya pitch for a grand temple at Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, another cabinet minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Mathura, Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary on Monday advocated for the same, saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath will make it a reality.“If a temple in the name of Sri Krishna will not be built in Mathura, would it be built in Lahore or Rawalpindi in Pakistan? Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath will jointly make the grand temple at Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi a reality, but at the appropriate time,” the state minister of dairy development, animal husbandry and fisheries said in a statement.He said the grand temple of Ramlalla in Ayodhya was becoming a reality only after due compliance of law and procedure. “Similarly, an apt opportunity would surface for the creation of grand temple of Lord Sri Krishna at the janmabhoomi site in Mathura,” Chaudhary added.“…Those who are against such temple should say so and get their DNA tested to prove that they are actually descendent of Sri Krishna,” Chaudhary told HT.Earlier, Maurya stirred the Hindutva pot in the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh last week as he tweeted that construction of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi was underway and Mathura would be next.Backing Maurya’s statement, Chaudhary said, “Keshav Prasad Maurya is a senior leader of our party and his statement in favour of a temple of Lord Sri Krishna at janmabhoomi site in Mathura is totally justified.”He added: “I hope the temple at Sri Krishna janmabhoomi site will be more magnificent than the one coming up at Ayodhya.”Rashtiya Lok Dal spokesperson Kaptan Singh said the BJP was sensing defeat in the forthcoming state assembly elections. “BJP raised such issues only at time of elections to divert attention from real issues. They have nothing to say on real issues,” he added.

He informed the court that the matter required to be heard before Wednesday, when the bail order will take effect.“The matter pertains to grant of default bail and this order will be in effect from December 8, so this case needs to be heard,” Mehta said.The CJI asked Mehta to share the case papers and said he will consider listing the case. Later in the day, the matter was listed for Tuesday before a three-judge bench headed by justice UU Lalit and also comprising justices S Ravindra Bhat and Bela Trivedi.Several activists, lawyers and authors are facing charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for participating in an alleged Maoist conspiracy to trigger violence on January 1, 2018, in the Bhima Koregaon village of Maharashtra’s Pune district.The activists are accused of delivering inflammatory speeches during an event called Elgar Parishad organised in Pune on December 31, 2017. The activists have denied all charges and accused the prosecution of planting evidence.Bharadwaj, who is currently lodged at Byculla women’s prison, argued that sessions judge K D Vadane, who granted Pune Police a 90-day extension on November 26, 2018, to file the charge sheet, did not have jurisdiction to do so as only a special NIA court could hear UAPA cases.On December 1, a division bench of justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar granted default bail to Bharadwaj but rejected the applications of eight co-accused facing terrorism and conspiracy charges for allegedly fomenting violence in Bhima Koregaon in 2018.This was the first time that a person accused in the high-profile case was granted default bail, which can be given if a person is jailed for more than 90 days without a charge sheet. One of the other accused, poet Varavara Rao, is out on medical bail, and a second accused, Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, died in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhima-koregaon-violence-case-sc-to-hear-nia-plea-against-sudha-bharadwaj-s-bail-today-101638816889515.html

Thereafter, three of the shutters were shut down at 10 pm and six were kept open to release 8,380.50 cusecs of water, it added.The Tamil Nadu authorities had raised the shutters to 120 cm after the water level of the dam reached 141.90 feet at 8.30 pm.This is first time nine shutters of Mullaperiyar are getting opened at night. According to district officials, more than 100 families have been shifted from Idukki.Augustine said the issue of water being released at night would be raised before the Supreme Court. He added that he will be present at Idukki to help with the rescue efforts and to persuade people to evacuate to camps wherever necessary.The Mullaperiyar dam, built in 1895 on the Periyar river in Idukki district of Kerala, is operated by the Tamil Nadu government for its irrigation and power needs. Kerala has been insisting on building a new dam, citing safety concerns, but Tamil Nadu is against it, saying the present structure is strong.Meanwhile, the Idukki district administration sounded an orange alert as the water level in the reservoir there touched 2,401.12 feet.The authorities also expect further rise in water level in Idukki reservoir due to the excess flow of water to it from the Mullaperiyar dam.They said that if the water in the reservoir rises excessively, one shutter of Cheruthoni dam will be raised at 6 am on Tuesday from 40 cm to 150 cm.The district collector said that people in the area below the Cheruthoni dam and on both sides of the Periyar should be extremely careful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-opens-shutters-of-mullaperiyar-dam-irks-kerala-101638816835856.html
07-12-2021||India||Sarada Menon, India’s first woman psychiatrist, dies at 98 in Chennai||Sarada Menon, considered India’s first woman psychiatrist, passed away at the age of 98 at her home in Chennai on Sunday. She has been a recipient of several awards, including the Padma Bhusan in 1992 for her work in the field of mental health. Born in Mangaluru, Menon graduated from the Madras Medical College and trained in psychiatry in Bengaluru’s NIMHANS. She became the first woman psychiatrist in the country when she began working in 1959 at what is now the Institute of Mental Health (previously government Kilpauk mental hospital) in Chennai. She held the post of superintendent of the institute for more than 18 years. Soon after her retirement, Menon founded the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in 1984. SCARF has been affiliated with the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a collaborating centre for mental health research and training since 1996, and it continues to be a premier NGO offering treatment and rehabilitation for those with mental illness and support for their caregivers. She stepped down from her position in 1995 and remained an advisor. Psychiatrist Dr R Thara, who took over as SCARF’s director and was among the founding health professionals, said, “She brought in terrific changes.” Menon changed it from an asylum into a place where she recruited volunteers and social workers and was instrumental in ensuring there were psychiatric outpatient wards in government hospitals. Dr Thara says late former chief minister J Jayalalithaa held Menon in high regard, which helped SCARF receive an annual grant from the state government and land to construct SCARF’s daycare centre and residential facilities. “We got together in 1984 and started SCARF. Her primary motivation was the rehabilitation of the mentally ill which she felt was a neglected aspect,” says Thara. “The other was a stigma. She felt one way of beating stigma was by employing persons who have recovered – the mentally ill. She was also particular that families need support, so we simultaneously work with them by providing information and emotional support.”Those who have worked with Menon say that she continued to actively monitor patients even until recently. Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, the founder of SNEHA Foundation, a suicide prevention helpline and a student of Menon’s, says that she attended a meeting in Chennai three months ago to be up to speed on the latest research on the gut microbiome in the mental health field. “It was mind-boggling. She was 98 and still wanted to learn. She asked all relevant questions at the meeting,” says Dr Vijayakumar. She adds that she didn’t enjoy psychiatry until Menon took a class. “Her class was an eye-opener for me. Most psychiatrists in Chennai are her students. She taught us in college even after her retirement.”Condoling her death, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin recalled Menon had studied in the Madras Medical College. “Her demise is a loss to the medical profession,” he said in a statement. 
07-12-2021||India||Congress forms panels for elections in Punjab||The Congress on Monday made key appointments in its election team for the coming assembly elections, seeking to bring on board all leaders in its faction-ridden Punjab unit. Party president Sonia Gandhi named former state president Sunil Jakhar as chairman of the campaign committee, Rajya Sabha member Ambika Soni as chairperson of the election coordination committee, and Partap Singh Bajwa as chairman of the manifesto committee. The party also nominated Jakhar as a member of the screening committee, which will pick candidates; the other members of the panel are Ajay Maken, its chairman, and Chandan Yadav and Krishna Allavaru. Harish Chaudhary, in charge of state affairs, Navjot Singh Sidhu, state party head, and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi as legislative party leader have been named as ex-officio members of the screening committee (including Jakhar). The appointments were announced in a statement signed by Congress general secretary KC Venugopal. Jakhar was upset after the September reshuffle when Channi was made chief minister. Jakhar was among those reported to be in the running to replace Captain Amarinder Singh but the party made a surprise pick, Channi. The head of the party’s Punjab unit, Sidhu, whose appointment set the state for Singh’s exit, was also reported to be in the running. “It is to be seen how the leaders, particularly Sidhu and Jakhar, who have been opposed to each other, will coordinate particularly at the time of declaration of candidates for the elections,” a party leader said on condition of anonymity. The upcoming weeks will be an acid test of the party’s ability to keep its flock together, especially when  Singh has floated an outfit to contest the polls along with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Akali Dal’s breakaway faction. 
07-12-2021||India||Protests over suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha MPs stall House||Opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha on Monday were unrelenting in their demand for reversing the decision of the House to suspend 12 MPs for the duration of the ongoing winter session from the Upper House for creating a “ruckus” during the monsoon session in August. Protests by the opposition MPs led to five adjournments, with the House clocking only 45 minutes of proceedings.The Opposition, in the process, even let go of a debate on price rise and a chance to ask questions to union home minister Amit Shah on the Nagaland killings. While some Opposition leaders justified their stand, others suggested that disruption shouldn’t always overshadow debate on raging issues. Congress and DMK members walked out of the House as no supplementary questions could be taken on Shah’s reply.During question hour in the Rajya Sabha , which was being held amid sloganeering by the opposition, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’ Brien, while posing a question to Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Shekhawat, said, “I want to ask the minister why has democracy dried up in Parliament.”This prompted leader of the house Piyush Goyal to criticise the opposition for creating ruckus in the House. The opposition objected to the minister’s statement and the House was adjourned from 12.18 pm till 2 pm.Earlier, chairman M Venkaiah Naidu refused to take up the issue of suspension for discussion and informed the House that home minister Amit Shah would be making a statement on the civilian killings in Nagaland. The opposition MPs, however, raised slogans, which led to an adjournment within 10 minutes of the House convening at 11 am.When the House eventually reassembled at 2 pm, the protests continued. Deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, who was in the chair, urged members to take up the short-duration discussion on price rise that had been demanded by several opposition parties. With no end to the logjam, the House was again adjourned till 3 pm within three minutes of assembling.At 3 pm, when the House assembled again, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman criticised the opposition for not participating in a discussion that they had sought and blaming the government for not having discussions.“Let me humbly submit to the opposition leaders. This topic is decided by them... The opposition wanted to discuss this and the government has agreed to have this discussion. If they are talking about democracy, they asked for it and we have agreed,” she said. “Shouldn’t they have been discussing it... Isn’t that democracy, isn’t that the spirit of this House and often we are accused that the Government is running away from debate?”Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said he was ready for debate but suspension should be revoked. “I will tell how the prices have gone up. I am ready to speak but how can I speak in the din?” Kharge said.Goyal also blamed the opposition for defending the “indefensible”. He said it was a sad day for Indian democracy that the opposition wanted this discussion but did not participate.“When the government is ready to do this, they are trying to defend the indefensible act of their colleagues, who are not even feeling any remorse for the sacrilege, the word that the chairman used, the sacrilege they did of democracy. Now the leader of the opposition claims that he wants to start the discussion and asks you to bring the House in order… This is like playing a game,” he said.The House was subsequently adjourned till 4 pm within eight minutes of convening. It was adjourned for the fifth and final time at 4.06 pm after Shah made a statement in the House on the civilian deaths in Nagaland.Trinamool’s floor leader Derek O’Brien said “It was artificially normal in the last two days. You can’t deprive 12 MPs from participating in the debate.” He argued that the Opposition allowed the House to run uninterrupted last Thursday and Friday but the government didn’t show magnanimity and push for revocation of suspension of 12 MPs. These MPs were have been suspended for the entire session for their unruly behavior in the last session.RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha, who lost his chance to question Shah on the Nagaland situation, indicated that the strategy would not remain same. “We have an evolving strategy that depends on the situation in the day. We are meeting tomorrow. Everybody was distraught on Monday that 12 Opposition MPs still remain suspended.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-over-suspension-of-12-rajya-sabha-mps-stall-house-101638816469585.html
07-12-2021||India||MGP announces alliance with TMC ahead of Mamata visit||The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) in Goa will have a pre-poll alliance with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) after “encouraging preliminary talks” between the two parties, MGP chief Deepak Dhavalikar said.“Preliminary talks have been held. We apprised the central committee of these talks. Our central committee has unanimously passed a resolution to align with the TMC,” Dhavalikar said at a media briefing.“We will fight the 2022 assembly elections in alliance with the Trinamool Congress. We had decided that we will go with the party that agrees to our demands, which the TMC did,” the MGP leader said.The MGP had won three out of the 40 assembly seats in the 2017 state elections, but its two legislators later defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party in the coastal state, leaving only Sudin Dhavalikar, the elder of the two Dhavalikar siblings, as the party’s representative in the state’s legislature.The TMC also confirmed that the two parties had reached an agreement to fight the elections together.“With this we believe that for the people of Goa who were looking for an alternative to get rid of the BJP government they should look no further. This alliance between the MGP and the Trinamool is a wonderful blend of both the Trinamool’s fighting spirit and the MGP’s long rooted history in Goa and we believe that this union will take Goa forward,” TMC MP and Goa in-charge Mahua Moitra told reporters at a press conference here on Monday evening.Goa is heading to polls in February-March next year.MGP held talks with several parties, including the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the TMC to form an alliance against the BJP, Deepak Dhavalikar said. “But as time passed, it was important for us to make a decision. There are other parties that could join our alliance later,” he said. “The BJP has been trying to woo our candidates, making it important for us to take a quick decision. We have to work to bring a new direction in the state.”The MGP initially held talks with the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP after Sudin Dhavalikar expressed willingness to explore the possibility of an alliance with the ruling party in the national Capital. However, for reasons that he is yet to spell out, the MGP chief said the talks with the AAP stalled and remained inconclusive.“We may formally announce our alliance with the TMC during Mamata Banerjee’s upcoming state visit,” he said.West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to visit Goa for her second visit, after her first last month, on December 13.The MGP’s decision is seen as a blow to the BJP, which has been attempting to woo the regional party given that the two parties largely battle for votes from the same communities.Goa BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade, however, said the MGP’s decision was not a setback.“The talks were being held by our party’s national leadership. Nonetheless, the state unit remains fully prepared to fight the elections on our own. If there are others who are willing to come along, we will take them along or else we will fight against them,” Tanavade said. “We have the strength to fight elections on our own even if everyone else joins forces against us. We have proved this in the zilla parishad (district council) and local municipality polls.” .With the TMC and the MGP coming together and the Congress and the Goa Forward Party forming an alliance, it leaves the AAP without any alliance partners for now, besides the BJP, which is also facing a situation where it might have to go solo in the state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mgpannounces-alliance-with-tmc-ahead-of-mamata-visit-101638816417423.html
07-12-2021||India||Supreme Court dismisses plea seeking more teeth for dowry law||Change must come from within on how women should be treated, the Supreme Court said on Monday as it sharply criticised the practice of dowry but dismissed a petition seeking to add more teeth to penal provisions in the country’s anti-dowry law.Asking the petitioners to approach the Law Commission for initiating reforms, the top court was categorical that such reforms fell within the realm of policymaking that restrained courts from stepping in. The Law Commission is a body of experts constituted by the Centre, from time to time, to examine amendments to existing laws, recommend redundant laws and even take up research on new and emerging fields of law. It is headed by either a judge of Supreme Court or chief justice of a high court.The observations were made while dealing with a petition by Kerala-based social activist Sabu Stephen and two others, including a woman lawyer who was a victim of dowry harassment.The petition argued by advocate VK Biju said that although dowry death and harassment were made punishable under Section 304B and 498A of the Indian penal code (IPC), and there was a dedicated law in the form of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, young women and girls continued to be subjected to severe torture for dowry.“We are also sensitive to the issue you have raised….the change has to come from within. How we treat a woman and how to treat a woman when she comes into a family are things that are part of a social change,” said the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna.The court found the prayers in the petition to be bordering on legislation. These included the appointment of a dowry prohibition officer in every government office, gifts brought by the woman to be registered in her own name till seven years after the wedding, a curriculum for schools, and a premarital course that will require “no dowry certificate” to be mandatory for registration of any marriage, among others.“The reliefs which have been sought in the above terms pertain to the realm of legislative policy. Hence, there are restraints on the jurisdiction of this court under Article 32 of the Constitution to craft remedies which essentially require legislative reforms,” the bench said,Granting liberty to the petitioners to approach the Law Commission of India, the bench said, “A dialogue on considering what measures would support the existing legislation on the subject, can be initiated. It is in this backdrop that we are of the view that it may be appropriate if the Law Commission of India considers the issue in all its perspectives. The petitioners are at liberty to submit a note of research and on all relevant aspects for the benefit of the Law Commission.”The court also noted the dangers in entertaining the prayers made in the petition. For instance, it noted that the idea of having a ‘no dowry certificate’ after a mandatory counselling will work to the disadvantage of women in villages. “India resides not only in Kochi, Delhi or Mumbai, but in small villages. So those getting married have to go to the nearest city to attend the course. And if you say, without the certificate, marriage won’t be registered, it will have serious consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-seeking-more-teeth-for-dowry-law-101638816408871.html
07-12-2021||India||Challenges overpowered China ties: Outgoing envoy||Challenges have overpowered the vast opportunities available in China-India ties, outgoing Indian envoy Vikram Misri told state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi, adding, however, that he hopes that the two sides will be able to resolve the difficulties through engagement.Referring to the ongoing military friction in eastern Ladakh, Misri said that he hoped that a “complete resolution” will be possible soon under the guiding framework provided by Wang and India’s external affairs minister, S Jaishankar.Misri, returning to New Delhi later this month, spoke to Wang during a farewell call held via video link.Misri, according to a statement issued by the Indian embassy in Beijing said bilateral relations comprised both opportunities and challenges, and “...certain challenges since last year had overpowered the vast opportunities in the relationship”.The challenges and difficulties can be overcome through engagement, Misri indicated.Misri told Wang that he was hopeful that with “…continued communication at all levels - political, diplomatic and military, the two sides would be able to resolve the current difficulties and take the relationship forward in a positive direction”.The Indian ambassador highlighted the role played by Jaishankar and Wang “…in issuing appropriate guidance to achieve complete resolution of the current issues at India-China border areas…”Misri said he hoped that “…complete resolution of these issues as per the understanding between the two foreign ministers would be achieved soon, which in turn would help relations to return towards normalisation, which was the common goal of both sides”.Wang, on his part, said he shared Misri’s “…belief that the commonalities far outweighed the differences in our bilateral relations, and expressed confidence that our relations would be able to make progress in the future.”The tenure of Misri, who took over as ambassador in January 2019, has been marked by the ongoing Sino-India friction along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in the Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Soldiers were killed on both sides in a brutal fight on the night of June 15 at Galwan Valley.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.In September, Misri urged China to separate the ongoing border tension in eastern Ladakh from the larger boundary dispute, saying the primary concern was to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC and not resolve the decades-long boundary disagreement.Speaking at a virtual India-China Track-II dialogue last week, Misri said day-to-day affairs along the disputed border should be addressed through existing established agreements and protocols, which are not to be confused with the long-term mechanisms in place for the final resolution.“A serious violation of peace and tranquillity in the border areas naturally requires us to apply our minds based on established agreements, protocols and mechanisms to resolve it,” Misri told the gathering by video link.“As we do so, any attempt to confuse border affairs with the Boundary Question is a disservice to the work of those involved in finding solutions,” he said, indicating that China was doing so by “shifting goalposts”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/challenges-overpowered-china-ties-outgoing-envoy-101638816289445.html
07-12-2021||India||December 6: What we know about the Omicron variant so far||Binayak DasguptaIn the first half of 2020, the most pressing scientific mystery was why Sars-Cov-2 caused wildly inconsistent symptoms and outcomes. Close to half the infected people would remain asymptomatic and among a minority that was left, it led to severe disease and even death. Before superspreader variants such as Alpha and Delta, it was estimated only about 20% of the cases were responsible for passing the virus on to the remaining 80% of infected people, which meant the uncertainty did not just manifest in symptoms, but also in how it spread.Slowly, some of that mystery was traced back to differences in how people’s immunity reacts – specifically, the early phase of the immune response when the body’s defences spot the intruder and trigger a series of biological responses. For some people, this intricate choreography of immune cells was badly tuned, like an out-of-sync musical ensemble, allowing the virus to keep multiplying and spreading deeper into lung tissue. A panicked overreaction to flush out the intruder follows, and it is this – the hyper-inflammatory stage – that leads to deaths in Covid-19.Immunity, back in focusThe Omicron variant is now bringing the focus back on the immune system. This time, scientists are racing to understand how the virus affects what is known as adaptive immunity, which over time keeps a biological sketch of all pathogens we encounter.This memory is defined by details of a pathogen’s structure to which antibodies attach. These details are called epitopes. When the same pathogen intrudes again, the immune memory of these epitopes is used to create antibodies and killer cells that neutralise the threat.Over time, scientists have identified the Sars-Cov-2’s epitopes. They have also identified how certain variants have changes in these epitopes.A recent analysis by Italian scientists, shared on virological.org, has quantified how four variants known or suspected to be resistant to past immunity – Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron – have camouflaged some of these epitopes on the spike protein, the protruding component of the Sars-Cov-2 that plays the main role in infection.Omicron, they contend, has the largest proportion of mutations in epitopes recognised by B cell (which turn into antibodies) at 30.91%, followed by Gamma at 15.34%, Beta 12.98% and Delta at 11.12%. In other words, it means Omicron has over twice the number of changes in a portion of its structure as Gamma and Beta, the two most resistant variants seen till now.The optimistic way to look at this is that close to 70% of the epitopes to which our immune system remembers making antibodies for is unchanged, suggesting there will still be substantial protection, even if that protection is significantly reduced.In addition to B Cells, there are T cells, which turn into killer cells that destroy infected cells and stop them from making more copies of the virus. The Italian scientists said the mutations affect 27.3% of the epitopes recognised by T cells – again, significantly higher than the rest. But close to 73% of the T cell epitopes are still unchanged.Other implicationsThe study also offers some scientific insight into how many of the epitopes they analysed have more implications than just immunity. The authors, from the Polytechnic University of Milan, note in their report that many of the mutations can also impact other traits of the virus, such as transmission, infectivity, virulence, and the stability of the virus’s spike protein itself. Many of the changes they see in Omicron are predicted to heighten or lower these traits.This could, theoretically, explain why the virus can become more transmissible while also becoming less virulent (that is, cause milder disease).Over the coming week, watch this space for two key metrics that are likely to be available: the drop in neutralisation potency of antibodies resulting from vaccination or past infection, and hospitalisation trends.
07-12-2021||India||MP: VHP, Bajrang Dal vandalise school alleging conversions of 8 students||Members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal on Monday vandalised a missionary school in Ganjbasoda area of Vidisha following a video showing a prayer meeting being held and news of alleged conversion of eight children in the school went viral on social media, the police said. Police registered a case against four identified VHP members and 50 unidentified members of Bajrang Dal under section 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon) and 427 (causing damage to the amount more than ₹50) of Indian Penal Code, said BB Sharma, sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP), Ganjbasoda, Vidisha. Four identified persons have been detained by the police. The SDOP said, “The members of the different organisations, including VHP and Bajrang Dal, had announced to hold a protest against an alleged conversion of eight children at St Joseph School. On Monday, people handed over a memorandum to sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and later, the mob turned violent and pelted the school premises with stones.” VHP regional president Rajesh Tiwari said, “The members of VHP and Bajrang Dal were holding peaceful protest but anti-social elements joined in and created ruckus.” The Saint Joseph church denied all allegations. “This fake news was spread by some Youtube channel. The news of holy communion of eight Catholic children was circulated as the conversion of Hindu children.”

Earlier, the petitioner’s senior counsel alleged that the Centre was initiating penal action as per the provisions of the Rules, even though the Bombay High Court had granted an interim stay of the Rules a couple of months ago.The Bombay High Court had on August 14 this year stayed the operation of sub-rules (1) and (3) of Rule 9 of the said Rules of 2021.The Kerala High Court had also passed a similar order restraining the Centre from taking any action, he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-take-coercive-action-under-new-it-rules-madras-high-court-tells-centre-101638816169472.html
07-12-2021||India||Nagaland killings: Home minister Amit Shah expresses regret||Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday expressed regret over the killing of 14 civilians in Nagaland by security forces and informed Parliament that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted to probe the “unfortunate incident” that occurred on Saturday has been directed to complete the investigation within a month. He also said the firing was a consequence of “mistaken identity”.“The Government of India sincerely regrets this unfortunate incident in Nagaland and expresses its deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives,” Shah said while making a statement in both the Houses.As a united Opposition mounted pressure on the government to make a statement about the incident that threatens to snowball into a political embarrassment for the government and cast a shadow on the ongoing Naga Peace Accord, Shah said the union government is keeping a close watch on the evolving situation and necessary measures are being taken as per requirement to ensure peace and tranquility in the region.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also chaired a meeting with senior cabinet ministers including Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to assess the situation; National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval is also learnt to have briefed the PM in Parliament.“The state authorities, as a precautionary measure, have promulgated prohibitory orders in the affected areas,” Shah said amid sloganeering by the opposition members in both Houses.Giving details of the encounter, Shah said that based on inputs received by the Indian Army about movement of the insurgents near Tiru village in Tizit area of Mon district, a team of 21st Para (special forces) commandos of Indian Army laid an ambush in the evening of December 4. “…During the ambush, a vehicle approached the location and it was signalled to stop. However, the vehicle tried to flee, following which the vehicle, suspected of carrying insurgents, was fired upon resulting in killing of 6 out of 8 persons travelling in the vehicle. However, it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity. The two persons who sustained injuries were evacuated to the medical facilities by the Army personnel,” he said.Referring to how the casualties escalated, Shah said local villagers surrounded the Army team, burnt two vehicles and assaulted them resulting in death of one Security Force personnel and injuries to several others on hearing the news of the killing.“For their own safety and to disperse the crowd, the security forces had to open fire which resulted in killing of 7 more civilians and injuring some others. The local administration and police have tried to defuse the situation, which remains tense but under control,” he said.The Opposition, however, did not relent.In the Lok Sabha, the opposition members wanted to a detailed discussion on the issue and also demanded that Prime Minister, Narendra Modi be present in the House. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said that the opposition was not satisfied with Shah’s statement and so staged a walkout.“The home minister came and replied with a very short reply and when we were asking for clarification, we were not allowed…We were not satisfied with the reply of the home minister. Therefore the opposition- Congress and DMK and other alliance partners- walked out in protest against the reply of the home minister,” he said.In the Rajya Sabha, Leader of the Opposition, Mallkarjun Kharge described the incidents as “horrendous” and demanded a statement by the minister. “There has been a very serious and most tragic development in which six innocent civilians were killed on December, 4 by security forces in the area of Tiru, in Mon District of Nagaland, mistaking them for militants. This horrific war sight led to clashes with security forces resulting in reportedly death of eight more civilians and one security personnel,” he said.Later when while Shah gave an account of the incident and the ensuing events in the Upper House the opposition was in the well of the house, sloganeering.“…In the evening of December 5, a mob of approximately 250 tried to ransack the Company Operating Base (CoB) of Assam Rifles at Mon town. The mob burnt buildings of the CoB following which troops had to open fire to disperse the mob. Resultantly, one civilian was killed while another was injured. More forces have been deployed in the area to prevent any further untoward incident,” Shah said.Oppositions MPs and chief ministers of Nagaland, Neiphiu Rio and Conrad Sangma of Sikkim also sought the removal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) from the state. While the government remained tight lipped on the issue, Shah informed Parliament that review meetings were held between top officials of the government and the security forces to ensure that normalcy is restored at the earliest. “It was decided that all agencies should ensure that no such unfortunate incident recurs in future while undertaking operations against insurgents,” he said.Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi who will be part of the panel delegated by the Congress to report on Nagaland said, “The events create an atmosphere of distrust and it sets the Naga Peace negotiations back. It creates a divide between the people and the institutions of the government. In the past there have been clashes between police in Assam and Manipur and now Nagaland.”The MP from Assam said since this is the first session after clashes in Manipur and Nagaland, the opposition wants the government to look at the events comprehensively. “We have a hostile neighbour in the East, we are aware of external influences so we expect a reply…” he said.
07-12-2021||India||Modi, Putin discuss trade, Afghanistan, vow to boost relations||India and Russia on Monday agreed to enhance cooperation and coordination on bilateral and multilateral issues, including trade and investment and the situation in Afghanistan, as the two sides signed 28 agreements during the annual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin.Defence cooperation, for long a key pillar of the India-Russia strategic partnership, was a prominent part of the summit and the maiden 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers. The two sides inked an agreement on the programme for defence cooperation during 2021-31 and concluded a deal for India’s procurement of more than 600,000 AK-203 assault rifles to be made a new joint venture.Both sides have set a target of increasing bilateral trade to $30 billion and bilateral investments to $50 billion by 2025, and Modi and Putin discussed ways to enhance economic cooperation, including through long-term procurement of essential commodities from Russia, elimination of trade barriers, and connectivity options such as the International North South Trade Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor.The two countries will also look at long-term cooperation and arrangements for energy, inland waterways, civilian shipbuilding, fertilisers, steel, coking coal, and supply of skilled manpower.In his televised opening remarks at the summit, Modi said India-Russia friendship has “remained a constant” despite many fundamental changes on the world stage and the two countries cooperated closely while paying attention to each other’s sensitivities.Putin, in his opening address, described India as a “great power” and a time-tested friend, and said Russia works with India in the military-technical field “in a way that we do not work with any of our partners”.Modi and Putin decided to continue close consultations and coordination on the situation in Afghanistan, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla told a media briefing the two sides will work for a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan with an inclusive government representing all sections of society.“Both sides were also very clear that Afghanistan’s territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing any acts of terrorism,” Shringla said. Even as the two sides coordinate on drug trafficking and other concerns emanating from Afghanistan, they will work jointly on providing humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.There was a lot of emphasis on counterterrorism, an area of common interest, and a “joint sense” on dealing with terrorist entities active in the neighbourhood, such as Islamic State, al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Shringla said. Both sides stressed the need to address cross-border terrorism, sought action against UN-designated terror groups, and called for strengthening the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the UN office for counterterrorism, he added.A joint statement issued after the summit said: “Both sides strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and urged the international community to intensify cooperation against terrorism including safe havens, terror financing, arms and drugs trafficking, radicalisation and malicious use of ICTs to spread extremist, terrorist and other illegal content.”The joint statement specifically referred to Islamic State, al Qaeda and LeT in the context of preventing Afghan soil from being used for terrorist activities, and called for ensuring that “Afghanistan would never become a safe haven for global terrorism”.Among the 28 pacts signed by government and private entities was the “Agreement on Program of the Military-Technical Cooperation from 2021-2031”, a plan outlining ongoing and future defence cooperation. Such agreements have been signed since 1994.Following talks between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoigu, a contract was signed for India procuring 601,427 AK-203 rifles through the joint venture Indo-Russian Rifles Private Limited.The other agreements covered diverse fields such as trade, energy, intellectual property, accountancy, cyberattacks in the banking sector, manpower, geological exploration and surveys, culture and education.Among them were a roadmap for science, technology and innovation cooperation, a memorandum of cooperation (MoU) in intellectual property, an agreement on technology protection due to cooperation in research and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and building and operation of launch vehicles and ground-based space infrastructure, an MoU between India’s Opto-Electronics Factory and Rosoboronexport, and a crude oil supply agreement between Indian Oil Corporation and Rosneft.Shringla said the two sides put off the signing of the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics (RELOS) agreement “for some time” as there are “still some issues we need to discuss”. It had been expected the agreement, which will allow militaries of the two nations to access support facilities at each other’s bases, would be signed during the summit.India’s dragging standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is understood to have figured in the 2+2 dialogue. Without naming China, defence minister Singh said in his opening remarks at the meeting that India is grappling with challenges arising from the “extraordinary militarisation” of its neighbourhood and “unprovoked aggression” on the northern border, and the country seeks partners who are responsive to its military requirements.“The pandemic, the extraordinary militarisation and expansion of armament in our neighbourhood and the unprovoked aggression on our northern border since early summer of 2020 have thrown in several challenges,” Singh said.“Recognising that its development needs are colossal and that its defence challenges are legitimate, real and immediate, India seeks partners who are sensitive and responsive to India’s expectations and requirements,” he added.Talking to the media after the 2+2 dialogue, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the India-Russia deal for S-400 air defence systems is being implemented despite US attempts to “undermine this cooperation”. He said the Russian side raised its concerns about “Indo-Pacific strategies” and “non-inclusive blocs” such as AUKUS during the talks.Shringla told the media briefing that the 2+2 dialogue had extensively discussed the Indo-Pacific and India’s security concerns. India is currently cooperating extensively with Russia in areas that involve the region, such as the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor, and also extending cooperation in the Indian Ocean, he said.Asked about possible US sanctions on the S-400 deal, Shringla said: “I think there was a sense that the S-400 is a legacy contract going back to 2018...Supplies have begun this month and will continue to happen.” He added both India and Russia conduct an independent foreign policy and there is no “need to look at our relationship in the light of any other relationship that is there”.
07-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: December 7, 1955 — Citizenship Bill passed by Lok Sabha||New Delhi- The Lok Sabha today passed the Citizenship Bill which provides for the acquisition and termination of Indian citizenship.During discussion on the remaining clauses of the Bill today the House accepted an amendment to Clause 5 with the result that the provision with regard to acquisition of the right by displaced persons was liberalized.Displaced persons, especially those from East Bengal, can acquire Indian citizenship by registration if they have been resident in India for a period of six months before the date of application for citizenship. The original clause provided for a 12 month period.During the debate on the clause, members had criticized the one year provision saying that some of the displaced persons might be deprived of their voting rights.DIVISION DEMANDEDDuring clausewise discussion, the Opposition demanded a division on Clause 11 which relates to Commonwealth citizenship. It was obviously a symbolic opposition because Clause 2, which also relates to Commonwealth citizenship, had been passed earlier. The division was lost by them by 26 to 128. Cries of “shame, shame” however were heard from the Opposition benches.Also during the passage of the First Schedule, which contains the names of the Commonwealth countries, there was a demand for division from them on Mr Kamath’s amendment to include in the list the names of Burma, Nepal, Bhutan and Afghanistan. The amendment was negatived.INSURANCE BILLThe House then took up the Insurance Amendment Bill which seeks to safeguard policy-holders’ money by giving the Government adequate powers to deal with the delinquent companies.The Bill replaces an Ordinance which the Government issued recently after investigations were started by them into the alleged irregularities in the working of the Bharat Insurance Co, which subsequently was placed by the Government under an Administrator.The discussion on the Bill had an unexpected start. Immediately after Mr M. C. Shah, Minister for Revenue and Civil Expenditure, moved it with a brief openings speech, Mr Firoze Gandhi (Cong.) spoke for nearly two hours, cheers punctuating the member’s maiden speech at frequent intervals.Mr F. Gandhi made serious allegations against the working of the Bharat Insurance Co. and a large number of associate companies and concluded with a demand that the Government should appoint a judicial commission to inquire into the affairs of the entire “ Dalmia Jain group of Industries ‘ right from the beginning. At one stage, when the Deputy Speaker inquired as to how a detailed account by Mr Gandhi of the transactions of other firms owned by Mr Dalmia was relevent, the Finance Minister. Mr Deshmukh rose to say: “ Sir, I believe Mr Gandhi is trying to portray the background against which legislation of this kind (Insurance Amendment Bills becomes necessary where the finances of industrial concerns, banks and insurance companies are inextricably mixed together by a person with more than ordinary capacity to intermix them.” Earlier. Mr Shah explained the circumstances in which the ordinance had been issued, It was found necessary, he said, that the Administrator appointed for the insurance company should have powers to prevent the delinquent, responsible for the loss of policyholders’ money, from disposing of his properties or transferring them to some other person for in that case even a decree obtained against the delinquent would not be effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-december-7-1955-citizenship-bill-passed-by-lok-sabha-101638816050125.html

07-12-2021||India||Afspa is damaging image of India: CMs of Nagaland and Meghalaya call for repeal||Kohima/New Delhi: The chief ministers of Nagaland and Meghalaya on Monday asked the central government to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958 (AFSPA), which protects armed forces from prosecution for killings in disturbed areas. The demand follows the killing of 14 civilians by defence forces in Nagaland’s Mon district on Saturday and Sunday. The Nagaland government wants the longstanding AFSPA to be repealed, chief minister Neiphiu Rio said.“AFSPA is damaging the image of our country, which is the world’s largest democracy,” Rio said at the funeral services for the dead civilians in Mon on Monday. Authorities will pursue justice for the killed civilians, the chief minister said, adding that a case has been booked against the special operations team of the Indian Army.Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma backed Rio. “AFSPA should be repealed,” Sangma tweeted.Later in a video message, he said his party has opposed the AFSPA since the days of his father and former Lok Sabha speaker P A Sangma. “AFSPA has not given any results. In fact, its enforcement has proved to be counterproductive. There are many ways to deal with (insurgency) issues. AFSPA is not the way. Repeal the draconian law,” the National People’s Party leader said. Both Rio and Sangma are part of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance that is in power in the two northeastern states, and at the Centre. AFSPA is in force in several northeastern states, home to some insurgent groups, and in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the law, local police need prior approval of the central government to prosecute army or paramilitary forces in civilian courts.The Army has constituted a court of inquiry into the incident when six coal miners were killed in an ambush by special forces looking for insurgents. The killings led to violent protests by villagers, who torched three army vehicles.The soldiers responded with gunfire, killing seven more people, officials said. One soldier was also killed in the clash. In a protest on Sunday, one more civilian was killed when an irate mob tried to set fire to an Assam rifles camp in Mon town. Some of the 11 injured civilians, are said to be in serious condition. People in Nagaland have been demanding the repeal of the 1958 law for years, and several human rights organisations have called the act draconian.The killing of insurgents has been declining in Nagaland, with just two deaths in 2018, official data show. No deaths of insurgents in clashes with security forces were reported in 2017 and 2016. Four deaths were reported in 2015 and three in 2014. Since 2001, the highest number of insurgents reported to be killed in Nagaland was 53, the data showed.In Nagaland, insurgency started in the mid-1950s, with rebels seeking an independent homeland. They have watered down their demand, and have agreed to reach a solution under the Constitution. However, a final agreement is yet to be reached. The demand for the repeal of AFSPA echoed in Parliament during a debate over the latest Nagaland troubles. Home minister Amit Shah should immediately call a meeting of all chief ministers of northeastern states, Trinamool Congress leader in Rajya Sabha Sushmita Dev demanded. The problems related to AFSPA should be resolved through dialogue, she said.“It is imperative that the Centre set up a committee to see if AFSPA is working in this country or not, Dev said. The killing of civilians in Nagaland has put a question mark over the Act.” In 2019, Kiren Rijiju, who was then junior home minister, said in a written reply in Lok Sabha that there was no proposal to repeal AFSPA. Rijiju hails from Arunachal Pradesh in the northeast.  AFSPA is in force in Assam, Nagaland and Manipur (except the Imphal municipal area), in three districts of Arunachal Pradesh (Tirap, Changlang and Longding) and areas under the jurisdiction of eight police stations in the districts of Arunachal Pradesh that border Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afspa-is-damaging-image-of-india-cms-of-nagaland-and-meghalaya-call-for-repeal-101638815569350.html
07-12-2021||India||Major General to head probe into Nagaland civilian killings||The Indian Army has set up a court of inquiry under a major general to look into the killing of civilians in a botched counter-insurgency operation in Nagaland’s Mon district on Saturday, officials familiar with the matter said on Monday. The two-star officer is posted in the country’s northeast.Fourteen civilians were killed in two separate firing incidents. In the first incident, army personnel gunned down six coal miners after mistaking them to be insurgents. Soon after, angry villagers reached the spot and set ablaze security vehicles, sparking off another round of firing by the forces in which seven villagers and one soldier died. On Sunday, a 14th civilian died when a mob attacked an army camp.The operation was carried out by a special forces unit of the army, which laid an ambush after receiving intelligence inputs on the movement of militant cadres in the area.“The incident in Nagaland has been a tragic mistake. The army has been open in its admission and ordered an inquiry. It would be good if the inquiry is quickly concluded and there is transparency about its findings, otherwise credibility is lost,” said former Northern Army commander Lt General DS Hooda (retd).The unfortunate incident should have never taken place, said Lt General Shokin Chauhan, who retired last year as the chairman of the Ceasefire Monitoring Group responsible for implementing ceasefire ground rules between the Centre and Naga insurgent groups.“If you continue to allow insurgency to fester and not bring the peace process to conclusion, such incidents are likely to happen. I feel there should be full disclosure and justice should be meted out,” said Chauhan. He also highlighted the need to take review standard operating procedures so that such incidents do not take place again.The gunning down of civilians renewed the demand for the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) from the state. The Act, which grants special powers to the forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas”, has been a contentious issue in the state, with civil society members saying that it gives security personnel impunity to carry out excesses and forces saying that it helps them maintain order in restive areas.Linking this incident with AFSPA is not entirely correct, and the issue of the continuation of the Act or otherwise needs to be holistically viewed keeping in mind the overall security environment, and not based on individual incidents, Hooda added.AFSPA bestows sweeping powers on security forces and prohibits prosecutions from being initiated without a go-ahead from the Centre if the allegations are linked to the public duty of the accused.The Nagaland government on Sunday banned mobile internet and SMS services in the region to curb “circulation of inflammatory videos, pictures or text.”A notification issued by the state home department banning the services alluded to the “apprehension of grave law and order problems” in the district and said: “Short Message Service (SMS), WhatsApp, Facebook, and other social media platforms could be used for spreading of rumours, fake news, and for circulating inflammatory texts, pictures, videos etc. which may inflame passions and thus exacerbate the law-and-order situation.”The incident has focused attention on the security situation in the northeast and the conduct of counter-insurgency operations by security forces. It comes weeks after armed militants ambushed an Assam Rifles convoy near the porous India-Myanmar border in Manipur’s Churachandpur district, killing five soldiers, including a colonel, his wife and their eight-year-old son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-general-to-head-probe-into-nagaland-civilian-killings-101638815334571.html
07-12-2021||India||Nagaland police FIR says army fired with‘intention to murder, injure civilians’||Nagaland police has registered a case on its own against the 21st para special forces for killing 13 civilians suspecting them as militants at Tiru-Oting area of Mon district in Nagaland 48 hours ago.The incident happened on December 4 afternoon when coal miners of Oting village were returning home from Tiru on a pickup truck, police stated.“On reaching at Langkhao between Upper Tiru and Oting village, security forces fired at the vehicle without any provocation, resulting to the killing of many Oting villagers and seriously injured many others,” according to the first information report (FIR) lodged at Tizit police station. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.At the time of the incident, there was no police guide for the security forces, nor did the security forces make any requisition to the police station to provide a guide for their operation, the FIR mentioned.“Hence, it is obvious that the intention of the security forces is to murder and injure civilians,” the FIR said while registering a case for necessary action against the culprits.The director general of police (DGP) of Nagaland and commissioner Nagaland, who visited the site of the firing on Sunday, have submitted a spot report on the sequence of events to the state government.The Nagaland government has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the firing. Home minister Amit Shah made statements in both houses of Parliament, saying that the army has regretted the incident, the FIR on the firing has been transferred to the state crime police station and will be investigated by a SIT, and that the Union government regrets the incident.The incident happened when the army laid an ambush for insurgents on the basis of intelligence inputs, and when the vehicle with the workers neared the spot and was asked to stop, it tried to flee, resulting in the firing that killed six of the eight people in the vehicle, Shah said in the statement in Parliament.Another seven civilians were killed when angry villages surrounded the army team, burnt two vehicles and assaulted them, resulting in the death of one soldier and forcing the team to fire at the crowd. The home minister termed the killing of the workers a case of mistaken identity.The army has launched an investigation into the matter.The security forces personnel tried to hide the dead bodies of the six villagers by wrapping and loading them in a pickup truck other than the one on which the villagers were travelling, according to the report by the DGP and the commissioner. HT has seen a copy of the reportThe report said on December 4 evening, eight villagers were returning home from coal mining work at Tiru in an open pickup truck, when they were killed by security forces ( 21 Para Special Force based in Assam), without any attempt at identification.Six of them were killed on the spot, leaving two critically injured. The incident happened some few kilometers away from Oting village.“On hearing the gunshots, the villagers went to the spot being apprehensive that the individuals did not return home from work. On reaching the spot, they found the pickup truck and the Special Forces Personnel trying to hide the dead bodies of the six villagers by wrapping and loading them in another pickup truck (Tata Mobile) apparently with the intention of taking the dead bodies to their base camp,” the report added.After seeing the dead bodies in the vehicle, the report said, violence broke out between the villagers and the security personnel where the irate villagers burnt three vehicles belonging to the security personnel.“In the melee, the security personnel again opened fire against the villagers, which led to the death of 7 (seven) more villagers and eyewitnesses have confirmed that the Special Forces Personnel opened fire indiscriminately as they fled from the scene towards Assam side even firing on the coal mine hutments on the way,” the spot report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-police-fir-says-army-unit-fired-with-intention-to-murder-injure-civilians-101638815153927.html
07-12-2021||India||Funeral of 14 civilians held as protests continue in Nagaland||Hundreds of mourners joined Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio to pay their last respect to the 14 civilians shot dead by security personnel during a botched ambush and a subsequent confrontation with local villagers on Saturday and Sunday.An elite military commando unit shot dead six coal miners returning to their homes in Mon district of Nagaland state on Saturday, believing they were targeting insurgents.The army has said the miners were killed after they laid an ambush following “credible intelligence” about an armed insurgent group moving in the area. When asked to stop, the pickup truck carrying the miners sought to flee, resulting in a mix-up based on mistaken identity, Union home minister Amit Shah told Parliament on Monday.Another eight people were killed by troops when they were confronted by a furious crowd across two separate incidents, with a soldier also being killed and army vehicles being set ablaze.Hundreds of locals carried the victims’ coffins to the helipad ground in Mon district to conduct prayers, as a curfew imposed on Sunday was lifted partially during the three-hour public funeral. “Curfew was lifted specifically for the locality where the funeral was held,” deputy commissioner Mon Thavaseelan K said.On Monday, for the second day, street protests and candle light marches were held across the state for the victims. A police officer described the ground situation as “tense but under control”.A six-hour shutdown called by Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) to protest the killing passed off peacefully, despite minor skirmishes between students and security forces in some places.The shutdown was to protest the shooting down of civilians and in solidarity with the family of victims, NSF president Kegwayhun Tep and general secretary Siipuni Ng Philo told reporters.They said the purpose of the bandh was to display the grief, anger and sentiments of the Naga people. The people of the state have every right to defend what they have, they added.During the six-hour shutdown, the NSF put up banners and placards, some of which read “We stand in solidarity with our Naga brethrens – the innocent civilians who were brutally killed at Oting village, Mon district,” and “Nagas have every right to live in peace.”In Mokokchung district, the Ao Students Conference, condemning the “massacre of innocent civilians,” held a silent procession demanding justice and revocation of Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the law that gives armed forces extraordinary powers in so-called disturbed areas. The Dimapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries enforced a total shutdown in capital Dimapur for 12 hours, and Lotha Hoho, a community grouping, imposed a bandh in Wokha district.Addressing a mass funeral service held in Mon for the 14 victims of the armed forces, chief minister Rio said the state continues to be declared a “disturbed state” every year due to the vexed Naga political issue and insurgency.Commenting on the killing of the 14 civilians, Rio asked people to have faith in the state government and said the special investigation team will probe every angle and action will be taken. He assured people that protection under AFSPA will not apply.“The army has admitted that they made a mistake and the whole world is watching the developments,” he said.The chief minister also mentioned that the commander of the army’s 3 Corps headquarters personally asked him to convey to the Naga people that the army will also be conducting a proper inquiry into the shooting and punish the guilty.The sacrifice made by 14 innocent Konyak Naga brothers will never be forgotten and December 4 and 5 will remain black days for all Nagas, Rio said, referring to a decision of the Konyak Union (the apex tribal body of the district), which declared that the two days would be observed as black days every year.The chief minister also announced Rs.5 lakh as compensation to the victims’ families. The Central government will give ₹11 lakh to the families of each of the dead, he added. The government would provide jobs to one person from the families of the victims, the chief minister promised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/funeral-of-14-civilians-held-as-protests-continue-in-nagaland-101638814969790.html
07-12-2021||India||S-400 deal is on despite US objections, says Russia||The deal between India and Russia for S-400 air defence systems is being implemented despite the US attempts to “undermine this cooperation”, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.India and Russia are on the same page on the situation in Afghanistan as both sides want the Taliban to deliver on commitments to form an inclusive government and prevent terrorism and instability from spilling over into neighbouring countries, Lavrov said.Talking to the media after the maiden India-Russia 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers, Lavrov said the Russian side raised its concerns about “Indo-Pacific strategies” and “non-inclusive blocs” such as AUKUS, the defence alliance between Australia, the UK and the US, during the talks.“The S-400 deal doesn’t have only symbolic meaning, it has a very important practical meaning for Indian defence capability and the situation is basically underway. The deal is being implemented,” he said, referring to the $5.4-billion deal signed by India to acquire five S-400 systems. “We witnessed attempts on the part of the US to undermine this cooperation and make India obey the American orders to follow the American vision of how this region should be developed. Our Indian friends clearly and firmly explained that they are a sovereign country and they will decide on whose weapons to buy and who is going to be a partner of India in this and the other areas,” he said. Russia-India ties are a “specially privileged strategic partnership” and Monday’s meeting of a bilateral military technical commission is a “manifestation that this cooperation is in the interest of both countries”, Lavrov added. Russia continues to be a key supplier of military hardware to India, which has diversified arms purchases in recent years by acquiring combat jets, helicopters and advanced weapons from the US, France and Israel. The US has threatened to impose sanctions on the S-400 deal under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), but India has said its defence procurements are guided by a policy of strategic autonomy. The delivery of the first S-400 system to India coincided with President Vladimir Putin’s visit for an annual summit. Lavrov said the situation in Afghanistan was discussed at the 2+2 meeting. “We share the view [with India] that the Taliban must deliver on their commitments to ensure an inclusive government structure and respect human rights, prevent the drug threat and the terrorist threat remaining in the country, and prevent instability from spilling over from Afghanistan into neighbouring countries, primarily into Central Asia,” he said. Russia is opposed to any attempts by the US or NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) to shift forces withdrawn from Afghanistan to neighbouring countries, and the Central Asian states have said this will be unacceptable, Lavrov said. India and Russia also agreed to work closely together, including within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), to coordinate their actions on Afghanistan. Lavrov, who has for long been critical of the Indo-Pacific concept, said the Russian side had focused at the 2+2 meeting on developments in Asia-Pacific, where “elements of instability have been accumulating which could undermine the universal framework of cooperation”. He added, “We expressed our concern about the activities taking place in this region under the slogan of Indo-Pacific strategies, where we see non-inclusive blocs. The latest example is AUKUS, a military-technical alliance between the US, Great Britain and Australia and there are a lot of questions on the plans to supply to Australia or make in Australia nuclear-powered submarines.” Lavrov questioned whether these plans comply with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) norms and non-proliferation rules. “From a regional perspective, to what extent will Australia stick to its obligation on the nuclear weapons-free zones in the Southern Pacific?” he said. The Indian side, Lavrov contended, “distanced themselves from the AUKUS bloc”. He said, “They are part of the Quad group, which brings together India, Japan, Australia and the US, and India...emphasises its interest in economic infrastructure and transport projects within this framework.” 
07-12-2021||India||Supreme Court stays 27% OBC reservation in Maharashtra local body elections||Local body polls in Maharashtra will be held without reservation for other backward classes (OBC), the Supreme Court ordered on Monday, while rebuking the state government for introducing 27% reservation for OBCs through an ordinance two months ago without collecting data.The decision of the court would affect 567 seats out of a total of 2,100 for which elections were announced by the state election commission (SEC) on November 24. Tuesday is the last day for filing nominations.“The election for the concerned local bodies in respect of reserved seats for backward classes shall remain stayed till further orders,” a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said. “SEC shall not notify reserved seats for OBCs for any election, either mid-term or any other general election, until further orders.” The order came on separate petitions by Kisanrao Kundalikrao Gawali, a former legislator in the state assembly, and Rahul Ramesh Wagh, a social worker. The requirement of collecting empirical data as a precondition for providing OBC reservation in Maharashtra’s local body elections was laid down by the Supreme Court on March 4. This judgment directed the state government to set up a dedicated commission to examine backwardness and extent of OBC population in each municipal council. On June 29, a commission was constituted for this purpose, but since this exercise would take time, the state issued an ordinance by amending provisions in two legislations – Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act and the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961.Taking exception to the haste shown by the state to introduce the ordinance, the bench remarked, “Your political compulsions cannot be the basis to undo our judgment….You should have waited for the data to be compiled by the commission.” The collection of data is an exhaustive exercise and, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was expected to take a long time, said lawyer Shekhar Naphade, appearing for the state.The state had filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding census data on OBCs, he informed the court. This petition is still pending consideration and is expected to be heard on December 13. The court ordered the present petitions to be heard along with that matter next Monday.The state argued against a stay, saying it would mean that OBCs will be unrepresented. The bench, however, said, “You have created this problem. Our judgment was very clear, asking you to get data and provide reservation for municipal council wise. You have overturned our judgment with this process.” Reservation for OBCs can be justified only by collecting data, lawyer Vikas Singh argued on behalf of the petitioners. “What this court set aside has been reintroduced by the ordinance, except with a rider of 50% on total reservation,” Singh said. He said that if this ordinance was stayed, the 567 seats will be filled up by general category candidates.The two petitions filed through advocate Chandra Prakash and Hrikesh Chitley said, “The foremost requirement (for providing OBC reservation) is to collate adequate materials or documents that could help in identification of OBCs for the purpose of reservation by conducting a contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness in the local bodies concerned through an independent dedicated Commission.”The petitioners had earlier approached the Bombay high court challenging the ordinance. On November 18, the high court issued notice on their petitions, but did not grant any stay. Later, when the SEC notification announcing the election process was put out, the petitioners approached the apex court, seeking urgent stay of the ordinance and its effect in the present local body polls.The court also pulled up the SEC for announcing the election schedule. “When the matter was before the court, you (SEC) could have taken permission,” it said. By two notifications of November 24 and November 26, the schedule for elections to 15 panchayat samitis in the districts of Bhandara and Gondia and 105 nagar panchayats throughout the state was declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-27-obc-reservation-in-maharashtra-local-body-elections-101638814550405.html
07-12-2021||India||India, Russia finalise AK-203 deal, renew 10-year pact: Officials||India and Russia on Monday concluded a much-awaited ₹5,100-crore deal to jointly produce more than 600,000 AK-203 assault rifles at a facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi district to advance self-reliance in defence manufacturing, officials said. The deal was finalised at the 20th meeting of India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) led by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoigu. The two countries also renewed their military-technical cooperation arrangement for 2021-31, the officials said, requesting anonymity. The IRIGC-M&MTC meeting took place ahead of the annual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. The government had on Saturday announced that it had cleared the plan to manufacture AK-203 rifles in Uttar Pradesh in a joint venture called Indo-Russian Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL) that was formed by Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited and Munitions India Limited, and Russia’s Rosoboronexport and Kalashnikov. The Indian and the Russian entities hold a share capital of 50.5% and 49.5%, respectively. Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited and Munitions India Limited are two of the seven defence firms carved out of the erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board in October. Singh described Russia as India’s long-standing special and privileged strategic partner, adding the relations between the two countries were time-tested and based on shared interests in multilateralism and global peace and prosperity. He said the close cooperation with Russia was not targeted against another country. “We hope that our cooperation will bring peace, prosperity and stability to the entire region,” the defence minister said. The AK-203 rifles will replace INSAS rifles inducted more than three decades ago. “The contract ends the long quest of Indian Army to replace the aging INSAS rifles with a modern weapon. The AK-203 assault rifle with proven technology will enhance the combat potential of soldiers to adequately meet present and future operational challenges,” said a senior government official. The 7.62mm X 39mm caliber AK-203 rifle has an effective range of 300 metre. AK-203 is a reliable weapon with reduced flash and recoil, better ergonomics and other modern features, and it will boost the morale of soldiers, he added. The agreement envisages the production of 601,247 rifles, of which the first 70,000 will be made with transfer of technology from Kalashnikov to IRRPL. The remaining 531,000 rifles will be fully indigenous, the officials said. The entire lot of 601,247 rifles will be produced in 10 years, they added. India and Russia signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for the AK-203 project in February 2018. “The Kalashnikov series weapons are the simplest to operate, they are tested weapons and the metallurgy is one of the best.
