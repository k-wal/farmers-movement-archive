26-12-2021||Noida||Over 15,000 birds flock to Okhla bird sanctuary, more to arrive if mercury dips||The drop in the temperatures over the past week has created a conducive environment for the arrival of more birds at the Okhla bird sanctuary with officials stating that about 15,000 birds, even of the migratory species, have been spotted in the area. Officials said the count of birds is increasing every day and it is expected that about 20,000 birds will be flocking to the water body in the next 10 days. Some of the visitors so far include herons, cormorants, terns, kingfishers, coots, gulls, painted stork, common porchard, Oriental darter, stork, greater flamingo, spoonbill, Indian black ibis, green sandpiper, pied avocet and pied stilt among several others. Over 20 migratory species have been spotted at the bird sanctuary so far.“Winter started a bit late, so the migration of birds also got delayed. In a few more days, we are expecting more birds of different species to arrive here. As the temperature drops further, the water body will become a home to a myriad of birds,” said P K Srivastava, divisional forest officer. T K Roy, an avid birder and ecologist, said, “Okhla bird sanctuary has one of the richest birding habitats but the routine maintenance has been poor. Because of the delayed winter, migration of birds has been slow but the authorities have been slower with upkeep with of the sanctuary. While the water hyacinth should have been cleared by September, it took all of October to do it. The bird population is slowly rising, but other habitats like Surajpur are in better condition. We’ll know about how many birds have come during the census.” The bird sanctuary is open to visitors from 7.30am to 5pm daily. The bird sanctuary now also has golf carts, a canteen, and a new bamboo bridge to reach the watchtower for the convenience of visitors. The footfall has increased in the past few days with about 200-odd people visiting the sanctuary daily. The footfall increases to about 500 on holidays and weekends. According to officials, the sanctuary had the maximum footfall of 800 visitors on Saturday, the day Christmas was observed. Siddharth Arya, who recently paid a visit to the sanctuary, said, “We went a bit late but still managed to see many birds. It was great fun and a good place to spend time with children. My whole family liked the place as it was quiet. The authorities should probably have more golf carts or rickshaws to ferry people from one end to the other. It would be really helpful for even those who have difficulty walking.”Meanwhile, the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) will also be held at three locations in Gautam Budh Nagar—Surajpur wetland (December 5) and Dhanauri wetland (December 4) in Greater Noida and Okhla bird sanctuary (December 7) in Noida. AWC is the largest annual waterbird census in Asia of the Wetlands International conducted by the WI South Asia and Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The AWC will be carried out throughout Asia between January 1 and 16. AWC in NCR-Delhi is being carried out at seven major wetlands, including the three in Gautam Budh Nagar. “AWC is part of the global International Waterbird Census (IWC). AWC is carried out simultaneously across Asia and Australasia by a national network of volunteers in coordination with the AWC state coordinators to record the status of the wetland’s habitat, water bird species diversity and population estimates based on the international protocol and methodology,” said Roy, who is also the AWC Delhi state coordinator, Wetlands International. In India, AWC is carried out at a few hundred listed important wetlands. AWC data helps to promote the designation and management of internationally important sites such as nationally and locally protected areas, Ramsar Sites, Central Asian Site Network for Siberian Cranes and other Waterbirds, World Heritage Sites, Import Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-15-000-birds-flock-to-okhla-bird-sanctuary-more-to-arrive-if-mercury-dips-101640542840446.html
26-12-2021||Pune||16.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses given in state till December 25||PUNE Over 16.4 million doses administered so far, Maharashtra’s vaccination may touch 20 million in December,Maharashtra has, till December 25, administered at least 16.4 million (1.64 crore) Covid-19 vaccine doses, which is a sharp rise compared to the past two months, according to the Central government’s CoWin dashboard. The rise in inoculations is mostly due to local administration in various districts making vaccine doses mandatory for people to be able to access various services. People have also shed a hesitancy in the light of a fresh threat emerging from Omicron variant. With a few days remaining for December to end, state may reach the milestone of administering 20 million doses in a month, considering the daily average of 600,000 to 800,000 shots being administered. Earlier in September, at least 20.2 million shots were administered in the state. Of the administered total vaccine doses in December, 5,154,120 are first doses and 11,268,352 are second doses. Till Saturday, a total of 130,937,956 doses have been administered in the state since the commencement of the Covid immunisation programme. Pune district has also seen an uptick in the doses administered in December. In December, so far, almost 1,614,421 total doses were administered in Pune district. The number of second doses have exceeded the number of first doses in the district. Speaking to reporters in Jalna on Saturday, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that around 10 million people in the state who are eligible for the vaccination have still not taken even the first dose. He also pointed out that the daily speed of vaccination has slowed down in the state with 500,000-600,000 doses being administered per day in the state. “A total of 87% of the eligible population has been given the first dose and 57-58% have been given the second dose. Now, daily 500,000-600,000 doses are being administered. Approximately, 10 million people remain to get the first dose. With this speed they can be covered in 15 days. Vaccines shots are abundantly available. The speed of 12,00,000 doses per day has been reduced to around 600,000,” said Tope. He asked people to come forward to take the vaccine. “We need a good response from people to maintain this speed. In rural parts officials have been given the lists and are meeting people to encourage them to take the vaccine,” said Tope. The Maharashtra government has launched the “Har Ghar Dastak” drive to motivate people to get vaccinated. In order to remove the hesitancy to take the second dose and inspire people to get the first dose, local administrations have been applying various methods including personally contacting unvaccinated people and imposing restrictions on those who are not inoculated. On December 23, the state crossed the milestone of administering 130 million vaccine doses. The 100 million mark was achieved on November 9, and the 120 million mark was achieved on December 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/164-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-given-in-state-till-december-25-101640542662991.html

26-12-2021||Noida||16 fresh Covid cases in Ghaziabad, highest single-day spike in December||A 12-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy were among the 16 fresh Covid-19 cases reported in the district on Sunday, the highest single day spike so far in the month of December, forcing officials of the district health department to ramp up testing and draw up containment plans to control the spread of the infection. Of the 16 cases reported on Sunday, five are members of the same family living in a high-rise in Crossings Republik; two of them have a history of arriving in Ghaziabad from Goa on December 18. Another member of the same family has a history of returning from the UK on December 17. The other cases include two doctors who were putting up at a hostel of a dental college in Modinagar; three members of a family in Indirapuram while one case each was reported from Kavi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Shalimar Garden and Raj Nagar. According to official data, 11 of the 16 new cases are contacts of previously infected patients and the samples of all new patients have been sent for genome-sequencing. Health officials said they will start empanelling more hospitals for Covid treatment. “This time, we plan to rope in about 75 hospitals for treatment of Covid patients in case there is a surge in cases. There is a rising trend in Covid cases; we are focussing on early detection, contact tracing and isolation of patients to curb the spread of the infection,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO) of Ghaziabad district. The last time the district received more than 16 fresh Covid cases in a day was on June 17, when it recorded 18 fresh cases. “Most of the positive cases coming to fore have a travel history and a majority of them have travelled to different states across the country. Apart from focussing on these cases, we are also seeking information of foreign travellers from residents and residents’ welfare associations and getting them tested at the earliest,” said the CMO. With 16 new cases, the number of total infections o far in the month of December has gone up to 83, of which 55 are active cases. Fifty of the 55 active cases are in home isolation. The overall tally of infections since the beginning of the pandemic has reached 55,763. Health experts said there is a rising trend in cases and it may go up further in coming weeks. “It is vital that all Covid protocols be followed and guidelines be strictly enforced if we wish to stop the spread of infection. The best part is that the vaccination coverage has increased and it should further be ramped up to get maximum protection against Covid,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). According to official figures, the sample positivity rate, which was 0.01% on November 30, has now increased to 0.6% till December 26. The overall sample positivity rate, since the start of the pandemic, stands at 2.69%. The sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing returning positive for Covid infection per 100 samples tested. Sometimes, patients would give more than one test for confirmation. Hence, the total positive samples could be higher than total positive cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a test positivity rate below 5% for at least two weeks in a region for an outbreak to be considered under control.“Our focus is on comprehensive vaccination but senior citizens (aged over 60) are not showing much inclination in coming out and getting vaccinated. So we have started near-to-home vaccination so that coverage can be increased. The overall coverage is over 95% and we hope that we can complete administering the first dose of the Covid vaccine to our targeted population within the next week,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination.After the district administration missed several deadlines of administering the first dose to its eligible beneficiaries, the state government set a new deadline of December 31 to finish the process.

26-12-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati had launched Ayodhya’s development in her tenure: Mishra||Lucknow; Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said on Sunday that the development of Ayodhya was launched under the BSP government when BSP president Mayawati was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati had prepared a plan for development of UP and welfare of the people and once the BSP formed government in the state, all the projects would be launched immediately, he said. Addressing a public meeting in Milkipur area of Ayodhya district on Sunday, Mishra said the BJP government indulged in land scam in the name of development of Ayodhya. The state government had allocated large fund for development of Ayodhya in the budget but the construction of roads and lanes in the temple town had not started. The development of Chaudah Kosi Parikarma road, laying of sewer line, water supply pipeline, establishment of sewage treatment plant and beautification of the Saryu ghat was done during the BSP government, he said. The BJP was seeking vote in the name of religion whereas the BSP called upon the people to vote for development. The project for development of Vrindavan was also launched under the BSP government. The development of Valmiki Ashram at Bithoor was also done under BSP government, he said. The BJP government was highlighting Lord Ram but had neglected Sita. This it clearly showed that the saffron brigade was not interested in the empowerment of women but considered them a vote bank. Now the BJP government was distributing smartphones among the youths with an eye on their votes. Instead of smartphones and laptops, the BSP aimed to give jobs to the youths, he said. The BJP and SP governments spread terror among the people whereas the BSP government established the rule of law. Under the SP government, the state witnessed spurt in crime and communal violence. The SP was not a well-wisher of the Muslim community rather but used it as a vote bank, he said. The BJP engineered defection in the BSP in 2003 to pave way for the formation of the SP government. This showed that both the BJP and the SP were two sides of the same coin, he said. Mishra said in the 2017 assembly election, the BJP leaders misguided the people with false promises. Today the people were feeling cheated, as the prices of essential commodities had increased he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-had-launched-ayodhya-s-development-in-her-tenure-mishra-101640541641720.html

26-12-2021||Lucknow||US, Indian scientists’ team research hints at anticancer therapy sans chemo||A team of US and Indian scientists on the strength of their research have hinted at a novel effective treatment process of cancer without chemo and radiation therapies known for causing side effects like fatigue, nausea, hair loss, weight loss, pain, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal problem, immune suppression, besides sore mouth and throat among most cancer patients.The findings of this team of 10 scientists working in the field of cancer at the Cleveland Clinic of the United States led by professor of Cancer Biology Yong Li and an assistant professor of biochemistry from Allahabad University (AU) Munish Pandey were recently published in the prestigious international journal Oncogene of Nature Publishing Group.After successful experiments on mice, efforts are now being intensified to do the same for human trial, the scientists claim. “The study may give relief to cancer patient who undergo chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses radiation and other drugs which have many side effects and evoke immune system response that causes severe pain and allergic reactions. Our team had earlier developed knockout mice (a lab mouse in which one or more genes have been turned off or “knocked out” using genetic engineering) for miR-21 and same was published in PNAS journal,” Pandey said.Knockout mice are used to study what happens in an organism when a particular gene is absent. MicroRNA-21 (small non-coding RNA) is one of the most abundant microRNAs in mammalian cells that regulate apoptosis (programmed cell death) and oncogenic effects.He said his team was on way to discovering an alternative to chemotherapy and drugs in the treatment of cancer which damage normal cells along with cancer cells during cancer treatment. In this successful experiment in the Cleveland Clinic of US the team, while experimenting on mice, injected its anti-sense (non-coding DNA strand of a gene) into mice to make miR-21 ineffective.After this, it was found that the tumour formed in the body of the mice gradually became smaller. Some tumours even disappeared. This experiment went on for a year in the US. However, it has not yet got approval for human trial. During research, the team also found that microRNA i.e. miR-21 significantly expressed in most cancer types. “This makes cancer cells more effective in presence of miR-21,” Pandey said. “The group is further working on other programmed cell death mechanisms, microRNAs and Chimeric Antigen T-Cell therapy (CAR-T) to tackle carcinogenicity in mice model,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/us-indian-scientists-team-research-hints-at-anticancer-therapy-sans-chemo-101640540920258.html

The officer has been booked along with a sepoy, his wife, and a havaldar-level staff member for sharing answer keys to the candidates appearing for the exam for money, that was paid allegedly through bank transfers. According to the FIR, two different amounts of ₹50,000 and ₹40,000 were transferred. Two of the four accused have been identified as havaldar Susanta Nahak and Sepoy Alok Kumar, both arrested in a similar case registered by the CBI Pune unit in November. “They were initially arrested in another case. They have been released on bail in that case. During their interrogation we found new information based on which we have registered a new case. I cannot comment on whether there will be any more arrests at this stage,” said a senior officer of the Central bureau of investigation’s (CBI) Pune unit of anti-corruption bureau on anonymity.

On Saturday, one lakh smartphones and tablets were given to final year students at Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium in Lucknow.“I am visually impaired and that posed many challenges to me. I wasn’t able to attend online classes and access study materials. Now, I can listen to audio lectures easily. I want to thank the CM on behalf of all visually impaired students who’ll be benefitted from this campaign,” said one Sagar Upmanyu in his speech. He is pursuing his MA in political science from Dr Shakuntala Misra National University, Lucknow.Another nursing student Akansha Mishra who is pursuing BSc from Bora Institute, Sitapur said smartphones would help in research, presentation and attending online classes besides battling Covid-19. “Due to financial issues, students weren’t able to fulfil their dreams.

The civic body has planned to implement the cast-in-situ method for redoing footpaths at Churchgate Pedestrian Plaza, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Chowk, Metro Junction, Horniman Circle and Veer Nariman Street.In 2020, the BMC had developed the stretch of footpath between the Mumbai University Fort Campus and National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) on a pilot basis. In this project too, the civic body had implemented the cast-in-situ method of concreting instead of using the usual paver blocks and tiles. The cast-in-situ method includes the use of concrete and cement which is prepared at the construction site and poured onto the surface after which it is left for curing. Almost all the existing footpaths in Mumbai are constructed using paver blocks and tiles which eventually makes their surface uneven with time. The cost of maintaining paver blocks is higher while the design life is short.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said that the usage of concrete instead of paver blocks or tiles will provide longevity to the footpath and will also reduce the maintenance cost. “We will be merging the footpath with the existing carriageway on the road. The surface of these footpaths will be smoother and pedestrian-friendly. We will be re-engineering these footpaths in a way that wheelchair users can find it easy to move,” Velrasu said.To ensure that pedestrians don’t face any inconvenience, only 100 metre of work will be carried out at a time and the cost of the entire project has been pegged at around Rs45 crore he said. The project has to be completed within 12 to 15 months which includes the monsoon season, and the BMC has already issued the work order for this. “These footpaths will be constructed in panels so that if a portion of the footpath gets damaged in future, we can replace that panel with a new one instead of digging the entire footpath,” Velrasu said.As the project is going to be undertaken in the heritage precinct, the BMC has roped in conservation architect Pankaj Joshi as a consultant for the project. Joshi said that besides re-engineering footpaths, new street furniture including concrete benches, road signages and bus shelters will also be installed on the footpaths. Joshi was also part of the pilot project that the BMC undertook last year.“The paver blocks and tiles that are used in building footpaths get detached easily from the surface which makes the surface uneven. Due to which people prefer to walk on roads instead of footpaths, which is why we will be designing the footpath surface for universal accessibility. Besides re-engineering the footpaths, we will also re-organise the tree-surrounds that will give more space to the roots to grow,” said Joshi. He mentioned that as the work will be carried out through a longer area, the width of the footpaths will vary between 1.2 to 2 metre to 9 to 11 metre.“The primary objective of this project is to use the space available to us in a smart manner. Dedicated pitches for the street vendors will be created and we will also paint the lanes highlighting parking spaces of these areas. This will minimise encroachment and encourage more people to use the footpaths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-makeover-of-footpaths-in-heritage-precincts-of-south-mumbai-101640540499423.html
26-12-2021||Pune||Four locations to roll out EV charging hubs across Pune||Pune has started working on fast-tracking electric vehicle adoption and has set sights on going ‘all electric’ in the future. Hinjewadi, Pune railway station, Lohegaon airport, Swargate and Bhekrainagar are some of the areas in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad that are coming up as ‘concentrated hub of electric vehicles deployment’ and ‘public charging clusters’ for electric vehicles.These locations – where charging stations exist or EVs are operating in large numbers or companies plan to deploy EV in future – have been identified by around 80 companies which participated in the City Electric Vehicle Accelerator workshop conducted recently by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Based on these and other findings, a complete ‘EV charging infrastructure plan’ for the city will be prepared soon. RMI India, an independent think-tank which is helping PMC to make Pune city ‘EV Ready’, has put together immediate and long-term steps to be implemented by PMC along with Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and the state government. Several issues and potential roadblocks for creating EV charging infrastructure are also identified by the 80 plus companies which are stakeholders in the EV sector. Akshima Ghate, senior principal, RMI India said, “Hinjewadi is an emerging area for EV deployment. We have identified seven locations and are in the process of identifying more pockets in the city to accelerate the charging infrastructure. We need to have a plan for the city which no other city in the country so far has. Our next step is to get all stakeholders in the EV ecosystem and work with city’s EV Cell to put together a charging infrastructure action plan.”“While the focus is on the fast-charging facilities, we also need semi-public charging infrastructure with slow-charging facilities for EVs. This can be done in residential areas and housing societies. Incentives and subsidies for making slow chargers and property tax rebates for installing them could be one of the steps to encourage its use,” added Ghate.Tejsing Gaikwad, CEO, TAG Eutomotive and an electric vehicle OEM who participated in the governance working group during the accelerator workshop, said, “We need good charging infrastructure especially with standardised swapable batteries. The public charging stations available at present are not truly accessible for all EV users. Hence, state government and civic bodies should work closely with the industry players and possibly enter a public-private partnership model to cater to the emerging two-wheeler EV segment.”During the workshop, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said that the EV Cell will work as a ‘single window’ system to resolve grievances of all stakeholders in the EV ecosystem. He also mentioned a policy framework to allow property tax rebates for residential housing societies for setting up charging stations.

In a bid to give facilities to customers, several cafes, private firms, restaurants and shops have installed electric charging points in their premises. The Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) has seen an increase in registrations of electric bikes.Sunny’s Cafe in Kothrud, near the MIT college, has set up a special charging point for e-bikes here. “As many college students have started using e-bikes, one of them asked us if we have a charging port. These students visit our cafe and sit here for hours, so we thought to have such charging point which will be beneficial for our customers and also we can earn something out of it,” said Sunny Waghmare owner of the cafe.Another grocery shop owner Ketan Rathi from Hadapsar said, “There is always a rush of customers at our shops, and when there is a long queue many times customers have to wait for an hour. So, we decided to have an electric charging point for customers bringing their e-bikes and cars. And after paying the nominal fees, they can easily charge their vehicles while they do shopping.”There are several restaurants specially on the highways which have started the charging stations in their premises,so that citizens can easily charge their vehicles on the go. While at housing societies, the charging stations have been set up to benefit the residents.Similarly, the Inox multiplex theatre at Bund garden is laying claim to being the first cinema in India to be equipped with charging stations for electric two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Charging stations have also been installed at Deshpande’s restaurant on the Pune - Solapur Highway near Indapur. It is a restaurant on the highway and daily hundreds of vehicles stop here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.BOXElectric two-wheelers registered at Pune RTO in last four years2018 - 5102019 - 8442020 - 1,6722021 - 1,952||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pvt-firms-cafes-shops-charging-stations-for-e-vehicles-mushrooming-in-pune-city-101640539905832.html

26-12-2021||Delhi||Jewar airport: Land acquisition for second phase to begin in January||Noida: The process to acquire land for the second phase of the Noida International Airport project in Jewar will begin in January next year, district administration officials aware of the development said on Sunday, adding that the Uttar Pradesh government has already approved the social impact assessment report for the new phase on December 17. The officials said the report, prepared by the district administration and Gautam Buddha University, was sent to the state government in July. Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari reviewed the report on the project’s impact on farmers in the region, and approved it on December 17, they said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Jewar airport on November 25. The greenfield project is billed to be the the largest in India, and will be the National Capital Region’s third, after the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) and the civilian terminal at Ghaziabad’s Hindon airport. The second phase of the Jewar airport envisages setting up the third runway, and a commercial maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of aircraft centre.MRO units ensure service worthiness of an aircraft with facilities for inspection and maintenance. Two runway pavements are being developed in the first phase, which is to be completed soon, said the officials. The first phase of the project, which will be fully implemented in four separate phases, is scheduled to be done by September 29, 2024.Officials on Sunday said the land for the second phase will be acquired in Karauli Bangar, Dayanatpur, Kureb, Ranhera, Mundhera and Nagla Hukum Singh villages. “We will start the land acquisition process from January. We will organise camps at the six villages on January 7,8 and 10 to take the consent of the farmers, who are likely to be affected by the land acquisition process. The suggestions and objections of those opposing the project will be noted down for suitable remedial action,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Gautam Budh Nagar.The state government has already handed over 1,334 hectares in Jewar to the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) -- a 100% subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG, which has been incorporated as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to develop Jewar airport -- last year. According to the agreement, the government has to provide 1,363 hectares to the subsidiary adjacent to the existing airport site for the third runway and further expansion.Meanwhile, the state government has rejected the demand by farmers of Karauli Bangar village to keep their area of the project. Objections have also been raised by residents of Nagla Hukum Singh, whose entire village is to be acquired.The villagers have said they will decide their next move in the future. “We will organise a meeting with the farmers, and then decide if we will file a plea in the high court or we will approach the state government for excluding our village from the project area,” said Mukesh Kumar, a farmer from Nagla Hukum Singh village. 
26-12-2021||Lucknow||Money meant for the poor coming out of walls: UP CM Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the BJP government freed the land grabbed by mafias and criminals and was using them for constructing houses for the poor. On the raid on the premises of a Kanpur-based perfume businessman, he said, “The money meant for the poor, which was embezzled during previous government is now coming out of the walls. The perfume launched is not giving fragrance but it is now giving stench.”The CM expressed these views while addressing a gathering in Prayagraj on Sunday. He was in Sangam city to lay the foundation of 75 houses being constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana on a piece of land that was freed from the illegal possession of Mafioso-turned-politician and ex-MP Atiq Ahmed in Lukarganj area of the city. On the occasion, he also inaugurated various government schemes for Prayagraj and Kaushambi districts. In Prayagraj, he inaugurated schemes worth ₹157.78 crore. This included inauguration of eight schemes worth ₹89.60 crore and stone laying of 23 projects worth ₹68.18 crore. The CM also gave benefits of different schemes to 25 beneficiaries and handed over e-tricycle to five differently-abled people.Addressing a gathering at the ground near Khusru Bagh, the CM said mafias and criminals were active during previous government and grabbed land and extorted money from businessmen. Before 2017, funds allotted for development works and schemes for the poor in Uttar Pradesh were embezzled, he added.“The BJP government has zero tolerance policy towards corruption and crime but in previous government grabbing lands of poor, extortion, kidnappings, embezzlement of money for development works was common. The government bulldozer is now active and houses are being built on lands freed from mafias,” the CM said.“The state was run by mafias and witnessed riots in previous government but now not a single riot occurred during the BJP rule. The mafias and their henchmen used to harass people in Prayagraj and even torture and abduct their children for grabbing their land,” he added.He said people had experienced the difference between Kumbh-2013 and Kumbh-2019. The Kumbh-2013 witnessed chaos, stampede and filth while Kumbh-2019 was well organised and magnificent, Yogi said.The CM said that Prayagraj will be the “justice capital” as the national law university had been proposed for the Sangam city. “BJP is working for development of the state and new airports, highways and even waterways have come up. Besides other schemes, the government is giving free tablets and smart phones to the youth,” he added.The BJP government helped the poor during the lockdowns when the pandemic was at its peak but leaders and workers of other parties were in “home quarantine” and were opposing the vaccination drive. Due to massive efforts of the government, 19.25 crore people in the state had been vaccinated so far, the CM said.UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the mafia who used to grab land and terrorise people in Prayagraj had been sent to rot in jail in Gujarat. Referring to the infamous “Madrasa incident’ of Kareli area in which two Muslim girls of a Madrasa were allegedly gang-raped, Singh said, “The mafias who were active in Prayagraj were not loyal to even their own society and religion. They gangraped the innocent girls but were not punished. The case will be reopened if the BJP government returns to power. The mafias and their henchmen tortured the children of Pasi and Pal families in Dhumanganj area for grabbing their land. The government has freed 200 bighas of land from mafias which will now be used for housing the poor.” On January 17, 2007, two girls of Madrasa Jamia Al Saalihat Islamia were allegedly gang-raped.

Addressing a press conference after the inauguration of the party’s central office for the assembly elections in Jalandhar on Sunday, Shekhawat alleged, “Regrettably, the Gandhi family of the Congress and the Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have ruined Punjab. Blatant corruption and absolute disinterest in creating opportunities for its citizens by the two families has led to its economic duress.”On the issues of sacrilege, he claimed that the need of the hour was an in-depth probe into finding the truth behind such conspiracies that disturbed peace in Punjab. “The astute voter of Punjab wants to know from where will the revenue be generated for the false freebies being announced by the Congress, the AAP and the SAD,” he said, taking a dig at populist politics, adding, “The public is exhausted with the loot, mafia and corruption in the state. The BJP will be victorious in assembly elections, and has a complete road map for putting the state back on track.”Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said an atmosphere of terror, in tandem with a corrupt regime has created fear in the minds of the general public. “The BJP will win on the strength of the complete road map, we have in place, of bringing the state out of its economic duress. We will create opportunities to progress for each member of the state,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unethical-policies-of-two-families-turned-punjab-bankrupt-shekhawat-101640539180124.html
26-12-2021||Mumbai||City’s Covid-19 cases highest in six months||MUMBAI: The city recorded 896 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest single-day spike since June 23, when it had recorded 864 cases. Mumbai’s cumulative cases stood at 770,910 on Sunday, with two deaths on Sunday, compared to 23 fatalities on June 23. The state reported 1,648 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest single-day increase in 64 days. Maharashtra had reported 1,710 cases on October 23. Maharashtra also saw the highest single-day surge in new Omicron variant patients with 31 cases reported on Sunday, taking the state’s tally to 141, the highest in the country. Mumbai accounted for 27 of those, also the highest in a day so far. Experts, however, said that it will take at least two more weeks of sustained rise in cases for them to conclude whether this is the third wave of Covid-19. Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the city’s current spurt can be linked to festivities and the ongoing wedding season. “These are small, scattered cluster breakouts due to high population density and social gatherings. We will have to closely monitor and contain these clusters and watch the trends in the coming weeks before labelling the spurt as a wave,” he said, adding that a fresh wave will have to be corroborated with a rise in test positivity rate as well as a lower doubling rate. “For now, it is apt to call the rise in cases as a spurt,” he said. Maharashtra’s active case count rose to 9,813 on Sunday. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 896 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking the tally to 770,910. Mumbai also reported two fatalities, taking the city’s death toll to 16,370. The city’s active case count stood at 4,295. As Omicron cases mount in the State, Maharashtra welcomed the Centre’s decision to vaccinate children and the ‘precaution’ doses for healthcare workers, frontline workers, and senior citizens with comorbidities. The state government is gearing for booster dose and vaccination of children. Apart from 27 in Mumbai, Sunday’s new Omicron cases include two from Thane and one each from Pune rural and Akola, the state health department said. All the patients have a history of international travel, except one, who is a high-risk contact of a person with international travel history. According to the health department, of the 31 cases, six are minors. Only two patients have mild symptoms and 29 other patients are asymptomatic. Of all the infected patients, 22 are fully vaccinated and three adults are not vaccinated, while six minors are ineligible. State health minister Rajesh Tope said Maharashtra is prepared to handle vaccination of beneficiaries between ages 15 and 18, and booster doses for healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) as well. From January 2022, India will begin administering the coronavirus vaccine to children of ages 15 to 18, along with booster doses to HCWs, FLWs and senior citizens with comorbidity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced in a televised address on Saturday. Tope said the state administration is prepared to tackle the vaccination of the new category and booster doses. “I am confident that with the rising cases of Omicron, booster doses and vaccination for children will be helpful,” Tope said. “We are inoculating at a good speed and we will be ready for the new categories by the time the next drive kicks off.” He said the state is awaiting Central government guidelines to understand the type of vaccine and the gap between the last shot administered and the booster dose. Meanwhile, officials said that the exact number of beneficiaries of the 15 to 18 years is being worked out. The state estimates that there would be 3.5 million healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW). Till December 25, Maharashtra has administered vaccine doses to 3.44 million (3,442,973) HCWs and FLWs. “We have not received a notification from the Centre on the next vaccination drive,” said state immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai. Officials added that modifications will have to be made in the CoWin App by the Centre for appointments to be generated, slots, etc, for vaccination. “We do not have the number of beneficiaries that would come under the 15 to 18 years bracket. By the coming week, we will know the exact numbers,” Dr Desai said. He added, “Overall, there will not be major change. All our machinery and process are well established. People are coming in to take vaccines and we have adequate stock.” A state health department official said, “We will have three vaccines soon – including Covishield, Covaxin and Zycov-D. Some studies show that a mix-and-match of vaccines can give good results. In the coming week, we will get instructions about the execution plan about booster doses. The Centre will give guidelines on what vaccine to use.” 
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Massive fire breaks out in fabric manufacturing unit||A massive fire broke out at a prominent fabric manufacturing unit in the city in the wee hours on Sunday. While there were no injuries, fabric and machinery worth lakhs were gutted. The fire, which erupted on the top floor of Sungrace Fabrics Private Limited at Kaali Sadak, was first noticed by the labourers working on night shift at around 5.30am. The workers immediately raised the alarm and called the fire brigade. The fire was doused after an intensive six-hour firefighting operation. Fourteen fire tenders were pressed into service for the firefighting operation. The vehicles had to make double rounds to replenish water in the tanks. Fire officials were also seen refilling the fire tenders with water from other factories in the area. The fire was completely extinguished by noon. The top floor of the three-storeyed building was completely destroyed, and the machines on the first floor were also damaged. Leading fireman Rajinder Kumar said the fire safety equipment at the factory was insufficient, and though 14 fire tenders were pressed into service, they had to be repeatedly refilled. “Luckily, no one was injured,” he said, adding that the fire was caused due to a short-circuit.The proprietor of the fabric manufacturing unit, Vimal Jain, said the fabric stored on the top floor had turned to ash, while the heavy machinery was also damaged. Founded in 1994, Sungrace Fabrics, is one of the leading exporters and manufacturers of fabric.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/massive-fire-breaks-out-in-fabric-manufacturing-unit-101640536239133.html

With the number of guests restricted families preparing for weddings are having to realign their preparations in terms of location, F&B and invitees.The entire wedding celebration ecosystem has begun to shudder.“My son’s wedding is scheduled on December 28 at Panvel and from both sides we had invited around 500 guests from all across Maharashtra. Now as per the new restrictions, only 100 guests are allowed inside the marriage hall, and so now we have started calling the guests who can be called later. Accordingly, the list is now reduced to 100 to 150 guests, and after the marriage for the pooja at our house the remaining guests will be invited,” said Anil Kakade, father of a bridegroom. Shruti Khinvsara’s wedding is scheduled in the first week of January. She said, “ My wedding is scheduled on January 7 and we have booked a marriage hall with lawns and around 1,000 guests are going to be invited. Now due to new strict restrictions imposed by the state government, all the planning and expenses done will be wasted. We are confused about whether to postpone the wedding or go with a few wedding guests.”On December 24, the state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took a review meeting with the state Covid task force and it was decided to impose strict restrictions. According to the new state Covid guidelines, only 100 people are allowed at indoor weddings. While not more than 250 are allowed for outdoor weddings on open grounds and party lawns. Just like Shruti there are several families of both brides and bridegrooms, who have weddings in their houses and now have to restrict the number of people attending the event. The effect is now seen on the weddings scheduled in December, and January and February next year. Talking about the impact of these restrictions on wedding halls owners, Kishore Jagdale owner of Shreesai Wedding lawns in Kalyani nagar said, “After the new Covid guidelines were announced, immediately we started getting calls from families who had booked our wedding lawn. They first reduced the number of people and hours, and mainly the food order which is a major part of any wedding. Some have now postponing the wedding and couple of them have cancelled the bookings.

For the remaining three months and a few days of this fiscal itself, the state government has to pay the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) ₹13,000 crore, an uphill task for the cash-strapped regime.Since assuming power in 2017, the Congress government has also defaulted on paying subsidy dues in every fiscal. The previous SAD-BJP regime had left arrears of ₹2,342 crore for it, this government has now allowed this burden to ballon to almost ₹10,000 crore. For PSPCL, this non-payment of dues in lieu of subsidies clubbed with the recent poll sops, has dried up its coffers; the utility is in acute financial stress. The corporation has not even received ₹2,023 crore in lieu of writing off arrears of defaulting 2 KW consumers.With chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s announcement of further sops, the subsidy bill for the present fiscal has touched ₹20,016 crore. The government, so far, has paid only ₹7,080 crore. If the PSPCL makes adjustments of ₹2,315 crore in lieu of electricity duty and other payments to be made to the Punjab government, even then the subsidy default stands at ₹6,000 crore till December 15; the revised balance amount, then, to be paid in three-and-a-half months is ₹10,025.The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), in its tariff order for the current financial year, worked out a total subsidy of ₹17,796 crore, including the arrears of the previous year.In its annual revenue requirement filing for next financial year, the PSPCL has revised the current subsidy to ₹12,245 crore. It has added five month additional subsidies announced by the Punjab government for more concessions to domestic and industrial consumers from November 1, this year.“The total amount payable to PSPCL this fiscal is about ₹13,500 crore, which as per government track record, is not possible at all. Subsidies must be subject to checks and balances or timely payments have to be ensured, as per PSERC orders. Using PSPCL for political freebies will dent it financially, and consumers will suffer,” said VK Gupta, spokesman, All-India Power Engineers Corporation. He added that for the next fiscal, the PSPCL has sought a subsidy of ₹13,929 crore based on the present tariff order. Going by this trend, this was likely to touch ₹20,000 crore, which is almost 15% of total budget of Punjab.Punjab finance secretary KAP Sinha could not be contacted for comments; but, sources in the PSPCL said every effort was being made to ensure that the government cleared its subsidy bill.

This has also lead to a major traffic jam and long queues of vehicles at toll nakas around Pune. People’s vacation trips to destinations around Pune district can be seen and experienced on the highways.On Sunday, queues of over 2km were seen at the Khed Shivapur toll naka on the Pune - Bengaluru highway as tourists from Kolhapur, Mahabaleshwar and other tourist destinations were returning back to Pune. “I had to wait for around 45 minutes to clear the Khed Shivapur toll naka as there were long queues. We had gone to Mahableshwar for three days and expected traffic jams on the return,” said Kushal Das, a businessman from Pune. Similarly, long queues of vehicles were seen at the Urse toll naka on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, as Punekars chose to go towards Lonavala. Though there was fast clearing of the vehicles due to the ‘fast tag’ method, people had to wait for around 15 to 20 minutes to clear the toll naka.

Pune district will get the rollout plan for vaccination as soon as state directives are issued. Officials noted that the state directives will clarify how beneficiaries will be identified and reached. On Saturday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccination for children between the age group of 15 to 18 years will begin from January 2022. Ahead of that, the state machinery is likely to issue guidelines this coming week.Speaking about the vaccination drive, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, said that a meeting will be conducted on December 27 to chalk out a strategy for vaccination of children between the ages of 15 to 18 years of age.“Pune district has so far inoculated the maximum number of people. We will continue to take similar efforts to inoculate children. There will be maximum centres and manpower dedicated to this drive. We will also mobilise beneficiaries. We are also exploring all strategies like reaching out to schools for maximum vaccinations. There is data shared by the health department which states the number of in the district,” said Deshmukh. Speaking about the number, Dr Abhay Tidke, district immunisationofficer, said that the plan will be rolled out soon.“On December 27, we are likely to receive directives from the State government. As of now, we don’t have the number of beneficiaries with us. As the beneficiaries are younger than 18 years of age, we don’t have clarity right now. The State guidelines will give the clarity on the vaccination drive,” said Dr Tidke.Speaking about the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, Dr Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer at PMC said that in PMC limits the number of beneficiaries should be around 500,000.“The approximate numbers are around 500,000, but how the inoculation drive will be conducted is still not clear. The state directives will clarify the centres and also highlight which vaccine will be administered to this age group,” said Dr Deokar.According to the Maharashtra State board records, there are at least 2.20 lakh students registered with the board to appear for the exams for Classes 10 and 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-dist-admin-primed-and-ready-to-roll-out-covid-vax-for-15-18-age-group-101640534499802.html

Sidhu, who addressed the rally that Sekhri had organised, said no outsider will be allowed to fight polls in Batala, without naming Bajwa, who is the MLA from nearby Fatehgarh Churian. Bajwa has shown his inclination to contest from Batala, but without openly declaring it. Sekhri and Bajwa have remained at loggerheads, with Sekhri even accusing Bajwa of planning to get him killed through gangsters. Bajwa had strongly denied this. “I want to ask people of Batala, whom they would like to field? I say that no one will come from outside here...Our party has already made history by making a Dalit CM….This seat (Batala) will stay where it has been. I will not allow anyone else to come here,” Sidhu said, while appealing to the rally to elect Sekhri as MLA from Batala.A few months ago, Sekhri had announced that he would be joining the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), but former CM Capt Amarinder Singh had made him the chairman of the Punjab Health Systems Corporation. Bajwa didn’t respond to repeated calls for his version.Last month, Sidhu had supported Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa at a rally. Fateh is also a rival of Tript Bajwa and Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. Notably, Tript and Randhawa were among ministers who had supported Sidhu’s cause against former chief minister Amarinder Singh. Veiled attack on Channi, says only announcements will never work In an attack on chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Sidhu said there were only announcements for providing cheaper sand and cable networks. “Are you getting cable at ₹100 per month? Are you getting cheaper sand? The price of sand is ₹3,700 and ₹4,000…That is why I am saying to you that these will not happen only with talks; these will happen with policies; with budget allocation,” he said.Calling the FIR against ex-SAD minister Bikram Singh Majithia a mere ‘formality’, Sidhu said, “FIRs were also registered after sacrilege incidents, but no justice has been delivered for six years.”“Today, where is Majithia?...The mothers who lost their sons to drugs are still waiting for justice. Nothing will happen with an FIR, until police straps are not unleashed; until he (Majithia) is not arrested,” he added.Hinting at his desire to become the CM, he said, “I give my word that I will extract between ₹20,000 crore and ₹25,000 crore from liquor...If you want to vote to save the next generation of Punjab; if you want to vote to give punishment to Majithia, then bring an honest person at the top. Only the CM does everything; he has absolute power…..It is your wish to bring mafia raj or end the mafia raj by choosing an honest person this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sidhu-bats-for-sekhri-from-batala-calls-fir-against-majithia-a-formality-101640534439855.html

Parmanand Tuddu (30) was killed on Thursday before he could take the oath. A hardcore Maoist, identified as Suresh Koda, had on October 13 threatened Tuddu of dire consequences if he filed the nomination papers. But Tuddu did file the papers and also won from the margin of 99 votes on November 13. He was to take oath on December 31, said police.Munger SP Jagunath Jala Reddy said that the accused, identified as Kanan Naiya, Kaushal Koda, Chhathu Koda and Anil Koda, were arrested from Dharhara and Ladaiyatand police station areas. Kanan was also wanted in a Naxal-related case lodged with Ladaiyatand police station on September 20. According to Tuddu’s son Abhishek Kumar, over 10 suspected Maoists in police uniform forcibly entered his house when his father was sleeping. They pulled him out shouting slogans and beheaded him outside the house. Due to fear, the Tuddu family could not lodge a police complaint about the ghastly incident. On Sunday, Munger police lodged an FIR against 11 unidentified and 10 identified Maoists, including Parvesh Da, Arjun Koda, Suresh Koda, Nageshwar Koda, Baleshwar Koda, Shri Koda, Birendra Koda and Arvind Da, based on the statement of the SHO of Ladaiyatand police station. The SP said the four arrested persons confessed their involvement in the murder of the newly elected mukhiya. Raids are on to nab other accused, he said..

CCTV footage around his residence in Khanna shows him leaving his house at 9am on a white Honda Activa; this two-wheeler has been found at the parking lot of Khanna civil hospital. Police are probing on how did he get to the court complex from his house in Khanna, 50km away. According to sources, the scooter being found indicates that Gagandeep could have been ferried to the court complex and handed over the explosives, en route. It also shows that the explosives were not kept at this house. “There is a strong possibility of the involvement of one or more persons, who may have been handling the explosives and who handed it over to Gagandeep. The presence of handlers in and around the court complex at the time of the explosion cannot be ruled out,” said an official privy with to the investigation. ACCUSED CREMATEDOn Sunday, the body of Gagandeep, who died while planting the bomb, was performed at a crematorium in Khanna at around 5pm. Except his father, wife and elder brother, no relative, friend or neighbour attended the cremation, all of them fearing police questioning.With the National Investigation Agency confiscating the Aadhaar card of the accused, the crematorium staff refused give wood, and other material needed to perform the last rites; they insisted on some identification before allowing the cremation. Later, police intervened and the cremation was performed. On Saturday, Sukhwinder Singh, 39, and notorious drug lord Ranjit Singh Chita, 54, were brought on a production warrant from the Ludhiana Central Jail, and a local court granted police their custody till January 1. These two had shared a barrack with Gagandeep in jail. A woman constable, who was allegedly the love interest of Gagandeep, was also detained for questioning. DCP (investigation) Varinder Brar said further probe was on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-bomb-blast-accused-s-scooter-found-in-khanna-handlers-involvement-likely-say-police-101640534019577.html
26-12-2021||Patna||GGI Index: What the ranking tells about Bihar’s progress||Bihar is ranked 15th among 18-major states (Group A and B category together) and 6th in Group B states, as per the latest Good Governance Index (GGI) - 2020-21, released by the Administration Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), Government of India, on Saturday in New Delhi. A biannual exercise, GGI was first published in 2019. This year, it includes 58 indicators for 10 important sectors. The indicators have been revised this year incorporating additional process-based indicators in addition to the outcome and output-based indicators.Bihar has been kept in other states ‘Group B’ category with MP, Rajasthan, West Bengal Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, UP, Bihar, and Odisha. Though Bihar ranks second last in its category out of eight states overall, it has shown improvement in some key sectors.Sudhanshu Kumar, economist & associate professor, Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance (CEPPF), Patna, said more weight has been assigned to the outcome and output based indicators compared to the process-based indicators while preparing the index and despite Bihar’s low ranking, it has done appreciably on the indicators associated with public infrastructure and utility sector, in which it is ranked No.1 in its category, ahead of states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.GGI is a comprehensive and implementable framework to assess the state of governance across the states and UTs which enables ranking of states/districts. The objective of GGI is to create a tool that can be used uniformly across the states to assess the impact of various interventions taken up by the Central and state governments including UTs. Based on the GGI framework, the index provides a comparative picture among the states.“The infrastructure & utilities sector includes access to water, rural road connectivity, and electricity-related indicators. The state has recently taken many initiatives to improve these and its benefits are getting reflected with better ranking. There is one indicator, per capita power consumption which is highly correlated with per capita income and industry and therefore will increase with the overall development of the state. Availability of electricity and its access both have improved a lot in the state,” said Kumar.Similarly, on indicators concerning citizen-centric governance, the state is ranked fourth in its category and seventh overall among 18 states. “Bihar is among the first two states to enact right to service acts and first to have a grievance redressal mechanism. The state needs to improve online access to government services. This is something which can be easily improved,” Kumar added.The state has also shown improvement in human resource development and public health, in which it is ranked third in its category and 11th and 13th respectively among the 18 states. “The state needs significant improvement in the economic governance sector. It needs to improve its own tax revenue as the share of its own taxes in total revenue is as low as 26%. With improvement on this, the debt scenario will also improve. This is something where the state needs to work to realise long-term goals of economic development,” Kumar said.However, Bihar fared poorly on the front of social welfare and development, where it is ranked last in its category as well as overall among 18 states. “Bihar has done well on empowerment of women. However, more needs to be done on this to improve relative performance. Better coordination and implementation on MGNREGA will give better results in this sector. Lower health insurance coverage is one of the indicators used which is something that goes up with overall economic development as people realise benefits of insurance,” he said, adding the state also needs to improve the availability of police personal.“Good proportion of police personal in the state are women, which is impressive and any further increase in personal will help in improving ranking on other indicators too. Areas of concern as highlighted by the index are low conviction rate and poor performance on disposal of court cases,” he added.The index reflects that the state has a lot of catching up to do on the key fronts of agriculture & allied sector and commerce & industry, where it is ranked 6th and 7th in its own category. Industrial growth in Bihar, however, has shown a dip. “The state needs to work on crop insurance and generating surplus through value addition, besides ensuring improved access to the market. The state also needs to focus on ease of doing business and encourage a start-up environment, as this area has a lot of competition from other states. In the environment sector also, Bihar has to lay stress in waste recycle and renewable energy,” he added.

Confirming seven deaths, Jayant Kant, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Muzaffarpur, said the incident occurred at a noodles factory located in Bela Phase-2 under Bela police station around 10 am. “Prima facie, it appears that the accident occurred due to the blast in a boiler. Most of the victims were daily wage earners. The list of the victims is being prepared,” said Kant. Two other factories nearby were also damaged in the explosion, he said. Chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed deep shock over the tragedy and offered condolences to the bereaved families. He announced a probe into the blast and compensation of ₹4 lakh each to the kin of every deceased. Minister of revenue and land reforms Ramsurat Rai said, “We need to find out why the factory was operational on a Sunday. A government certificate was given for the operation of the boiler in May. A high-level inquiry will be conducted followed by action against those found guilty.” Soon after the incident, locals launched the rescue operation and rushed victims to SKMCH in coordination with the district administration. Later, a state disaster response force (SDRF) team was pressed into search operation by the district administration. The SDRF recovered three bodies till the filing of this report. “The bodies were badly mutilated, body parts were maimed and beyond recognition,” Guneshwar Mandal, inspector, SDRF Muzaffarpur, said. When contacted, Dr Babu Saheb Jha, superintendent of Shri Krishna Medical College & Hospital (SKMCH), said all seven victims were brought dead. “Seven others who sustained injuries in the explosion are undergoing treatment with minor to moderate injuries. Their condition is stable,” he said. Pravan Kumar, district magistrate (DM), Muzaffarpur, said action will be taken against those found responsible. “It would be too early to comment on the accident right now. We will look into the causes behind the accident after the rescue operation and investigate the matter from all possible angles,” said the DM. Residents dwelling near the factory said that the area resounded with a deafening explosion accompanied by land shaking that occurred around 10 am. “At first, everyone thought that there was an earthquake,” said Shashi Rajan Rai, a local. The intensity of the blast was so severe that the sound could be heard up to 5 km, said another local. People familiar with the matter said the factory was set up around four years back for producing processed food like noodles and confectionaries. Meanwhile, Pankaj, one of the injured victims, said, “In the morning, when everyone was busy in their work, suddenly an explosion took place. Before we could understand anything, the machine started to fall apart. Few friends got trapped under it. There was shouting and confusion on the premises,” he said.

26-12-2021||Mumbai||Consider National Lok Adalat to clear pending railway claim cases: HC||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) recently directed the Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority (MSLSA) to consider setting up a National Lok Adalat to clear 26,395 cases that are pending with the Railway Claims Tribunal till September 2020. The directions were issued after the court was informed that there were cases pending since 1995 and to reduce pendency, a National Lok Adalat was held in five cities across the country in 2019, which helped them clear a large number of cases. The single-judge bench of justice Prithviraj Chavan, which was hearing multiple appeals against orders of the Railway Claim Tribunal (RCT), was informed by advocate G J Mohan Rao, president of the Railway Claims Tribunal Bar Association, Bombay, that there were numerous appeals pending in the HC as well the RCT. Advocate Rao added that the delay in settling claims was resulting in the denial of justice in the real sense to the litigants and hence, there was a need for the bench to issue directions for holding periodical Lok Adalats. Advocate Balasaheb Deshmukh, who practices before the RCT, placed a communication dated November 16, 2020 from the Ministry of Railways to the Principal Chief Commercial Manager, All India Railways, wherein it was stated that the pending cases were causing a huge loss to the railway exchequer.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “It is of common knowledge that most of the victims/deaths in the railway accident are mainly from socially disadvantageous strata of the society. Justice in real sense will have to be imparted to such helpless and hapless litigants.” The court further said, “It is equally important to note that due to pendency of such huge number of cases, Indian Railway is incurring huge expenditure in the form of interest due to long pendency of claim cases in various Benches of Railway Claims Tribunals. That itself is a loss to the Railway exchequer which can be avoided through expeditious disposal of claim cases by organising Lok Adalat.” Thereafter, the bench noted in its order, “Looking to the pendency of appeals in this Court, Registrar (Judicial) is directed to place this order before the Executive Chairman Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority, Mumbai for necessary directions in that regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/consider-national-lok-adalat-to-clear-pending-railway-claim-cases-hc-101640532338707.html
26-12-2021||Lucknow||Rajnath Singh lays foundation of BrahMos unit, defence technology centre in Lucknow||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday laid the foundation stone of the Defence Technology and Test Centre and BrahMos manufacturing centre that will be established by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Lucknow.Speaking on the occasion, Rajnath Singh said India wants to manufacture BrahMos missiles not to attack anyone, but to ensure that no other country has the audacity to cast an evil eye on it.The Yogi Adityanath government has allocated 200-acre land for the project in Lucknow. The BrahMos Manufacturing Centre, announced by BrahMos Aerospace, is a modern, state-of-art facility in the Lucknow node of Defence Industrial Corridor, Uttar Pradesh.The next generation BrahMos missiles will be manufactured here and this facility will be made operational in the next two-three years. Around 80-100 missiles will be manufactured at the Lucknow unit every year. Rajnath Singh expressed confidence that the foundation laying of the two units would herald a new chapter in defence manufacturing of the country, the economy of Uttar Pradesh and the city of Lucknow. He also said till date ₹1400 crore investment had been received in the Defence Corridor in Uttar Pradesh. Stressing the need to maintain nuclear deterrence, he said, “We want to manufacture BrahMos on Indian soil so that no country has the audacity to cast an evil eye on India.” The missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.“It has never been the character of India to attack any other country or grab even an inch of land of any country,” he said.Rajnath Singh also stated that India has attained a respectable position in areas of defence technologies, including the development of state-of-the-art missile systems in the last few years and has made commendable progress in building its defence industrial base.He slammed Pakistan of carrying out terror attacks in the country.“There is a neighbouring country. It got separated from India sometime back. I don’t know why its intentions vis-a-vis India are always bad. It committed acts of terrorism in Uri and Pulwama,” the defence minister said.“And then our Prime Minister took a decision and we went to the soil of that country and destroyed terrorist hideouts and when there was a need for airstrikes, we did that successfully,” he said.“We gave the message that if somebody dares to cast an evil eye on us, then not just on this side of the border, but we can go to the other side and hit them. This is India’s strength,” Rajnath added.India carried out a surgical strike in September 2016 and cross-border strike in February 2019 in response to terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama.The defence minister praised Yogi Adityanath for expediting land acquisition for the project.“When I spoke to Yogiji and expressed the desire to establish this project, he did not take a second and said land will be made available at the earliest. I thank the chief minister for making 200 acres available in just one and a half months,” he said.“This will provide jobs to people living in Lucknow and in UP. I can see that a new chapter has been added to the economy of Uttar Pradesh,” he added.Rajnath Singh stated that action against mafias and improved law and order scenario in the state has made Uttar Pradesh favourite destination for companies in India and abroad. Rajnath Singh, who represents Lucknow in Parliament, also said: “Uttar Pradesh is achieving new heights under chief minister Yogi Adityanath.”Rajnath Singh also listed development works of the state government, including expressways, flyovers and roads. “Before 2017, riots were common, criminals and mafias ruled the roost in the state. But today Uttar Pradesh’s law and order is being discussed in other states. ‘UP ki sarkar bhaut asardar’ is what others are saying,” said Rajnath Singh. The defence minister talked about the Yogi Adityanath government’s drive against mafias.“Bulldozers are busy and having a field day in Uttar Pradesh,” said Singh while pointing out demolition of mafia turned politician Atiq Ahmed’s establishments in Prayagraj. On the occasion, Singh also pointed out effective rollout of all welfare schemes of the Modi government by Yogi Adityanath in the state. Work has begun on six nodes of Defence Corridor in UP: YogiChief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said work had begun on all six nodes of the Defence Corridor in UP.Foundation laying of two units (BrahMos and Defence Technology Testing Centre) is fulfilment of the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ in the defence sector, Yogi Adityanath added. The chief minister added that these units would provide avenues for employment for youth.MSMEs have been promoted in the state in the last four and a half years, he further said.“UP has a strong MSME base and it will become an export hub,” the chief minister said after defence minister laid the foundation stone for a BrahMos unit and a defence technology and test centre in Lucknow. Yogi Adityanath also said 40 lakh (4 million) migrants returned to Uttar Pradesh during the pandemic and most of them were given jobs. DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy thanked the defence minister and the chief minister for making land available for the BrahMos project in the state capital. 
26-12-2021||Mumbai||Third wave may start if cases keep on rising for two more weeks: Experts||Mumbai The rise in the average daily cases in Mumbai this month has triggered one question- is it the beginning of the third wave already? Epidemiologists and health experts, who are closely monitoring the situation, said that if the rise continues for another two weeks, then the next wave has begun. For now, it looks like an expected surge due to social gatherings and crowding because of the festival and year-end celebrations. “A sustained rise for another two weeks will make it clear if the city has started seeing a fresh wave,” said epidemiologist and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. “If you plot the numbers on a graph, a sustained rise will show an upward curve, which will be an indicator of a wave. At the moment, the city authorities should closely watch the trend,” he said. Dr Lahariya said that every setting is likely to experience a different trend. For instance, while Mumbai and Delhi have recorded a spurt in cases over the past few days, the cumulative statistics from the country have not shown an upward trend. The rise in Mumbai’s average daily cases has been concerning. In the first week of December, the city’s average daily cases were 185. The number rose to 212 in the second week (Dec 7-14) and 270 in the third week (Dec 15-21). Worryingly, Mumbai five-day average between December 22 to 26 jumped to 671- a 148% rise compared to the previous week. “The rise was expected in presence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant,” said epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, who is also a member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI). “If we start translating these numbers into a graph, it will look like the beginning of a new wave. But we should wait and watch the trend,” he said. According to Dr Muliyil, what matters is whether the wave is of any consequence. “Globally, the Omicron variant is replacing the Delta variant, but it is causing a mild disease and has not led to an increase in hospitalisations. Given the immunity that Indians have with the exposure to the virus as well the vaccination, it’s likely that the new wave may not be of any consequence,” he said. Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said that the city’s current spurt is linked to the festivities and ongoing wedding season. “These are small, scattered cluster breakouts due to the high population density and the gatherings. We will have to closely monitor and contain these clusters and watch the trends in the coming weeks before labelling the spurt as a wave,” he said, adding that a fresh wave will have to be corroborated with rise in test positivity rate as well as lower doubling time. “For now, it is apt to call the rise in cases as a spurt,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/third-wave-may-start-if-cases-keep-on-rising-for-two-more-weeks-experts-101640529699048.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Kila Raipur readies for the birth of its library||Just days ago, my friend Paramjit Singh Grewal, who heads the Youth Club at Kila Raipur – the village known for the rural Olympics near Ludhiana, bombarded my phone with pictures, showcasing some construction work. As I patiently scanned through them, I was surprised, rather elated, for they were a perfect example of actions speak louder than words. Instantly, I was taken back to the after-dinner walks during my visits with the young minds of the club, two years ago, when we would go on talking about the library’s birth, with the help of villagers settled abroad. The seed of this discussion was sown as one evening we began counting gurdwaras of Kila Raipur. Sixteen in all, mostly built by NRIs with roots in the village. We wondered why they never came up with the idea of setting up a library. As we wandered that night under the starry sky on the silent streets, none of us knew that with that question the library would become our favourite topic, during almost every walk, inundating the air around with many creative thoughts, many of which are currently into play. After all, the club members have commenced meeting librarians, writers, poets, professors and even villagers – young and old for their suggestions and have initiated the collection of books and magazines, many sourced from homes, where they were just gathering dust. Excited, I have also compiled heaps of magazines and books from my own bookshelf and have asked many other book lovers to pitch in. I would also love to volunteer in the library as many other club members, chiefly when literary events would be organised, from writing contests to book meetings. This would be the village’s first public library and if the construction work continues as planned, it will be the most inspiring gift ever to the villagers on the upcoming Lohri festival in mid-January, and it would always offer free admission. It’s unfortunate that most villages and several towns are without a library. Books have the power to mould our minds, and eventually our lives. Laura Bush, the wife of former US President George W Bush, who has also been a librarian once concluded, “I have found the most valuable thing in my wallet is my library card.” Author JK Rowling too had a powerful epiphany for a library: “When in doubt, go to the library.” Words of Albert Einstein, which I recently came across on a school wall, also underline the library’s vitality in our lives. “The only thing that you absolutely have to know is the location of the library.” Hence, despite the discouragement from some villagers, who felt no one may visit the library, the youth club members went on to pursue their dream. A special thanks to everyone who supported them financially, especially NRIs from the village, who are now desperate to see their villagers becoming bibliophiles. Hopefully, other villages will follow suit as the birth of libraries will do wonders to infinite minds. Imagine their influence on youngsters! Even government bodies should play a big role in this direction. As Lilian Jackson Braun, an American writer, observed, “A library card is the start of a lifelong adventure.” I agree, for sure. rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor

Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state task force, said that the majority of this age group should be immunised within one-1.5 months. He also emphasised the completion of the vaccination of the eligible adult population with both doses. “In terms of children, we actually had asked for the vaccination of the 12-18 age group. But 15-18 years old has evolved as a subset. Through the task force I have requested the government to design a time-bound programme. I have suggested that in 1-1.5 months the majority of children could be immunised. Currently the age group is 15-18. So, let’s immunise the maximum number in this age group,” said Dr Sanjay Oak in Mumbai on Sunday.He also explained that paediatric inoculation will be carried out at government and private centres. “I am sure that in the upcoming days, the centre will also give permission to inoculate 12-14-year olds as well. To fight Omicron it was essential to begin the vaccination of this age group. Administration is completely ready for it. Which centres should be utilised are identified. Supply will be ensured by administration, but vaccine doses will be administered in government, private centres and also through some schools,” said Dr Oak. State Health minister Rajesh Tope also claimed that his department is ready to carry out the paediatric immunisation programme and to administer precautionary doses to health workers in the 60-plus age group with comorbidities. “When centres will issue the guidelines, and we are fully prepared to carry out these programmes. Public health department and its staff will implement it properly,” said Rajesh Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/timebound-covid-vax-programme-for-minors-needed-maharashtra-state-task-force-101640527599071.html

During the investigation, he revealed that the contraband was ordered for New Year’s parties to be held in south Mumbai and western suburbs.In light of this, ANC has activated all its human intelligence, as well a few officials, who will go as party revellers to unearth drug use and its source in the city. The NCB had recently used the same ploy to board the Cordelia cruise ship.According to the ANC, a Nigerian national, Boyega Abubakar, 47, was arrested near Mandvi BEST sub-station in the Masjid Bunder area at South Mumbai on Saturday. During the search, the police found 110 gram of cocaine worth ₹33 lakh in his possession. Abubakar came to Mumbai a few years ago for a garment business and later started dealing drugs. In another case, the agency arrested Imran Mohammad Sharif, 38, in BMC colony, Santosh Nagar, Dindoshi, Goregaon (East). As per the tip-off, police inspector Rupesh Naik of the Kandivali ANC unit and his team arrested scrap dealer Sharif in the Goregaon area on Saturday evening when he was carrying 1.10 kilograms of charas worth ₹ 30.30 lakh. The accused confessed that he brought the consignment from Uttar Pradesh. He further claimed that he was aware of who the consignment was to be delivered to in Goregaon before December 26 as the consignment is for some important party in the city. “We have been working to find out other suspects involved in the case,” said deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade of the ANC. “We are collecting information through an informant and also checking social media to get clues of any drug party in the city. We are closely monitoring a few suspicious places. Several teams have been prepared in all five ANC units of the city and are working from different ways to get information” added Nalawade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anc-arrests-two-seizes-drugs-worth-63l-meant-for-new-year-parties-101640527118621.html

According to the police, on January 6, 2021, a group of six men abducted a 21-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy, assaulted them and paraded them naked at Kajupada in Malad. The group also made a video of the parade and uploaded it on social media. After the duo were freed, they had approached the police station. After registering a case of assault and an attempt to murder, four of the accused were arrested. The officers then began tracing the two wanted accused but could not arrest them.In November, API Bharat Ghone tracked Dulgaj through a phone number. “However, Dulgaj was changing his locations constantly from Wadala to Thane and other places.

26-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah says BJP will score chauka with fourth win in 2022 UP polls||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the BJP, which won the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well as the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, would score a chauka (boundary) and register its fourth victory in 2022 UP polls.This time again, the BJP’s tally would cross the 300-seat mark in the 2022 UP polls, said Shah. He was addressing a rally in Kasganj where the BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatra reached on Sunday.Amit Shah said that all six Jan Vishwas Yatras, flagged off on December 19 and travelling through 403 assembly constituencies, were getting a warm welcome from supporters across the state. Kasganj is part of Etah parliamentary constituency from where former Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh governor and ex-UP chief minister the late Kalyan Singh, had been elected as MP.Amit Shah remembered Kalyan Singh and described him as a leader who let his chief minister’s post go (in 1992) when it came to the cause of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “The landslide victory for BJP in 2014, 2017 and 2019 would not have been possible if there was no Kalyan Singh,” said Amit Shah.“Kalyan Singh ji spoke of good governance within Uttar Pradesh for the first time. He worked towards giving rights to the backward society. Kalyan Singh ji chose Ram Janmabhoomi over the chief minister’s chair,” Amit Shah said.Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer Singh ‘Raju’, the current BJP MP from Etah, shared the stage with Amit Shah. The Union home minister also took a swipe at the Opposition parties in UP.“The regimes of Bua and Babua (Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav) in Uttar Pradesh did not do any development for the masses and were confined to caste-based politics and their own families. On the other hand, the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, has worked for all,” Amit Shah said.“During the past regime in UP before 2017, girl students used to stay away from schools, but in these five years of Yogi Adityanath’s tenure as CM, it is now the criminals who are leaving the state. Decades had passed but work on the Ram temple in Ayodhya could not begin. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was voted to power again in 2019 and the Ram temple construction became a reality,” said Amit Shah.He asked the crowd if they would vote for those against the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The home minister also referred to the recently inaugurated Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi.“The corridor of (Kashi) Vishwanath temple was deserted since the time of Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, but Modiji changed it all in Varanasi. Now, one carry ‘gangajal’ directly to the temple in Varanasi. The Congress, the SP and the BSP all, opposed but Modi abolished Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019. There was terrorism during Congress rule at the Centre, but Prime Minister carried out surgical strikes across the border when terrorists targeted Uri and Pulwama,” the home minister said.“Earlier, there used to be riots in Uttar Pradesh, but now medical colleges and expressways are coming up in Uttar Pradesh. Not a single riot has taken place in Yogi Adityanath’s rule in state. Incidents of loot, rape and kidnapping have gone down in UP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made free of cost vaccination for over 130 crore citizens of India a possibility,” Amit Shah said. Talking about development works in UP, he said, “Eighteen big schemes are being launched in the state. Thirty medical colleges and five expressways are coming up in Uttar Pradesh. Sugarcane farmers are being paid their due amount and 20 sugar mills are being modernized.” The Union home minister ended his speech with “Jai Sri Ram”. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, in his speech, highlighted that SP president Akhilesh Yadav did not pay tribute to “Babuji’ (Kalyan Singh) and asked his followers to avenge the insult to Singh who championed the cause of the backward castes.

As per the officials, each gun will be affixed atop a vehicle with a water tank and transported to different corners of the city where localised air pollution levels are high.The MCG has floated a tender in this regard, bids of which will be opened on December 28, they said, adding that the operation and maintenance of these machines will be outsourced.“Anti smog guns are one of the many measures we are looking to introduce in the city to reduce air pollution levels. We are procuring only four such machines at the start to gauge the extent of its impact before introducing it on a large scale manner,” said Subhash Yadav, district forest officer (DFO) who is also the nodal head for the environment and sustainability wing in the MCG.According to the detailed notice inviting tender for procuring the guns, it will cost the MCG ₹9.38 lakh.Each gun will be operated in an eight hour window, said the officials. Depending on the capacity of the water tank, each machine can work for at least four hours continuously, they said.Anti smog guns were trialled by the Delhi Government in December 2017 and have become a regular feature in the national capital ever since, in its “war on the pollution” campaign.Some MCG officials, though, are largely sceptical of the move. “The four guns have been ordered so as to show the central authorities that we are taking various measures to bring down localised air pollution levels in Gurugram. The MCG is any way sprinkling water on the ground. Dispersing water in the atmosphere through anti-smog guns is thus redundant and a waste of money,” said a senior MCG official, seeking anonymity.Experts said that the MCG should focus on initiatives that have scientifically been proven to bring down air pollution levels. “There is no proper scientific study carried out to analyse and determine the impact of anti-smog guns. Instead, the MCG should focus on Grap measures that have shown positive results on checking air pollution,” said Suneel Pandey, director of environment and waste management division at TERI School of Advanced Studies. An anti-smog gun works similar to rain. In this, high pressurised water also known as atomised water is sprayed in the atmosphere, around 40-50 metres in height, to bring down pollutants, suspended particles, and dust.

That’s the message a new children book tries to put across. Written by Pritisha Borthakur, Puhor and Niyor’s Mural of Family Stories portrays diverse families as seen by the eyes of the author’s twin sons Puhor and Niyor. It speaks of families with two mothers, two dads, multiracial families, single parents, family with adopted children and more. “Usually, we are told or shown about families as being units with grandparents, a father and mother and their children. But there are other kinds of families too and each of them is beautiful and unique in their own way,” said Borthakur, a former journalist who’s also an entrepreneur. Born and brought up in Assam, Borthakur, who’s based in Delhi these days, earlier penned a collection of poems. She wants her children and others to be compassionate towards each other and also know about unconventional families and other overlooked aspects of society.“We sometimes see children from unconventional families getting bullied. I wanted to portray these families so that children and parents understand that all kinds of families can be happy units and there should be no discrimination,” she said at the official launch of the book in Guwahati recently. The book has small stories like that of Demetria and her brother Isaac -children of a transgender couple, Ms Baruah who lives with her cats and consider them her family, Saheil-an Israeli child adopted by Chinese parents, Elvis-who’s mom is white and father is brown and a couple with Down Syndrome. “This anthology of stories illustrated through beautiful graphic is an inimitable effort at showcasing the diversity that exists in a modern society and implanting the idea of cohesion in young minds,” wrote Kuladhar Saikia, president of Asom Sahitya Sabha, Assam’s premier literary body, in the foreword to the book. “The one striking feature of the illustrative book is the simplicity of style. No attempt has been made to complicate the issues by useless elaboration. The intricate questions are left to be answered at a later date when they mature,” he adds. Eminent Assamese author and Sahitya Academy Award recipient Rita Chowdhury said the book will help children understand how families can be of different compositions and all of them can be accepted. “Some families try to hide issues like children who are autistic or adopted. This is a great step as this book talks about those children and their families. I would encourage Pritisha to publish this book in Assamese and other languages so that this conversation reaches all,” said child rights activist Miguel Das Queah. The book available online since September has already sold nearly 9,000 of the first edition of 10,000 copies in India and abroad. Nearly 4,000 copies have been sold in UK, UAE, Germany and Australia. Several schools in India have purchased copies for their libraries and the publisher Author’s Channel is in talks with schools in Delhi, Dubai and Bangalore to include it in their curriculum. A second edition is underway and Asom Sahitya Sabha is interested in translating it into Assamese soon. 
26-12-2021||Pune||Your Space: There is much to fear of Covid spread, little to gain from reopening schools||Is it wise to reopen schools now amid the apprehension of a possible third wave and the new Omicron variant hovering above us? Some readers say that it is not advisable to reopen schools and online education must continue, while others say that there is ample scientific and epidemiological evidence to indicate it is safe to reopen schools for children of all ages Not advisable to resume offline classes With the Omicron variant spreading fast and wide, it is not advisable to resume offline classes at school. Students are in the vulnerable age group that has not been vaccinated yet. Since the virus is airborne, going to physical school involves many touch points that cannot be avoided. Starting from boarding the school bus, attending classes with teachers, students coming from all over the city, eating lunch, walking the corridors and all the other activities that are part and parcel of being at school with peers. Recently, in an international school in the city, it so happened that the student was covid positive but parents did not inform the school. Such irresponsible actions are unexpected but happening around us. This shows the sheer desperation to be part of normal life. In another incident, someone tested positive but did not inform the house help, unaware she went to other houses to work. Each of us has to be extra vigilant and committed to maintain high standards of hygiene and safe distance when tested positive. If educated and well-informed citizens fail to do their part, how can we be sure about others who already refuse to follow simple protocols such as wearing masks and not spitting because they assume Covid is gone. Schools can achieve safe schooling only with 100% support from parents, staff, and students. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Lack of awareness, transparency, due diligence and honesty is causing anxiety and can cost a life. Children have been resilient so far but we must not forget that the virus is evolving too. My child attended in person school 4 days a week in October and after the Diwali break, but after hearing about the unreported positive cases, I won’t take a chance. It will be online schooling until the end of the school year. Better safe than sorry, better late than never. Anuja Bali Students can go to malls but not schools Maharashtra Education Minister for Schools, Varsha Gaikwad has hinted at the possibility of shutting schools again due to the rising cases of the new Covid-19 variant that has escalated throughout Maharashtra. We will resort to protest if schools were shut again. Schools were closed in March 2020 following the outbreak of the pandemic. While it was decided that schools would reopen in the city from December 1, it was postponed to December 15 due to the detection of the Omicron variant. What is the rationale behind allowing children to enter malls, attend parties, go to movies and travel, but not attend schools? Sameer Nagavde We will protest if schools remain shut It is our demand that children of all classes be allowed to go back to school for physical classes. As parents we will not accept the closing of schools. In other cities across the country, schools have reopened and are running, Parents should decide if they want to send their children to schools or not. Parents will take to the streets and there will be protests if schools are closed again as there is no threat of Covid-19 and it is all but media propaganda being carried out to keep citizens in fear. There has been a good percentage of vaccination and hence it is not at all dangerous for school kids. Ahil Khan Reopening schools will put children at risk Education is an important aspect of our growth and development. Education is something that forms our personality. Educating the young minds in a free and happy environment is equally important. Covid-19 has changed the entire dimension of human life and co – existence. We have faced the various challenges related to Covid-19 and its variants like delta, mucor mycosis, omicron, etc. We have learnt that life is precious and we are the ones who need to take d precautions to safeguard our life and the life of our near and dear ones. We managed the online and offline options of work from home, study from home, etc. The starting of schools and colleges for students seems to be important from the point of view of education and their overall development. Students form an integral part of our society and their right formation leads to a strong society. But due to the rise of Omicron cases in India especially in Maharashtra is a major cause of concern now. If students of Class 1 to 7 need to go to school, the parents, guardians, school and private transport systems and many others have to be actively involved. This will surely lead to a lot of preparations as the students are totally dependent on various mechanisms to reach school, thus leading to a high risk. The Covid protocols of wearing a mask and physical distancing are especially forgotten and public places seem to be places of high risk for children. Many countries are heading towards lockdown again. It will be wise to be cautious and curb the problem when it is peeping up again in the form of Omicron. Students of Class 1 to 7 can still continue online education. We can strengthen our online education for this academic year. We could allow the third wave and related risk to pass on and become better equipped to face this pandemic by keeping our children safe. The students need to grow in a happy and safe environment so we need to support our vaccination drives and put our systems in order instead of creating chaos by opening schools. Dr Vilas Adhav Don’t hurry to reopen schools The reopening of schools will be risky, with the Omicron variant. We have been patient with online education so far and should not hurry in opening the schools. The children will be at risk of getting the virus. There is surge in cases. When we are talking of curbs, restrictions for elders why are we risking the lives of children by opening the school.

Here are some tips by Zareen Shaukat Shaikh, pastry chef and Instructor: *Sift dry ingredients like flour, baking powder or soda. This is aeration, which gives your sponge a light texture*Use ingredients at room temperature*When whisking eggs, start at a low speed, and gradually increase it. This causes proper aeration which results in a fluffy sponge*Bake at a correct temperature so that your cake doesn’t sink or become dense*Replace milk with buttermilk - this causes an acidic reaction, which equals to a lighter and fluffier sponge*Do not over mix your flour and do not over fold your batter. If you do this, your sponge will be extremely rubbery.The chef believes cake decoration is the most daunting and important task, it is what will make or break your cake, because at first glance, people will see your creation. “Personally, I prefer to keep it classy, and elegant, and not overdo things, when it comes to beautifying a cake.

26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala’s eligible population fully vaccinated||Days before the year comes to a close, Ambala has become the second district in Haryana, to have fully vaccinated its eligible population of 8,50,360 adults. The development comes just three days after Gurugram achieved the feat.Officials said a total of 9,10,378 (107 %) beneficiaries have received the first dose and 8,54,695 (100.5%) have been administered the second dose till Saturday 4 pm.Deputy commissioner Vikram said it’s a moment of pride for Ambala. The district had managed to fully inoculate half of its eligible population by September 14, just nine months after the vaccination drive started countrywide. In about 100 days after the feat, it covered rest of its eligible population. The achievement comes just days after the state government banned the entry of partially vaccinated residents into public places from January 1. How it managed the featCivil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said that since the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (door-to-door) drive started on November 8, the staff has administered three lakh doses, covering mostly those residents who were due for their second dose.“We gave them doses after prayers at religious places, during festivals in markets and at parks during morning or evening walking hours. Mobile teams were stationed at crowded places like old cloth market, showrooms etc. Our female staff have even camped outside liquor vends to cover the target,” Dr Singh added.Ambala, the home constituency of health minister Anil Vij, has rarely faced a shortage of vaccines. Even if it did, extra vials were borrowed from neighbouring districts within hours, people familiar with the vaccination process said. Dr Sunidhi, the vaccination in-charge of Ambala, said, “In the age group of 18-44, we have covered 5,48,691 beneficiaries of the 5,46,660 eligible (100.37%), 1,83,110 of 1,82,220 (100.49%) in the age bracket of 45-59 years and in the group above 60 years, 1,22,480 persons have been fully vaccinated as against 1,21,480 (100.82%) of the eligible population.” In the past year, the health workers fighting on two fronts, the invisible virus and reaching out for vaccines, have faced it all -- laxity to take a dose, resistance in rural belts and finding the untraced beneficiaries for the second dose. Not only this, the vaccine staff was allegedly ‘boycotted’ by a few panchayats and faced stone-pelting by a group of vendors too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambalas-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-101640472448340.html

The Delhi special cell team also visited the district court complex in Ludhiana to investigate the crime scene in connection with the recent blast at the Rohini Court in Delhi.

26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Malhar Road project misses Christmas deadline||It was hardly a merry Christmas for commuters with traffic moving at snail’s pace on Malhar Road on Saturday as labourers hammered away on the construction project, which has breezed past its December-25 deadline. The construction work coupled with diversions created by the municipal corporation meant that traffic snarls were the order of the day. With residents making a beeline for the church near the Sarabha Nagar market on Christmas day, and shoppers catching up with their Christmas and New Year’s eve shopping, the stretch was chock-a-block with vehicles. It did not help that construction work is also taking place on the Ferozepur Road and Pakhowal Road railway crossing, which has increased traffic on Malhar Road. Commuters had little choice but to take a detour through Model Town Extension and Malhar Road to enter Sarabha Nagar with the entry from Pakhowal Road Railway Crossing blocked due to the railway underbridge and overbridge projects. Residents exasperated With the MC blocking certain intersections and roads for re-carpeting, traffic chaos ensued. Gurkirat Singh, a resident of BRS Nagar, said, “Recently, the civic body had blocked the intersection near Welkom Palace. Road portions are blocked without intimating residents. Commuters have to take detours and a lot of time is wasted in traffic jams. Authorities should have made arrangements to streamline the flow of traffic on Christmas. Instead, the snarls were worse.” Residents demanded that the project be expedited as already two years have elapsed. The delay has also given fodder to the Opposition to take digs at the ruling Congress government. They have slammed the government for reducing the width of the Malhar Road, which is the busiest in the city. A local, Palwinder Singh, said, “All the ongoing projects have missed their deadlines, be it the Malhar Road, Pakhowal Road railway overbridge project or the Ferozepur elevated road project. Commuting is a nightmare, but authorities are not paying heed to the problem. Sometimes, at least 15 minutes are wasted standing in traffic on Malhar Road.” Shopkeepers a harried lotShopkeepers have also been facing a harrowing time due to the construction work as the regular traffic jams have hit business. They have been complaining of lack of parking space, pedestrian paths, and cycling tracks. A manager at one of the eateries on the stretch, Anil, said,”There was already a shortage of parking space, which has been further reduced due to construction work. We appreciate that the market is being transformed, but authorities must finish the project well in time. Project almost complete: MC commissioner MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that the project to transform Malhar road into a smart road was almost complete, and the road was being re-carpeted. Two-year delayThe project, which was initiated under the Smart City Mission in July 2019, has missed several deadlines. The project missed its May 2020 due to the coronavirus, and also bypassed the September 2020 deadline. After holding a meeting with officials on December 4, Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had set December 25 as the deadline for completing the project. However, officials could not meet the deadline, much to the chagrin of commuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-malhar-road-project-misses-christmas-deadline-101640472150565.html

Acting on his complaint, police has registered a case under Sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to public servant) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 39 police station. Kalra accuses MC employees of assaulting him After the case was registered against him, Kalra told police that the XEN and SDE, along with the employees of the MC, had attacked him. He alleged that Garg had slapped him multiple times and hit him in the stomach while Jagdeep tried to hit him with a shovel lying close by.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/supervisor-of-private-firm-held-for-assault-on-chandigarh-mc-officials-101640472148336.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | The leopard hush up||Come winter, poachers lay notorious clutch-wire traps along game trails to slaughter herbivores and leopards. However, the wildlife field staff, on certain occasions, tend to brush the poaching incident under the carpet by ascribing chain-link fencing or other accidental contingencies to leopards getting caught. The most recent case was of a male leopard found writhing in a clutch-wire trap in the Noorpur Bedi area of Roopnagar district on Wednesday. One end of the trap was tied to the chain-link fencing protecting a farmhouse. Though the leopard was rescued successfully by a tranquilliser gun team from Chhatbir zoo, the Roopnagar Wildlife Preservation Division DFO and Range Officer diverted attention by putting out a statement in the media the same day that the leopard had got trapped in chain-link fencing, omitting mention of the clutch-wire trap which had actually encircled the leopard around the waist. Not only this, the field staff failed to seize the wires and contraption used for the game trap from the spot. A species accorded the highest protection under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the clutch-wire trap had warranted that the incident to be treated as one of attempted poaching and registration of a case. Instead, the incident was treated as a kind of natural mishap.This kind of an incident, of which several have taken place in the wider region over the years involving clutch-wire traps, would have been relegated to oblivion once again, thereby encouraging poachers. However, Punjab Chief Wildlife Warden RK Mishra got wind of the bungling at the ground level and he stepped in. “I saw the videos of the trapped leopard and also got feedback from my sources. I am convinced it indeed was a case of attempted poaching not merely an entanglement in chain-link fencing. I have directed the field officials to initiate an inquiry and not let the matter rest,” Mishra told this writer. Lynching a skink, raises no stink With understanding comes not just empathy but fond attachment. Ignorance promotes the very opposite, including recourse to thoughtless, murderous violence. My evening game at the Chandigarh Club’s squash court since May 2021 was, on occasion, disrupted by a little skink or legless lizard that householders label as ‘baamani’ or ‘saanp ki mausi’. We find them slithering about in our gardens and staging a furtive entry into the house.This skink at the squash court would be found lost in the court having wandered from hiding places in the crevices. The sound of the ball thumping the wall and tin base would terrify her no end as she vainly sought an escape from infernal din. Apprehensive of her safety, I would halt the game and chaperon her to outside the court where she would scamper into a crevice, only to surface after a few weeks right in the middle of the court, befuddled, and in danger of being squashed under shoes.As misfortune would have it, I came across my little friend on Thursday evening. She lay still, no din or looming giants (humans) would ever rouse her again. She had been bludgeoned to death by someone, apprehending her to be a venomous, snake-like reptile. Fact of the matter is skinks are a group of lizards, pure carnivores and gulp down or swallow prey (insects) just like house lizards. However, due to ignorance, slithering skinks are confused with venomous snakes and killed though they do not possess a bite toxic to humans. India is home to 62 species of skinks.The luckless skink lay woebegone and friendless, so lonely in a brutal end. It reminded me of the poor, hungry vagabond, who had been lynched and hacked to death by a mob at the Kapurthala gurdwara recently under the false incitement of sacrilege. I did not want my friend’s body to lie so bereft. It would also encourage people to kill such creatures. I bundled her into a fallen winter leaf and placed her outside in a quiet flower bed. RIP my dainty, innocent gal; forgive your murderers if you can, for they do not know what they do. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-leopard-hush-up-101640471669075.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||In aftermath of Ludhiana blasts, Mohali ups vigil, all eateries to close by 11pm||Amid heightened security concerns following the blast at the Ludhiana court complex, Mohali police carried out searches of public places in the district on Saturday. Police teams, with dog squad and anti-sabotage team, carried out searches in markets, restaurants, malls and under-construction buildings on Saturday. Police parties conducted checks at Zirakpur, Mohali as well as Kharar that are emerging as night-party spots in the district. It may be mentioned that Chandigarh police is already enforcing the orders issued by district magistrate wherein no club, eatery or restaurant is allowed to remain open after midnight. Of late, a trend has been noticed where party-goers shift to Zirakpur and Mohali. “Most party goers shift to Mohali after Chandigarh’s commercial activity closes. To check this practice, the administration has decided to close down eateries at 11 pm,” shared a senior official in Mohali administration. “The checking of public spaces will continue in future as well to ensure safety of residents in wake of the festive season,” added the senior official in Mohali administration. “The vigil has been increased to ensure that no untoward incident takes place in the district,” said senior superintendent of police, Mohali, Navjot Singh Mahal. He added that all restaurants, eating joints have been asked to close by 11 pm so that revellers do not create nuisance in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-aftermath-of-ludhiana-blasts-mohali-ups-vigil-all-eateries-to-close-by-11pm-101640471428688.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Now, 60 is indeed the new 40||The new-age adage ‘60 is the new 40’ has rapidly gained popularity, so when a friend parroted the elliptical comment, I decided to scratch below its surface.If one were to paraphrase the adage it means a 60-year-old person in the present times is at par, in terms of energy and passion, with their 40-year-old counterpart in the olden days. It also implies that people now appear much younger than their biological age. This is because youthfulness is prolonged with the help of medical advancements, internet-enabled seamless flow of information, cosmetics, salons and spas. Indeed, one could not guess that my retired colleagues have crossed 60 years of age. Not only do the elderly look younger, the easy flow of information and the internet have also given them the perspective of a youngster, thereby bridging the generation gap. In sync with the times, one would be hard pressed to find a truly old fashioned person. Earlier, the older generation, comprising our parents and grandparents, used to be wary of new trends and distrustful of the latest technologies. Our parents did not splurge as much on their clothes and tresses. Our grandparents were even more frugal. Not any more. Nowadays, a 60-year-old person is as trendy and fashionable as a young adult. Salons and spas have sprung up in every nook and corner, and older people can be seen getting facials and dying their hair to get a face lift. No longer does cataract blur the vision of the old, as medical procedures keep their eyes keen,no longer do older people haunch over canes, they simply get a new pair of knees, and sophisticated dentistry keeps them smiling brightly. Information Technology has certainly been a great equaliser. The internet has levelled the playing field, where merely being younger yields no advantage. Information is available to one and all on equal footing. Social media has also diluted the age gap to some extent. An age gap of 15 years in adults is insignificant. The age brackets of 20-35, 30-45, 40-55 are essentially the same. A 45-yera-old mother looks almost as youthful as her 20-year-old daughter, and a 20-year age gap is no impediment to friendship, as everyone is on the same wavelength. A person of 50 exudes the same energy, same keenness, same confidence as a 30-year-old. I can tell from my own experience that I bond well with persons even two decades younger to me, provided they are somewhat like-minded. To top it all, a curiosity to learn, keenness to travel, passion to pursue hobbies, and uninhibited approach to fun, keep the heart young forever. chander59@icloud.com ( The writer is a Panchkula-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-now-60-is-indeed-the-new-40-101640471308626.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Walking the tight rope of keeping students online, in-line||‘Am I audible’, ‘Turn your camera on’, ‘Please mute yourselves’ ‘Who’s there?’ are just a few of the phrases that teachers find themselves repeating a handful times each day in the new normal, where a computer screen separates them from their pupils. The virtual interactions between teachers and students are far from perfect, though we maintain the farce of ‘everything being alright.’ The other day when my friend’s son was attending his online class, he was asked a simple question related to wildlife, which I felt was apt as per his age and grade. However, rather than confidently answering the question, he crumbled and simply turned off the mike and camera. To my utter surprise, he had a Plan B, and later simply told the teacher that the internet connection had been cut off.This is just the surface of the problems, not only are teachers confronted with fibs such as the one told by my friend’s son, but also flabbergasting, impertinent and cheesy comments. The pandemic has given the students a convenient excuse to slink out of an uncomfortable situation, rather than facing it head-on. Students are turning hostile due to improper redressal and problem solving. It certainly is an alarming situation to see the future of the country turning tail at the slightest challenge.Cheating and copying have become an integral component of our novel education transmission system. The role of the parents is also changing from that of enforcers to defenders. Dashing into the online classrooms, sneaking out after giving them a clue in the exams and getting into unnecessary debates with teachers has become far too common. This is unfortunate as the whole concept of learning and education revolves around character building. As Swami Vivekananda, rightly said, “Education is the manifestation of perfection already in the man.” Thus, a teacher’s job is only to polish the deep rooted credentials. Our character is what we do when we think no one is watching, and online classes are best examples of character manifestations. The missing ingredient in our current education system is inculcation of moral values, irrespective of any strata – primary or secondary. This void has shown its true colours in the non-personal contact mode of content delivery. The greatest fear is that misconduct traverses into delinquency in no time and is catalysed by the irresponsible attitude of parents and ignorant behaviour of some tutors. Appropriate social behaviour and etiquettes are not desirable features, but essential requirements to sustain and progress. Time is ripe, to act together and ensure that in any system of education delivery; students, our prospective nation builders, stay in line!(The writer is an associate professor at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-walking-the-tight-rope-of-keeping-students-online-inline-101640471008433.html

However, no fatality was reported on the day. The tricity had last seen over 30 cases in July. Of the total 36 cases, Mohali contributed the maximum, 17, cases which was also the district’s highest daily tally since July. Chandigarh had 10 cases while Panchkula had nine new infections on the day. For the past 21 days, the tricity has been consistently logging cases in double-digits. On Friday, it had reported 18 cases. In Mohali, 16 cases were reported from Mohali (urban), while one surfaced in Kharar. Chandigarh’s infections were reported from Sectors 19, 29, 32, 37, 40, 45 and 48.BSF camp in Mohali reports 15 cases, declared containment zoneOf the 17 positive cases reported in Mohali on Saturday, 15 are BSF jawans from BSF Lakhanur campus. “We have converted the campus into a containment zone. Health authorities will be collecting samples of all people on campus,” said Mohali deputy commissioner Isha Kalia. Mohali civil surgeon Adarsh Pal Kaur, said, “Majority of the cases are from a single campus, which caused the spike. We will be sending the samples for genome testing as well.” At 215, tricity’s active cases also highest since JulyWith the fresh infection tally increasing in tricity, the active case count also climbed to 215 on Saturday, against 195 on Friday.

Even the daily positivity count increased on Saturday as Mohali and Chandigarh’s positivity rate crossed 1%.‘Crowded gatherings inviting surge’“In December, events like marriages, parties and international tourism increase. Also in Chandigarh, we had election rallies this month. The crowded gatherings, where Covid-appropriate behaviour went for a toss, are now causing a surge in cases. But, it’s not too late to avert the third wave. People must follow basic rules like wearing a mask, maintaining social distance and getting vaccinated against the disease as it will control the transmission,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-area-logs-36-new-covid-cases-highest-in-five-months-101640470768328.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Here’s to 2022, the year of hope||The United Nations has declared the new year as the international year of artisanal fisheries and aquaculture, but truly 2022 should be celebrated as the year of hope, after two years of Covid-induced travails. In the new year, all nations will continue their unrelenting fight against that invisible and almost invincible enemy, the coronavirus, and the numerous variants it has spawned. With only 46% of the global population fully inoculated against Covid, the battle is far from won. Till around 80% of the world is fully inoculated, we are not safe. Convincing the non-believers, the anti-vaxxers, will be the biggest hurdle to surmount in the new year. At the same time, developed countries must also help developing countries who have merely inoculated 3-4% of their populations. The political tug of war On the global political stage, US president Joe Biden will continue to remain the pivotal global leader. Despite the temporary hiccups his party is facing, he will stand tall. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin will plough a lonely furrow, needling Ukraine needlessly. Putin’s people love him, his dolls sell on the streets of Moscow.The real conflict will be through the translucent ‘bamboo curtain’ between the USA and China. China will continue its aggrandisements, especially in Asia and Africa, by funding infrastructure project, peeving America with its expansionist policies. However, the Chinese have fat wallets,and they will continue to spend. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will continue to obfuscate his people, but will thrive. The new German leadership may struggle, without Angela Merkel as the chancellor. Polls will be fought in India, while Afghanistan will struggle to find money. Hopefully, there will be no wars. We need to fight hunger and poverty, which have augmented of the last two years. Economic disparitiesThe IMF has predicted a growth rate of 4.9% in 2022. With Covid variants harassing the world, its effects remain to be seen on the global economy. While the US economy could grow around 3%, China with its zero-Covid policy could grow by around 5%. Overall, the global economy could suffer a setback of around 3%. Developing countries will continue to lag. Economic disparities are sure to widen. As per Oxfam, the richest 1% of the world’s population has more than twice the wealth with 6.9 billion people. Around 811 million people sleep hungry every night and 2 billion people suffer from malnutrition. The agony and poverty suffered by citizens, cannot be gleaned through digits. People have lost faith, family members, homes, livelihoods, savings, during the last two years. Migrant labourers who fled to their countries are yet to return. The world needs at least three years to shave of the ghosts of the coronavirus. Real estate prices will remain low. The stock markets will oscillate anxiously, depending on new mutants of the coronavirus. Gold prices will hover around USD 1,875 to 1,900 per ounce, though its future is uncertain. Oil prices will dance, but hold steady at around USD 60 to 70 per barrel. Inflation will give the world sleepless nights. Expect to pay more for food in 2022. Climate change will dominate conclaves, with scarce action, while Greta Thunberg will fume. International travel may lubricate the global economy, with quarantines and Covid-passes. Nations should undertake rigorous reviews of their health resources. People across the world have died waiting for hospital beds, medicines, vaccines, and oxygen.Priority should be given to establishing hospitals, beds, ICUs, medical colleges, and nursing institutes. Global growth is meaningless for the 124 million people punched below the poverty line of 2 USD per day, during the pandemic. 2022 should be the year of humane economics, where the poor override polemics. Football and James BondThe world will relish the FIFA football matches in Qatar. However, Latino fans will have to forego their beers, shorts, and spaghetti strap dresses. Qatar frowns on alcohol and revealing apparel. The new hunger for medals in developing countries, will find satiation at the Commonwealth Games. Novak Djokovic will break new records. India will re-seek cricketing glory at ICC championship.The world will be hunting for a new James Bond, since Daniel Craig has bowed out. Cinema famished fans, will troop into theatres.Hope in 2022 depends on conquering Covid, mending fences between America and China, managing climate change, spurring economic growth and reducing disparities. Hopefully, leaders will listen.My soulmate, Patricia and I, hope for a Corona free world. Then, we can go for long walks among the pine forests in the mountains. We are happy with the cold air, silences and white clouds around us. It has been a long time since Patricia and I held hands and walked endlessly, as soft, white, snowflakes waft down. It is heavenly.rkaneja@anejamanagement.com(The author is a Mumbai-based freelance writer)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-here-s-to-2022-the-year-of-hope-101640470231689.html

26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Seeking tribal status, Himachal’s Hatti community holds ‘khumblis’ in Sirmaur||The central Hatti committee held “Khumblis” in the Trans-Giri region of Sirmaur on Saturday. The committee has units in village panchayats and all tehsils. The Hatti community passed a resolution demanding the Prime Minister to grant Scheduled Tribe status to the community on par with those living in the tribal Jaunsar–Bawar in neighbouring Uttarakhand. The Jaunsar-Bawar region of Uttarakhand was granted tribal status in 1967. Jaunsar-Bawar and the Hatti dominated the regions, both were part of the erstwhile Sirmaur state. The people of the Trans-Giri area of Sirmaur district have been demanding tribal status on the pattern of the Jaunsar-Bawar area of Uttarakhand for the last 54 years. The Trans-Giri and Jaunsar-Bawar area were part of erstwhile Sirmaur princely state and both have unique similarities in all aspects. The Hatti community had for long been demanding tribal status, but to no avail.The Hatti community in Himachal Pradesh have warned the state government that it will hold agitation if the Central government does not meet its demand for granting tribal status to 144 panchayats in the remote region of the backward Sirmaur district. The community held the “Khumblis”, the congregations, in all 144 panchayats to press for their demand. “We are demanding tribal status for the Trans-Giri region for the last five decades. Our traditional lifestyles and topography are similar to that of Jaunsar- Bawar. The government should consider it seriously or else the community will be forced to resort to agitation,” said Ami Chand Kamal, 65, a retired professor of political science who heads the central Hatti committee. “I have corresponded with the Prime Minister’s office numerous times. The government is taking too long to fulfil our demands,” he said. The dominant Hatti community is spread in four assembly segments of Sirmaur district -- Paonta Sahib, Renuka, Shillai and Pacchad. It comprises about 2.76 lakh people.“The resolutions passed in the Khumblis will be sent to the Prime Minister’s office and the registrar general of India’s office through the state government,” Kamal said. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur himself had raised the demand with Union home minister Amit Shah. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was BJP’s national president in 2014, had announced to grant Schedule Tribe status to the Hatti community in a political rally in Nahan.“The issue is not related only to granting tribal status but there is growing concern about the future of our children. There is backwardness and job avenues are few,” said Balbir Singh Chauhan of Kuhnt village in the Shillai assembly segment.The representatives of the Hatti community made repeated representations to the Central government. The state government had submitted its recommendations to the Union ministry of tribal affairs in August 2016 on the basis of a study conducted by the Tribal Affairs Institute, Shimla. In 2016, the state government headed by then chief minister Virbhadra Singh moved a case to the Centre for granting tribal status to the Trans-Giri region, Dodra Kwar in Rohru. In 2018, the ministry of tribal affairs wrote back to the state government saying that details provided in the ethnography report about the Hatti community were not “sufficient”. The government had written to the state to re-examine the proposal for the inclusion of the Hatti community in the list of Scheduled Tribes and had further recommended the government to conduct a full-fledged ethnographic study.

The event will pose life risk to scores of people who would gather for the Prime Minister’s rally,” said state party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore while addressing the media in Shimla. He said his party will submit a memorandum to the governor to condemn BJP’s four-year regime.He claimed that the state’s finances were in the red, while the government was extravagantly spending on government functions. He said the government has erected big banners and billboards on the roadside in the state.Rathore claimed that the government has issued directions to the district administration and officials to ensure that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally scheduled for December 27 is well attended. Rathore alleged that the government has raised a ₹1,000 crore loan to celebrate its four years’ regime in Himachal. “We are not opposed to Prime Minister’s visit, but against the unnecessary spending,” he said, adding that the state’s debt burden has exceeded ₹65,000 crore.He said the Congress was preparing a charge-sheet to highlight the “misdeeds” of the state government.“The party will come out with a charge-sheet after six months. All the charges will be substantiated with facts,” Rathore also underplayed factional war in the party. Eight legislators owing allegiance to Naduan legislator Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu had recently met the AICC in-charge of party affairs, Rajiv Shukla, in New Delhi demanding a change of guard in the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-hits-out-at-jai-ram-thakur-over-mandi-event-101640469513391.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||On Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniv, Jai Ram Thakur unveils his statue in Manali||On the occasion of the 97th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur unveiled the statue of the former Prime Minister at the Mall Road, Manali, in Kullu district on Saturday. Later, the chief minister addressed a public meeting at Prini, Vajpayee’s village, and said the people of Kullu district in particular and people of the state, in general, were fortunate that Vajpayee had special love and benevolence for the state and its people. He said despite his busy schedule as Prime Minister, Vajpayee visited Prini every year. He said for a few days the entire government used to function from this small village. He said due to the special benevolence of the Prime Minister, the state got liberal assistance from the Centre. Jai Ram Thakur said even Vajpayee’s political opponents would come to listen to his speeches and loved his art of oratory. He said the Atal Tunnel was the vision of the former Prime Minister which has virtually transformed the economy of the tribal district of Lahaul-Spiti and which was strategically important. He said this vision of the former Prime Minister was converted into reality by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he dedicated this tunnel to the nation on October 3, 2020. The chief minister said this tunnel has opened a new vista of development in Lahaul and Spiti district. He said the day was celebrated as ‘Sushasan Divas’, adding that several schemes of the state government had been named after Vajpayee as a mark of respect to the former Prime Minister. He said the state government would provide all possible help to further promote the Atal Gyan Kendra scheme as this would be a befitting tribute to the former Prime Minister. Jai Ram Thakur said the present state government was completing four years of its present term on the 27th of this month and the Prime Minister was gracing the occasion by addressing a massive gathering at the historic Paddal Ground, Mandi. He also urged people to attend the mega event as the Prime Minister would be inaugurating and laying foundation stones of projects worth ₹11,281 crore for the people of the state. Thakur also paid floral tributes to Vajpayee. He announced ₹20 lakh for the construction of a community centre at Prini village, ₹10 lakh for the construction of Janjghar in Prini. He also announced ₹2 lakh for the local yuvak mandal for the purchase of cricket and volleyball kits from his discretionary fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/on-atal-bihari-vajpayee-s-birth-anniv-jai-ram-thakur-unveils-his-statue-in-manali-101640469511068.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh gets into action for Swachh Survekshan 2022||From a dedicated project management team to creating an “atmanirbhar” ward to bringing in behavioural change regarding sanitation, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has started implementing a comprehensive plan to ensure a major turnaround for the city in the Swachh Survekshan 2022 (SS22). In the Swachh Survekshan 2021, Chandigarh’s rank dropped from 8 to 16 among 48 cities with population above 10 lakhs, and overall, it stood at a lowly 66th rank in the country. Its score also dipped from 83% to 71%. The issue went on to become a major issue in the MC election, with parties indulging in blame game over the city’s poor show in rankings. Changing its strategy from the past years, the MC is now working to improve the city’s performance on all the 150-odd parameters in the survey. “The thrust areas of the plan are to give a major uplift to ground-level garbage management infrastructure, make citizens active participants in the city’s sanitation and create an institutional setup, within the MC, dedicated to issues related to the Swachh Survekshan,” said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra. The SS22 will be undertaken for the period April 2021 to March 2022. Actionable points have to be done by December 31. The deadline for completion of the documentation is January 31. The Survekshan will be done after February 15 when onsite survey will be done by the Centre’s independent teams. Under the survey, cities’ performance is assessed on 150 parameters, in six segments. Notably, in a meeting last month, UT adviser Dharam Pal had fixed responsibility of different UT department regarding Survekshan. Dedicated team The MC has created a project management team, drawing people with the desired skill-set from the MC and Chandigarh Smart City Ltd. “Our field teams of engineering department and medical officer of health (MOH) are the implementing agencies and are accountable for successful execution of different works. We cannot expect them to create awareness among the people or do the Swachh Survekshan related documentation. For that, we needed a dedicated team. So, we created a project management team,” said Mitra. Every member of the team has been given a set of parameters and topics on which they have to monitor the performance of departments on a daily basis. So, parameters like door-to-door garbage collection, segregation and public engagement have been given to different members of the team to monitor and report on. They will also undertake gap analysis to point out the lacunas in the implementation process. The team is also responsible for public engagement on every parameter. An important component of the Survekshan is documentation. In previous years, many of the mandatory documents were not even submitted to the central Survekshan team by the MC. “We are taking this very seriously this time, and PMT members have been made responsible for documentation regarding each parameter,” said Mitra. Improving ground-level infrastructure An “Atmanirbhar” ward is being created in ward 20 (old ward) to ensure that all the wet waste is being processed within the ward. For this, bulk waste generators are undertaking onsite wet waste processing. “There are seven schools here. We are organising competition among them, for best onsite composting. They are completing their capacity building. In Sanjay Colony and Colony 4, we are giving them home composting buckets. This is being done under CSR (corporate social responsibility). Religious organisations in the ward have also agreed to compost wet waste like flowers,” said Mitra. The MC has also revived the bio-methane plant, which was lying defunct for more than two years, to process the wet waste in the ward. For segregation, the two-bin MC door-to-door garbage vehicles are being converted into four-bin. In addition to dry, wet and hazardous waste, the MC will also collect sanitary waste in these vehicles now. The MC also launched 80 additional garbage collection vehicles covering the entire city. Major push on people’s involvement The MC is organising a number of programmes and competitions to create awareness among citizens. With themes related to garbage management, MC is holding poster competition, jingle competition, mural competition and street play competition in Maloya. To encourage home composting, the MC is organising a competition among residents’ welfare associations. “It is to identify who are already skilled in-home composting. The winning entry will get ₹1 lakh prize,” said Mitra. Swachh Innovative Technology Challenge has been started for engineering colleges and technocrat for creating innovative ideas for garbage management and processing. In collaboration with an NGO Green Dream Foundation, mural will be created at four sites where “Swachhta ki Kahani” will be created by December-end. Angadwadi workers are being tapped in to create awareness people to segregate sanitary waste. 
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||‘People trust SAD for a proven track record of development’: Sukhbir Singh Badal||SAD(B) president Sukhbir Singh Badal speaks to Ramesh Vinayak on a range of issues ahead of the Punjab assembly polls due early next year. Edited excerpts:What is your reading of the electoral landscape in Punjab?People want a stable, strong government and a decisive chief minister. The CM face is going to make a lot of difference. A right choice can take the state forward and a wrong one will push it backwards as it happened in the last five years. So, the Congress is completely out. The people of Punjab don’t trust (AAP chief Arvind) Kejriwal. Half of his 20 MLAs have left him. Others also want to follow suit, but there are no takers. In 2017, people had put some faith in him, but they now feel disappointed. The AAP has since been dipping. Today, Kejriwal comes and goes, hardly anyone in Punjab cares. Last time (in 2017), his rallies used to draw a big gathering but now they are marriage palace affairs. People still trust the Shiromani Akali Dal because we are the only Punjab party with a proven track record of development, be it power plants, airports, roads, urban infrastructure or social welfare.The Punjab assembly contest is shaping up as a four-way fight. Who do you see as your main challenger?It appears a multi-cornered only from an academician’s perspective. In reality, it is not. On a majority of the seats – I will say, 110 out of 117 – the SAD and the Congress will fight for pole position. On some, it would be the SAD versus the AAP.How serious is the setback of an FIR against senior leader Bikram Singh Majithia in a drug case?There is no setback. The Congress government in 2002 had put a false case against my father and me, too. Yet, people voted us to power in 2007 because they knew it was vendetta. In Bikram’s case, I have never seen a more false FIR that can ever be registered. Three director generals of police (DGPs) were changed because they were not ready to file an FIR. Three chiefs of Bureau of Investigation were shifted because they gave in writing that it is a false case. Then, they brought in Siddharth Chattopadhyaya who has been rejected by the UPSC for the DGP post. He agreed to do his political master’s bidding only to become the DGP. There is no credibility. The case in which Bikram has been framed has been settled by the court five years ago. Neither was he made an accused nor did his name come up in the trial.But, these arguments centered on the political vendetta allegation didn’t find favour with the Mohali court which denied him anticipatory bail?I don’t want to comment on the local court. We have full faith in the judiciary. Remember what happened in the case of Shah Rukh Khan’s son who was implicated in a false case. He got relief from the higher court. We will fight the judicial battle and use all our legal options.How has Charanjit Singh Channi’s elevation as the state’s first Dalit CM impacted the SAD’s alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party?Punjab’s SC (Scheduled Caste) samaj does not consider Channi a part of them because he never stood for them when he was minister in the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government. He never raised his voice when SC students were denied scholarships for five years. An individual doesn’t represent a community. If I’m a Jat Sikh, that doesn’t mean all Jat Sikhs will vote for me.How do you look at the alliance between Capt Amarinder Singh and the BJP?Zero plus zero is equal to zero. People of Punjab don’t like the BJP. Captain is a lost case. He was removed for being an incompetent CM. How can he now ask for another five years? Punjab is a highly aware state.How do you look at the 22 farm unions’ decision to contest the Punjab polls? Will this impact the SAD’s base in the peasantry?Everyone has the right to test waters. So they are most welcome. It won’t impact us. Our cadres had supported the kisan morcha for a cause, not farm unions.What if the unions forge an alliance with the AAP?Then they will be seen to be backing out from their stand to stay away from political parties.

General secretary of the RWA, Kuljinder Sra, said, “Our sector has a large number of retired veterans and senior citizens, many of who required wheelchairs to cast their votes. But, the wheelchair available at the centre was improper. It was a normal chair with a table which had been modified and fitted with wheels which were also not working properly. Seniors were forced to bring wheelchairs from their own home .” There were also complaints from other polling stations regarding inadequate facilities for seniors and differently-abled people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-sec-33-b-rwa-complains-of-poor-facilities-at-polling-station-101640465607800.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||PU Teachers’ Association seeks deferment of senate meeting on January 8||The Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) has demanded that the senate meeting scheduled on January 8 be deferred till the complete senate is in place.In a letter to the Vice-President of India, who is the chancellor of PU, the teachers’ body has also demanded that a fresh notification be issued which will include all elected members of the senate. They have sought that instructions be issued to PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar to defer the meeting.The development comes a day after PU issued a senate meeting notice, even though the elected members from two constituencies are yet to be notified. As many as 71 members have been notified to the PU senate by the chancellor so far. However, the elected members from the constituency of faculties and the teachers of affiliated arts colleges have not been notified yet.After the senate meeting notice was issued, the PUTA executive held a meeting on Saturday, in which they opposed the varsity’s move to hold the senate meeting. The teachers’ body in their letter stated, “This has happened for the first time in the history of the varsity, that in violation of the Panjab University Act, 1947, multiple notifications have been issued excluding certain members who were duly elected in the election process conducted by the PU authorities.” The letter also states that PUTA strongly condemns the issuance of the notification on December 20, 2021, by the Vice-President secretariat, arbitrarily omitting the names of 14 duly elected fellows.PUTA continues protest over UGC pay scalesContinuing with the demand for immediate implementation of the revised UGC pay scales as per the seventh pay commission by the Punjab government, Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) on Saturday held a dharna at the varsity campus as part of the statewide protest by teachers.The university and college teachers in Punjab and Chandigarh had started an indefinite protest from December 1 to press for their demands. While decrying the casual approach of the Punjab government to fulfil genuine demands of teachers, PUTA president, Mritunjay Kumar, said, “The government should not run away from their duty and notify revised UGC pay scales at the earliest, particularly when the same has been implemented in all other states except Punjab.”“Due to non-implementation of revised UGC pay scales by Punjab, the same could not be implemented in Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh,” he said, while appealing to the chief minister to adopt the UGC pay scales in toto without any further delay and save the higher education system of the region from further deterioration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-teachers-association-seeks-deferment-of-senate-meeting-on-january-8-101640465427802.html

26-12-2021||Delhi||4 in net for kidnapping, extorting ₹50L ransom||Eight days after the 18-year-old son of a banquet hall owner from northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh was abducted from outside Ghazipur flower market on gunpoint, and later released after the kidnapper collected ₹50 lakh ransom from his father, the Delhi Police on Saturday claimed to have cracked the case after arresting four persons, including an employee of the businessman, her mother and boyfriend.Senior police officers aware of the matter identified the teenager as Kinshuk Aggarwal, whose father Vikas Aggarwal, runs a banquet hall at GT Karnal Road in northwest Delhi. The family lives in Shalimar Bagh area. Kinshuk helps his father in running the business, the officers said.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap said Vikas Aggarwal approached the Patparganj Industrial Area police station on December 18, and informed the police that his son, Kinshuk, was kidnapped a day earlier, and that he had to pay ₹50 lakh as ransom for his release.The police met Kinshuk to record his statement. According to investigators, Kinshuk said he had gone to Ghazipur flowers wholesale market on December 17 with Richa Sabharwal, 32, a flower decorator who works at his father’s banquet hall, and driver Jitender, the DCP said.Around 7.30am, they were sitting inside the car when a man wearing black hooded jacket, cap and mask forcibly entered the car and held all three occupants on gunpoint. The unidentified man threatened to kill them if they raised any alarm. He asked the driver to move towards Ashok Vihar, she said.“On the way, the kidnapper took Kinshuk’s phone and called his father, demanding ₹1 crore for his son’s safe release. But after negotiation, he agreed to release everyone after collecting ₹50 lakh. Within an hour, the businessman met the kidnapper in Ashok Vihar with the money. The kidnapper released Kinshuk, Sabarwal, and the driver, and asked the businessman to take the wheel. The kidnapper took them to Paschim Vihar, where he got down and threatened Vikas Aggarwal to arrange the remaining ₹50 lakh,” said the DCP.How cops identified, caught suspectsA case of kidnapping for ransom was registered on the businessman’s complaint, and two teams were formed to investigate the case.

26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana using IT-driven initiatives for good governance: Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Saturday that numerous information technology (IT)-driven initiatives have started delivering positive results and ensuring the state moves towards good governance with the help of e-governance. Speaking on the occasion of Good Governance Day at Panchkula, the chief minister said such has been the outcome of e-governance reforms started by the BJP government that people don’t have to go to offices and run after the officials to avail benefits of various government welfare schemes. “People can avail the benefits of government schemes from the comfort of their homes through one click,” he said, adding the state government is constantly working towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of transforming India through e-governance. The CM said a system has been developed under which people do not have to make frequent visits to headquarters in Chandigarh or to district offices to get their work done. People can take advantage of all the government schemes at nearest community service centres in their villages or online, he said. Khattar said the state government has so far received about 150 awards for technology use, and the PM has also praised the work being done in Haryana and the use of technology, which is a matter of pride for the people of the state. Starting old-age pension automatically Parivar pehchan patra (PPP) would be a strong document in moving towards the direction of good governance in the state, the CM said. “The PPP will make it easy to avail benefits of welfare services automatically. The elderly people will not have to apply anywhere as the pension will automatically starts when one attains the age of 60,” he added.

26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana blast accused had Khalistani links, role of Pak-based entities suspected: DGP||Punjab DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyaya on Saturday said initial investigation into the Ludhiana district court blast case has revealed that Gagandeep Singh, the former state police head constable who was killed in the explosion, had gone to the washroom to assemble the bomb and plant it somewhere.Addressing the media in Chandigarh, the officiating director general of police said Gagandeep Singh, who was dismissed from service in 2019, was alone in the washroom when the bomb went off and had links with Khalistani elements and narcotic smugglers. The police have found a mobile phone and an internet dongle from the blast site which have been sent for investigation, the DGP said. “We have found strong leads in our probe that pro-Khalistani linked narco terrorists based in Pakistan are behind the blast. We won’t be able to disclose the names till our probe is completed,” he said.A senior police official familiar with the matter said the probe has strongly pointed towards the role of gangster Harvinder Singh, alias Rinda, who recently got settled in Pakistan and is actively participating in anti-India operations, especially in Punjab. Rinda, a wanted gangster in Punjab, hails from Nanded in Maharashtra, and before fleeing to Pakistan was active in Punjab. A Germany-based operative linked with banned pro-Khalistani outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) is also said to be a key link in the conspiracy, the official said.Dismissed cop was ‘technically sound’A resident of Khanna, Gagandeep was dismissed in connection with a drugs-related case. “Gagandeep had Khalistani links and was facing trial in a drug case. His date of hearing in a Ludhiana court was December 24, a day after the blast. He was dismissed after 385gm of heroin was recovered from him in 2019. He was assembling the bomb inside the washroom when it exploded,” the DGP said.Gagandeep was killed and six others were injured in the blast that occurred in the court complex on Thursday. The Punjab government declared a high alert in the state after the incident.Asked if RDX was used in the bomb, Chattopadhyaya said it has been sent for forensic examination and the type of explosive used will be known after the report comes. “I cannot say conclusively what the (explosive) material was,” he said.Replying to another question, the DGP said Gagandeep was “technically sound” when he was serving in the police. “He was very good with computers and technical material,” he said.Human bomb angle ruled outRuling out the human bomb angle, Chattopadhyaya said, “It appears that he went there (washroom) to connect some wires and... to place it (the bomb) somewhere. It was not the concept of a human bomb. The posture in which he was sitting (showed that) he did not go to the washroom to use it. He was using the washroom to assemble it (the bomb). He was alone there.”The DGP said the police had tracked suspicious movement of some other persons too and efforts are on to ascertain their identities.Chattopadhyaya said the accused was identified from a tattoo on his right arm during post-mortem. Besides, DNA samples were also collected, he added.The DGP said preliminary investigations suggest that Gagandeep wanted to create fear and panic on the court premises.The material used for the explosion is yet to be ascertained as samples have been sent to the forensic lab. “A team of the NSG and that of the state forensic experts were called for a post-blast investigation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-blast-accused-had-khalistani-links-role-of-pak-based-entities-suspected-dgp-101640462918833.html
26-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sexual exploitation: DSP was framed in false case as he acted tough against drug traffickers, says court||Faridkot : Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), special task force (STF), Bathinda, was framed in a false sexual exploitation case under criminal conspiracy with the complainant woman after he got tough on drug traffickers, observed a Bathinda special court. In the absence of incriminating evidence on record, the court acquitted DSP Gursharan Singh. The Bathinda police had arrested the DSP from a hotel in Bathinda on October 26, 2020, on charges of sexually exploiting a woman, whom the DSP had arrested earlier, along with her husband and son, with 212 grams of heroin. In the cross-examination, the complainant woman said that the DSP never committed any sexual assault on her nor did he ever called her to a hotel. She said her and her husband’s signatures were obtained in the Bathinda civil lines police station under threat. The DNA profiling report also indicated that the semen detected on the vaginal swabs of the prosecutrix does not match with that of the DSP. In the 53-pages judgment, Bathinda special court judge Baljinder Singh Sra said it is prima facie established that SHO, Bathinda civil lines, Ravinder Singh, along with sub-inspectors Harpinder Kaur and Amandeep Kaur, the complainant (Kuldeep Kaur) and her husband Rajwinder Singh entered into a criminal conspiracy to implicate the DSP in a false case and in pursuance to that conspiracy, they fabricated evidence to support the charge against him. The court considered the case on four counts: The initiation of disciplinary action against the police officials, registration of a criminal case against the police officials and the prosecutrix, prosecution of the witnesses for false evidence and awarding of compensation of ₹2 lakh to the DSP. “Their acts of omissions and commissions prima facie establish a case under Sections 218, 465, 466, 469, 471 and 120-B of IPC, so DSP Gursharan Singh is at liberty to file an appropriate application before the director general of police for registration of an FIR against the aforesaid persons within a period of 15 days. This court has already ordered the preservation of result of DNA by the forensic laboratory, which will be handy in finding the source of human semen found on the vaginal swabs of the prosecutrix,” he said. Suggestive evidence on involvement of senior cops The court also observed that DSP’s only fault was that being posted in the anti-narcotic agency, he got tough on drug traffickers, which rattled a section of police officials, who were conniving with drug traffickers. It said there is suggestive evidence on record that some higher police officers were also involved in the frame-up otherwise a police officer of a DSP rank could not have been implicated by an SHO-rank official at his own end. “However, the truth can come out only after a thorough investigation. It further disturbs the conscience of the court that if such high ranking police officer feels intimidated by the drug traffickers, who have entered into the sinews of the police system, what would be the plight of a common man? It is incontrovertible that organised crime is the biggest threat to civil society,” the court observed. Kamaljit Singh Sidhu, 45, the Bathinda district in-charge of a vernacular newspaper, had committed suicide in April and named four persons, including the woman, who had charged his brother-in-law Gursharan Singh, with rape in the suicide note.

But ever since mid-July the place has been constantly booked, and people are appreciating it,” said Dr Sonam Kapse, cancer genetics super speciality surgeon turned restaurateur and owner of Terrasinne.The restaurant is managed by 12 specially-abled youth, though Dr Kapse has trained 44 youths. “They are all above 21 years of age and are farmers children from villages of Maharashtra and Karnataka. We are also sourcing organic food material like millets used in the restaurant from these farmers,” she said.Before training the youth, Dr Kapse spent three years understanding how she could help the physically and specially challenged. During her studies on their behavioural pattern, she realised that they need to be treated like normal people and should be included in everyday work, thus thinking of opening the first such restaurant in Pune.“It was a mammoth task to teach them about global cuisine, from Mexican food to Mediterranean dishes. These were kids who had not sampled pizza or pasta and using sign language, we trained them in two months,” said Dr Kapse.The menu in the pleasing alfresco restaurant is also well planned and unique, for each of the menu pages uses Indian sign language as a symbol along with each dish lined up with a unique symbol or sign and patrons are encouraged to use signs for the dish they want to order. “This is done to promote inclusivity and create an equal platform for them,” she added. Parveen is one of the servers on staff and despite the mask, one can see a smile lurking around as she uses her sign language for an order. “I am very happy to work here. I get to meet people, although it takes time to talk with them, as they are learning my language, I understand their orders,” said Parveen, who was earlier working as a beauty specialist.Many companies and people who come to the restaurant have approached Dr Kapse to train and provide them with specially-abled youth for work opportunities. “People and companies want to employ these youths to provide them an equal working platform and are willing to go that extra mile of even learning the sign language,” she said.Anisha Vaidya was with her family enjoying lunch and said, “They are very fast in understanding the order and happy to help us if we make a wrong sign. It is a great learning experience, with good food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/at-the-terrasinne-restaurant-on-fc-road-in-pune-specially-abled-staff-run-the-show-101640457147784.html

26-12-2021||Delhi||Tihar Jail: Six inmates die in eight days, admin says no foul play||Six inmates of Delhi’s Tihar jail have died in the last eight days, prison officers aware of the matter said on Saturday. The last of these deaths was recorded on Friday evening that of a 23-year-old under trial prisoner in jail number 3 on Friday evening, they said.The officers said though foul play was not involved in any case, a magisterial inquiry has been ordered to probe into the cause of death in each case.To be sure, a magisterial inquiry conducted by judge is ordered whenever a death is reported from inside the prison because inmates inside prison are said to be in “judicial custody”.A Tihar jail spokesperson said of the six inmates who died there four were aged between 38-48 while the other two are between 22 and 24 years.“Prima facie, the circumstances indicate the deaths are caused by natural causes. Some inmates were suffering from old medical conditions or unknown causes. None of the deaths were caused by violence. As per rule, inquest proceeding are being conducted by metropolitan magistrate in each case,” the spokesperson said.Against a sanctioned prison population of 10024, the three jails in Delhi -- Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini -- have around 19000-20000 prisoners. The records of National Crime Record Bureau show that in 2019 there were at least 46 deaths in three jails of Delhi. Of the 46, at least 35 had died of natural deaths, while investigation is pending in at least 11 cases. The NCRB is yet to release prison records data for 2020. In 2018 there were 33 natural deaths and 8 unnatural deaths, according to the NCRB dataThe bodies have been sent for post-mortem examination, after which police will submit the doctor’s report on the cause of death to the magistrate. Delhi Police officers said they will await findings of the magisterial inquiry to probe the case.Delhi jails in 2021 have been rocked by controversies related to the murders of two prisoners by prison staff inside the jails. The family members of the prisoners who died have alleged that their relatives were murdered for failing to meet the extortion demands of the jail officers. The Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the two cases, even as the prison department has denied the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tihar-jail-six-inmates-die-in-eight-days-admin-says-no-foul-play-101640455887154.html
26-12-2021||Delhi||Eye on municipal polls, Amit Shah targets AAP at park launch event||naugurating a municipal park in Delhi on Saturday, Union home minister Amit Shah said the Delhi government should cut spending on advertisements and pay the “pending dues” to the three civic bodies, even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) countered that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre as well as the party’s government in Uttar Pradesh were spending more than double on publicity.Shah, while launching the Bharat Darshan Park built, by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in Punabi Bagh, said, “I am here to tell the Delhi CM that it will be gracious of him if he will cut the expenditure on advertisement, and pay the MCDs’ dues instead. Unlike other political parties, the BJP has done what it had promised. And the people of Delhi have now understood that other parties do not work, but just do photoshoots for advertisement.”In a statement, the AAP shot back, saying all the home minister should have done was to count the number of hoardings that his party put up in the national capital. “There are 850 hoardings of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath in Delhi. In stark contrast, the Delhi government has only put up 108 hoardings,” the AAP said.“Delhi government spends barely ₹70 crore on advertisements, compared to Yogi Adityanath’s splurge of ₹2,000 crore annually,” the AAP added.The war of words between the Union minister and the AAP comes months ahead of the municipal elections in Delhi.Listing achievements by the BJP-ruled civic bodies in Delhi, Shah said the Delhi government owes ₹13,000 crore to the three civic bodies. “Beautification under the flyovers, turning 31 barren plots into beautiful parks and turning over 1,000 parks into open gyms, are few of the many splendid jobs done by the municipalities. Had the AAP government cleared the dues of ₹13,000 crore, it could have completed several other development projects,” Shah said.The AAP, however, said the three civic bodies were going through a crippling financial crisis only because of the corruption by the BJP, and called the Delhi municipalities the “world’s most corrupt municipal corporation”.“The BJP leaders of the three MCDs have looted public funds. If Amit Shah tries to run them honestly instead of supporting their corruption, then there will be a huge corpus of funds available for welfare,” the AAP said.All three MCDs, ruled by the BJP, have been facing financial problems for several years, and have struggled to pay regular salaries to their staff, and implement new projects. While the BJP says the Delhi government was choking flow of funds to the civic bodies, the Delhi government has made it clear that not only it has paid all budgetary dues to the corporations, but has also extended a loan to them.Claiming that the BJP is the only party that translates promises into ground reality, Shah said that his party doesn’t give currency to criticism from the opposition parties. “When we were talking about Ram temple in Ayodhya, they (the opposition leaders) use to ask about the dates? Now, I say to them not to feel sorry and go Ayodhya to take a glimpse of the deity that established Ram-Rajya in India. I also request them to go to Kashi (Varanasi), take a holy dip in the clean Ganga there and worship Lord Shiva. They will feel relaxed,” he said.Bharat Darshan Park is the second waste-to-art park in Delhi where replicas of monuments have been set up using scrap material. Officials said that the facility uses 350 tonnes of scrap to recreate 17 Indian monuments over 8.5 acres.The park has been built for around Rs12 crore over the past two years, said a senior municipal official said.The first such installation in Sarai Kale Khan, called the Waste-To-Wonder Park, was thrown open to the public in 2019.The Bharat Darshan Park features replicas of monuments such as the Konark temple (in Odisha), Qutub Minar, Taj Mahal (Agra, Uttar Pradesh), Sanchi Stupa (Madhya Pradesh) and Nalanda University (Bihar).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/eye-on-municipal-polls-amit-shah-targets-aap-at-park-launch-event-101640455407132.html
26-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi University colleges sent 2 fresh course plans||Colleges in Delhi University have been sent two proposed alternative course structures in line with the New Education Policy for feedback, principals said on Saturday. While the DU academic council (AC) in August approved 196 credits for a four-year honours degree and 148 credits for a three-year honours degree, the credits have been reduced to 184 and 140 respectively in the first alternative course structure and 164 and 124 in the second.The reductions have been criticised by members of the executive council (EC) and AC, who said that the course credits outlined in the proposed were far lower than those in the structure passed by the two decision-making bodies. AC members said the university communicated the new structure with principals without prior discussions with the AC.In August, Delhi University (DU) approved the introduction of a four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP), along with multiple entry-exit schemes (MEES) and an academic bank of credits (ABC) from the 2022 academic session.Under FYUP, the structure of the current undergraduate course will be changed to allow students to opt for a three-year course, a four-year honours course, or a four-year honours course with research.Miranda House principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said two frameworks outlining the FYUP course structure were shared with colleges last week and feedback sought for them as part of ongoing consultations.“We will have a lot of consultations on frameworks and other aspects of the FYUP rollout from next year. Discussions are already taking place with principals, teachers, and other stakeholders. Recommendations have been sought from us and we will go through the frameworks in detail. The idea is to hold wider consultations to discuss the kind of framework that will suit the university,” she said.Appreciating the call for feedback, she said, “It’s a welcome step that discussions are taking place. Various committees are already working on it. With more recommendations coming from all quarters, we will be working towards the implementation in an informed manner,” said Nanda.Poonam Verma, principal, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, said the proposals were being discussed and aspects such as the number of credits were being looked at in terms of the three and four-year programmes.“Feedback has been sought from us as part of the ongoing deliberations on the various aspects,” said Verma.Several teachers, however, once again raised concerns over the reduction of workload that would arise due to the implementation of the provisions outlined in the proposals.Naveen Gaur, AC member, said that during the August meeting of the AC, everyone knew that the structure that had been passed was not in conformity with the UGC structure. “Back then, we were told the university will strive to ensure that the structure passed by the AC will be adopted. The fact that these new proposals were not discussed with the AC and were in violation with the sanctity of the council,” said Gaur.Both the Democratic Teacher’s Front and the National Democratic Teachers Front (NDTF) wrote to the DU vice-chancellor on Saturday raising objections against the two proposals.In its letter, DTF said that the two models of FYUP were at variance with the proposals that had been placed in the AC and EC earlier. It said that if either of the two models were implemented, it will lead to massive workload deductions leading to large scale displacement of existing ad-hoc teachers.While rejecting the two proposed course structures, NDTF said that the proposed alternative course structures had reduced the total number of credits in three years honours courses which will result in dilution of the course content as well as the teaching workload/teaching positions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-colleges-sent-2-fresh-course-plans-101640455047001.html
26-12-2021||Gurugram||Hindu group disrupts Christmas meet in Pataudi, allege conversion bid||A Christmas congregation at a primary school in Pataudi in Haryana’s Gurugram district was disrupted by a Hindu group claiming that the gathering was an attempt at religious conversion.A video shared on social media showed some persons chanting Jai Shri Ram at the Christian meeting while a man snatched the microphone from a woman signing a devotional song. Police made no arrests, saying no complaint was made.The House of Hope, a social organisation, organized a Christmas Milan at a private school in Pataudi to celebrate the day through song, dance and teachings of the Bible, local residents said on condition of anonymity. Children and women had gathered for the event, when a group of men barged inside the hall and stopped the programme, they said.“Two days ago, some women reached out to residents and invited them for the Christmas programme,” said RP Pandey, president of Dharam Jagriti Mission, the Hindu organisation. “Through songs and prayer, they promote their religion and pollute the minds of children about sanatan dharma.”The programme was an attempt to lure the poor and convert them to Christianity, Pandey alleged.The event was organised in his “personal capacity” by a local resident, who is a member of the House of Hope, the pastor of the organisation said, asking not to be named. “We were present when this unfortunate incident took place,” he said. “They started shouting slogans and stopped the event.”“We are not going to file any complaint,” the pastor said, also requesting that the name of the school is not revealed.Police have not received any complaint from any group, said inspector Shailender Kumar, station house officer of Pataudi police station.The incident comes on the heels of regular disruption of Friday prayers by Muslims by Hindu groups in Gurugram.
26-12-2021||Delhi||AAP, Delhi BJP tussle over provident fund payouts of civic body staff||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday charged the BJP-ruled MCDs with misappropriating the General Provident Fund (GPF) payouts of municipal employees amounting to more than ₹1,200 crore, even as the BJP rejected the allegation.Senior AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj, who is also the chief spokesperson of the party, alleged that the BJP “looted” ₹1,232 crore of provident fund money after the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was trifurcated in 2012. He claimed that now ₹1,197 crore of GPF money was divided among the three civic bodies. “Instead of reflecting in the government account, the money has disappeared mysteriously, which proves that the BJP leaders have shared the spoils of the loot,” Bharadwaj alleged.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the AAP leaders must know that nobody can withdraw money from GPF, and there was no question of funds being siphoned from the account. “As for the matter of use of GPF money for payment of employees salary or some other important work is concerned, it is Arvind Kejriwal government which is responsible for this situation as it has been constantly denying funds to the three MCDs, forcing them to draw funds from where ever possible. If AAP leaders have any serious concern for municipal employees then they should ask their chief minister to release withheld municipal funds of around ₹13,000 crore,” he said.Echoing similar views, Praveen Shankar Kapoor, the Delhi state BJP spokesperson, said AAP’s charges are nothing more than cheap tactics to malingn BJP as civic polls are approaching closer. “Before levelling a charge and calling the GPF trifurcation illegal, the AAP leader should understand that original MCD was trifurcated into three civic bodies in 2012 and the employees were given a chance to choose from either of the three new MCDs they wished to work under, and since 2012 the employees are divided under three civic bodies and get their salary and pension from the MCD they work under,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-delhi-bjp-tussle-over-provident-fund-payouts-of-civic-body-staff-101640454807535.html
26-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Covid action plan to kick in if positivity rate above 0.5% for 2 days||With the Covid-19 test positivity rate in Delhi touching 0.43% on Saturday, the Capital is close on the heels of the minimum threshold required for measures to kick in under the colour-coded graded response action plan to curb the spread of Covid-19. District officials in the city said they are ready to implement the curbs, which include restrictions on movement, curbs on markets’ operational hours, as well as closing educational institutions, if the need arises.Delhi on Friday added 249 cases of Covid-19, the largest single-day spike since June 13, when the city logged 255 infections, showed data from the state government’s daily health bulletin.The fresh infections on Friday came at a test positivity rate of 0.43%, the highest since June 9.The action plan spells out four different levels of economic restrictions that will come into force at different levels based on the positivity rate. The first level of curbs, classified as a ‘Yellow Alert’, will be imposed when the positivity rate breaches 0.5% and stays above it for two consecutive days. The highest level is a ‘Red Alert’, which will come into play when the positivity rate breaches 5% and stays so for two consecutive days.In the event of a yellow alert, all educational institutions will be closed, and markets will be allowed to open only at specified times, and may only operate on an odd-even basis.The number of passengers allowed in the Metro will be limited to 50% of seating capacity, and only two will be allowed in taxis and autorickshaws. A night curfew will also come into effect.A district official said the plan is now part of standard protocol to handle a surge in Covid-19 cases, and multiple enforcement, mobilisation and awareness teams have been deployed in all districts.“The measures will be implemented as soon as the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) order is out. Our teams will spread awareness and ensure the measures are strictly complied with,” said the official.A revenue department official who asked not to be named said, “DDMA will issue a formal order communicating the restrictions applicable under the yellow alert, and the restrictions will be implemented by district authorities.”Traders fear the curbs will be a blow to them, especially during peak shopping season. Confederation of All India Traders general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said a night curfew and other Covid restrictions will hit businesses already reeling under the impact of previous lockdowns.“The domestic trade across the country is on the verge of recovery after being battered by lockdowns. Restrictions on travel in the Metro will affect the footfall at markets. Restrictions on hotels and other business will also hit employment,” said Khandelwal, adding that traders are of the considered opinion that night curfew has no meaning and the states should desist from such a move||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-action-plan-to-kick-in-if-covid-positivity-rate-above-0-5-for-two-days-101640454627396.html

Police have launched a hunt for the driver of the tractor-trolley, who fled the spot after the accident leaving behind his vehicle. The deceased have been identified as Somdutt (21), and Pradeep (23), both residents of Kansara village in Dankaur. Pawan (35), a brother of the deceased, filed a complaint, said police. Somdutt worked in a private factory in Kasna area while Pradeep worked as a construction labour. Pawan said Somdutt bought a motorcycle two weeks ago to travel from home to office and vice versa. “Somdutt was returning from work around 6pm on Friday . On the way, he met Pradeep and together they headed home. Some locals informed that a speeding tractor-trolley loaded with some furniture was coming from the opposite direction in Bilaspur village. The tractor navigated but its trolley hit the motorcycle.The two riders fell on the road and were critically injured,” he said. Surendra Kumar, an uncle of the deceased, said the accident took place about two kilometres away from their house. “Some locals spotted the two and identified them immediately.

Demands of lawyers will be met immediately, if we are voted to power. Chambers for lawyers in courts and special benches of the high court will be set up. All kinds of insurance will be provided to lawyers and their families.”In his meeting with Anganwadi and ASHA workers in Amritsar to ‘understand their issues’, the Delhi CM assured them that their problems will be resolved.Addressing them, Kejriwal claimed that the AAP was the only party that went to people to know their issues so that once they’re voted to power they can solve those issues.He claimed that like Delhi, corruption will be eradicated from Punjab’s system and demands of ASHA and Anganwadi workers will be met. He said, “The third guarantee, announced by AAP of giving ₹1,000 per month to all women above 18, which was been heavily criticised by the other political parties, alone will provide a great deal of financial help. We only did one thing in Delhi, eliminated corruption. Then we were able to provide free water, electricity, best schools and hospitals, and free transportation for women.”He urged Anganwadi and ASHA workers to get united and ensure the formation of a AAP government in Punjab. “In Delhi, my government has doubled the pay and incentive amounts and similar benefits will be given to Punjab workers,” he said.MP and AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann; Punjab leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema; Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh; Justice Zora Singh (retd), Vipan Kumar Dhand, Bar Association president, Amritsar, and other leaders were present during these meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-meets-lawyers-in-amritsar-promises-to-meet-all-demands-if-elected-101640446466431.html

The latest statement was made by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and former National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq about possible return of Sharif.The minister also offered to issue a visa to 71-year-old Sharif, though being a citizen of Pakistan he would not need a visa. “If Nawaz Sharif is returning, I offer him a ticket out of my own pocket,” he said.Rashid also said that the PML-N’s current President and younger brother of Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif, and the Pakistan People’s Party leader and former president Asif Ali Zardari “are the most corrupt people of this country”.He stressed that Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government will complete its tenure until 2023.Earlier, Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz last week said that Sharif would soon come back but refused to share any time line for his return.Sharif was in prison serving his term after conviction by an accountability court when the Lahore High Court allowed him to go to London for medical treatment for four weeks but he never came back at the end of the deadline.His party has maintained that Sharif would be back when allowed by the doctors.Responding to reports about his return, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gill said that the PML-N was making ground for his return as Sharif's request for visa extension is likely to be turned down.“Unnecessary announcement: Nawaz Sharif’s visa extension in the UK has been rejected. He is currently on appeal, but he knows his visa will be rejected, and he will be deported,” Gill tweeted.“Expulsion of Nawaz Sharif from London is being made up as a decision from him to return to Pakistan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-says-he-will-buy-air-ticket-for-sharif-if-he-is-returning-101640533414684.html

The fighting has left at least 2,000 people dead and 1.4 million displaced.Here’s a list of some of the deadliest attacks that rocked the nation in 2021.June: An estimated 132 lives were lost in northern Burkina Faso on June 5, 2021, when assailants targeted gold mines before attacking civic volunteers. Armed men killed women, children and men, indiscriminately and buried the bodies in three mass graves.Hundreds of houses were burnt down as thousands fled for their lives.September: A mining convoy attack in eastern Burkina Faso killed six persons and injured another seven. The convoy was returning from a gold mine and was on a stretch of road between the Sakoani and Matiacoali villages.November: In November 2021, 56 military police and civilians were found dead in a fatal assault on the country's security forces.December: The latest atrocity in Burkina Faso occurred when suspected jihadists killed 41 people. The ambush targeted a convoy of traders escorted by VDP near Ouahigouya, a town not far from the Mali border.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/burkina-faso-how-armed-conflict-cost-lives-in-troubled-african-nation-in-2021-101640531704415.html
26-12-2021||World||Swiss to permit simple legal gender transition from Jan. 1||People in Switzerland will be able to legally change gender by a visit to the civil registry office from Jan. 1, putting the country at the forefront of Europe's gender self-identification movement.Switzerland joins Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Norway as one of the few countries on the continent that allow a person to legally change gender without hormone therapy, medical diagnosis or further evaluation or bureaucratic steps.Under the new rules written into Switzerland's civil code, anyone aged 16 and above who is not under legal guardianship will be able to adjust their gender and legal name by self-declaration at the civil registry office. Younger people and those under adult protection will require guardian consent.This marks a change from the current set of regionally prescribed standards in Switzerland, which often require a certificate from a medical professional confirming an individual's transgender identity.Some cantons - semi-autonomous regions in federal Switzerland - also require a person to undergo hormone treatment or anatomical transition in order to legally change gender, while, for a name change, proof could be required that the new name has already been unofficially in use for several years.Switzerland, long known as socially conservative in the main, voted in September to legalise civil marriage and the right to adopt children for same-sex couples, one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so.With the new gender change rules, Switzerland joins just two dozen countries worldwide aiming to decouple gender choice from medical procedures.While some other European nations including Denmark, Greece and France have removed the requirement of medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or psychiatric evaluation, their rules require further steps or conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-to-permit-simple-legal-gender-transition-from-jan-1-101640529820177.html
26-12-2021||World||No trips for Afghan women unless escorted by male relative:Taliban||Afghanistan's Taliban authorities said Sunday that women seeking to travel anything other than short distances should not be offered transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative.The guidance, issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also called on all vehicle owners to offer rides only to those women wearing Islamic hijabs."Women travelling for more than 45 miles (72 kilometres) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member," ministry spokesman Sadeq Akif Muhajir told AFP on Sunday, specifying that it must be a close male relative.The guidance, circulated on social media networks, comes weeks after the ministry asked Afghanistan's television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors.The ministry had also called on women TV journalists to wear hijabs while presenting.Muhajir said Sunday that the hijab would also be required for women seeking transport. The ministry's directive also asked people to stop playing music in their vehicles.The Taliban's interpretation of the hijab -- which can range from a hair covering to a face veil or full-body covering -- is unclear, and the majority of Afghan women already wear headscarves.Since taking power in August, the Taliban have imposed various restrictions on women and girls, despite pledging a softer rule compared with their first stint in power in the 1990s.In several provinces, local Taliban authorities have been persuaded to reopen schools -- but many girls still remain cut off from secondary education.Early this month, the Islamist group issued a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing the government to enforce women's rights.The decree did not mention girls' access to education.Activists hope that the Taliban's battle to gain international recognition and get aid flowing back into one of the poorest countries in the world will lead to them making concessions to women.Respect for women's rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid.Women's rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban's previous stint in power.They were then forced to wear the all-covering burqa, only allowed to leave home with a male chaperone and banned from work and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-trips-for-afghan-women-unless-escorted-by-male-relativetaliban-101640519310340.html

The president decrees national mourning of 48 hours," said a government statement issued on Saturday evening.The government said the dead included members of an official self-defence force known as the Volunteers for the Defence of the Motherland (VDP), set up to support the army.Volunteers receive 14 days of training and are then sent out on patrols and surveillance missions, equipped with light arms.Among the victims of Thursday's attack was Ladji Yoro, considered a leader of the VDP in Burkina Faso, the statement said."The identification of the victims is still underway," said the government statement.According to local media, the ambush targeted a convoy of traders escorted by VDP near Ouahigouya, a town not far from the Mali border.The attack was the deadliest since mid-November when 57 people, including 53 gendarmes, were killed.Like its neighbours Mali and Niger, Burkina Faso has been caught up in a spiral of violence since 2015, attributed to armed jihadist groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State militant group.The fighting has left at least 2,000 people dead and 1.4 million displaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-jihadists-kill-41-in-burkina-faso-101640513640055.html
26-12-2021||World||How does coronavirus reach brain? What causes long Covid? Scientists find answer||Coronavirus can spread to many organs in the body starting from the airways, which is primarily the reason why people experience long Covid, a new study by the scientists at the US National Institutes of Health has revealed, Bloomberg reported. The findings have been described as the most comprehensive so far about the persistence of the virus in the body and brain.According to the study, it takes time in getting rid of the virus completely and, in the meantime, the virus travels from one organ to another and that is why long Covid sufferers complain of symptoms affecting organs beyond the respiratory system.In the study, researchers found persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in multiple parts of the body, including regions throughout the brain, for as long as 230 days after Covid symptoms were initially found.For this study, the tissues taken during autopsies on 44 patients who died after contracting the coronavirus during the first year of the pandemic in the US have been widely studied. Patients with long Covid symptoms were not studied in the study though the findings shed light on why some Covid patients reported symptoms in organs that are not generally affected by Covid."For a long time now, we have been scratching our heads and asking why long Covid seems to affect so many organ systems. This paper sheds some light, and may help explain why long Covid can occur even in people who had a mild or asymptomatic acute disease," said Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the clinical epidemiology centre at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who has led separate studies into the long-term effects of Covid-19.The findings have been released online in a manuscript under review for publication in the journal Nature.So which are the organs where the virus can travel? The highest burden of the virus is in the airways and the lungs. But it can infect cells throughout the entire body, including the brain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-does-coronavirus-reach-brain-what-causes-long-covid-scientists-find-answer-101640514502655.html

26-12-2021||World||Desmond Tutu, anti-apartheid icon who won the Nobel Prize, dies at 90||Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to racial discrimination in South Africa, has died. He was 90.Tutu died on Sunday in Cape Town, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent surgery. Tutu was subsequently hospitalized several times to undergo treatment for infections and other ailments.As South Africa’s first Black Anglican archbishop, Tutu used his international profile to lobby for sanctions against the White-minority government. From 1996 to 1998, he led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, aimed at exposing the injustices of the past.“Desmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead,” Ramaphosa said.Tutu’s brand of activism was shaped by his religious conviction, a mischievous sense of humor, and physical bravery that once led him to rush into a mob to save the life of a young woman about to be lynched on suspicion of being a police informer.‘Moral Universe’“This is a moral universe; God is in charge of this world,” was a favorite saying of the man who, as archbishop of Cape Town, liked to wear a T-shirt emblazoned: “Just Call Me Arch.”Born on Oct. 7, 1931, in Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, Tutu worked as a teacher before entering a theological seminary. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1961, obtained a master’s degree in theology at King’s College, University of London, and in 1975 was appointed Dean of Johannesburg, the first Black person to hold the post.With many of South Africa’s Black leaders in jail, including Nelson Mandela, and others in exile, Tutu emerged as a leading voice of Black defiance against apartheid.He became general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, an organization at the forefront of the struggle against White-minority rule, in 1978. He called for economic sanctions against the apartheid regime, in defiance of a law that made it illegal to advocate such actions. The government responded by withdrawing his passport.Nobel PrizeIn 1984, the Nobel Committee awarded Tutu its annual Peace Prize, citing his “role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa.”Tutu was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, the titular head of the Anglican Church in southern Africa, in 1986 and held the post until 1995 when he was named to lead the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Tutu openly wept while listening to victims of South Africa’s pre-1994 system of institutionalized racial discrimination, yet opposed Nuremberg-style trials for those responsible for the atrocities.Even after apartheid’s demise in 1994, Tutu never lost his outrage at injustice or his capacity for protest. Soon after South Africa’s first democratic vote, won by Mandela’s African National Congress, he criticized the new government for “stopping the gravy train just long enough to get on.”Mbeki CriticHe also accused former President Thabo Mbeki of not doing enough to combat poverty and the spread of AIDS, and for remaining silent about human-rights abuses in neighboring Zimbabwe.Tutu also clashed with Jacob Zuma, Mbeki’s successor as head of the ANC, saying he should have faced trial on charges of taking bribes from arms dealers. The case against Zuma was dropped in April 2009, just weeks before he was elected president, but was subsequently reinstated and is currently before the courts.Tutu officially retired from public life in 2010, yet continued to do charity work through his Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.When the Zuma administration denied an entry visa to the Dalai Lama in 2014, Tutu accused it of “kowtowing” to China and said he was “ashamed to call this lickspittle bunch my government.”In 2017, he joined tens of thousands of people who took to the streets to demand Zuma’s ouster, after the president’s firing of his respected finance minister caused the rand to crash. The ANC forced Zuma to quit the following year. Tutu made a public appearance in Cape Town in May 2021 to get his coronavirus vaccine and encouraged others to follow suit. Tutu is survived by his wife, Leah, and four children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/desmond-tutu-anti-apartheid-icon-who-won-the-nobel-prize-dies-at-90-101640503936927.html

They have joined in the closed-off management of communities, nucleic acid testing and environmental disinfection,” the Xinhua report said.The central commission for discipline inspection on Friday said in a statement that 26 people in Xian were being held accountable for “not doing a good job” in their Covid-19 prevention and control effort, but did not specify their punishment.China reported 48 imported cases for Saturday including 18 cases in Shanghai; eight cases in Tianjin; and one in Beijing.China also reported 29 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, up from 24 a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 101,077 confirmed cases as of December 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-spike-in-covid-cases-as-china-scrambles-to-contain-outbreak-101640504195726.html

He "confessed to killing" Swati during police interrogation, reported Geo News.The sources said that Swati came to Pakistan from England on October 16 to resolve property issues with her ex-husband.The US woman was murdered the same day she arrived in Rawalpindi, they added.A case relating to her abduction was registered at Morgah Police Station in Rawalpindi on the complaint of her son.According to the sources, Habib said that he had killed Swati on October 16 and buried her body in Hangu.On December 23, the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench's Justice Raja Shahid Mehmood Abbasi ordered the city police officer (CPO) to recover Swati soon otherwise the court will summon the Inspector General of Police. The court had ordered the police to present her in court after recovering her, reported Geo News.City Police Officer Rawalpindi Sajid Kiani, addressing a press conference, said that the case is under investigation and the police will not divulge too many details at this point, reported Geo News.Kiyani did reveal some aspects that came to light during investigations, such as Swati arriving in Pakistan on October 16 and being received by her former husband, Rizwan Habib.He went on to say that three people -- Habib, his father and one other suspect -- have been arrested in connection with the case, reported Geo News.The CPO said that Wajiha's body was found from Lakki Marwat's Pizu area and that it is being brought to Islamabad.He said that further investigations are underway and further arrests are expected.The case bear's eerie resemblance with the Noor Mukadam murder case, the daughter of former Pakistani diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, who was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad on July 20.A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested from the site of the murder, under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the victim's father.The murder and its gruesome nature sparked strong condemnation and public outrage in Pakistan, and numerous calls to bring the perpetrator to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-of-kidnapped-pakistani-american-woman-found-ex-husband-confesses-killing-101640500886655.html

The people were in seven vehicles and did not stop for the military, it said.The Myanmar military could not immediately be reached for comment.Photos shared by the human rights group and local media showed the charred remains of bodies on burnt-out truckbeds.The Karenni National Defence Force, one of the largest of several civilian militias opposing the junta that led a Feb. 1 coup, said the dead were not their members but civilians seeking refuge from the conflict."We were so shocked at seeing that all the dead bodies were different sizes, including children, women and old people," a commander from the group told Reuters, asking not to be named.A villager who asked not to be named for security reasons said he was aware of the fire on Friday night but could not go to the scene as there was a shooting."I went to see this morning. I saw dead bodies that had been burnt, and also the clothes of children and women spread around," he told Reuters by phone.Meanwhile fighting in another part of the country, near the Thai border where the Myanmar military continues to clash with a rebel group, resulted in a wayward rocket-propelled grenade damaging a house on the Thailand side of the border with no deaths or injuries, Thai authorities said on Saturday.The Myanmar military carried out airstrikes https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-airstrikes-displace-more-people-along-thai-myanmar-border-2021-12-24 a day earlier on an area controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU) near the border in an escalation of fighting that flared up last week and has since sent thousands fleeing into Thailand.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi almost 11 months ago, claiming fraud in a November election that her party had won. International observers have said the ballot was fair.Civilians enraged by the coup and subsequent crackdown on protesters have been taking up arms. Many local resistance forces have sprung up across the country.The military has outlawed many opponents, labelling them traitors or terrorists, including a self-proclaimed National Unity Government that seeks to lobby the international community and prevent the junta from consolidating power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-30-including-women-and-children-killed-bodies-burnt-in-myanmar-101640493166533.html
26-12-2021||World||Omicron looms large over Christmas weekend, more than 6,000 flights cancelled||More than 6,000 flights have been cancelled worldwide over the long Christmas weekend and thousands more were delayed, a tracking website reported Saturday, as the highly infectious Omicron variant brings holiday hurt to millions.Compounding the travel chaos in the United States, severe weather in the country's west is due to wreak havoc on roadways and other routes there although it may well bring a white Christmas weekend to northwest cities Seattle and Portland.According to Flightaware.com, nearly 2,800 flights were scrubbed around the globe on Saturday, including more than 970 originating from or headed to US airports, with over 8,000 delays as of 0130 GMT.On Friday, there were around 2,400 cancellations and 11,000 delays, while Sunday cancellations have already surpassed 1,100.Pilots, flight attendants, and other employees have been calling in sick or having to quarantine after exposure to Covid, forcing Lufthansa, Delta, United Airlines, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, and many other short-staffed carriers to cancel flights during one of the year's peak travel periods.“Help @united flight cancelled again. I want to get home for Christmas,” one exasperated traveler from the US state of Vermont tweeted to the airline early Saturday.Flightaware data showed United cancelled around 200 flights on Friday and nearly 250 Saturday -- about 10 percent of those that were scheduled.A scramble to reroute pilots and planes and reassign employees was underway, but Omicron's surge has upended business."The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation," United said in a statement Friday."As a result, we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport," the airline said.Similarly, Delta scrapped 310 flights Saturday and was already cancelling several dozen more Sunday, saying it has "exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying.""We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans," the company said.The cancellations added to the pandemic frustration for many people eager to reunite with their families over the holidays after last year's Christmas was severely curtailed.Chinese airlines accounted for the highest number of cancellations, with China Eastern scrapping more than 1,000 flights, over 20 percent of its flight plan, on Friday and Saturday, and Air China also grounding about 20 percent of its scheduled departures over the period.‘Treacherous’ snow conditionsAccording to estimates from the American Automobile Association, more than 109 million Americans were scheduled to travel by plane, train or automobile between December 23 and January 2, a 34 percent increase over last year.But most of those plans were made before the outbreak of Omicron, which has become the dominant strain in the United States, overwhelming some hospitals and healthcare workers.The state of New York announced Friday that it recorded 44,431 new daily positive Covid tests, a record, while new cases surged nationwide as well.On the weather front, while unseasonably warm temperatures were bathing eastern states, the National Weather Service announced winter storm warnings including a deep freeze for significant parts of the west."Anomalously cold conditions and a barrage of Pacific moisture results in prolonged periods of mountain snow and coastal/valley rain, some of which may fall heavy at times," the NWS said in an advisory.An eye-popping two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) of snow was forecast to fall this weekend, with higher accumulation in some spots, in the northern and central Sierra mountains of California and Oregon.Travel will be "treacherous to at times impossible" from the Sierras to the central Rocky Mountains at the weekend due to whiteout snow conditions, the NWS added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-looms-large-over-christmas-weekend-more-than-6-000-flights-cancelled-101640485882014.html

26-12-2021||World||Joe Biden commends Americans' ‘resilience, resolve’ in Christmas message||US President Joe Biden on Saturday commended Americans for their strength and resilience in the face of the raging Covid-19 pandemic, urging “hope and renewal” during the holiday season.In his first Christmas address as president, Biden praised “the enormous courage, character, resilience, and resolve in all of you who heal, comfort, teach, and protect and serve in ways big and small.”“You show there is much to gain in appreciation and gratitude for the gift of time and goodwill we share as we look out for one another,” Biden said in a statement with First Lady Jill Biden.“Again and again, you show how our differences are precious and our similarities infinite.”Biden, a devout Catholic, went on, saying that "for the nation, we pray for the promise found in Scripture -- of finding light in the darkness, which is also perhaps the most American of things to do."Later Saturday, the Bidens spoke to service members stationed domestically and at US bases overseas. Also present at the event was the newest addition to the first family, a German shepherd puppy named Commander.“As your commander in chief, I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you, thank you, thank you,” Biden told soldiers based in Qatar, Bahrain, Romania and the US state of Colorado.“You are the solid steel spine of the nation,” he said, recalling that his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, had served in Iraq.“Jill and I know how hard it is for you” to spend a season of togetherness away from loved ones, he added.“It's a poor substitute for what you are missing,” Biden said of his presidential message.Jill Biden, meanwhile, spoke about her father who served in the US Navy during World War II.With Americans battered by the deadly pandemic and economic hardship exacerbated by record-high inflation, the presidential couple have focused on end-of-year traditions -- pardoning a turkey on Thanksgiving and decorating the White House for Christmas -- to send messages of hope and joy.But with the country rocked by deep political divisions, even a Christmas Eve greeting turned sour for Biden Friday, when a man to whom he was wishing a merry Christmas during a video call from the White House, launched at him with an insult that is popular among supporters of Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-commends-americans-resilience-resolve-in-christmas-message-101640470310351.html

26-12-2021||World||Nasa’s James Webb telescope heads for 1.5mn-km voyage||The world’s most powerful space telescope on Saturday blasted off into orbit, headed to an outpost 1.5mn-km (930,000 miles) from Earth, after several delays caused by technical hitches.The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), some three decades and billions of dollars in the making, left Earth enclosed in its Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana.After a 27-minute, hypersonic ride into space, the 14,000-pound (6,350kg) instrument was released from the upper stage of the French-built rocket about 1,392km above the Earth, and should gradually unfurl to nearly the size of a tennis court over the next 13 days as it sails onward on its own.It is expected to take a month to reach its remote destination.It is expected to beam back new clues that will help scientists understand more about the origins of the universe and Earth-like planets beyond our solar system.Named after a former Nasa director, Webb follows in the footsteps of the legendary Hubble - but intends to show humans what the universe looked like even closer to its birth nearly 14 billion years ago.Speaking on social media, Webb project co-founder John Mather described the telescope’s unprecedented sensitivity. “#JWST can see the heat signature of a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon,” he said.All that power is needed to detect the weak glow emitted billions of years ago by the very first galaxies to exist and the first stars being formed.The telescope is unequalled in size and complexity.Its mirror measures 6.5m in diameter - three times the size of the Hubble’s mirror - and is made of 18 hexagonal sections.It is so large that it had to be folded to fit into the rocket.That manoeuvre was laser-guided with Nasa imposing strict isolation measures to limit any contact with the telescope’s mirrors from particles or even human breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-james-webb-telescope-heads-for-1-5mn-km-voyage-101640467121827.html

The number of deaths fell to 141 from 168 on Thursday.Omicron has become the dominant strain in Portugal where over 12,000 daily cases were registered on Friday, the national health agency said.“The Omicron variant is already dominant in Portugal,” the General Directorate of Health said on Saturday, “accounting for 61.5% of cases on December 22”.On Friday, Portugal recorded 11 deaths and 12,943 cases - a record since January 29.Singapore on Saturday confirmed a new cluster of Covid-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant, warning that it expects to see the highly-transmissible strain spread in the community.The primary case in the confirmed cluster at The Vinyl Bar in the city was a passenger who flew in using Singapore’s quarantine-free vaccinated travel lane on December 14. He tested negative upon arrival but received a positive result in a further government-mandated test four days later. Nine more people are linked to the cluster.At least 5,700 flights have been cancelled worldwide over the long Christmas weekend and thousands more were delayed, a tracking website reported on Saturday, as the highly infectious Omicron variant brings holiday travel headaches to millions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-china-battles-to-tackle-outbreaks-101640466485241.html
26-12-2021||India||Karnataka launches anti-narcotics campaign||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai urged the youth in the state to join the state government in its war against narcotics, adding that the strictest punishment will be given to those selling drugs in and around college campuses and those using them. He was speaking after launching a state-wide campaign against narcotics organised by the Home Department of the state government in collaboration with a Kannada news daily.“Karnataka would be completely freed from the drug menace with cooperation from the youth,” he said.“Energy is another name for the youth,” Bommai added and called upon the youth to harness this energy to build a bright future for themselves and bring laurels for the state.Emphasizing the need to eradicate the drug menace from the state, he said that he had instructed the police to install CC cameras around all prominent colleges. “Similarly CC cameras should be installed within the college campuses and hostels too.”Karnataka has declared a war against drugs. State tops the country in the quantity of drugs seized and destroyed. “We will wage a relentless war against drugs. Some foreign nationals staying in Bengaluru have been found to be engaged in drug peddling. Stringent action is being taken against them. NDPS act is being used to crush the drug menace. Dark Web has been penetrated for the first time in Karnataka. Drug supply from abroad is being prevented,” Bommai said.He urged the youth to register themselves to be part of the campaign against drugs. The Chief Minister termed those involved in the narcotics business as traitors and assured that they would be dealt with sternly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-launches-anti-narcotics-campaign-101640543204204.html
26-12-2021||India||Surya triggers political row with ‘ghar wapsi’ remark||South MP and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Tejasvi Surya have triggered a political slugfest after he called for a ‘Ghar Wapsi’ of people who converted from the Hindu faith to other religions as a way to protect and review the religion. Speaking on Saturday at the Udupi Krishna Mutt, the young MP continued with his style of communally provocative speeches amid concerns over the state government’s controversial anti-conversion bill.“Those people who have left their mother religion and have for various socio, political and economic reasons throughout India’s History. Those who have gone out of the Hindu fold must be brought back in whole, brought back to the mother faith, to the Hindu faith,” Surya said during his over one-hour long speech in the coastal district.Surya did not stop there with his speech, which went on to attack the ideas of other religions.“Christianity and Islam are not mere religions. They are political imperial ideologies, and Hindus should understand this,” he said.He added that it was essential for Hindus to understand “who their enemies are”. “The first thing we need to do, identify who is trying to wipe our religion from the face of the earth. This is essential for survival for Hinduism and the Hindu race,” he said.The speech attracted adulation from the hard right and criticism from the larger society.“If everyone has a #GharWapsi as desired by the BJP, where exactly will they fit them in the varna system or will all be considered as Brahmins by default? That would be an interesting proposition for #GharWapsi,” Priyank Kharge, former minister and Congress legislator from Kalaburagi said in a post on Twitter.“And these persons “brought back” will be casteless, I assume? This whole Hinduism is under threat is a ploy by the Hindutva brigade to reestablish the caste hierarchical society,” Karti Chidambaram, Congress MP from Tamil Nadu, said. The statements come at a time when there have been attacks against the Christian community in Karnataka, which under the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government, has been trying to implement the contentious laws that are core to the beliefs of its ideological parent, RSS.These include the recently mooted anti-conversion law, anti-cattle slaughter legislation and the special marriages act or which the right-wing calls ‘love jihad’.There have been similar hate speech allegations against prominent seers and other politicians from across the country, adding to communal tensions in the country.A video of prominent Hindu seers making provocative remarks in an event in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, between December 17-19, has gone viral on social media.Another speech by a controversial politician, Asaduddin Owaisi had made provocative remarks during an election speech in Uttar Pradesh.“Please remember, Yogi will not always be the Chief Minister. Modi will not be the Prime Minister forever. We Muslims will not forget your injustice. We will remember this injustice. Allah will destroy you through his strength. Things will change. Who will come to save you then? When Yogi will return to his mutt and Modi will retreat to the mountains, then who will come?” Owaisi said, attracting sharp criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surya-triggers-political-row-with-ghar-wapsi-remark-101640543202961.html
26-12-2021||India||Tenures of Karnataka CMs marred by uncertainty||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) overdrive to dispel any speculation on leadership change in Karnataka has been more counterintuitive as news of an imminent replacement of Basavaraj Bommai gathers steam, largely on account of its own doing.Leaders dismissing any change of chief minister “on camera” are also often the ones speaking “off the record” on an imminent change that shows that growing divide within the saffron outfit in Karnataka.“This news (about Bommai’s exit) is a figment of imagination. I feel this is a conspiracy to create confusion, problems in the state politics and to defame the BJP government,” Nalin Kumar Kateel, the state BJP president, told reporters in Bengaluru on Saturday.Though it remains to be seen if the BJP will indeed make a gamble and replace Bommai before the 2023 assembly elections, a closer look at the state’s political history throws some insight into the uncertain reign of chief ministers since the formation of Karnataka in 1956.Between 1956 and today, there have been a total of 21 chief ministers who have occupied the post in 29 terms over 63 years (excluding around 26 months of president’s rule), making it an average of 3 years per person or just around 1000 days in office.Only three chief ministers – S Nijalingappa, D Devaraj Urs and Siddaramaiah – have completed a full term in office, though the likes of Ramkrishna Hegde have completed over five years in office in three consecutive terms.SM Krishna may well have been on this list, but he had decided to go in for early elections, after which the Congress came up short and had to depend on the JD(S) to form the government in 2004. Dharam Singh was named the chief minister then.Senior BJP leader and a record four-term chief minister, BS Yediyurappa, has had one stint for two days and another lasting just one week.Jagdambika Pal, who became the Uttar Pradesh chief minister for a day after the 1998 elections, holds the record for the shortest term in office across India. Pawan Kumar Chamling, who governed the state of Sikkim for five terms, is the longest-serving chief minister with over 24 years of any Indian state after Independence.“This is the reality of coalition politics in Karnataka,” Dr Vinod MJ, political analyst and faculty at Christ (Deemed to be University) said.“How coalitions have evolved in Karnataka and the instability surrounding these coalitions is also a reflection of weak leadership also,” he added.Though there have been stalwart leaders in Karnataka, few have managed to keep a complete hold on their respective parties. The Congress dominance in Karnataka was challenged when Hegde formed the first non-Congress government in the state in 1983. This came about soon after when Urs challenged Indira Gandhi and carved out a faction from Congress.One analyst pointed out that a long reign in the state is almost inversely proportional to the strength of the party’s central leadership in New Delhi. Siddaramaiah completed his full term in office when Congress across the country was waning.The BJP has been no different, despite the heavily centralised decision-making culture under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, who were forced to make difficult and reluctant choices like in the case of Yediyurappa to not upset the caste balance, analysts said.“Bommai is neither an asset nor a liability to the party,” said one Bengaluru-based analyst, requesting not to be named. The analyst added that this made him easily dispensable.Though Bommai is not originally from the BJP, the leader has made almost every attempt to fit into the plans of the saffron outfit, including proposing and implementing contentious laws like anti-cattle slaughter, anti-conversion, special marriages act (love jihad) and anti-CAA measures.But the recent allegations of corruption, including the Bitcoin scandal, commission scam, poor electoral performances and mismanagement has put the BJP in a fix whether it must continue with Bommai or make changes before more damage is done.Yediyurappa continues to be a cause for concern as the 78-year-old was forced to step down from the top chair, making the BJP wary of any inkling to bring down the saffron outfit in the state as he did in 2013.For the BJP, Karnataka is a beacon of hope as it is the only state in the south where the party has any real presence and considers it a gateway to the south.The focus, however, remains on Bommai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tenures-of-karnataka-cms-marred-by-uncertainty-101640543201599.html
26-12-2021||India||Night curfew imposed across Karnataka as Covid cases increase||The Karnataka government on Sunday imposed fresh restrictions, including night curfew and a complete ban on any large gatherings in public places across the state as a preventive measure to contain the growing number of covid-19 infections, state health minister K Sudhakar said on Sunday.The decision comes a day after Karnataka reported seven more cases of Omicron infections, taking the tally in the southern state to 38.“From December 28 onwards, for about 10 days, we have called (imposed) a night curfew, invoking section 144 from night 10 pm to the next day morning 5 am,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in Bengaluru.The announcement came after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai chaired an urgent meeting with ministers, senior government officials and members of the technical advisory committee (TAC) on covid-19 in Bengaluru to impose “preventive” measures to contain the growing number of infections.“From 30-12-2021 to 02-01-2022 the restaurants/hotels/clubs/pubs will function with 50% of their seating capacity strictly adhering to COVID appropriate behaviour. All staff members of the said entities compulsorily possess COVID 19 negative RTPCR report and will be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of COVID 19 vaccine, “according to the new guidelines issued on Sunday.The decision to impose restrictions with barely a week to go before New Year’s eve has irked hotels and other business establishments who were looking to make up for losses incurred during similar restrictions the whole of last year and long durations earlier this year.“The government has got its revenues as spirits are sold in several places and the budget targets are achieved. But those who are dependent on alcohol licence and even veg restaurants... What should they do and how to recover losses? We were not given any concessions in anything?” Govindraj Hegde, president of the Karnataka Wine Merchants Association, said.He said that during the time around New Year’s, businesses are trying to not make profits but to contain growing losses.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has been criticised for its knee-jerk reactions that have impacted lives and livelihoods. Interestingly, there were no seating capacity restrictions on cinema theatres mentioned in the order.“All gatherings, meetings, conferences, including marriages etc, from 28-12-2022, should strictly limit the number of participants to 300 people only and COVID appropriate behaviour shall be strictly enforced during the event, the responsibility to enforce the same lies with the organisers,” according to the order.The fresh curbs have heightened fears of a relapse into restrictions on movement in the new year.“We have curbs on all kinds of functions (events) for the New Year (celebrations),” Sudhakar said.He added that there would be a complete ban on all parties and events with large gatherings and DJ nights or celebrations in public places.The state registered at least 348 new Covid-19 infections in 24 hours, the state health department said in its bulletin on Sunday. The worrying part is that the number of recoveries at 198 is lower than the number of new infections, taking the active case count to 7418, according to the health department bulletin. Three more people died due to the virus, taking the death toll to 38312 in the state so far, and the case fatality rate stood at 0.86%. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Saturday, Sudhakar said that the state government would also commence vaccination for children between the ages of 15 and18 from January 3. He said that there are around 4.3 million kids who fall between this age group in the state.The state government will also administer booster or preventive doses for healthcare and frontline workers, persons above 60 years of age and others with comorbidities from January 10, the minister added.Sudhakar said that Karnataka has achieved around 97% coverage with the first dose and 75% in the second dose. Around 4.5 million persons have yet to take the second jab in the state.“There shall be intensive patrolling and surveillance at all bordering districts adjoining Maharashtra and Kerala states to prevent the spread of COVID 19, particularly Omicron variant in the state,” according to the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-imposed-across-karnataka-as-covid-cases-increase-101640543142061.html

For women everything is possible and their body has the power to stay fit and stronger even after the age of 60. I just want to show all women what they are capable of,” said More, from Istanbul who is now getting ready to achieve another gold medal in the classic powerlifter act on Monday.For her first international gold medal, More lifted 165 kg – Bench press (30kg), squat (60kg) and deadlift (75kg) in the equipped power lift squad category.More won individual gold medals in all three categories and also earned overall gold medals.“When I started training, I had never thought of entering a competition, it was my son Rohan who was getting trained by Omkar Chincholkar, along with them I also started training.“In eight months, we saw her improvement and capability of lifting weight and we thought of giving it a try to a powerlifting competition. We focussed on building strength, mobility and flexibility and she has not been even injured once in the last two years,” explains Omkar Chincholkar, owner of Omfit Health and Fitness Solution.So far, the journey of powerlifting is the golden path for More as she has won eight gold medals in the district, state, national and international tournaments.“When I first competed in the district championship, I won gold which gave me more confidence and after that, I kept improving my performance. Along with Omkar, I got help from senior coach Girish Binjwe and both are the reason for what I have achieved today,” said More who had planned to participate in the Asia Pacific powerlifting championship in Taiwan in 2020, but Coivd-19 restrictions made her wait longer to achieve an international medal.Rohan, who himself has tried powerlifting is on the moon after what his mother has achieved. He said, “It was her dream to represent India in the international tournament and winning the gold medal in debut overseas tournament is the best thing that has happened.”The tournament is organised by the international powerlifting federation, the Asian powerlifting federation.Senior coach Binjwe said, “She always had the determination to perform better. This attitude has helped her to achieve success.”Lorraine and son Rohan, jointly owns Japalouppe, an equestrian academy spread over 19 acres in the outskirts of Pune which has 63 horses.Difference between powerlifting and weightlifting*In powerlifting the focus is to lift as heavy as possible in a single plane of motion, so squat, bench or deadlift.*In weightlifting there are two movements, snatch and clean and jerk, and they are executed much faster.*In weightlifting the difference is that people, the competitors, are judged on not only how much they can lift but on their technical skill and the control of the lift too.*Powerlifting (bench press only) is a Paralympic sport while weightlifting is an Olympic sport||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-66-lorraine-more-wins-gold-for-india-in-powerlifting-101640542904898.html

Behind the success of BJD was the dream of the people for a prosperous and strong Odisha. The party will work for the next 100 years with the support of all residents of the state,” said Patnaik through video conferencing.Patnaik said BJD is the only party whose popularity is growing with each passing day and which has 1 crore of the 4.5 crore people of Odisha as its members. “Born with the vision of the legendary Biju Patnaik, the BJD has now turned into a social movement. The party is a symbol of the trust and belief of 4.5 crore people of Odisha,” he said.Stressing his government’s success in bringing down poverty, Patnaik said that Odisha has undergone a sea change since 2000 and the poverty rate of the state has come down from 63 per cent to 29 per cent and over 80 lakh people have been brought above the poverty line.“Odisha will create history by further reducing the poverty rate to 10 per cent in the next five years. Our government will take all measures to achieve this goal,” he said.As per the NITI Aayog’s National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2021 report released last month, Odisha is among the top-10 states with a significant share of the population living under poverty.

More than 55.81% of the population did not have proper houses.Patnaik said that in terms of food grain production, Odisha has become third in the country from primarily being a buyer from other states. He added that Odisha led the country in disaster management, and has even been praised by the United Nations and Niti Aayog among others for its exemplary work.The chief minister said Odisha has received a whooping over ₹4 lakh crore investments during the Covid-19 pandemic period which is the highest in the country. “The Smart Health Card has been able to instil a sense of confidence among the people,” the Chief Minister said in his speech to the party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-says-bjd-does-not-have-a-boss-in-delhi-vows-to-reduce-poverty-101640540740370.html

Immunization of these children can be started in a short period w/o specific preparation. It's a 2-dose schedule given at a 4-week interval; dosage requirement is the same as the adults: Dr. N K Arora“Immunisation of these children can be started in a short period without any specific preparation. It is a two-dose schedule given at a four-week interval. The dosage requirement will be the same as adults,” Dr Arora was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The government’s decision to expand the vaccination drive in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant of the virus.More than 61 per cent of India's adult population has received both doses of the vaccine. Similarly, about 90 per cent of the adult population has received the first dose of Covid vaccine.The cumulative COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has exceeded 141 crore, according to the health ministry.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-protect-adolescents-two-third-covid-deaths-in-12-18-age-group-top-doc-101640539972724.html
26-12-2021||India||Vaccination for 15-18 years: Only Covaxin likely to be administered||Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is likely to be the only vaccine available for children between the age of 15 and 18 years, though Zydus Cadila's vaccine ZyCoV-D has also been approved by the country's apex drug controller body for administration among children, news agency PTI reported. ZyCoV-D was the first vaccine to have received the nod for administration on children but it may not be part of the immunisation programme starting from January 3 as it has not yet been introduced even for adults.ZyCov-D, the world's first DNA-based needle-free vaccine received emergency use authorisation from the drug controller on August 20. On December 25, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin received the go-ahead from the drug controller and on the same day, PM Modi announced India's vaccination programme for children.Amid Omicron rise, curbs brought back in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru | 10 pointsChairman of India's COVID-19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) Dr NK Arora on Sunday said Covaxin has shown a very good immune response in children in the trials. In an exclusive interview to news agency ANI, Dr Arora said, "Children between the age of 12 and 18 years, particularly those in the age group of 15 to 18 years, are very much like adults. Our research within the country also says that almost two-thirds of the deaths which occurred due to COVID in India are within this age group. So, this decision was mainly taken to protect the adolescents.""There are two other advantages of immunizing adolescents. One is that they are quite mobile, they have to go to the school colleges and their risk of getting an infection, particularly in the light of Omicron, is present. Secondly, many times these adolescents get infection into their households where elderly and those with comorbidities can get infected. So, in view of all this, the country has decided to introduce vaccination for children between 15 to 18 years," Dr Arora said.Covaxin has, in fact, shown better results in children than adults, Dr Arora said. "The point is that we have a vaccine, which is approved for children. Covaxin has shown that it has a very good immune response in children in trials. In fact, it is slightly better than adults. Secondly, this vaccine is a safe vaccine, and even local effects like pain, swelling in the arms is much less as compared to adults. We would like to offer this protection to our adolescents," he said."Although the disease's effects are much milder, but as we know many schools have opened. A lot of parents are still not very confident in sending their children to schools. So this vaccination drive will also be giving confidence to them. I would say it's a great New Year gift for our adolescents," Dr Arora added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-for-15-18-years-only-covaxin-likely-to-be-administered-101640538117761.html
26-12-2021||India||Centre forms panel, headed by Vivek Joshi, to study AFSPA removal from Nagaland: Report||The ministry of home affairs on Sunday set up a high-level committee, headed by Vivek Joshi, a secretary-rank officer, to look into the possibility of withdrawing the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from Nagaland in the wake of rising tension in the state over the killing of 14 civilians earlier this month.Joshi, the registrar general and census commissioner of India, will head the five-member committee, a report by news agency PTI said.Hours ago, the Army again expressed regret over the "sad and unfortunate" incident. It said the probe is progressing expeditiously and all efforts are underway to conclude it at the earliest.The Army also assured that action would be taken in the case in accordance with the law to "secure justice for all" and urged the people of the state "to be patient and wait for the findings of the Army inquiry".Earlier in the day, the Nagaland government, in a statement, said its chief secretary and director general of police (DGP) will be part of the central panel.The committee was set up three days after Union home minister Amit Shah held a meeting with Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio and his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma over the matter in Delhi.The December 23 meeting was also attended by Nagaland deputy CM Y Patton and former chief minister of Nagaland TR Zeliang. The panel will submit its report within 45 days.The new committee will look into the possibility of the withdrawal of the AFSPA in Nagaland, where it has been operational for decades, and a decision will be taken on the basis of its recommendations. The controversial Act gives sweeping powers to the armed forces to conduct operations and arrest anyone without any prior warrant. It also gives immunity to the forces if they shoot someone dead.Meanwhile, officials said that disciplinary action is also likely to be taken against the Army personnel, who were directly involved in the botched counter-insurgency operation in Nagaland's Mon district in early December, after a fair inquiry.Protests have been going on in several districts of Nagaland demanding withdrawal of the AFSPA, ever since an Army unit killed the 14 civilians in Mon mistaking them as insurgents.The Nagaland government will provide government jobs to the next of kin of the deceased 14 people.On December 6, Shah informed Parliament that "a team of 21 para-commandos of the Indian Army laid an ambush for insurgents in Mon district of Nagaland on December 4 but "it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity". He also expressed regret over the incident in which civilians were killed by security personnel.Shah had said that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been constituted and directed to complete the investigation within one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-forms-panel-headed-by-vivek-joshi-to-study-afspa-removal-from-nagaland-101640538322099.html

26-12-2021||India||Make CM Mamata Banerjee state’s governor, says Dhankhar||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who went to north Bengal for a week-long visit, attacked the state government on Sunday suggesting that that the Bengal chief minister should be made the governor of the state. He was responding to a statement by state education minister Bratya Basu who had suggested on Friday that the chief minister should be made the interim chancellor of state-run universities. “You make the chief minister the governor also in addition to making her the chancellor,” Dhankhar said while speaking to reporters at Bagdogra airport in north Bengal. Earlier this month, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan had written to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressing his disappointment over alleged political appointments in universities and urging the latter to amend the law and appoint himself as the chancellor. The Prime Minister is the chancellor of central universities; while the governor of a state is the chancellor of state-run universities. “It is high time to introspect whether we should continue with the colonial legacy of the Governor being the Chancellor of Universities just by the virtue of his post or we should nominate eminent scholars and educationists as Chancellors,” Basu had tweeted. Dhankhar said: “I was astonished that the education minister, who should have interacted with me, instead said that the chief minister will be made chancellor.” Dhankhar assumed charge on July 30, 2019. The acrimonious relationship between the governor and the TMC government has been in the news since September that year. It all started when, earlier this month, the governor had called a meeting of chancellors and vice-chancellors of private universities in the state in his capacity as visitor. Most of the vice-chancellors, however, didn’t turn up. An attempt to hold the meeting again on Thursday also fell through following which Dhankhar had attacked the state education department. “Education scenario @MamataOfficial worrisome as no Chancellor & VC of Pvt Univ turned up for meeting with Governor-Visitor. Shocking unionism,” he had tweeted. The state education minister, however, responded saying that the role of the Governor, as ‘visitor’ of private universities was only ceremonial and he has no controlling authority over them. “So, instead of meddling in their affairs, he would better mind his constitutional business. # stick to the Constitution please,” Basu had tweeted. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government is trying to turn the governor into a rubber stamp. “This is not good for the Constitutional setup,” Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-cm-mamata-banerjee-state-s-governor-says-dhankhar-101640534739673.html
26-12-2021||India||What is ‘precaution dose’ for Covid? Which vaccine will be administered? What all we know||From January 10, India will be administering the ‘precaution dose’ of the Covid vaccine to frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities. At a time when the world is seeing the 4th surge of the Covid pandemic, India's Omicron cases are also rising with states imposing restrictive measures. The idea of a booster dose to strengthen the immunity against the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 has already been introduced in the world with several countries opting for it. However, India is not calling it a booster dose. As PM Modi made the major announcement on December 25, he called it precaution dose.Here is what we know about the precaution dose1. Dr RS Sharma, CEO of National Health Authority, said a comorbidity certificate will be required for senior citizens to get the precaution dose, news agency ANI reported.2. The government is likely to use the same list of comorbidity that was followed when the vaccination drive started in India in January this year.3. PM Modi in his speech on Saturday said the precaution dose will be administered to senior citizens after consulting with their doctors.4. According to reports, the gap between the second dose and this third precaution dose is likely to be 9 to 12 months.5. Which will be the vaccine for this precaution dose? Reports said these are the details that will be finalised in the next few days in consultation with the experts. The general opinion of health experts is that the third dose or the precaution dose should be different from the first two doses. But the government has not announced any mix and match policy yet.6. A booster dose certificate will be given to beneficiaries, RS Sharma said.The Indian Medical Association said if the government adopts a mix and match policy for the third dose, then the government should ensure the availability of Covaxin as the majority of people has taken Covishield in the first two doses.Precaution dose, third dose, booster dose: What are all theseThe aim of a third dose is to boost the immunity which is likely to wane 7-8 months after vaccination or previous infection. Some scientists have even pitched for an annual booster against the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. The World Health Organization is not very enthusiastic about booster doses, considering the global vaccination situation as many countries are far from reaching the 40% coverage target.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-precaution-dose-for-covid-which-vaccine-will-be-administered-101640533041426.html

The remaining two cases are asymptomatic and have been admitted to hospital.” Contact tracing of at least 30 people, who came in contact with the returnees have been done, the minister said. Earlier, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “As many as 3000 people returned from foreign countries to Indore. The health department conducted RT-PCR tests of 1000 returnees and 26 tested positive for Covid-19 in four weeks. Their samples have been sent to Delhi for genome sequencing and out of the total, eight have tested positive for Omicron.”But MP Congress Committee president Kamal Nath attacked the state government for hiding the cases. “The Madhya Pradesh government should clarify how many people have returned from different countries in the past two months and how many of them tested positive for Covid-19. The state government should also clear what arrangements are being made to deal with such cases.” Kamal Nath said it was a serious issue and the state government should maintain transparency. In MP, the positivity rate has increased to 0.06% from 0.01% in the past month. MP has 232 active cases. On Saturday, 42 cases were found positive after 60,650 tests.

26-12-2021||India||Lyrics of Sunny Leone's Madhuban to be changed, following minister's warning||Following Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra's warning to Sunny Leone and the singers of the recently released music video Madhuban, music label Saregama said on Sunday that the company will change the lyrics. "In light of the recent feedback & respecting the sentiments of our fellow countrymen, we will be changing the lyrics and the name of the song Madhuban," it said, as reported by PTI."The new song will replace the old one across all platforms over the next 3 days," Saregama said.Narottam Mishra who made designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee withdraw his mangalsutra advertisement warned Sunny Leone and the singers of the music video to apologise and withdraw the video within three days. Failing to do this would attract action, the minister said.Soon after the warning, the company responded and said the video will be changed. Without referring to the minister's threat, the company said the decision is prompted by recent feedback."Some vidharmis are constantly hurting Hindu sentiments. The video 'Madhuban me Radhika nache' is one such condemnable attempt. I am warning Sunny Leone ji, Shaarib and Toshi ji to understand. If they don't remove the song after apologising in three days, then we will take action against them," Narottam Mishra said.  The song uses some words from a song from the 1960 movie Kohinoor, sung by Mohammed Rafi. Before Narottam Mishra, Mathura-based priests said they found the video objectionable and will go to court if no action is taken against the video. Akhil Bhartiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha’s national president Mahesh Pathak said Sunny Leone through the video has maligned the prestige of Brijbhumi by presenting the song in a “derogatory manner”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lyrics-of-sunny-leone-s-madhuban-to-be-changed-after-minister-s-warning-101640525236137.html

26-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: December 27, 1962 — Swaran Singh wants all irritations ended; Rawalpindi talks open today Pakistan for priority to Kashmir question||Rawalpindi: All references to Kashmir were severely avoided by Sardar Swaran Singh, leader of the Indian delegation to tomorrow’s Indo-Pakistan talks, in his airport chat with newsmen after his arrival here aboard an IAF plane a little before noon. Sardar Swaran Singh was accompanied by Commonwealth Secretary Gundevia and six other delegates. A small crowd including Mr Z. A. Bhutto, head of the Pakistani negotiating team, had gathered to welcome them despite a drizzle. Recalling how the two outstanding irritants, the canal waters dispute and the border issue, had already been removed amicably in the three years since he last visited Rawalpindi, Sardar Swaran Singh stressed that an overall sett1ement at this stage would be “welcome not only to vast populations of our two countries, but also to men of goodwill and peace throughout Asia and Africa.” He said India was “entering these talks in all sincerity.” The fate of waiting for the other to take the first step would depend primarily on the urgency with which India was prepared to view the Kashmir issue. India’s attitude was formally conveyed by Sardar Swaran Singh in the evening when he separately called on President Ayub Khan, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ali and Mr Bhutto. Pak demand His impromptu statement at the airport indicated that his instructions were to discuss the entire gambit of the Indo-Pakistan relations without preconditions and to find “mutually satisfactory and beneficial” solutions for the “many unsolved problems” still festering relations between the two countries. Pakistan, on the other hand, has repeatedly declared, and this was reaffirmed today by its Foreign Office spokesman, that prior consideration must be given to the Kashmir question. Pakistan was prepared to discuss any proposal other than plebiscite though he denied that either India or Pakistan had been approached by friendly countries with any specific plan. He confirmed, however, that both the U.S. and British emissaries were received this afternoon by President Ayub Khan. Only with an unexpected degree of tact and persuasive diplomacy can both sides succeed in bringing the wide gulf separating them and reconcile the overflexible stand of India with the rigid attitude adopted by Pakistan. Sardar Swaran Singh later told a Press conference that India would consider and might agree to plebiscite as a solution of the Kashmir issue if the conference came to the conclusion, after discussing the views of both sides on the proposition, that it was the most suitable solution. No proposal for a solution of the problem including plebiscite was ruled out at the talks. In fact, he reiterated, there was no precondition to the talks.The aim of the talks, he said, was to find an honourable and mutually satisfactory solution to the issue. Sardar Swaran Singh allayed Pakistani fears that India wanted to divert the course of the conference to issues other than Kashmir. He declared that the delegation had come to discuss Kashmir and not to dump it in other issues. If certain other issues between the two countries could not be discussed at the current talks or in a series of talks, India would wish to discuss them later, he said. He denied that it was the intention of the Indian Government to prolong the discussion in order to delay the settlement of the Kashmir issue. Charter of talks Sardar Swaran Singh said the “charter” of the talks was a joint communique issued by President Ayub Khan and Prime Minister Nehru to make renewed efforts to resolve Kashmir and other matters. It would be their endeavour at the talks to reach agreement on as many points as possible before President Ayub and Prime Minister Nehru meet, he said in reply to a question. The Pakistan Government spokesman said Pakistan looked forward to India offering a solution better than plebiscite for the Kashmir dispute. He was asked whether the Pakistan Government had any solution other than plebiscite. The spokesman said the question of plebiscite had been dragging for a long time and the Indian Government had stated that it was no longer possible to hold a plebiscite. The Pakistan Government, he said, had asked the Indian Government to tell them a better and more practicable solution and was looking forward to its reply. Asked whether Pakistan’s readiness to consider other solutions did not detract on her rigid adherence to plebiscite, the spokesman said that it obviously implied that the adherence to plebiscite was not rigid. Asked whether Pakistan would agree to attempting settlement of other differences with India along with the Kashmir issue, the spokesman said the joint communique referred to “Kashmir and other related matters.” Once this Kashmir question was solved it was bound to generate a better atmosphere for better relations. The settlement of other issues would then become much easier. He said in answer to another question that the words “other related matters” in the joint communique referred to matters relating to Kashmir and not any other matter affecting Indo-Pakistan relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-december-27-1962-swaran-singh-wants-all-irritations-ended-rawalpindi-talks-open-today-pakistan-for-priority-to-kashmir-question-101640524598819.html

26-12-2021||India||Tejasvi Surya calls for 'Ghar Wapsi' of Muslims, Christians; video goes viral||Bengaluru BJP MP Tejasvi Surya has called for the conversion of Muslims and Christians to Hinduism as this is the only way of Hindu revival. Portions of the speech that the MP delivered at Sri Krishna Math, Udupi, on Saturday have gone viral on social media. Tejasvi also tweeted the live speech. "Spoke on 'Hindu Revival' at Sri Krishna Math in Udupi today. After 2014, Bharat is finally decolonising itself after 70+ years of colonial hangover. Following centuries of being ruled by foreign invaders, Bharat is re-emerging as 'Vishwaguru'," Tejasvi tweeted.In his address, he said temples and mutts must set yearly targets to convert people who got converted for various reasons back to Sanatan Dharma. There is no other solution and we wonder whether it is possible because it does not come naturally to us, Tejasvi said. He said Islam and Christianity are not mere religions but are political imperial ideologies. These religions believe they are the supreme and that is the fundamental difference between these religions and Hinduism, the MP said. These faiths were propagated by wielding swords. https://t.co/gXWWZZytm4“The Hindu has been taken out from his mother religion. There is only one possible solution to address this anomaly. Those people who have left their mother religion and have for various socio-political, economic reasons over the course of India’s history have gone out of the Hindu fold must be brought back in whole, into the Hindu fold, brought back to the mother faith,” Tejasvi said.The video comes on the heels of Haridwar's Dharma Sansad videos which invited widespread outrage for the hate speeches by Hindu leaders. An FIR was also launched against the Dharma Sansad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejasvi-surya-calls-for-ghar-wapsi-of-muslims-christians-video-goes-viral-101640522881826.html
26-12-2021||India||MP govt withdraws ordinance on panchayat elections, poll process cancellation likely||In the wake of the Supreme Court order staying the poll process on seats reserved for OBCs in the Madhya Pradesh panchayat elections, the state cabinet on Sunday decided to withdraw an ordinance brought to annul the process of delimitation and reservation rotation set by the previous government in 2019. The cabinet's decision to withdraw the ordinance is likely to pave the way for cancellation of the panchayat poll process in the state. The present BJP government in MP had brought the ordinance last month to annul the process of delimitation and reservation rotation set by the previous Congress-led government in 2019. On the basis of this ordinance, the panchayat election process was started as per the delimitation and reservation rotation of 2014. “After the Supreme Court's decision, the state cabinet has decided to request the governor to withdraw this ordinance,” MP Panchayat Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodiya told reporters. He accused the opposition Congress of scuttling the process by repeatedly going to the high court and the Supreme Court over the issue of delimitation and reservation rotation. “Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is committed to provide reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs),” the minister said.Notably, the Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution, which stated that no panchayat polls will be held in the state without reservation for the OBCs. CM Chouhan, who is also the Leader of the House, proposed the resolution saying the state government wants every section of the society to get justice. The Supreme Court earlier this month stayed the poll process on seats reserved for OBCs in the panchayat elections in MP and re-notified these seats for the general category. The SC ruling came after Congress leader Manmohan Nagar, president of the Bhopal jila panchayat, approached the apex court pleading that the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh violated the constitutional provisions on reservation rotation and delimitation for the panchayat polls. A day after the SC's order, the State Election Commission (SEC) had decided to postpone the panchayat election process on the seats reserved for OBCs. Before the SC's order, a total of 155 posts of members of jila panchayats, 1,273 members of janpad panchayats, 4,058 sarpanchs, and 64,353 posts of panch were reserved for OBCs during this election process. On December 4, the SEC had announced polling for 859 posts of district panchayats across 52 districts in MP, 6,727 posts under 313 Janpad Panchayats, Sarpanchs of 22,581 village panchayats and 3,62,754 posts of Panch members will be held in three phases - on January 6, January 28 and February 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-withdraws-ordinance-on-panchayat-elections-poll-process-cancellation-likely-101640517225781.html

He said that the Congress party was spreading rumours to cover up its failures.In a tweet on Sunday, Tomar said, “The government has no plans of bringing back the farm laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had decided to withdraw the agricultural reform laws to keep the honour of the farmers. The Congress is spreading rumours to cover up its own failures. The farmers should be beware of this.”While speaking at an event on Friday in Nagpur, the minister hinted that the farm laws could be reintroduced drawing sharp criticism from the opposition. He had said that the government took a step back and will “move forward again because farmers are India’s backbone”.At the event, Tomar said, “We brought agriculture amendment laws. But some people did not like these laws, which were a big reform... But the government is not disappointed. We took a step back and we will move forward again because farmers are India’s backbone. And if the backbone is strengthened, the country will get stronger.”His comments drew sharp criticism from the opposition. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Saturday, “The agriculture minister has insulted Modi’s apology — it is highly condemnable. If the anti-agro-farming steps are taken again, then there will be annadata satyagraha again...”On November 19, while apologising to the country, Prime Minister Modi announced that his government would withdraw the three laws, against which farmers were protesting at the borders of the national capital and other parts of the country for over a year.On November 29, both houses of Parliament passed the farm laws repeal bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-said-farm-laws-will-be-brought-again-agriculture-minister-101640519619765.html
26-12-2021||India||Covid vaccination for children ‘unscientific’: senior AIIMS epidemiologist||A senior epidemiologist at AIIMS who is the principal investigator of Covaxin trials for adults and children at the institute on Sunday termed the Centre's decision to vaccinate children against Covid "unscientific" and said it will not yield any additional benefit.Dr Sanjay K Rai, who is also the president of the Indian Public Health Association, said before implementing the decision, data from countries that have already started vaccinating children should be analysed.In an address to the nation on Saturday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccination against COVID-19 for children in the 15 to 18 age group will start from January 3.This will reduce the worries of children going to schools and colleges and their parents, and boost the fight against the pandemic, he said, adding that the move is also likely to aid in normalisation of teaching in schools."I am a great fan of PM Modi for his selfless service to nation and taking right decisions at right time. But I am completely disappointed with his unscientific decision on children vaccination," Rai said in a tweet tagging the Prime Minister's Office.Elaborating his viewpoint, Rai said there should be a clear-cut objective of any intervention. The objective is to either prevent coronavirus infection or severity or death."But according to whatever knowledge we have about vaccines, they are unable to make a significant dent in the infection. In some countries, people are getting infected even after taking booster shots."Also, 50,000 breakthrough infections are being reported per day in the UK. So this proves that vaccination is not preventing coronavirus infection but vaccines are effective in preventing severity and death," Rai told PTI.He said mortality due to COVID-19 in susceptible populations is around 1.5 per cent, which means 15,000 deaths per million population."Through vaccination, we can prevent 80-90 per cent of these deaths, which means that 13,000 to 14,000 deaths per million (population) can be prevented," he added.Serious adverse events following immunisation are between 10 to 15 per million population, Rai said."So, if you do the risk and benefit analysis in adults, it is a huge benefit," he said.In the case of children, he said, the severity of infection is very low and according to data available in the public domain, only two deaths per million population have been reported."In this section (children), 15,000 (people) are not dying and keeping in mind the adverse effects also, if you do the risk and benefit analysis, then the risk is more than the benefits based on the available data," Rai explained."Both the objectives are not being fulfilled by initiating vaccination among children," he said.Few countries, including the US, started vaccinating children four-five months ago. The data of these countries should be analysed before initiating Covid vaccination for children, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccination-for-children-unscientific-senior-aiims-epidemiologist-101640517308206.html

Speaking to the media in Kohima, the CM informed that a court of inquiry will initiate disciplinary proceedings against the army unit and personnel who were involved in the incident at Oting this month which claimed the lives of 13 civilians. The decisions were taken in a meeting held at New Delhi on December 23 with the Union Home Minister which was attended by Rio, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Y Patton, deputy chief minister of Nagaland and TR Zeliang, leader of the Naga Peoples’ Front legislature party. Thanking Amit Shah “for taking up the matter with upmost seriousness”, Rio tweeted on Sunday urging “all sections to continue to maintain a peaceful atmosphere.” In a botched-up operation, 13 civilians were killed by 21 Para Special Forces of the Indian Army on December 4 at Tiru-Oting area in Mon district of Nagaland and another civilian was killed by security forces in Mon town on December 5 in a chain of related events which also resulted in injuring 35 people. There was massive outrage across Nagaland following the incident with protests by Naga organizations seeking fair inquiry into the incident and punishment for those responsible. On December 20, the Nagaland assembly adopted a five-point resolution denouncing the killings and demanding the repeal of the AFSPA from Nagaland and the northeast region. A joint press release issued by Rio, Patton and Zeliang on Sunday mentioned that the committee on AFSPA withdrawal would be chaired by additional secretary (northeast) in the Union home ministry and include Nagaland chief secretary and director general of Nagaland Police. “The committee will submit its report within 45 days and withdrawal of Disturbed Area and AFSPA from Nagaland will be based on recommendations of the committee,” the release said. It added that that the court of inquiry will take action against those army personnel “directly involved” in the Oting incident and action will be taken immediately “on the basis of fair inquiry”. “The identified people who will face the enquiry will be placed under suspension with immediate effect,” the release said. It also mentioned that the Nagaland government would provide jobs to the next of the kin of the deceased in the Oting incident. 
26-12-2021||India||Congress claims credit for booster jab announcement, slams Centre||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, on Sunday, gave himself credit for the government’s decision to vaccinate children aged between 15-18 years by saying that the Centre has “accepted my suggestion”.Gandhi tweeted, “The central government has accepted my suggestion of a booster dose—this is the right step. The safety of vaccines and boosters will have to reach the people of the country. He added the hashtags, “BoosterJab #VaccinateIndia.”Wayanad MP’s response came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced, on Saturday, that India will start vaccinating children between 15-18 years from January 3, 2022, and “precaution dose” for healthcare workers and citizens aged 60 and above from January 10, 2022, amid the rising cases linked to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease.Within a few hours of Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, the Congress party organized a press conference and slammed the Centre for its handling of the pandemic given the possibility of a third wave in the first few months of 2022.During the second wave, “The lives of our countrymen were played. Just before a possible third wave, the lives of our countrymen are once again at risk,” said Congress General Secretary and spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. He added, “The tepid response to Omicron virus bordering on the directionless drift is even more alarming now,” deeming this as “criminal negligence”.Surjewala also demanded that the Prime Minister take accountability for his government’s actions. Providing official data, he said the government currently has 17.74 crore vaccines only, however, to inoculate the full adult population, 59.40 crore vaccine doses are needed. The Congress spokesperson also alleged that 40 lakh people have died during the second wave due to the “criminal negligence” of the government.Bharatiya Janata Party spokespersons were not available to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-claims-credit-for-booster-jab-announcement-slams-centre-101640517698474.html

I am warning Sunny Leone ji, Shaarib and Toshi ji to understand. If they don't remove the song after apologising in three days, then we will take action against them," Narottam Mishra said.Premiered on YouTube on December 22, the song had over 98 lakh views on YouTube till December 26.This is not the first objection on the way of Sunny Leone's new album. Mathura-based priests have already demanded a ban on the video as they found Sunny Leone's dance on this iconic song objectionable. “We will go to court if the government does not act against the actress and ban her video album,” said Sant Naval Giri Maharaj of Vrindaban.Akhil Bhartiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha’s national president Mahesh Pathak said Sunny Leone through the video has maligned the prestige of Brijbhumi by presenting the song in a “derogatory manner”.Narottam Mishra on Sunday said the song has hurt the sentiments of the people as Hindus worship Maa Radha. Madhuban mein Radhika naache was originally sung by Mohammad Rafi for the 1960 film, Kohinoor. The Sunny Leone version is a spin of that iconic version using only the phrase Madhuban mein naache Radhika from the earlier one. In October this year, Narottam Mishra had issued a 24-hour ultimatum to designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee to withdraw his mangalsutra advertisement for its "objectionable and obscene" portrayal, following which Sabyasachi later withdrew the advertisement. A Karva Chauth advertisement featuring a same-sex couple was also withdrawn after Narottam Mishra's warning this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warning-sunny-leone-ji-madhya-pradesh-minister-asks-to-remove-madhuban-video-in-3-days-101640516780461.html

Stressing the need for maintaining nuclear deterrents, Singh said India is manufacturing the BrahMos missile and other weapons not to attack any country but to defend its people against “any nation with hostile intentions.”“It has never been the character of India to attack any other country or grab even an inch of land of any country," Singh said. "We want to manufacture BrahMos on Indian soil so that no country has the audacity to cast an evil eye on India."Referring to Pakistan, Rajnath Singh said he doesn’t why the intentions of a neighbouring country that got separated from India sometime back, are always bad vis-a-vis India. It committed acts of terrorism in Uri and Pulwama, Singh added."And then our prime minister took a decision, and we went to the soil of that country and destroyed terrorist hideouts, and when there was a need for airstrikes, we did that successfully. We gave the message that if somebody dares to cast an evil eye on us, then not just on this side of the border, but we can go to the other side and hit them. This is India's strength," he said.The defence minister was in Lucknow to lay the foundation stone of the Defence Technologies and Test Centre and the BrahMos Manufacturing Centre. The BrahMos Manufacturing Centre is a modern, state-of-art facility in the Lucknow node of Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor covering over 200 acres.The centre will consist of six subcentres: deep-tech innovation & startup incubation centre; design & simulation centre; testing & evaluation centre; centre for industry 4.0/digital manufacturing; skill development centre; and business development centre.

He said that citizens’ effort is crucial to defeating the global pandemic.He said, “We have to remember that a new variant of Covid-19 has already knocked on our doors… In such a situation, self-awareness and self-discipline are our strengths in the fight against this variant of Corona. Only our collective strength will defeat Corona and it is with this very sense of responsibility we have to enter into 2022.”This comes a day after the PM announced vaccination for children of ages 15 and above and booster doses to health care and frontline workers and people above the age of 60 with certain health conditions.Referring to the vaccination drive carried out in the country, Modi said, “Crossing the 140 million vaccine dose mark is an achievement of every Indian. This shows that every Indian has trust in the system; trust in science and in scientists; and is also a testament to the willpower of the people who are fulfilling their responsibilities towards the society.”In the 84th edition of his radio programme, the PM spoke about the recent helicopter crash in which CDS General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 12 defence personnel lost their lives. He paid tribute to Shaurya Chakra awardee Group Captain Varun Singh, the lone surviour who succumbed to his injuries a week after the crash, for his humility and effort to inspire young students.Referring to Group Captain Singh’s letter to his school principal after receiving the Shaurya Chakra, Modi said, “After reading this letter, the first thought that came to my mind was that even after reaching the pinnacle of success, he did not forget to nurture his roots. When he had time to celebrate, he showed concern for the generations to come…he did not boast of his valour, instead he referred to his failures, but talked about how he converted his shortcomings into his strength.”In the letter, which went viral on social media after Singh’s death, he wrote that “it is okay to be mediocre” and the performance in school is by no means the measure of things to come in life.The PM said that Swachh Bharat is a common theme in all the suggestions and messages received from people for the new year. He spoke about the individual initiatives of people to contribute to the Swachh Bharat initiative. He also listed out the various measures taken by the government departments and ministries to digitise old records, clear the junkyard and reuse it as a wellness centre, cafeteria etc.The PM lauded the Arunachal Pradesh Airgun Surrender Campaign to stop the indiscriminate hunting of birds. He said that about 1600 airguns have been surrendered.He also spoke about efforts by individuals and institutions to promote Indian culture and protect ancient art forms from extinction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peoples-effort-essential-in-fight-against-omicron-pm-modi-101640516558723.html

This motto is now a central tenet of Sukhbir Singh Badal’s strategy in the upcoming Punjab assembly polls, in the face of a tough electoral battle made tougher by a damning FIR in a drug case against his brother-in-law and frontline Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia. The polls, the first since the rupture of the 24-year-old SAD-BJP alliance, will be a litmus test of Badal’s leadership as the first dynastic successor to his father-Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal in the party’s 100-year history. In an exclusive sit-down interview on Saturday, Badal, 59, spoke freely on a range of issues from Maijithia, his challengers, the burning issue of sacrilege, issues surrounding drugs, and the political plunge that some farmer unions are now taking.

Presently, you must be amid preparations for bidding farewell to 2021 and welcoming 2022. On New Year, every person, every organization, takes a resolution to do something better, to become better in the coming year. For the last seven years, our 'Mann Ki Baat' has also been inspiring us to do better and improve further, by highlighting the goodness of the individual, of the society, of the country. In these seven years, while doing 'Mann Ki Baat', I could also have discussed the achievements of the government...You too would have liked it; you would have appreciated it as well! But it is my experience of decades, that away from the glare of the media, away from the headlines of newspapers, there are millions of people who are doing great things. They are expending their today for the ensuing tomorrow of the country. For the coming generations of the country, they are busy today relentlessly with their efforts. Talking about such people is very comforting; gives deep inspiration. For me 'Mann Ki Baat' has always been a beautiful garden filled with the efforts of such people and in 'Mann Ki Baat', every month my effort is...from this garden, which petal should I pluck for you? I am happy that from the treasure trove of our land the unceasing flow of virtuous deeds keeps on flowing ceaselessly. And today when the country is celebrating Amrit Mahotsav, the mention of this Janashakti; the strength of each and every individual, their efforts, their hard work, in a way, guarantees a bright future for India and humanity.Friends, this is the strength of the people; it is because of everyone's effort that India could fight the biggest pandemic in a 100 years. We stood by each other like a family in every difficult moment. To help someone in one’s locality or city... everyone tried to do more than what one could have done. If we compare the vaccination figures of the world today with those of India, it feels that the country has handled such an unprecedented task... how big a goal has been achieved. Crossing the 140 million vaccine dose mark is an achievement of each and every Indian. This shows the trust of every Indian in the system; shows trust in science and in scientists; and is also a testament to the willpower of we Indians who are fulfilling our responsibilities towards the society. But friends, we also have to keep in mind that a new variant of Corona has already knocked at the door. Our experience of the last two years is that our own effort as a citizen is very important to defeat this global pandemic. Our scientists are continuously studying this new Omicron variant. They are getting new data everyday , their suggestions are being worked upon. In such a situation, self-awareness, self-discipline is in itself the country’s strength in fighting against this variant of Corona. It is this very collective strength of ours that will defeat Corona; with this very sense of responsibility we have to enter into 2022.My dear countrymen, during the battle of Mahabharata, Bhagwan Shri Krishna expressed to Arjuna – ' Nabhah Sprisham Deeptam ' i.e. touch the sky with pride. This is also the motto of the Indian Air Force. Many lives engaged in the service of Maa Bharati soar over these heights of the sky with pride every day; they teach us a lot. Such was the life of Group Captain Varun Singh. Varun Singh was flying the helicopter that fell prey to a mishap this month in Tamil Nadu. In that accident, we lost the country's first CDS, General Bipin Rawat and his wife along with many brave hearts. Varun Singh also fought death bravely for many days, but then he also left us. When Varun was in the hospital, I saw something on social media that touched my heart. He was given Shaurya Chakra in August just this year. After this honor, he had written a letter to the principal of his school. After reading this letter, the first thought that came to my mind was that even after reaching the pinnacle of success, he did not forget to nurture his roots. Second - that when he had time to celebrate, he showed concern for the generations to come. He wanted that the lives of the students of the school that he studied in should also be a celebration. In his letter, Varun Singh ji did not boast of his valour; instead he referred to his failures. He talked about how he converted his shortcomings into abilities. At one place in this letter he has written – “ It is ok to be mediocre. Not everyone will excel at school and not everyone will be able to score in the 90s. If you do, it is an amazing achievement and must be applauded. However, if you don't, do not think that you are meant to be mediocre. You may be mediocre in school but it is by no means a measure of things to come in life. Find your calling - it could be art, music, graphic design, literature, etc. Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best. Never go to bed, thinking, I could have put-in more efforts.Friends, the mantra he has given to rise from average to extraordinary is equally important. In this letter Varun Singh has written –“Never lose hope. Never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be. It will not come easy, it will take sacrifice of time and comfort. I was mediocre, and today, I have reached difficult milestones in my career. Do not think that 12th board marks decide what you are capable of achieving in life. Believe in yourself and work towards it."Varun had written that if he could inspire even a single student , it would be a lot. But today I would like to say – he has inspired the whole country. Even though his letter talks only to the students , he has given a message to our entire society.every year I discuss such similar topics with students on exams. This year also I am planning to discuss with the students before the exams. The registration for this program is also going to start two days later, 28th December onwards on Mygov.in . This registration will be on from 28th December to 20th January. For this, online competition will also be organized for students, teachers, and parents of class 9 to 12. I would like you all to take part in this... will get an opportunity to meet you. Together we will brainstorm on many aspects related to examinations, career, success and student life.My dear countrymen, in Mann ki Baat now, I am going to make you listen to something which has come from far away, across borders. It will delight you and amaze you as well :(Instrumental + Vocal (VandeMatram))VandeMataram . vandemataramSujalanSuphalanMalayajsheetlamShasyashamalanMataram. vandemataramshubrajyotsnapulkitayaminifullakusumitdrumdalshobininsuhasini sweet talkerSukhdanboordaanmataram.VandeMataram. VandeMataram .I am sure you must have enjoyed listening to that; with a feeling of pride. The spirit that is embodied in Vande Mataram fills us with pride and enthusiasm.Friends, you certainly must be thinking... where is this beautiful video from; what country has it come from? The answer will add to your surprise. These students who presented Vande Mataram are from Greece. There they attend a High School at Illia. The beauty and emotion with which they have sung ' VandeMataram ' is amazing and commendable. Such efforts bring people of two countries closer. My greetings to these students of Greece and their teachers. I appreciate their effort during the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.Friends, I would also like to discuss a post of Nilesh ji, a resident of Lucknow. Nilesh ji has showered praises on a unique Drone Show in Lucknow. This drone show was organized in the Residency area of Lucknow. The testimony of the first freedom struggle of 1857 is still visible on the walls of the Residency . In the Drone Show held at the Residency , different aspects of the Indian freedom struggle were brought to life. Be it ' Chauri Chaura Andolan ' , the ' Kakori Train ' incident or Netaji Subhash's indomitable courage and valor, this Drone Show won everyone's hearts. Similarly, you can also bring to the people the unique aspects related to the freedom movement connected to your cities, villages. In that you can take a lot of help of technology. Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav gives us an opportunity to live the memories of the freedom struggle; gives us an opportunity to experience them. This is an inspiring festival, a motivating occasion , to display the will to do something, to take new resolves for the country. Let us continue to be inspired by the great personalities of the freedom struggle, continue to further strengthen our efforts for the country.My dear countrymen, our India is endowed with many extraordinary talents, whose work inspires others to do something. One such person is Dr. Kurela Vithalacharya ji from Telangana. He is 84 years old. Vithalacharya ji exemplifies the fact that when it comes to fulfilling your dreams, age does not matter at all. Friends, right from childhood Vitthlacharya ji had a wish to open a big library. The country was a slave then, some circumstances were such that the childhood dream remained just a dream. Over time Vittlachary ji, became a lecturer, deeply studied the Telugu language and also created many works in the same. 6-7 years ago he once again started fulfilling his dream. He started a library with his own books. He put his life's earnings into this. Gradually, people started joining and contributing to it. In this library at Ramannapet Division in Yadadri-Bhuvnagiri District, there are nearly 2 lakh books. Vitthalacharya ji says that when it comes to studies, none else should have to face the difficulties he had to. Today he feels very happy to see that a large number of students are getting its benefits. Inspired by his efforts, people of many other villages have started setting up libraries.Friends, books not only impart knowledge; they also shape personality and life. The hobby of reading books leads to a wonderful satisfaction. These days I notice people proudly saying that they have read these many books this year! And that I want to read many more of such books. This is a good trend, which should be enhanced further. I would also ask the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' to mention about five books of theirs this year, which have been their favourites. In this way, you will also be able to help other readers to choose good books in 2022. At a time when the screen time is on the upswing, Book Reading should get more and more popular; for that too, we will have to strive together .My dear countrymen, recently my attention has been drawn to an interesting endeavor. This effort is to make our ancient texts and cultural values ​​popular not only in India but all over the world. In Pune there is a centre named Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. This institute has started an online course to acquaint the people of other countries with the importance of Mahabharata. You would be amazed to know that although this this course has been started now, the content being taught started taking shape over a 100 years ago. When the Institute started a course with regard to this, it received tremendous response. I am discussing this grand initiative so that people become aware of how the various aspects of our traditions are being presented in a modern manner. Innovative methods are also being adopted to ensure its benefits reach people based across seven seas.Friends, today there is a growing interest in the world to know about Indian culture. People from different countries are not only curious to know about our culture but are also helping to spread it. One such person is Serbian Scholar Dr.Momir Nikich. He has compiled a Bilingual Sanskrit-Serbian Dictionary. More than 70 thousand Sanskrit words included in this dictionary have been translated into Serbian language. You would be delighted to know that Dr.Nikich has learned Sanskrit language at the age of 70. He tells that he got his inspiration from reading the articles of Mahatma Gandhi. A similar example is that of 93 (Ninety-three) year old Professor J. Gendedharam of Mongolia. In the last 4 decades, he has translated about 40 ancient texts, epics and compositions of India into Mongolian language. Many people are working with this kind of passion in our country too. I also got to know about the efforts of Sagar Mule ji of Goa, who is involved in saving centuries old 'Kaavi' painting from extinction. 'Kaavi' form of painting covers the ancient history of India in itself. Actually, 'Kaava' means red soil. In ancient times red clay was used in this art. During the Portuguese rule in Goa, the people who migrated from there introduced the people of other states to this wonderful painting form. With the passage of time this painting was on the verge of extinction. But Sagar Mule ji has infused a new lease of life to this art. His efforts are also getting a lot of appreciation. Friends, a small effort, even a small step, can make a huge contribution in the preservation of our rich arts. If the people of our country are determined, the passion to adorn, beautify and save our ancient arts across the country can take the form of a mass movement. I've talked about a few attempts here. Many such efforts are taking place across the country. Do convey information on them to me through Namo App .My dear countrymen, the people of Arunachal Pradesh have been running a unique campaign for a year and have named it "Arunachal Pradesh Airgun Surrender Campaign". In this campaign, people are voluntarily surrendering their airguns – Do you know why? So that indiscriminate hunting of birds can be stopped in Arunachal Pradesh. Friends, Arunachal Pradesh is home to more than 500 species of birds. These include some indigenous species, which are not found anywhere else in the world. But gradually, now the number of birds in the forests has started declining. This airgun surrender campaign is going on now to rectify this very situation. During the past few months, from the hills to the plains, from one community to the other, people everywhere in the state welcomed it with open arms. The people of Arunachal have voluntarily surrendered more than 1600 airguns. I commend and congratulate the people of Arunachal for this.My dear countrymen, there have been many messages and suggestions related to 2022 from all of you. One theme is always there in most people's messages. That is of cleanliness and Swachh Bharat. This resolve of cleanliness will be fulfilled only with discipline, awareness and dedication. We can get a glimpse of that in the Puneet Sagar campaign undertaken by cadets. More than 30 thousand NCC cadets participated in this campaign. These cadets cleaned the beaches, removed plastic waste from there and collected it for recycling. Our beaches, our mountains are worth visiting only when there is cleanliness at the place. Many people dream of going to a particular place all their lives... but when they go there, knowingly or unknowingly, they leave behind waste there. It is the responsibility of every countryman that the places which give us so much joy, should not be dirtied by us.Friends, I have come to know about a start-up named saafwater which has been started by some youth. With the help of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of things , it will give information related to the purity and quality of water in their area to people. This is just the next step of cleanliness. In view of the importance of this start-up for the clean and healthy future of the people , it has also received a Global Award .Friends, in this effort 'Ek qadam swachhata ki ore’ , be it the institutions or the government, everyone has an important role. You all know that earlier there used to be a lot of old files and papers in government offices. Ever since the government has started changing the old practices, these files and piles of paper are getting digitized and stored in computer folders . Special campaigns are also being run in ministries and departments to remove the old and pending material. Some very interesting things have happened through this campaign. When this cleanliness drive was started in the Department of Post , the junkyard there became completely empty. Now this junkyard has been turned into a courtyard and cafeteria. Another junkyard has been converted into a parking space for two wheelers. Similarly, the Ministry of Environment converted its vacant junkyard into a wellness centre. The Ministry of Urban Affairs has even installed a Swachh ATM too. Its purpose is that people deposit garbage and take cash in return. Departments under the Civil Aviation Ministry have started making organic compost from dry leaves falling from trees and organic waste. This department is also working to make stationery from waste paper. Our government departments can also be so innovative on a subject like cleanliness. Till a few years ago, no one even believed in it , but today it is becoming a part of the system. This is the new thinking of the country, which is being led by all the countrymen together.My dear countrymen, this time also in 'Mann Ki Baat' we touched upon many topics. Like every time, after a month, we will meet again, but, in 2022. Every new beginning also brings an opportunity to recognize your potential. Goals we didn't even imagine before. Today the country is making efforts for them. It is said here -Kshanashah kanashashchaiva, vidyam artham cha saadhayet.Kshane Nashte Kuto Vidya, Kane Nashte Kuto Dhanam ||That is, when we want to earn knowledge, learn something new or do it, we should make use of every single moment. And when we have to earn money, that is, progress and growth, every particle, every resource, should be used optimally. Since, with the destruction of the moment, learning and knowledge are gone, and with the destruction of the particle, the resource, paths to wealth and progress are closed. This thing is an inspiration for all of us countrymen. We have to learn so much, innovate anew, achieve new goals, therefore , we will have to persevere without wasting even a moment. We have to take the country to new heights of development, so we have to make full use of every resource of ours. In a way, this is also the mantra of Atma Nirbhar Bharat that is self-reliant India, because, when we use our resources properly, we will not let them go waste, only then will we recognize the power of local, only then will the country be self-reliant. So, let us reiterate our resolve to think big, dream big, and work hard to make them come true. And, our dreams will not be limited to us alone. Our dreams will be such that the development of our society and the country is connected, our progress will open the way for the progress of the country and for this, we have to start working from today, without wasting a single moment, without losing a single particle or resource. I am fully confident that with this very resolve the country will move forward in the coming year, and 2022 will be the golden page of building a new India. With this very faith, wishing you all a very Happy 2022. Thank you very much.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-speech-text-pm-modi-s-address-to-nation-on-last-mann-ki-baat-episode-of-2021-101640500219662.html

He was given the Shaurya Chakra in August just this year. After this honour, he had written a letter to the principal of his school.”Talking about the humility displayed by Varun Singh, Prime Minister Modi said, “After reading this letter, the first thought that came to my mind was that even after reaching the pinnacle of success, he did not forget to nurture his roots. Second - that when he had time to celebrate, he showed concern for the generations to come. He wanted that the lives of the students of the school that he studied in should also be celebrated.”The Prime Minister said that Group Captain Varun Singh never once boasted of his valour and instead referred to his failures.“It is okay to be mediocre,” wrote the IAF officer, talking about how he managed to turn his shortcomings around.“Not everyone will excel at school and not everyone will be able to score in the 90s.

Never go to bed, thinking, I could have put in more effort,” he wrote.From Varun Singh's letter to the students, the Prime Minister highlighted the ‘mantra’ that the officer delivered – a bolstering message inspiring the youth to rise from average to extraordinary.“Never lose hope. Never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be. It will not come easy, it will take sacrifice of time and comfort. I was mediocre, and today, I have reached difficult milestones in my career. Do not think that 12th board marks decide what you are capable of achieving in life. Believe in yourself and work towards it,” Singh wrote in that letter.PM Modi pointed out that Singh wrote that if he could inspire even a single student, it would be enough. “…but in doing so, he has inspired the entire country. Even though his letter talks only to the students, he has given a message to our entire society,” he added.India’s first Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 others also died in the IAF chopper crash near Coonoor town of Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/find-your-calling-pm-modi-recalls-group-captain-varun-singh-s-letter-to-school-101640499373160.html

26-12-2021||India||Judiciary faces perennial problems, if unsolved, will haunt my successors too, says CJI Ramana||Stressing the need for stepping up judicial Infrastructure in the country, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday said the Judiciary is also facing certain fundamental problems and they continue to haunt his successors also if not solved. Speaking at a Civic Reception in Vijayawada, he further said there are 4.60 crore pending cases in courts and the number is not big for a country like India which has a population of about 150 crore. Maintaining that courts would interfere when there is violation of rights, Justice Ramana said the Executive is also responsible for providing justice and that if it functions within the parameters of law, there is no necessity for anyone to come to courts. “Like all systems, the Judiciary is also facing certain fundamental problems. My predecessors, Chief Justices, also mentioned them. I am also raising those issues. This will be a perennial problem to my successors too, because slowly we are forgetting the importance of Judiciary and legal education,” he said. He said there is a need to develop judicial infrastructure and it would result in more respect towards courts. Justice Ramana was given LifeTime Achievement award by Rotary Club in a felicitation programme. “You all know how important the Rule of Law is. If there is no rule of law in any country, anarchy prevails. It poses a threat to the existence of democracy. There is a necessity to enlighten the public on rule of law,” he said. Indianisation of the country's legal system is the need of the hour and it is crucial to make the justice delivery system more accessible and effective, the CJI said adding simplification of legal procedures is necessary for the common people to understand court proceedings. He said though the nation got independence about 75 years ago, the country is still facing problems such as illiteracy, health issues, poverty, unemployment and superstitions which need to be alleviated. Stating that people should be enlightened about their constitutional rights and responsibilities, Justice Ramana said organistions such as Rotary Club should take up awareness programmes for the public. The Chief Justice is on a three-day tour of Andhra Pradesh. Earlier in the evening, the State government hosted a High Tea for the CJI. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, along with his wife Bharathi, welcomed the CJI and participated in the programme. Supreme Court Judge Justice JK Maheshwari, and Chief Justices and several judges of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana High Courts also participated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judiciary-faces-perennial-problems-if-unsolved-will-haunt-my-successors-too-says-cji-ramana-101640483330936.html

People convert when they see a particular religion serving humanity and not discriminating,” Azad said while addressing an event in Udhampur on Saturday.His statement comes after Opposition in Karnataka alleged that the anti-conversion bill is being proposed in the state to “target a particular religion.” The winter session in the state has witnessed strong opposition against the bill.“No person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage, nor shall any person abet or conspire for conversions,” the Bill states.Earlier, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had said the proposed Anti-Conversion Law that the state government intends to introduce in the winter session of Assembly is only to prevent religious conversions by inducements. “Proposed law will not affect any religion, their practices and traditions that are guaranteed under the Constitution,” Bommai had said.Earlier in April this year, Gujarat Vidhan Sabha had passed the ‘Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2021’ with a majority to bring more stringent punishment against forced religious conversions through marriage.Gujarat had become the third state after Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to make a law against forced religious conversions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/religious-conversions-occur-due-to-good-work-and-character-not-fear-ghulam-nabi-azad-101640482372883.html

The next plan should be to vaccinate children above 5 years old.

Every day is important in a pandemic. We know that Omicron is increasing at a fast pace. We will get variations of this virus.

26-12-2021||India||Tomar’s remarks on three contentious farm bills trigger row||The central government could reintroduce the three contentious farm laws that it repealed after widespread farmer protests, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar hinted on Friday, sparking criticism by the opposition Congress party.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 announced that his government will withdraw the three farm laws against which farmers protested at the borders of the national capital and other parts of the country for over a year. Parliament repealed the laws on November 29.“We brought agriculture amendment laws. But some people did not like these laws, which were a big reform brought about 70 years after Independence under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership,” Tomar said at a public event in Nagpur on Friday. “But the government is not disappointed. We took a step back and we will move forward again because farmers are India’s backbone. And if the backbone is strengthened, the country will definitely get stronger.”The Congress took strong exception to Tomar’s remarks. “The Agriculture Minister has insulted Modi’s apology - it is highly condemnable,” Congfress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted. “If the anti-agro-farming steps are taken again, then there will be annadata satyagraha again. Had defeated arrogance, will again defeat it.”A “concerted conspiracy” to bring back the three “anti-farmer” laws stood exposed by the statement made by Tomar, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.“Perceiving defeat in the ensuing elections to five state assemblies including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had apologized and had repealed the three black laws in Parliament,” Surjewala said. “Even then we suspected the intent of the Prime Minister, the BJP and the RSS and the Modi government and had called it a mere election stunt.” The Bharatiya Janata Party and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, had supported to contentious laws.Surejwala appealed to farmers to defeat the BJP in the upcoming assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tomars-remarks-on-three-contentious-farm-bills-trigger-row-101640456069255.html
26-12-2021||India||PM Modi has redefined governance by giving say to common man: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said the Modi government has taken decisions that are good for the people and not which people would like, even at the cost of political damage.Addressing a function organised on the occasion of Good Governance Day, Shah said people have long been waiting for good governance which was delivered by the Modi government in the last seven years. “People have kept saying that we have got independence (swaraj) long ago but when will we get good governance (su-raaj),” he said.Shah said because of lack of good governance, people’s faith in the country’s democratic system is gradually eroding.But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought back people’s faith in democracy by taking the good governance up to the grassroots level, he said.According to Shah, people have realised that Modi came to power in 2014 not to run the government but to provide a clean, transparent and welfare administration, thus changing the face of the country.He said people’s faith in democracy has enhanced since 2014 as they started getting benefits of development undertaken by the Modi government.“Before 2014, many governments have changed. Many government have come, many have gone. But when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, people have realised that his government has come not to run the government but to change the country,” he said.Shah said some earlier governments on some occasions took decisions keeping the vote banks in mind. “But Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the Modi government has never taken decisions which the people would like (jo logon ko acche lagen). He has taken decisions which are good for the people. (jo logon ke liye achhe hon). There is a big difference between the two. Some decisions may bring you popularity for a short time but this means keeping the country in problems,” he said.The home minister said Modi took everyone along and made the efforts of making good governance a reality.Giving example of good governance, he said there has not been a single corruption charge against the Modi government in last seven years as it is a clean and transparent administration.Shah said in the last seven years, the government has taken the benefits of development to 60 crore population who were otherwise deprived of all welfare programmes in last so many decades.He said the Modi government has provided toilets to the poor, constructed houses, given electricity and gas connections free of cost.Shah said the government has framed such policies through which the problems could be rooted out.He said there should always be a government which is sensitive and accountable to the people.“People should have faith in the government and at the same time government should have faith in the people.

26-12-2021||India||Complete social audit of midday meal scheme; provide status by Dec 30: Centre||All states and Union territories will have to update the central government by December 30 on the status of the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman Yojana 2021 that aims to provide free food to schoolchildren for five years.The Centre in September expanded the midday meal programme that aims to provide adequate nutrition and ensure school attendence into the Poshan scheme, and made it mandatory for all states to conduct social audits in every school. About 1.1 million government schools are covered under the welfare programme.All provincial authorities had assured the education ministry that they will conduct social audits at meetings of the Programme Approval Board, the ministry said in a letter sent to the principal secretaries, education secretaries and nodal officers of all states and Union territories on Thursday.Since schools have remained closed for the past year and a half due to the pandemic, authorities have either provided dry rations to students, or given them an allowance. The government now wants to take stock of the implementation of the programme.“The objective of social audit is to create awareness among beneficiaries under the scheme and empower public/ beneficiaries to hold government accountable, to address problems and identify bottlenecks at the grassroots level so that bottom-up and location-specific approach may be adopted for smooth implementation of the programme or scheme,” the ministry’s letter said.The states and Union territories may employ different agencies or departments to conduct public meetings to conduct these audits. In a social audit, the people and the government jointly monitor a scheme.The ministry had earlier sent two letters, on August 26 and September 8, asking provincial authorities to start the social audit in each district.Several states and Union territories have not yet started the auditing process, a ministry official said on condition of anonymity. “The states have now been asked to complete the audit and submit a status report with the ministry on or before December 30,” the official said.
26-12-2021||India||Previous UP govt wasted money meant for poor on ‘kabristans’: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday targeted the Samajwadi Party, claiming that its government wasted the “money meant for the poor” on “kabristans”, hired “incompetent Urdu translator” but did nothing for students and teachers of Sanskrit schools.“During the previous government, the money meant for the poor was wasted on subjects like ‘kabristan’ (graveyard). Those who did not even know Urdu language were appointed as Urdu translators but nothing was done for students and teachers of Sanskrit schools,” he said.“The Bharatiya Janata Party government took care of Sanskrit schools,” claimed Adityanath during his visit to Bateshwar, ancestral village of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.He also inaugurated and laid foundation stones of projects worth ₹230 crore in Bateshwar on the former PM’s 97th birth anniversary. “Atalji inspired us all and paved the way for various schemes in favour of the,” he said, while assuring people that the state government will not leave any stone unturned to develop Bateshwar.“The BJP government is now giving tablets and smartphones to the youth in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, there are various schemes operational in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Medical Colleges, residential schools and intermediate schools are coming up after his name,” said Adityanath.He promised that a museum, cultural complex and a park in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee will soon come up in Bateshwar.Referring to income tax raids on premises of some SP leaders, the CM accused the party’s previous government of “looting” people.On income tax raids, Adityanath said the previous government “looted” people. “They have been out of power for the past five years, yet ₹200 crore was unearthed from their houses,” he said. “From where did this money come? It seems it was looted and stored when they were in power in the state,” he alleged. He claimed that the previous government “committed a crime” by denying benefits to the poor. The cash now being unearthed was meant for the poor but misappropriated, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/previous-uttar-pradesh-govt-wasted-money-meant-for-poor-on-kabristans-yogi-adityanath-101640455173365.html
26-12-2021||India||PM Modi announces Covid-19 jabs for kids, boosters for 60+||From January next year, India will begin delivering the first coronavirus vaccine doses to children of ages 15 and above and booster doses to health care and frontline workers and people above the age of 60 with certain health conditions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday.The move comes amid calls from experts to expand the vaccine drive, especially booster doses, to fight new variants such as Omicron, which has shown a substantial drop in vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease.In a televised address late in the evening, the Prime Minister outlined the preparations the government has made to tackle any surges before he announced the three decisions. “For children who are between the ages of 15 years and 18 years, vaccinations will now start in the country. In 2022, it will be launched on January 3,” he said in his address to the nation.“We all have experience that those who are Corona warriors, health care and frontline workers, they have a huge contribution in keeping the country safe in this fight… Therefore, from the point of view of precaution, the government has decided that a ‘precaution dose’ of vaccine will also be started for health care and frontline workers,” the PM said.He said citizens above 60 years of age and with comorbidities will also have the option of “precaution dose” of the vaccine on the advice of their doctors.What the Prime Minister referred to as “precaution doses” are what has commonly been called boosters, which several countries have rolled out since mid-September.Boosters for health care and frontline workers will open on January 3, and for people aged 60 and above with certain health conditions that put them at a higher risk of severe Covid-19 disease will start on January 10, the PM said.In the context of children, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Saturday approved the use of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in children aged 12 and above. A second vaccine, too, has been approved by the drugs regulator for use in ages 12 and above – ZyCoV-D, a dose made by Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila. ZyCoV-D is yet to be included in the immunisation programme.“This decision, apart from strengthening India’s fight against Corona, will also help reduce the concern of school and college goers and their parents,” the Prime Minister said. “India needs to be vigilant about the spread of the coronavirus,” Modi said, adding that people should not pay attention to rumours nor panic about rising infection numbers.“In our country, a nasal vaccine and the world’s first DNA vaccine will also start soon,” Modi said, adding that “since the beginning, India’s fight against Corona has been based on scientific principles, scientific opinions and scientific patterns.”“We are in the last week of 2021. 2022 is set to arrive. We need to be cautious during the festive period. Infections are rising across several nations due to a new variant of Covid, Omicron. In India, there have been a few cases as well. I would urge all of you not to panic, be careful and alert,” he said.“Today, the nation has 18 lakh isolation beds, 5 lakh oxygen supported beds, 1.4 lakh ICU beds and 90,000 special beds for kids. Today, we have over 3,000 functional PSA Oxygen plants and 4 lakh cylinders have been provided to all states,” PM Modi added.The issue has been fraught with difficult considerations, since many parts of the world have had limited access, and many people still have not taken their primary course. The World Health Organization, in an interim technical advice shared on December 22, signalled relenting on its stand against booster doses to suggest an approach “firmly evidence-driven and targeted to the population groups at highest risk of serious disease and those necessary to protect the health system”.The need to accelerate vaccine coverage (including booster doses) has been underscored by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in several countries, where scientists have also found it to be significantly resistant to immunity created by vaccines or a past infection.In the case of some vaccines, such as the AstraZeneca dose (produced and used in India as Covishield), the vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease has dropped to near-zero when infections have been with Omicron, prompting health experts as well as government leadership in countries such as the US and UK to appeal to people to take their booster shots.To be sure, studies have also shown that the variant is significantly less likely to lead to hospitalisation, partly because vaccine efficacy in preventing serious illness has been more durable.The opening up of the drive comes at a time when the country appears to have ample amount of doses at hand.According to the government’s daily update on vaccine stock availability, 17,74,97,506 doses of coronavirus vaccines were available with states or were in the pipeline, the health ministry said on Saturday.“Protection of persons at high risk of severe disease or high viral exposure is a high priority. The decision is timely. Including of the 15-18 year age is also appropriate if supplies and vaccination teams are available to meet the needs of the expanded vaccination programme,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, senior public health expert and founder, Public Health Foundation of India.Gagandeep Kang, a senior vaccine expert and senior faculty, Christian Medical College, Vellore, said: “It is bound to have some benefit, how much I don’t know since I don’t know what the data is on severe disease in the groups now targeted.”Paediatricians also said the decision was timely. “A timely decision to open vaccines for children above 15..High school students have board exams and entrance exams to take so they rightfully be the first group of children to get vaccinated,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.
26-12-2021||India||Dalit students refuse meals cooked by woman from upper caste at Uttarakhand||Dalit students in a school in Uttarakhand boycotted the midday meal prepared by an upper caste cook days after upper caste students refused to eat meals cooked by a Dalit woman, who was subsequently fired.Of the 66 students of classes 6 to 8, 58 were present on Friday, Prem Singh, principal of the Government Inter College of Sukhidhang in Champawat district, said. “When the midday meal was served, 23 Dalit students refused to eat the food cooked by the upper caste bhojanmata (cook),” Singh said. “They said if upper caste students boycott the food cooked by a Dalit bhojanmata, they will boycott the meal cooked by the upper caste woman.”A row erupted at the school last week when upper caste students refused to eat the food cooked by Sunita Devi, a Dalit woman, who was hired on December 13.Devi was removed from her post on December 21, with the state’s education department citing procedural lapses in her appointment.“We had received 11 applications for a Bhojanmata post. She (Devi) was selected for the post on December 5 in a meeting,” principal Singh said. “When the row of boycotting midday meals erupted, our senior officers held an inquiry into the matter and cancelled her appointment on December 21, saying due process was not followed.”Devi and her husband, Prem Ram, work as farm hands.After she was fired, Devi approached the local administration in Tanakpur of Champawat and police outpost in Chalthi, complaining about caste discrimination. The police, however, is yet to register a case.Subsequently, Vimilesh Upreti, 37, a woman from an upper caste, was appointed in Devi’s place.“I tried to persuade the Dalit children to have the midday meal on Friday, but they refused,” Upreti said on Saturday.Devi, however, said that Dalit students were giving a befitting reply to the upper caste people. “If upper caste students don’t eat the midday meal cooked by a Dalit bhojanmata, how can Dalit students have the meal cooked by an upper caste woman,” she asked.The parent teacher association, meanwhile, has alleged that Devi is provoking children to eat the food prepared by the new cook. “This is not a case of discrimination but a matter of faulty process in appointment of Sunita Devi. She is now provoking the children,” said Narendra Joshi, president of the parent teacher association.By firing a Dalit cook, the state government has hurt the self-respect of Dalits, tweeted Chandrashekhar Azad, the chief of Bhim Army, a group that fights caste discrimination. “If the Dalit woman is not reinstated, the Bhim Army will gherao of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami,” Azad said.“We are waiting for the inquiry report and will take proper action accordingly,” said RC Purohit, chief education officer, Champawat district. “As far as boycott of Dalit students is concerned, we will go to the school again and will sort out the matter of purported discrimination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-dalit-students-refuse-to-have-midday-meals-cooked-by-woman-from-upper-caste-at-uttarakhand-school-101640455170987.html
26-12-2021||India||Breakaway farmer unions say they will contest Punjab polls||Twenty-two farmer unions, that protested against the Centre’s now repealed farm laws under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), on Saturday jumped into the poll fray and announced a political outfit, the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM).After a meeting that lasted nearly four hours on Saturday, farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal was appointed the leader of the outfit, people familiar with the matter said.There is a need to change the system, Rajewal told reporters after the meeting. “A new Sanyukt Samaj Morcha is formed for contesting Punjab Assembly elections. Twenty-two unions have taken this decision. We need to change the system and want to appeal to people to support this morcha,” Rajewal, who heads the Rajewalfaction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said.The announcement came even as the SKM, the umbrella body of farmer unions that spearheaded the yearlong agitation against the three agriculture laws, distanced itself from the outfit floated on Saturday.A statement issued by the coordination committee of the SKM reiterated that the farm body is firm on its stand of not allowing any political party to use its banner. “Any attempt to use the name of SKM for elections will constitute a grave violation of Morcha’s discipline,” the statement said.Earlier in the day, SKM leaders said that the outfit has more than 400 different ideological organisations across the country as its members and is formed only to fight for the issues of farmers.In a surprise announcement on November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government’s decision to withdraw the three contentious farm laws after year-long protests. Days later, both Houses of Parliament passed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, on November 29 by voice vote to annul the laws enacted in September 2020.The SSM will contest from all constituencies in the 117-seat Punjab assembly, said Harmeet Singh Qadian, leader of the Qadian faction of BKU.Of the 32 farmer unions from the state that participated in the year-long protests under the SKM, 10 have said they will not participate in the elections.At the media briefing, jointly addressed by representatives of the 22 organisations, the farm leaders said that three more outfits – BKU (Lakjowal), BKU (Dakounda) and Kirti Kisan Union, are likely to join the SSM soon.BKU (Dakounda) representatives are likely to meet SSM leaders on December 27 in this regard, the general secretary of the outfit, Jagmohan Singh, said.Rajewal said that the state needs to vote “traditional parties” out of power in the upcoming elections.“Punjab needs a radical transformation,” he said, urging the people to not “get swayed” by the parties that have been in power in the state for decades.Unemployment, exodus of the youthand the drugs menace are the issues concerning the state and need to be tackled effectively, another leader said at the briefing.Addressing reporters, Kadian said that a large number of people were cut off from other political parties for opposing the government’s stand on the farm laws. “Now they want us to give them a platform,” he said, expressing confidence that traders, labourers and farmers will all support the SSM.Some of the constituents of the political outfit objected to the name, Sanyukt Kisan Party, which was proposed earlier. A consensus on the name was reached at the meeting on Saturday, people familiar with the details of the meeting said.Another meeting of the outfit to work out an election strategy is likely soon, the people said.Responding to a question on an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the elections, the SSM leaders said a decision would be taken closer to the polls.The statement came amid reports that Rajewal was offered a key post by AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal if the party wins the elections.“Our strategy is that the votes opposed to the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Akali Dal should not be divided further. Let us see it is planned,” All India Kisan Federation president, Prem Singh Bhangu, said.In the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls, Congress won an absolute majority in the state by winning 77 seats and ousted the SAD-BJP government after 10 years. AAP emerged as the second-largest party winning 20 seats. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) could only manage to win 15 seats while the BJP secured three seats.Earlier, farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni had also announced the launch of his party, the Sanyukt Sangharsh Party, and accused leaders of promoting capitalism in the state.On November 2, former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh resigned from the Congress party and announced a new party, Punjab Lok Congress.
26-12-2021||India||Centre deploys expert teams to 10 states showing rapid surge in covid cases||The 10 states that have seen a surge in Covid-19 infections will have multidisciplinary teams from the Centre overseeing the situation, the health ministry said through a directive from its disaster management cell. “In view of the rapid surge in cases, and deaths, because of Covid-19… noted in internal reviews, it has been seen that the number of Omicron cases has emerged in some states. It has also been observed that the pace of Covid-19 vaccination in these states is less than the national average,” according to an office memorandum of the ministry on Friday seen by HT. “In wake of this situation, a decision has been taken to deploy multidisciplinary central teams to 10 identified states, some of which are either reporting an increasing number of Omicron and Covid-19 cases, or slow vaccination pace, to aid the efforts of the state and district administration for management of Covid-19.” The teams will be sent to Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Mizoram, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Punjab. They will be stationed for 3-5 days, working with state health authorities.The teams have been tasked to look at contact tracing, including surveillance; containment operations; Covid-19 testing, including sending of adequate samples from clusters to the government’s INSACOG lab network for genome sequencing; Covid-appropriate behaviour and its enforcement; availability of hospital beds, sufficient logistics including ambulances, ventilators, medical oxygen, etc.; and progress of vaccinations. “The state-level central teams will assess the situation, suggest remedial actions and submit a report every evening by 7 pm on the public health activities being undertaken to the disaster management cell besides submitting the same to state government…,” the order read. Although the number of new daily cases is declining, India’s Covid-19 case positivity rate remains at 5.3%. A case positivity rate of below 5% for two weeks is necessary to contain any outbreak. “There are regional variations, as some states are still reporting a very high number of cases. What is the cause for concern for us is that the case positivity rate in Kerala, which is 6.1%, and Mizoram (8.2%),” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Friday during the ministry’s pandemic briefing. “Compared to the national case positivity rate, both the states are showing very high case positivity.” India has so far has administered first vaccine doses to at least 89% of the adult population, and around 61% is fully vaccinated. There still are at least 11 states that have vaccinated a lower number of people than the national average, for both the first and second doses, according to the health ministry. “We have engaged with these states on a continuous basis, and last such review was held on Thursday where it was discussed how to increase the coverage,” Bhushan said on Friday. The central teams will review all parameters, and look to plug the gap along with the local administration.“The health ministry has rushed teams in the past to states, which seem to have been reporting higher cases or deaths, or inadequate testing related to Covid,” a health ministry official said on condition of anonymity. “These teams act as a guiding force on the ground, and their feedback helps in effective use of strategies to manage the pandemic.”
26-12-2021||India||Day after minister Harak Rawat walks out of cabinet, Dhami says issue resolved||A day after Uttarakhand minister Harak Singh Rawat reportedly stormed out of a cabinet meeting upset over an infrastructure project in his constituency, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami dismissed reports of the minister’s resignation.State BJP chief Madan Kaushik and MLA Umang Sharma were among the other leaders who termed reports of Rawat’s exit as “baseless”.Calls and texts to Rawat – who represents the Kotdwar constituency — for comment went unanswered.Speaking to reporters in Dehradun on Saturday, Kaushik said “all is well in BJP”.“Reports of Harak Singh resigning from the government and party are totally baseless. He has not resigned and the party is united ahead of upcoming state assembly elections,” said Kaushik.He added that Rawat was unhappy over the issue of a proposed medical college in Kotdwar.“Yes, there was some unhappiness on his part regarding the medical college. But it has now been solved. He is our senior leader, and party will support him,” he said.CM Dhami too reiterated Kaushik’s statement. “The party is a family and in a family, sometimes such things happen. However, it has been solved with the government approving an initial fund of ₹5crore for the college.”Earlier, BJP MLA and Harak Singh’s close aide Umesh Sharma had claimed that “the issue has been resolved with no resignation from Rawat.”He said, “It was not a big issue. The episode happened over the lack of approval of a proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar. It has now been resolved as the government has approved it and would likely pass its government order on Monday,” Sharma said.The whole episode also led to speculations of Rawat joining Congress which he had left in 2016 during the party’s government under then CM Harish Rawat, who is now leading the party’s election campaign committee.Opposition Congress meanwhile, claimed the BJP was facing factionalism.Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh said, “BJP is reaping what it sowed… In 2016, BJP committed a felony by taking down a democratically-elected Congress government by breaking away its MLAs through money. Friday’s episode is the result. People of Uttarakhand have not forgetten,” said Singh.Former CM and party national general secretary Harish Rawat, however, said in a veiled reference: “I have no information whether he is in touch with any of our leaders as the development is being monitored by party state president Ganesh Godiyal. However, I want to say that, those who committed crime against democracy in 2016, have to first apologise before the state’s public. I am not sitting with a stick to check who is coming to the party and who is not.”
26-12-2021||India||Course correction important for Congress to win Uttarakhand polls: Harish Rawat||A “course correction” is necessary for the Congress to script a victory in the upcoming Uttarakhand assembly elections, the party’s campaign committee chairman Harish Rawat said on Saturday.“Some course correction is important to win the upcoming elections,” Rawat said at a media briefing.The rethinking comes a day after Rawat met Rahul Gandhi. He had earlier posted several tweets that were seen as his unhappiness with the party’s election strategy. Rawat was replaced by Harish Chaudhary two months ago as the party’s chief election strategist for the Punjab assembly elections due in early 2022, the same as Uttarakhand.“One thing we all should understand is that the AICC (All India Congress Committee) is the boss, just like the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India). The election in-charges are like a coach. But the playing captain, too, is important,” the former Uttarakhand chief minister said on Saturday. “So, there should be a relation of confidence and understanding among the three.”“If you play at cross purposes, the match will be lost,” the veteran party leader said. “Therefore, whatever I said was so that we would win the match. If I would have said it normally, then people would have accused me of political adjustments. So, expressing pain often benefits the party, and I think it will benefit the party.”Taking a dig at former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and Congress parliamentarian Manish Tewari, Rawat said they were regretting quitting the Congress.Rawat served as chief minister of Uttarakhand between 2014 and 2017, and the party sees the 2022 assembly polls as an opportunity to return to power since the Bharatiya Janata Party is roiled by troubles of its own. The ruling party has changed the chief minister three times in the past year.The BJP has 55 members the assembly of 70 members; the Congress has 12.Queried on his meeting with Gandhi, Rawat said it has been made clear that everyone has to work together. “I will lead as the campaign committee chairman, and everyone will support me,” he said.However, the Congress has stopped short of announcing Rawat as its chief ministerial candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/course-correction-important-for-congress-to-win-uttarakhand-polls-harish-rawat-101640454327147.html
26-12-2021||India||DCGI approves Covaxin for emergency use in age group between 12 and 18 years||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Saturday granted approval for restricted use in emergency situation to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the paediatric age group between 12 and 18 years, people familiar with the matter said, making it the second vaccine after Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D that was approved for use in children aged 12 years and above.“Yes, DCGI has granted approval for use of Covaxin in children,” confirmed a senior government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.However, it is still time before the Union health ministry starts jabbing children under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme as it is waiting for the expert scientific opinion on the matter.“Even though the approval has been granted by the DCGI for paediatric emergency use of Covaxin, we will await the inputs of the standing group on Covid of NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation) on lowering the age of beneficiaries,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity. The approval from DCGI came nearly 10 weeks after the subject expert committee of central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) recommended Covaxin’s use in children on October 12, this year, based on the clinical trials data submitted by the Hyderabad-based company.Covaxin is one of the two anti-Covid vaccines being currently used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme; the other vaccine being Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is being locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield.For a vaccine to be included formally in the government’s coronavirus immunisation campaign for children or adults, DCGI’s approval is mandatory.It is for the first time that DCGI has taken this long to approve recommendations of the subject expert committee of CDSCO with regard to a Covid-19 vaccine; so far the DCGI approval has been granted in a day or two max. Six anti Covid-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization by the national drugs regulator so far based on the recommendations of the subject expert committee.“The drugs controller general of India took his time to approve the vaccine for paediatric use after carefully scrutinizing the data and looking at some additional data from around the world where vaccination in children has begun. It is a sensitive matter, which is why it made sense to be thorough before granting the approval,” said a senior official in the Union ministry of health and family welfare, on condition of anonymity.“We will have to be extremely careful when talking about Covid-19 vaccination in children as even the developed countries that have begun vaccinating their children have been treading cautiously,” added the official cited above.According to the conditions laid down by the subject expert committee, the company should submit safety data, including the data on adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) and adverse event of special interest (AESI), with due analysis, every 15 days for the first two months and monthly thereafter and also as per requirement of New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019. The company should also continue the study as per the approved clinical trial protocol and provide updated prescribing information/package Insert (Pl), Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Factsheet. Experts welcome the approval and say it is high time children are also vaccinated against Covid-19.“Children may not get severe disease but there will always be the risk of others getting infected through children, especially elders and those at high risk in the family. Government should take a stand on it soon as the numbers currently are low,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of respiratory medicine department, Fortis Healthcare. 
26-12-2021||Today's||Democracy and the US-India relationship||By most accounts, the Summit for Democracy hosted by United States (US) President Joe Biden earlier this month was a mess. Many rightly criticised the decision to invite or not invite certain countries: Why, for example, include Pakistan, which, in any case, chose not to officially participate in reported deference to China’s sensitivities, but not Bangladesh? Others thought the agenda was poorly thought through. The participation of Taiwan, while perceived as a pointed message by the US to China, was also accompanied by unnecessary controversy.

26-12-2021||Today's||Disaster management: How India is improving its existing capabilities||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) initiative at the Glasgow climate conference, he was drawing the world’s attention to the urgent need of finding new, smarter, and more effective ways of managing disasters. IRIS aims to forecast, prevent and minimise the loss and damage caused by disasters, by building the technological and institutional capacity of Small Island Developing States with the help of satellite-based modelling and information systems. This is an outcome of the growing realisation that institutional preparedness is critical to handling disasters effectively. A greater focus needs to be laid on building capacity to assess and reduce the risks of a disaster, than just deploying resources on post-disaster relief and rehabilitation.
