02-12-2021||Lucknow||Govt left people to die during Covid lockdown: Akhilesh||KANPUR: On the second day of his Samajwadi Vijay Rath Yatra in Bundelkhand, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav focused on the issues related to farmers and said they would not face any shortage of fertilisers or DAP when his party formed the government in Uttar Pradesh. Accusing the BJP of misleading the people, he said the tricks of the ruling party would not work as change was inevitable. Akhilesh was addressing a rally in Ginnaut Bagh ground of Lalitpur. SP allies Om Prakash Rajbhar and RS Kushwaha shared the dais with the former chief minister at the rally. Akhilesh said the SP would do the best to alleviate the problems the people were facing in Bundelkhand. There had been massive damage to the region due to drought in the past, he said, adding that the party workers distributed food packets to people during the lockdown and Lohia Awas (houses) were given when the SP was in power. “You have seen the horror of four-and-a –half years’ misrule in Uttar Pradesh; the people have never been through the kind of pain that they feel now,” he said. During the first wave of the pandemic, the situation was worse than that during the partition of the country, he said. “Who can forget the pictures when a lockdown was imposed and our labourer brothers had to come from other places,” Yadav said. “The BJP government put up barricades and did not allow them to enter the state,” he alleged. “The government left people like orphans to die. Labourer brothers put their lives at risk and had to walk hundreds of kilometres to reach their home on foot,” the former CM added. The migrants were kept in cow shelters, he said, adding had the SP government been in place, none of the workers would have had to walk and they would have been sent to their native places in vehicles. He said the farmers were compelled to stand in queue for the DAP. “People in Lalitpur will stand in queue to vote to oust this government,” he said, adding, “The farmers are facing huge problems. We will make sure that the farmers harvest two crops in Bundelkhand.” He said the ruling party always flayed him about pariwarvaad (nepotism). Only those having families could understand the pain of others, he said. He took a dig at the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, asking the people if he deserved the title of Yogi. A Yogi, he said was someone who understood the pain of others as his own. He said the Yogi government was meting out injustice in the name of caste and religion. Famers and youths were dejected while traders had been destroyed under the BJP government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/govt-left-people-to-die-during-covid-lockdown-akhilesh-101638469722391.html

After stealing the cars, they would park them near government hospitals or private parking slots for a few days to ensure police were not tracking them. Once confirmed that police were not after them, the men would take the stolen vehicles to their rented godowns and dismantle them. They would then sell the spare parts in scrap markets, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.DCP Sathiyasundaram said that to curb car thefts in the trans-Yamuna region, the anti-auto theft squad (AATS) of Shahdara district was tasked to launch a crackdown on vehicle thieves and receivers of the stolen vehicles and their spare parts. The team collected information about one such gang and arrested two of its members from the Geeta Colony area on November 30.“We caught Amarjeet Singh and Fahimuddin (who goes by his first name) with a stolen Honda City car. Their associate, Irfan, managed to flee,” said the DCP.During interrogation, police said, Singh said he is a car mechanic but got involved in stealing cars and receiving stolen vehicles. Singh rented a godown in Baprola in the outer district, where he dismantled stolen cars. The police raided the godown and recovered parts of various cars. Singh had stored them to sell to potential clients in the Mayapuri scrap market.“Fahimuddin revealed that he worked as a scrap dealer in Sundar Nagri and was also involved in stealing cars with his associate Hakimullah. Both the arrested persons mostly stole Brezza and Baleno SUVs because they were experts in stealing and dismantling them. Also, the spare parts of these two cars are in high demand,” added DCP Sathiyasundaram.Police said that Singh was previously involved in two cases of car theft and was released from jail in August this year. The arrested duo has confessed to stealing over 50 cars along with their associates, who are yet to be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-behind-string-of-car-thefts-in-delhi-arrested-search-on-for-aides-101638469302018.html

A member of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan team, Yadwinder, said they had received information about some children being trafficked to Punjab from Bihar in Karmabhoomi Express. “The kids were sitting in different coaches. A complaint was made to the district child protection office and railway protection force was also informed about the same,” he added. When the train arrived at platform 2 of the city railway station, the teams checked five coaches of the train and rescued as many as eight children, Yadwinder said. He said that of these rescued children, four belong to Bihar while the remaining ones are from West Bengal. A complaint regarding the same has been lodged at the government railway police station and the children will be sent to the child care institute after producing them before the child welfare committee (CWC).He added that the children will be counselled. We are also trying to identify the human trafficking gang, he added. The rescued children are aged between 10 and 17. The committee would also try to ascertain how the traffickers trapped them and where they were planning to take them, officials familiar with the rescue operation said. It may be noted here that the district child protection department along with Bachpan Bachao Andolan and Childline had on July 8 too rescued three children from Ludhiana railway station. Among the three, two were rescued from the same train following a tip off.

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Reduction in excise costs state ₹1,700 crore; MVA in dilemma over reducing VAT on fuel||While the Maharashtra government is under tremendous pressure for the reduction of the value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel, the state is also in a fix over the losses it incurred due to the Central government’s decision of reducing central taxes last month. After the Central government reduced its taxes on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 ahead of Diwali on November 3, the state government’s VAT, which is levied on an ad Valorem (according to value) basis automatically reduced by ₹1.19 and ₹2.41 a litre on petrol and diesel respectively. This has led to the estimated losses to the exchequer by around ₹1,700 crore between November 2021 and March 2022. Losing business to neighbouring states The state government’s estimated revenue from the VAT from petrol and diesel in FY 2021-22 is ₹28,000 crore. The annual sale of diesel in Maharashtra is 1.15 lakh kilolitre, while petrol sale is 50,000 kilolitre. Besides the setoff losses because of the reduction in the central taxes, the state has been losing its business to the neighbouring states due to the huge difference in the price of fuel. According to the rough estimates, the business loss is around 10%. “The major loss is in the diesel sales. For the neighbouring states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa the diesel is cheaper by ₹4.81, ₹3.27, ₹9.13 and ₹6.87 a litre, respectively. The heavy vehicle fleets have been refuelling from the bordering districts to save money. The difference is too huge after the respective Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led states reduced their taxes after the Central government’s decision, resulting in the huge loss of business,” said an official from the finance department. Uday Lodh of Federation of All Maharashtra Petrol Dealers Association said, “The petrol dealers in the districts sharing borders with other states with cheaper diesel have been badly hit. Their business has dropped by up to 90% as the difference is as high as ₹8 a litre. The state government should immediately think about reducing its VAT, to give a level playing field.” State may take a call on VAT by Feb The state government is under tremendous pressure for the reduction in its VAT on the lines of the reduction in the taxes by the Centre and other states. The VAT levied in Maharashtra on diesel is 24% in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Amravati and Aurangabad and 21% in the rest of the state, with an additional cess of ₹3 a litre. The VAT on petrol in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Aurangabad and Amravati 26% and 25% in the rest of the state with the additional cess of ₹10.12 per litre. The VAT and the cess in Maharashtra is one of the highest in the country. With the tremendous pressure from all fronts, including motorists, transporters, petrol-diesel dealers for the reduction in the VAT, the state government is expected to make the decision ahead of the local body elections slated to be held in February. Shambhuraj Desai, minister of state for finance, said, “The reduction in Centre’s tax by ₹5 and ₹10 on petrol and diesel was after increasing the rate multifold. Other states have indeed reduced their VAT and it has resulted in a loss to our business in the bordering areas. We are studying the potential burden if the VAT is reduced. It is a policy decision, which will be taken after due deliberation and by bringing the proposal before the cabinet.”A Nationalist Congress Party minister requesting anonymity, said, “Reduction in VAT on diesel by ₹1 leads to the losses of ₹800 crore and ₹7,000 crore if ₹1 is reduced on petrol. By reducing just ₹1 to ₹2 will not give us any political mileage. However, the reduction by the Centre was huge. Besides the consequential reduction of ₹2.41 on diesel after the November 3 decision by the Centre, we will have to reduce the tax at least by ₹2.50- ₹3. But it will be done at the huge cost of more than ₹3,000 crore.”

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Twenty-eight samples from Maharashtra sent for genome sequencing||Maharashtra government tested 861 international passengers until December 2, with three testing positive, according to data released by the state health department. Twenty-eight samples have been sent for genome sequencing, including the three found positive on Thursday. Their reports are awaited. Meanwhile, the state recorded 796 fresh infections pushing the cumulative Covid-19 cases to 6,637,221 on Thursday. The tally of active cases further reduced to 7,209 as 952 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. It also saw 24 casualties on Thursday and the number of fatalities stood at 141,049. Raigad reported the highest toll with twelve deaths. A health department release said, “Until today (Thursday) morning, 861 international passengers have been tested with RT-PCR and 3 of them have been found positive. Samples of all three patients have been sent for genomic sequencing. Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers who arrived since November 1 is underway. A total of 28 samples from both airport and field surveillance have been sent for genomic sequencing. Out of these, 12 are sent to NIV, Pune and 16 to Kasturba Hospital laboratory (in Mumbai). Of the 28, 25 are international travellers and three are their close contacts.” The state has managed to diminish the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic even after lifting most of the curbs as no spike was recorded in the state after the festive season that lasted almost two months. But the situation has changed since the outbreak of the Omicron variant which is being called as a super mutant owing to its transmissibility. On Thursday, the state health department said that there is not enough clarity on its severity, and more information is expected to be released in the next two weeks. It has also urged the people to follow Covid-appropriate behavior and inform the state health authorities if they have international travel history from the last month and are not fully vaccinated. “On November 26, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the Covid-19 virus variant detected in South Africa and some other countries Omicron. It has also classified the Omicron variant as a ‘Variant of Concern’. Experts have expressed possibilities that owing to the genetic modification in the virus, it may possess some specific characteristics. While the transmissibility of infection seems to have increased because of this new variant, there is still not enough clarity on whether or not it will cause a severe disease and whether it will evade the immunity. More information is expected in the next two weeks’ time or so,” stated the release. “Genetic changes or mutation in viruses is a natural phenomenon and people should not panic. The state health department appeals to the citizens that they should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, inform the state health department authorities if they have had an international travel history in the last month and those who have not taken Covid-19 vaccine or have had only one dose should complete their vaccination at the earliest,” it added. With 220 cases, Mumbai again reported the highest number of cases in the entire state and its tally reached a total of 763,206 cases till date. It also recorded one fatality taking the toll to 16,341. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 108,329 samples and had a positivity rate of 0.73%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 10.1%, according to the data issued by the state health department. The state also vaccinated 938,930 doses on Thursday and has administered a total 116,209,817 doses till date, according to the data available on CoWin portal. 
02-12-2021||Pune||Preparedness for Omicron variant: Of the 65 oxygen plants planned in Pune, only 37 are operational||Even as the government had promised to expedite the procedure to make all the proposed Oxygen plants operational within three months ending September, the story is far from over. The administration had planned to install 65 oxygen plants in Pune district, of which only 37 are operational and 28 are in pipeline. The installation of the plants acquired renewed urgency after the second Covid-19 wave this summer triggered a shortage of life-saving medical oxygen. Before the pandemic, the district did not have a single oxygen plant. The 37 operational plants have a production capacity of about 21,550 liters per minute and 20 oxygen tanks that can store more than 300 kilo-liters of oxygenEarlier in August, when the second wave was on the verge of decline, the administration had planned to set up 38 oxygen plants and make it operational by September end, but the administration promised to install more plants considering the rise in cases. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, in a virtual meeting on Monday along with multiple stakeholders said that the district is fully prepared with enough stock of drugs and also enough supply of oxygen. “Although we are fully prepared for a third wave, the sheer transmission rate of the Omicron variant as is being discussed among the health experts can be challenging for us. If the transmission is about 500-600 times, then it can be a challenge to deal with the patients if the hospitalisation rate rises. Along with Pune, we also utilised this time to prepare the health infrastructure of the neighbouring districts like Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Kolhapur so that the eventual load on the hospitals in Pune is also reduced.” As of November 26, there are about six more plants proposed in Pune city with a capacity of 6,766 liters per minute (LPM), four plants in the PCMC area with 3,590 LPM and 18 plants for rural areas with 6,301 LPM. Along with this, more storage tanks for liquid medical oxygen are also being built, three in Pune city with a capacity of 43 kilo-liters, one in PCMC with 20 KL’s and two in Pune rural with 12 KL’s A nightmare on repeatCovid-19 exposed the world to India’s medical oxygen problem, yet only 37 oxygen plants are operationalCurrent status of oxygen plants in the district Details No. of plantsTotal plants 65 Functional plants 37 Proposed plants 28 Area Operational/capacity* Proposed/capacity PMC 12/9500 6/6766 PCMC 3/2460 4/3590 Pune rural 22/9589 18/6301 *production capacity in liters per minute Liquid Oxygen tanks Details No. of tanksTotal water tanks 26 Functional water tanks 20 Proposed water tanks 6 Area Operational/capacity** Proposed/capacity PMC 9/130 3/43 PCMC 6/131 1/20 Pune rural 5/72 2//12 **storage capacity in kilo liters In addition to this, private hospitals have a storage capacity of 211 metric ton liquid medical oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/preparedness-for-omicron-variant-of-the-65-oxygen-plants-planned-in-pune-only-37-are-operational-101638467802005.html

Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura are among our holiest places and which Hindu won’t seek a grand temple there,” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran asked. “Talking about building a grand temple at his (Krishna’s) birthplace cannot be wrong,” Khanna said. Khanna, who has been elected lawmaker from Shahjahanpur for eight consecutive terms, is the senior most cabinet minister of the Yogi Adityanath government in UP. His backing of Maurya’s tweet is being viewed as the ruling party’s endorsement of the deputy CM’s stand on the Mathura temple issue. Maurya on Thursday asked the opposition parties to clear their stand on the Mathura temple issue. “So far, the opposition parties have said various things without actually touching upon the central issue. I would like all the opposition parties, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav ji in particular, who is claiming these days that he is a Krishna devotee, if they support the call for a grand temple at the Lord’s birthplace,” Maurya said. Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati hit out at Maurya, saying his tweet was aimed at the UP elections. “This is their last desperate bid and people should remain aware of this Hindu-Muslim politics of theirs,” Mayawati tweeted. In November, on a visit to Mathura-Vrindavan, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said that plans were afoot to ensure that like Ayodhya, Mathura too was developed into a global pilgrimage centre. “All the facilities, development happening in Ayodhya would happen in Mathura too,” he had said. Samajwadi Party and Congress leaders said they felt that the statement on Mathura was made to polarise the atmosphere in order to offset the party’s likely losses due to the farmers’ agitation in west UP. “It is all so clear. We all are Hindus too and BJP surely doesn’t have a copyright on gods as they make it appear. Hinduism stands for inclusiveness and it is a lesson these ruling party politicians, who fear losing UP, need to learn. In fact, the people of this state will make them realise that such tactics won’t work,” said Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh.

The doctor survived the attack as he had shielded himself with a register when the man, who had earlier worked at his clinic, fired a bullet at him.The bullet got stuck in the register and saved the dentist’s life, the police said.Senior police officers said that the arrested man, Naveen Singh, was angry with the dentist because of a financial dispute and because he was allegedly in a relationship with his sister. Singh’s two sisters also worked at the clinic.“Some months ago, a heated argument took place between Singh and the doctor over the two issues. Singh felt humiliated after finding out about the dentist’s relationship with his sister. He pledged to take revenge from him and planned it with the 17-year-old boy,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey. On November 27, the dentist was at his clinic when Singh and his juvenile friend arrived on a motorcycle. The teenager remained on the bike while Singh barged into the clinic wearing a helmet and went straight into the doctor’s chamber. He pulled out a firearm and fired a shot. As the dentist immediately shielded himself with a register, the bullet got stuck into it and saved his life. Singh tried to reload the gun but it malfunctioned. Then he ran out of the clinic and fled on the motorcycle with his associate, said DCP Pandey.The police registered a case of attempt to murder and began an investigation.  After several raids, the police caught Singh from Sonia Vihar on Wednesday. His interrogation led to the apprehension of the teenager and recovery of the gun as well as the motorcycle used in the crime, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/minor-among-two-held-for-firing-at-dentist-in-south-delhi-s-kalkaji-last-week-101638467201737.html
02-12-2021||Mumbai||Institutional quarantine, RT-PCR only for passengers from SA, Botswana & Zimbabwe||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government on Thursday issued revised guidelines for air passengers coming into the state, making it mandatory for passengers coming from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe to undergo RT-PCR testing on arrival and a seven-day institutional quarantine to contain the spread of Omicron variant of Covid-19. The fresh order, which was issued after the Centre asked the state health department to “align” its order with the guidelines of the union ministry of health, also removed the rule that mandated negative RT-PCR test reports for domestic fliers coming into Maharashtra from other states. Instead, passengers will either have to be fully vaccinated or carry an RT-PCR negative report conducted within 72 hours prior to boarding.While keeping the Centre’s guidelines as “minimum restriction”, the state’s latest order created a category called ‘high-risk countries’ - South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. However, fliers coming from countries that are designated as ‘at-risk’ by the Centre, European countries including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Bangladesh, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel, will have to follow guidelines issued by the Centre, senior government officials said. These include a self-paid Covid-19 test on arrival, seven-day home quarantine, if negative, and a re-test on the eighth day.The order issued by chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty said that the list of ‘high-risk countries’ is a dynamic one and will be updated as and when required by the state government. The order said that all passengers from ‘high-risk’ countries shall have to undergo RT-PCR Test immediately on arrival at the respective international airport and shall undergo mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine. Another RT-PCR test will be conducted on the seventh day. If any of the tests is found to be positive, then the passenger shall be shifted to a hospital. In case the result is negative, then the passenger will have to undergo a further seven days of home quarantine. International passengers will also have to fill out a form declaring details of the countries visited in the last 15 days. Any incorrect information furnished by the passenger will lead to action under sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the order said.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said that the move to make institutional quarantine mandatory for three nations has been done as it is suspected that community transmission has started in these African nations. “If they are inbound from countries where there is community transmission of Omicron, they need complete supervision like institutional quarantine. The government of India had adopted home quarantine with close supervision. The institutional quarantine will be done only in Maharashtra for three countries,” he said.The State government rolled back its earlier rule mandating a negative RT-PCR test 48 hours before arrival from other states into Maharashtra. On Wednesday, the Centre wrote to the health department saying the state’s order was in “divergence” with the guidelines of the health ministry. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday said that the state altered it to make the rules uniform for all fliers. “The guidelines issued by the State and the Centre earlier had a few differences. But we have decided to sort that out,” he said.
02-12-2021||Lucknow||Mamata Banerjee may ride Akhilesh’s vijay rath, seek support for him as next Uttar Pradesh CM||West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) president Mamata Banerjee may ride Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav’s “vijay rath” to drum up support for him as the next chief minister of the state, said people in the SP who are privy to the matter.According to the party’s plan, three women leaders — Mamata Banerjee, SP MP and film personality Jaya Bachchan, and former Kannauj MP and Akhilesh’s wife Dimple Yadav — will join Akhilesh’s Vijay Yatra together.The SP will announce the date at “an appropriate time,” said those aware of the developments in the party. This yatra (on a motorised rath) will be in Lucknow.If Mamata Banerjee campaigns for Akhilesh in Lucknow this time, it will be the second time she is seeking support for him in elections. In November 2016, towards the end of Akhilesh’s first term as the UP chief minister, Mamata Banerjee had addressed a public meeting in support of Akhilesh and against the Union government’s demonetisation decision. Mamata Banerjee had held the meeting at the 1090 crossing in Lucknow within weeks of the demonetisation announcement.Akhilesh and Mamata Banerjee have shared a bonhomie since the SP leader became the UP chief minister for the first time in 2012. Both the parties have been supporting each other since then. This is Banerjee’s third successive term as the West Bengal chief minister. The SP had supported the TMC in both the 2016 and the 2021 West Bengal assembly polls.Also Read | Akhilesh Yadav extends support to Mamata Banerjee ahead of Bengal polls“In the 2021 polls, our party MP Jaya Bachchan and the party’s national vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda had substantially campaigned for the TMC and our party had not contested the polls in the eastern state,” said a senior SP leader.Kiranmoy Nanda, the SP’s national vice-president, reportedly was instrumental in Mamata’s TMC-organised event taking place in Lucknow in 2016 and also the forthcoming one. Nanda hails from West Bengal and had been a former minister there.Akhilesh had launched his Vijay Yatra as part of the 2022 UP assembly election campaign on October 13 from Kanpur (to Hamirpur). Thereafter, he embarked on yatras in Hardoi, from Gorakhpur to Kushinagar, Ghazipur to Lucknow, and has just finished Banda-Mahoba-Lalitpur leg.

The fees will remain the same as in the academic year 2020-21. Students of some colleges faced issues of being charged high examination fees and several students and student unions complained about the same, even to the vice-chancellor, after which the decision was taken.A circular issued on December 1 by Mahesh Kakade, head of the examination and evaluation department of SPPU, stated, “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many students and their parents had to face a financial crisis. Considering this, the university’s student welfare board decided not to increase examination fees for the first- and second- semester in the academic year 2021-22. The fees will be taken as earlier in the academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21. All colleges and institutions have been instructed accordingly and will follow through while taking exam fees.”Kuldeep Ambekar, a student and president of Students Helping Hand Organisation, said, “We had repeatedly complained about the examination fees issue during the pandemic as students were charged heavy fees despite the exams being held online. In some colleges, results were not given till the students paid up the fees. It is good that the university has not hiked the fees for this academic year and we welcome the decision.”Another student Rahul Mandhare said, “It is good that fees have not been increased but some concession should be given to students as well and they should be able to pay the fees in installments. Students and their families are somehow managing to become stable financially after lifting of the lockdown and other restrictions. This will take another year to settle down so if the fees are payable in installments, it will be beneficial for students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-hike-in-fees-for-1st-2nd-semester-of-sppu-affiliated-colleges-101638466902407.html
02-12-2021||Pune||December rain kills 150 sheep; grape, paddy crops likely to be hit||PUNE December rain is likely to have affected the grape and paddy crops in Western Maharashtra. At least 150 sheep died in the Purandar taluka of Pune district due to the heavy rain on Wednesday. Prashant Utage , animal husbandry officer said, “There are reports that 152 sheep passed away. The panchanama is on and chances are this number may increase. This happened mainly in Vanpuri, Supe, Walhe Tekwadi, Parinche and other villages in Purandar taluka.” Grape farmer Vilas Gangude from Nashik district said, “I planned for an early crop. I planned to start sending grapes to the market three-four days ago, but the rains damaged the rest of my crop. It is tough to say what the losses will be as the meteorology department has forecast rain for few more days.” Rajendra Pawar, president of the Maharashtra Draksh Bagayatdar Sangh, said, “Only the vineyards where cutting happened early are likely to get damaged, but it is tough to say what the exact position will be right now.” Strawberry farmer Satish Bhilare from Panchgani said, “Strawberries which were fully grown got damaged, but if the weather does not improve, then there are chances of more damage.” Sadashiv Nangade, a paddy farmer from Bhor taluka in Pune district said, “We cut the paddy and kept it in the open to dry. Due to the rain, there are chances that the rice would turn black and this would affect the market value.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/december-rain-kills-150-sheep-grape-paddy-crops-likely-to-be-hit-101638466422483.html

02-12-2021||Lucknow||Prayagraj: New ₹37 cr modern academic building to come up at MNNIT||State’s lone NIT—Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT)-Allahabad— will soon get a brand new modern academic building embellished with all the latest amenities soon. The building would be constructed at a cost of ₹37 crores. The Union Ministry of Education has sanctioned the budget for the building to the institute, informed MNNIT director, Prof Rajeev Tripathi. He said that the institute has in turn now entrusted the construction responsibility to Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the central agency which has earlier too taken up vital construction work on its campus. This three-floor building (ground floor + two floors) will be built near the existing library of the institute. Besides a library, toilets and power backup, the building will have high-tech conference rooms and labs with state-of-the-art equipment, Tripathi said. As soon as the building is completed, some departments, such as humanities and social sciences, mathematics, and electronics and communication engineering, could move into it, and others facing space crunch could be given space on vacated sites, said Tripathi. It may be noted that in 2019, the Central government had directed the implementation of a 10 per cent economically weaker section (EWS) quota in educational institutions. Under this, 25 per cent of seats were increased in institutions including at MNNIT. The new building is being constructed to alleviate the shortage of space and resources caused by the gradual increase of seats in the institute under the EWS quota. After increasing the seats, the need to increase the infrastructure was being intensely felt. With the increase in the number of students, it had become imperative to increase the infrastructure too accordingly, the director explained. Prof Tripathi said that a detailed proposal was prepared and sent to the union ministry of education for approval and sanction of the requisite funds. Now the funds worth ₹37 crores have been sanctioned for it and the institute has accordingly entrusted the task of construction of this new building to CPWD which would soon kick-start the construction on the selected site in the campus. It has already started the soil testing works he said. CAPTION: MNNIT-Allahabad campus in Prayagraj. HT File Photo

02-12-2021||Bangalore||All contacts of India’s 1st Omicron patient test negative, not so for 2nd patient||BENGALURU: India’s first cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus were reported in Karnataka on Thursday. According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, a 66-year-old male and a 46-year-old male tested positive for the variant in Bengaluru.“Two cases of Omicron have been found positive: a 66-year-old male, and a 46-year-old male. We got the results very late last night,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary at the union ministry of health and family welfare, told reporters. “All primary and secondary contacts have been identified and are under isolation.”While Agarwal refused to divulge any more details about the two positive cases, Gaurav Gupta, commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) said one of the patients is a South African national who arrived in Bengaluru on November 20 and the second patient is a health care worker in Bengaluru.The confirmation came after genome sequencing results came from a laboratory under the INSACOG when the samples were sent by the Karnataka government for verification.The World Health Organization (WHO) has labelled Omicron a Virus of Concern last Friday, and the UN health body suggested that preliminary evidence found an increased risk of re-infection with this variant, as compared to other variants of concern.Gupta told HT that India’s Omicron patient number one is a South African who landed in Bengaluru on November 20. “The patient is 66-year-old. His samples were collected on November 20 at the (Kempegowda) international airport on the day of his arrival. He had come from South Africa via Dubai. He came to India with an RT-PCR negative test report, but tested positive in the city,” said Gupta.A report from BBMP said that after the Covid test, he checked into a hotel in the city. After he tested positive, a doctor from the Urban Primary Health Care Centre visited him for a physical triage and found him to be asymptomatic. He was asked to isolate himself at the hotel. “On November 22, his test samples were collected and sent for genomic sequencing via BBMP,” said the report.It further added that the patient took a self-examination on November 23 and was tested negative. On getting this negative report at 12.34am on November 27, he left for Dubai from where he had come to the country.Karnataka’s minister for health and family welfare, Dr K Sudhakar said that India’s patient number one had 24 primary contacts and 240 secondary contacts. “The samples were collected from these contacts on November 22 and 23. All of them have tested negative. Even though they have tested negative, we are constantly monitoring their health,” said the minister.Unlike the first patient who arrived from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, patient number two was a resident of Bengaluru without any travel history.BBMP’s report said: “On November 21, he developed fever and body ache. He underwent an RT-PCR test on November 22 around 10am and by 4pm, he was declared Covid positive. Since he had a low CT value (which indicates a high viral load), his sample was sent for genomic sequencing,” said the report.The patient was in home isolation between November 22 to 24. On November 25, he was shifted to a hospital and was discharged on November 27, said the report.“He (patient number 2) had 13 primary contacts and 205 secondary contacts. Out of which, three primary contacts and two secondary contacts have tested positive for Covid. They are currently at a government hospital, and they are not showing any severe symptoms. We have sent their samples for genome sequencing,” said the health minister.It remains unclear how patient number two, who doesn’t have a travel history or contact with patient number one contracted the new variant which wasn’t detected in India before. “No comments,” said BBMP commissioner Gupta, when asked about the source of the new variant in the second patient.Following the detection of the new variant, the Karnataka government has asked the officials concerned to increase testing and tracking at various airports in Karnataka. The government on Tuesday issued directions to test all international passengers arriving in the state.BBMP commissioner Gupta said while the guidelines for the general public such as avoiding crowds and wearing masks continue, BBMP will increase the number of samples sent for genome sequencing.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is in New Delhi to meet union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to seek permission to administer the third dose of vaccine to frontline workers in the state, is expected to return to Bengaluru on Friday. Officials at CM’s office said that a high-level meeting will be held on his arrival to discuss further steps to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/all-contacts-of-india-s-1st-omicron-patient-test-negative-not-so-for-2nd-patient-101638463601346.html
02-12-2021||Lucknow||Police begin verifying identities of visitors, tenants in Sangam vicinity ahead of Magh Mela-2022||Ahead of the upcoming Magh Mela-2022, the police teams have started a verification drive of persons living in the Sangam area including, Parade Ground, near ghats and nearby slums in a bid to ensure security during the fair. Daraganj police are also verifying details of the tenants who have shifted to the area recently to identify any suspicious person who may cause trouble during the annual religious fair. It is worth mentioning that during Kumbh-2019, a satellite phone was found to be in use in the Mela area but despite all efforts, the phone and its user could not be traced. Moreover, there have been incidents of thefts from vehicles and even at ghats during the main bathing days. Some pick-pockets and snatchers have also been arrested during the Magh and Kumbh fairs in the past. There are some large slums at Parade Ground and Daraganj area which are close to Sangam and other ghats. During Mela, many gangs of thieves, including women, take shelter at Parade Ground and nearby slums and commit thefts. They leave the place after the fair is over to avoid the police. Now in a bid to identify such gangs and suspicious persons, police teams have launched a rigorous drive at Parade Ground and Sangam area on the instructions of senior police officials. Police teams are verifying documents of those living in the Sangam area and nearby slums and are checking if any suspicious persons have come there recently. The police are also taking the help of locals and informers to identify suspects. Moreover, a list of those involved in thefts and other crimes at Sangam in the past is also being compiled. Police officials said they would keep a strict eye on the suspects and take appropriate actions if necessary. On Thursday SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi visited the Sangam area and inspected the ongoing works. He issued necessary instructions to the concerned officials. SSP said that amid the ongoing preparation for Magh Mela, patrolling has been increased in the Sangam area and adjoining areas. A search has been launched for suspicious persons who may cause trouble during the annual fair, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/police-begin-verifying-identities-of-visitors-tenants-in-sangam-vicinity-ahead-of-magh-mela2022-101638463364310.html

Hearing his screams, others rushed to the spot following which the big cat left the boy and hid inside a classroom, said a member of forest department team that along with a team of NGO Wildlife SOS rescued the big cat. The rescue operation lasted for 4 hours and the big cat was later released in Shivalika forest division in Saharanpur on Thursday. Aditi Sharma, conservator of forests (Aligarh), said, “The leopard probably sneaked into the college in the night and was first sighted near the staircase. On being informed, our team rushed to the location and immediately evacuated the students and staff and cordoned off the area with safety nets. Wildlife SOS assisted us in the safe rescue and release of the leopard.” The injured child was taken to hospital for treatment and was stable, she said. The official further said, as the leopard was confined to the first floor, the team called for a bucket truck that is often used for repairing street lights to facilitate the team. They spotted the big cat hiding behind a chair inside an empty classroom. Wildlife SOS veterinary doctor Dr Rahul Prasad tranquilized the leopard through a window. Dr Prasad said, “Such rescue operations are highly sensitive and need careful planning in order to ensure the safety of the animal as well as of the people. The leopard kept running between classrooms which made the task challenging.” Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO Wildlife SOS, said, “We are very grateful to the forest department for making this rescue a success. Such incidents are a direct result of loss of forest cover and encroachment leading to depletion of natural prey base and habitat, which in turn forces wild animals to venture into human settlements in search of food and shelter. This often leads to human-animal conflicts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/leopard-enters-school-in-aligarh-injures-student-101638463242254.html

In the legislative council, Congress member Prem Chandra Mishra moved an adjournment motion, saying it was a criminal offence on the part of the doctors.  The eye hospital had held a cataract camp on November 22 in which many people from nearby areas were operated upon. At least 25 people who had undergone cataract operations there complained of pain in their eyes and contacted the hospital, after which the eyes of almost 15 people were extracted.Later in the day, the entire opposition led by former deputy chief minister Rabri Devi held a protest holding placards. “We demand adequate compensation to victims and action against the culprit,” she said. Mishra demanded to job for at least one member of the affected families. A few leaders also demanded the resignation of health minister. In the assembly, the issue was also raised by Congress leader Ajit Sharma, who alleged that the health system in Bihar has collapsed. “After the Muzaffarpur incident, the government has remained a mute spectator. Chief minister Nitish Kumar should take action. The government should arrange better treatment in Delhi or wherever possible for those whose eyes have been damaged and compensation should be given to the affected families. Strict action should be taken against the culprits,” said Sharma.He also demanded the resignation of health minister Mangal Pandey. “The government is definitely not taking any cognizance of the incident. Affected people should get government help, including financial compensation and action should be taken against guilty doctors,” said Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Bhai Birendra. Meanwhile, health minister Mangal Pandey told HT said a four-member team has been sent to Muzaffarpur to probe the matter. “This will be in addition to the four-member team probing the matter at district level,” said Pandey.The health minister said the team would be collecting the swab samples, instruments used, the fluid used for surgery, the condition of hospital and other details. “We are expecting a report in next 72 hours and action will be taken on the basis of report,” he said. 
02-12-2021||Patna||DIG facing graft charge suspended||Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police Shafi-Ul-Haque, who was facing corruption charges, has been suspended for extorting money from his juniors, according to a notification issued by the home department Wednesday night.The action was taken based on a report submitted by the economic offence unit (EoU) , which was probing the case, in the last week of November . Haque was posted as Munger’s DIG when allegations of corruption were levelled against him by junior officers last year. Departmental proceedings against him started on November 3 this year. The matter came to light when one of his junior officers recorded his verbal orders demanding money using name of a state minister. The minister later provided the audio clip to chief minister Nitish Kumar who ordered an inquiry, said officials familiar with the matter.On the basis of several complaints, the EoU conducted an investigation and found the charges to be true. Haque was transferred to the police headquarters in Patna on June 19, 2021. He was waiting for a posting till the suspension order was not issued. The home department has directed him to report before IG Patna during his suspension.A person familiar with the matter said that an additional superintendent of police (ASP) in Munger had alleged that a person claiming to be close to Haque approached him and demanded a bribe while promising to help him in a departmental inquiry initiated by the state police headquarters for his alleged failure to file a charge sheet against two accused in the case of recovery of 22 AK-47 rifles smuggled from the Central Ordnance Depot (COD) in Jabalpur in September 2018.The ASP also provided an audio clip to back his claim. Two days before his transfer, Haque had recommended departmental proceedings against the ASP for his alleged failure to file a charge sheet in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/dig-facing-graft-charge-suspended-101638463063218.html
02-12-2021||Patna||MLAs fume after cop halts minister’s car in assembly for ‘VIP passage’||The Bihar assembly on Thursday witnessed uproarious scenes when labour resources minister Jibesh Kumar lamented how he felt “humiliated” when his car was stopped by security personnel to make way for cars of Patna’s district magistrate and police chief inside the premises of the legislative building. The minister stood up during the question hour and narrated how his car was stopped today inside the legislative assembly premises and a traffic constable asked him “to wait till the cars of DM and SP passed through”. The minister sought immediate action against the erring officials. “When my car was stopped, I thought the CM’s convoy or Speaker’s car is passing by. But the security personnel stopped my car for making way for car of DM and SSP. This is an insult of public representatives. I seek your (Speaker’s) protection and immediate action against officials who stopped my car. Is the government supreme or is it that the DM and SSP above the minister? This has to be decided,” Kumar said, sounding visibly agitated. Opposition legislators immediately started shouting and rushed to the well of the house, demanding action against officials for stopping the minister’s car. Senior legislators of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and the Left, Lalit Kumar Yadav, Ajeet Sharma and Mehboob Alam, respectively, said the incident only reflected how prestige and dignity of legislators was being undermined by the bureaucracy. Sources said the minister’s car was apparently stopped because the CM’s convoy had just entered the legislative assembly with senior officials and police officials, including Patna’s SSP. A traffic constable on duty told reporters that he had only followed orders because the CM’s convoy was passing and he had acted as per protocol by stopping the minister’s car. Amid the protests, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the matter was serious and would be looked into even as Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha adjourned the house for 15 minutes, asking the agitated members to attend a meeting with him at his chamber. Another meeting of business advisory committee was held after pre-lunch session wherein leaders of major parties were present. Patna’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Upendra Sharma was also called during the meeting in the pre-lunch session, sources said. In the evening, the Speaker held a meeting with senior police and administrative officials on the matter, sources said. Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad said it seemed unlikely that minister car could have been deliberately stopped. “There must have been some issues related to CM’s convoy. But we are looking into the whole matter,” he said. Director general of police S K Sinnghal said they are probing the matter from all angles and CCTV footages would be scanned. Meanwhile, a strongly worded statement was issued in protest by Sanjay Jaiswal, who heads the state unit of BJP, to which Jibesh Kumar Mishra belongs. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had only recently stressed the need for officials to be courteous towards elected representatives,” said Jaiswal, who is a Lok Sabha member. “While this is a convention followed across the country, in Bihar some bureaucrats seem to betray a sort of regal arrogance. The Speaker must take cognisance and act,” he said.

An FIR against unidentified people had been registered under Section 379 (for theft) of the IPC and further investigation was on, said police on Thursday.A special team had been deployed to investigate into the case as it related to the nation’s security and there could be some anti-national motives behind it, they said.The FIR was lodged on Wednesday on the complaint of trailer driver Hem Singh Rawat of Ajmer (Rajasthan). Rawat stated that he was transporting five tyres of a fighter jet and travelling from BKT Air Force Station to Jodhpur when one of them was stolen on Shaheed Path on Saturday (November 27), said Dheeraj Shukla, inspector in-charge of Ashiana police station. The complainant mentioned the tyre was stolen when his vehicle was stuck in a traffic jam. According to another police official, the driver said two SUV-borne men stole the tyre when the trailer was in the jam.

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Opposition cannot be limited to UPA; need broader front with collective leadership, says NCP||A day after Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that there is no united progressive alliance (UPA) left, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) national spokesperson Nawab Malik on Thursday said that things will not change if Opposition parties limit themselves to UPA. There is a need for a broader front with collective leadership to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre. Several parties are not part of UPA but have significant strength and thus need to be brought on this platform. He also pointed out the drawbacks of UPA by saying that there were several issues in the country, on which, UPA allies could have met to discuss and formalise a strategy, but that did not happen.The NCP stand is seen as an advice to its ally in Maharashtra. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has been publicly expressing his view that all Opposition parties should be brought together to provide an alternative to the ruling BJP-led NDA at the Centre.“Things will not go ahead by limiting UPA. Several parties are not part of it but have around 150 seats (out of 543 seats in Lok Sabha) and thus need to be brought on a platform to make a broader front with collective leadership. There were several issues in the country on which UPA allies could have met (to formalise a strategy) but that did not happen. Certainly, there were drawbacks,” Malik told reporters in Pune.On Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar at the latter’s residence in Mumbai. After the meeting, she said that there was no UPA left in the country and made a pitch for unifying Opposition parties. “What is UPA? There is no UPA,” Banerjee told reporters after the meeting. On Tuesday, Banerjee met leaders of the Shiv Sena, the biggest constituent of Maharashtra’s ruling alliance that also comprises the NCP and Congress.“Considering today’s situation and the ongoing fascism, a strong alternative force is required in the country against it. No one can do it alone. We all need a strong alternative and if someone is not ready to fight, then what can be done,” Banerjee had said without naming Congress.On Thursday, Malik said that Banerjee told them there is unrest in the country against the PM Narendra Modi led government at the Centre and there is a need to bring all the opposition parties together. “Pawar saheb clearly said we will make all the efforts. No opposition can be strengthened without Congress. We want to bring all the parties be it Mamata didi (TMC), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), Samajwadi Party (SP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and parties from southern states on a platform. We want to make a front along with Congress, which will have a collective leadership,” he said.Referring to Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, a ruling coalition, comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, the NCP minister said that Pawar is the real Chanakya who brought Congress and Shiv Sena together to ally.“Pawar is a real Chanakya who defeated the one who was calling himself Chanakya. No one would have dreamt that Shiv Sena and Congress could come together. Similarly, Pawar saheb will bring such parties together that no one would have imagined. Our front cannot be made by removing any particular party (Congress). We want to include all the parties and Pawar saheb is working in that direction,” he said.Congress leader and state minister Ashok Chavan said all such issues can be discussed and resolved on the forum of UPA. He said that they agree that all anti-BJP parties should come together but what is wrong if they all come under the UPA fold.“Since all issues pertaining to UPA, the matter should be discussed at the highest level with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. It is a proper forum under which all such issues should be discussed, everybody can express their individual opinions and the UPA chairperson is also competent enough to take a call on the suggestions,” Chavan said.“No doubt all anti-BJP parties should come together but what is wrong if they come into the UPA fold. What is the point in forming a front without Congress when you want to take on BJP, especially when Congress played a dominant role against it (BJP),” he argued.He also said that the parties named by the NCP for a broader front can clear their stand on their own and why NCP is making statements on their behalf.
02-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC proposal: 24 SUVs for ₹2.83 crore||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to shell out ₹2.83 crore to acquire 24 Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) for each of the 24 assistant municipal commissioners (Ward Officers) in charge of the 24 administrative wards in Mumbai.According to the standing committee agenda of December 3 the civic administration wants to replace the existing vehicles with new ones citing frequent breakdowns and overuse. The proposal states that BMC will buy 24 models of the Mahindra Scorpio (BS-VI) at a price of ₹11.34 lakh each. In the agenda it is also mentioned that the vehicles that are going to be replaced are also Scorpio but the variants are different.The BMC has said that it will procure the new vehicles from the Government E Marketplace (GEM Portal) at a discounted price of 15-20% from present-day market rate, and the overall cost including taxes and transportation would come to ₹2.83 cr.The existing vehicles were brought 8-10 years agoA senior BMC official associated with the Solid Waste Management (SWM) department in charge for the maintenance of vehicles owned by the BMC said that owing to the rules of the Bombay High Court (HC), the BMC needs to replace its existing fleet of vehicles after every eight years.“To keep a check on the carbon emission there is a rule of replacing these vehicles after every eight years. We are following these orders,” the official who did not wish to be quoted, said.The official added that a technical committee will conduct a structural audit of the existing to assess whether they could be used for other departmental purposes.“The SUV vehicles are robust and will not breakdown easily especially during the monsoon season,” the official said. These vehicles are mainly used by the ward officers for their official field visits, inspection visits and day-to-day commute.Earlier this year, the BMC had spent ₹1.6 years for acquiring five electronic vehicles on lease for eight years. “The five e-cars are in operation and one of it is presently being used by the Mayor and some officials of Joint Municipal Commissioner rank,” the official said.The official said that as there not enough charging points in the city, the civic body will acquire the SUVs.“At a time when the civic body is cutting budget for slum development, school repairs and garden maintenance it is planning to buy new cars. The BMC has already spent crores in battling Covid and the proposal should be ascertained before giving it a go-ahead,” Vinod Mishra, group leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who is also a member of the standing committee.The proposal will be tabled for approval in the civic standing committee on Friday. If passed, the vehicles will be delivered to the BMC within 90 days after official order is placed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-proposal-24-suvs-for-2-83-crore-101638462461268.html

The announcement, which came ahead of the civic general polls slated for next year, might benefit the ruling party that had earlier lost seats in Diva owing to the unresolved issue of dumping the waste of the entire Thane in Diva.The corporation has claimed that the scientific processing of waste can start at Bhandarli by January next year.For almost a decade, all the waste generated in Thane, Mumbra and Kalwa was dumped on four dumping spots in Diva. The residents, however, had to bear foul stench and other health issues due to the mounting of garbage in their vicinity. The dumping was also near to the creek, leading to destruction of mangroves.Sharma said, “The plot in Diva is around 10 acres and we will complete setting up a scientific waste treatment plant here in two weeks. We have also completed all the formalities needed to get permission to set up the plant and hope that the approvals will also come in two to three weeks. We have also shown the plot to Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to seek its permission. We plan to start the project by January next year.”The Daighar waste-to-energy project, wherein electricity will be generated out of the waste, will also gain momentum in the next six months. After the Daighar plant is operational, the collection centre at CP Tank in Wagle Estate will be closed, Sharma added.TMC will have to spend a total of ₹2.40Cr on the plot that includes rent and operational cost.Mhaske said, “Thane city, though, is clean. However, we lost points in the Swachh Survey due to unscientific dumping of waste. Diva residents have had to bear the brunt of entire Thane city’s waste since 2008. This decision is a major relief to these residents and we hope that there is no opposition to the said plot.”The unresolved issue of dumping in Diva was used by political parties in most elections to garner votes. However, time and again, the residents merely got assurance rather than relief. Rohidas Munde, Thane city executive member, BJP, said, “The decision came with merely three months left for the elections and looks merely like a poll gimmick. In the last elections the Sena had promised Diva residents that they would close the dumping in Diva in three months when they came into power. It has been five years and people are still suffering. It was in their tenure itself when permission to dump the entire city’s waste on Diva was given, which affected the health of the Diva residents. People are hearing this announcement for the last many elections and will trust only when the dumping actually stops.”

The businessman, Dinesh Patel, owned a wood saw mill in the rural Nandabazar area of Singur. The principal suspect, who was seen leaving the spot by eyewitnesses, is a relative of the family, police said. He was identified as Yogesh Dhawan, a cousin of Dinesh Patel. “Dhawan came from Gujarat about a month ago to work at the mill,” said a police officer. Patel’s body and that of his wife, Anusuya, 46, were found in one of the rooms inside the factory premises where the family used to live. Both bore multiple injuries apparently inflicted by an iron rod. Patel’s father, Bhabji, and son, Bhavik, were found in the adjacent room. They died at the state-run SSKM Hospital in Kolkata shortly after they were rushed to the state capital, police said. “Raids are being conducted to nab the suspect. It appears that some dispute over property led to the crime,” an officer from the Singur rural police station said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/businessman-murdered-in-bengal-along-with-kin-suspect-at-large-101638461981285.html

Fines for talking on the mobile phone while driving has been increased from ₹200 to ₹500.“The increase in fines will discourage people from committing traffic offences and will drive safely, improving the road safety of the driver and the pedestrians as well,” said a senior transport department official.Further, compounding fines in many sections of the MV Act have not been hiked, however, they have been altered. Fine for dangerous (reckless) driving was ₹1,000, while it has now been revised to ₹1,000 for two-wheeler and ₹2,000 for other vehicles. Similarly, the fine for a fancy number plate (different display of numbers than prescribed) was ₹1,000, while the revised penalty is ₹500 for the first time and ₹1500 for subsequent instances.Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakane did not respond to HT’s calls or messages.There were mixed reactions from motorists.

Safety on the city roads will increase.” Faisal Khan, a Bandra resident, said, “Increase in fines for the second time, especially, for those without helmets will only increase instances of bribes.

The trio - Arsheed Yusuf, Inayat Altaf Sheikh and Showkat Ahmed Ganai – was arrested on October 27, 2021 by Agra police.Generally, the bail application is moved before the district court first, and in case of its rejection, the same is challenged before the high court with a request to release the applicant on bail. Significantly, along with bail plea, the students also moved an application seeking transfer of their case from Agra to Mathura on the plea that “the entire bar association of Agra is not ready to appear on behalf of the applicants before the court.”They were booked under Sections 124 A (sedition), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 505 (1)(B) (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 66-F of the Information Technology Act for allegedly sending WhatsApp messages “against the country” after the match.Seeking transfer of the case, an application filed by them took the plea that “if the case of the applicants is not transferred to Mathura district court, the accused/applicants cannot contest their case and also cannot take proper legal assistance, and in the absence of that, they would remain behind bars for an unlimited period.”In their petition, it was claimed that the students were getting life threats if they tried to contact any member of the Agra Bar Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/3-kashmiri-students-held-for-sedition-approach-allahabad-hc-for-bail-101638458980965.html
02-12-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records 91mm rainfall, wettest day in December||Mumbai: The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz observatory recorded 91 mm rainfall in the past 24 hours at 8:30 am Thursday, marking the city’s highest-ever single-day rainfall during December. Mumbai’s previous record stood at 53.8 mm of rain in 24 hours, on December 6, 2017, due to the passage of Cyclone Ockhi, close to the city coast. The mean monthly rainfall for December (i.e. the average from 1981 to 2010) stands at just 1.6mm. The ongoing unseasonal rains are due to a cyclonic circulation over the southeast and the east-central Arabian Sea, along with a persisting trough running through Gujarat’s Kutch region at mean sea level (MSL), which are bringing moisture-laden winds over the city.Rains in December are rare for Mumbai but do occur with much less intensity. On December 11, 2020, the city recorded 0.7mm of rain due to a similar cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea. On December 5, 2019, due to similar meteorological conditions, the city had received 1.2mm of rain. An official with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai informed, “A prolonged spell of rain like we are seeing is extremely unlikely in December. In terms of the synoptic features, we know what is causing it, but we will have to wait much longer to see if there is any change in rainfall trends. It is also unlikely for such rains to happen again this month,” said an official with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.These rains, which will continue with reduced intensity on December 3, resulted in a steep dip in temperature. At both Santacruz and Colaba, the minimum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 18.5 degrees Celsius (down from 23.8 degrees Celsius and 24.5 degrees Celsius respectively the day prior). This is a degree below normal for Santacruz and four degrees below normal for Colaba. Mumbai’s lowest ever December minimum, recorded in 1949, stands at 10.6 degrees Celsius.On Wednesday, the city had recorded its second-coldest December day in over a decade, with the daytime maximum dipping to 24.8 degrees Celsius. This was followed by a pleasant 26.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. Temperatures will remain low for at least another day, with the maximum expected to hover around 26 degrees Celsius and minimum at around 20 degrees Celsius. As per the IMD’s forecast, Mumbai will continue to see ‘light rains’ on December 3, though their intensity will keep decreasing and overcast skies will give way to ‘partly cloudy’ conditions from December 4 to December 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-91mm-rainfall-wettest-day-in-december-101638457720947.html

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Mother fakes 3-month-old kidnap, arrested for killing child||Two days after a Kalachowkie resident claimed that her three-month-old daughter was stolen by an unidentified hawker from her house, the Mumbai Police crime branch on Thursday, arrested the 32-year-old mother for allegedly killing the child. According to police, the accused woman, Sapana Bajrang Magdum, has an eight-year-old daughter and desperately wanted her second child to be a baby boy. The woman added that said she was being mentally harassed by her family members and had acted out of desperation. The woman had, however, reported a concocted story to the local police. On Tuesday, the woman had informed the police that on Tuesday afternoon a hawker aged between 30 and 35 years of age approached her at her residence, to sell a plastic bucket in exchange for old clothes. She had claimed that when she proceeded to her room, the hawker followed her and pressed a chloroform-laced cloth on her mouth, making her unconscious. She added that the hawker then picked up the baby girl, who was sleeping at the time and fled from the house. She had said that after she gained consciousness, she called her husband and thereafter approached Kalachowki police station to report the incident. The police had registered a kidnapping case and formed several teams to search the woman hawker and trace the missing girl child. The crime branch had also started a parallel probe in the incident. “When we enquired with the woman about the incident, we sensed a foul play. A skilful interrogation of the woman revealed that she had dropped the girl child in a water tank, in their house,” said deputy commissioner of police Prakash Jadhav of the crime branch. Jadhav said the woman also informed them that she was being mentally harassed by her family members for failing to deliver a male child, and she committed the act out of desperation. He added that the woman has been handed over to Kalachowkie police for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mother-fakes-3-month-old-kidnap-arrested-for-killing-child-101638456822919.html

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Environmentalists claim mangroves being destroyed at Karanja jetty in Uran||Environmentalists and local fisher folks have claimed that a vast stretch of mangroves is being allegedly destroyed at Karanja jetty in Uran across Mumbai harbour and the land is being reclaimed.In September too, the region was involved in a controversy over the destruction of stretches of mangroves and dumping the bundles of the chopped plants mid-sea.In their latest complaint to the Chief Minister and the High Court-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee, NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan said the sea plants in at least five acres have been uprooted.“The mangrove destruction is absolutely not acceptable because it violates the Environmental Clearance,” said NatConnect Foundation director, BN Kumar.Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Pratishtan, alleged that the destruction has robbed the fishing community off their livelihood as the coast was a breeding ground for a variety of fish and crabs.The activists sent photographic evidence of the destruction to the government.Following the complaint in September, Uran tehsildar ordered an inspection of the site following which an FIR has been registered. On the one hand, the breeding grounds of fish are being destroyed while on the other, the creek water channels are being shut for fishing, said Dilip Koli of the traditional fishing community, Paaramparik Machhimaar Bachao Kruti Samiti. “Our constitutionally-guaranteed right to practice our trade is being denied to us,” he lamented.When contacted, Uran tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare, said, “I had inspected the area last time with concerned officials and also the complainants. A police complaint was lodged and a person has been identified against whom an FIR has been registered.”On the latest allegation he said, “We are not aware of any such development. We will check if there is something to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/environmentalists-claim-mangroves-being-destroyed-at-karanja-jetty-in-uran-101638455320797.html
02-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC forms teams in 24 wards to levy ₹10,000 fine on Covid-19 guidelines violators||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has formed 24 teams, one for each administrative ward, to monitor the violations of the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the state in the backdrop of outbreak of Omicron variant. Establishments that are found to be in violation of these guidelines will be fined ₹10,000, while individuals will be fined ₹500, based on a state government notification issued last week. The order issued on November 27 stated that all shops, establishments, malls, and spaces of gathering “where a member of public has a right to come and get services” can only admit persons who have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The guidelines also mandated Covid appropriate behaviour, including being masked and maintaining social distance.BMC officials said that the civic body will start levying fines on December 6 (Monday) once it has carried out sensitisation and awareness among establishments about the guidelines.Under the National Disaster Management Act, the civic body has the authority to close down the establishment if it is found to be in frequent violation of the guidelines. However, the notification did not confirm how many violations could be considered “frequent”.“We have formed a team of officers from several departments at ward level. We are going and checking private offices, malls, theatres etc. Till now, we have not come across any violation as such in order to levy a ₹10,000 fine,” Sandhya Nandekar, Assistant Municipal Commissioner of the BMC said. Officials from the license, solid waste management and shop and establishment departments of the wards will be part of these teams. Currently, clean up marshals of the BMC are authorised to levy a ₹200 fine for those found to be unmasked in public places. “For now, we have formed teams who will do awareness and sensitisation drive across establishments to ensure there is compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. We will start issuing fines starting next week,” a BMC ward official from south Mumbai said. Since April 2020, over ₹78 crore has been collected from nearly 38 lakh citizens for not wearing a mask in public places in Mumbai. The state government in a notification on Saturday made it mandatory for people to be fully vaccinated to access public places and public transport. It also said it will monitor crowding at weddings and open spaces to prevent super-spreader events. At present, theatres are only allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Up to 100 people or 50% (whichever is lesser) are permitted for weddings taking place in closed spaces while up to 200 persons or 50% (whichever is lesser) are permitted in weddings conducted in open spaces like lawns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-forms-teams-in-24-wards-to-levy-10-000-fine-on-covid-19-guidelines-violators-101638454240712.html

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Farmers, APMC traders worry about damage to fruits due to unseasonal rains||The unseasonal rains in different parts of Maharashtra over the last few days have given a cause for concern to the farmers and traders of APMC about the damage to crops of seasonal fruits.This can also lead to degradation in quality or increase in prices. Even the much-loved Alphonso mangoes, which are in the pre-flowering stage, might be delayed this year. Fruits like grapes, anjeer and strawberry would also bear the brunt of the unseasonal rains with the flowering crops and the crops in the pre-flowering stage completely destroyed.Gulab Neharkar, grapes farmer and supplier for the last 35 years, has not seen any losses like the ones he is facing since the last three years. “The unseasonal rains have been an issue since the last three years. Since last year, Covid has also added to our woes. In the last two days, all the crops that were in the flowering and pre-flowering stages have been completely damaged. The crops have been infected with diseases like downy mildew and powdery mildew due to which we are spraying on the crops all day and night to save them. This has led to the rise in the expenses of the manufacturing of grapes. The cost of labour, and fungicides-pesticides have gone up due to the higher usage. Many farmers are planning to abandon the work of farming and sell off their lands due to the unpredictable climate,” Neharkar from Junnar in Pune, said.Director of fruits market in APMC, Sanjay Pansare, said that similar to the grapes even strawberry, anjeer and mangoes have suffered. “Grapes come mainly from Nashik, Pune, Sangli and Solapur, and wherever there has been rain, the crops have suffered. The fruits that are coming now are of lower quality due to this. The price has not increased but the quality has decreased. The mangoes that would have otherwise started coming in by February 15 will now come only after February. A farmer who would have got 90 days to sell the produce will now get only 60 days in the market,” Pansare said.Currently, one kilogram of grapes cost ₹100- ₹125 and 400g of anjeer and strawberry cost ₹150 in the wholesale market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-apmc-traders-worry-about-damage-to-fruits-due-to-unseasonal-rains-101638452085995.html
02-12-2021||Lucknow||UPTET paper leak: Another printing firm in Delhi under STF scanner||LUCKNOW A few more people, including the owner and employees of another printing firm of New Delhi, were under the scanner of the Special Task Force (STF) in connection with the UP Teachers’ Eligibility Test-2021 (UPTET) question paper leak case, said police on Thursday.Officials said Delhi-based printing firm’s director Rai Anoop Prasad, who managed to procure a work order worth ₹13 crore for printing over 22 lakh question papers, had sub let the work to another printing press. Prasad and secretary of Exam Regulatory Authority (ERA), UP, Sanjay Kumar Upadhyay, had already been arrested in the matter and now the STF was verifying the role of the second printing press, where the question papers were actually printed, they added. A senior STF official said the involvement of people associated with the second printing press was suspected in selling some sets of question papers to different solvers’ groups in return of money.He said the ERA secretary had given the printing job to Prasad’s RSM Finserv Ltd firm in violation of security norms laid for this purpose. As per the norms, the questions papers should be published at least 1000 km away from the examination centres and employees should not be aware about the language in which papers are printed. The official said the work was given to Prasad’s firm barely 40 km from Gautam Buddh Nagar, where many examination centres were set up. Investigation revealed that the ERA secretary and Prasad were familiar with each other since the former’s posting in Gautam Buddh Nagar. It also came to fore that Upadhyay and Prasad met in a hotel just three days before the work order was released on November 26. The investigators had retrieved phone call details of both the accused as incriminating evidence about their links, said the STF official.So far, 38 people had been arrested in connection with the paper leak case while the involvement of at least 10 others surfaced in the matter. The UP STF had arrested 33 people while five others were arrested by the local police unit in Basti district.The state government had cancelled the UPTET-2021 on Sunday (November 28) after the paper leak came to fore following the arrests and recovery of question papers from some of them hours before the exam on Saturday night (November 27). A total of 19,99,418 examinees were supposed to write the UPTET scheduled in two shifts at 2,736 centers across 75 districts of UP on Sunday, but the exam was cancelled after the paper leak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uptet-paper-leak-another-printing-firm-in-delhi-under-stf-scanner-101638451300465.html
02-12-2021||Mumbai||Women claim to feel unsafe while travelling in suburban trains in Navi Mumbai||Twenty eight-year-old Kanika Surve, who works at a beauty salon at Vashi, returns to her home in Kharghar late in the night by local trains. She complains that the women compartment in the train do not have guards most of the time, leading to her feeling insecure.“Very rarely can I see an unarmed guard in the compartment, but I have never come across anyone patrolling on the platforms in the past four years. Also, the outer side of Kharghar station is not well lit. It’s very scary to wait for buses and autos after alighting from the trains at that hour,” she said.According to an estimate made by the Railways, around eight lakh women travel by train in the satellite city daily.A large number of women commuters from Navi Mumbai who travel on harbour and trans-harbour lines during the odd hours say that they do not feel safe inside the trains as well as on the platforms because of insufficient security, anti-social elements outside the stations or lack of safety walls at some stations.Nerul is one of the prominent railway stations in Navi Mumbai that sees over 60,000 footfalls in a day. The station premises have a liquor shop (licensed) on its West side. The commuters allege that some people drink liquor outside that shop and lie down near the platforms. “On several occasions, I have seen drunkards lying near the platforms and outside the station. The police should take stern action against such people,” said Jyothika P, a 31-year-old resident of Ulwe.At Juinagar and Sanpada stations, the commuters often come across commercial sex workers in the evenings. They keep loitering near the premises and lure the commuters with obscene gestures. Shenal Mane, a 25-year-old resident of Sanpada, said, “These sex workers may not be a threat to the safety of the woman commuters, but the men who go to them are.”The absence of compound walls has been yet another issue at several stations including Vashi. The Vashi station has two underpasses. However, people can also illegally enter the platforms from the sides due to the lack of such walls. “The criminals know these loopholes and, thus, can easily run away through those routes after snatching a chain, mobile phone or a bag from the commuters. This station also does not have lights at several places,” said Upasana Sharma, a 35-year-old resident of Vashi.On the trans-harbour line (which connects Navi Mumbai with Thane), the fatka gangs are a cause for serious concern. These criminals normally keep waiting along the railway tracks at isolated spots. Whenever a train crosses those spots, they hit the commuters (who travel standing at the doors) with long sticks or give fatka. The commuters’ wallets or mobile phones then fall off their hands and they collect them easily. Even as the number of such cases has decreased, these gangs are still active in some places. So far this year, the Vashi GRP has busted one fatka gang between Ghansoli and Rabale station.In the first 11 months this year, the Vashi GRP registered a total of 167 FIRs and one of them was of sexual assault on a woman. The Panvel GRP registered 286 FIRs in the corresponding period and two cases were of sexual assaults.Vishnu Kesarkar, senior inspector of Vashi GRP, said, “This week, we have received 175 home guards and have increased patrolling in the trains as well as on the platforms. We are aware of the issue of the drunkards at Nerul station and have registered multiple FIRs against those people so far. Recently, we also arrested a few people who were illegally selling liquor outside Nerul station at night and seized liquor worth ₹25,000 from them. We also inform the city police if we get to know about the existence of anti-social elements outside our jurisdiction.”Some criminals loot the commuters in the long-distance trains that pass through Panvel station and hence the GRP has to take extra efforts to ensure the safety of those commuters. Sambhaji Khatare, senior inspector of Panvel GRP, said, “Every morning, we dispatch one team to Vasai station and another team to Roha station. There, they board the trains coming towards Panvel and check every compartment so that no one can loot the commuters.” Bhakti Dave, president of Panvel Pravasi Sangh, said, “In an empty compartment, a woman commuter normally hesitates to approach a male police official. Several women don’t even board the ladies’ compartments at night because they cannot see any other woman but a male police official there. Therefore, GRP should provide more women police officials in the trains.”CIDCO is responsible for the maintenance of the station premises and their lighting systems. A CIDCO official said, “We keep conducting surveys at the railway stations and whenever we find the need of a compound wall or a new lighting system, we take the requisite measures immediately.”
02-12-2021||Kolkata||Chemicals stored in 3 drums blew up Bengal fireworks factory, killed three: Police||Explosions that killed three people inside a fireworks factory at Mohanpur village in the Nodakhali area of Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district on Wednesday morning was caused by powdered chemicals stored in three drums, forensic experts who visited the spot on Thursday told the police. “The villagers claimed that they heard not one but three explosions in quick succession before the house went up in flames. Investigations suggest that the chemicals were stored in quite large quantity in three drums kept next to each other,” said a district police officer who did not want to be named as the matter is under investigation. The factory was running inside a residential building in a densely populated area. The village is located around 45 km to the south of Kolkata. The owner of the house, Ashim Mondal, died along with a woman, Kakali Mridha, who was Mondal’s relative, and Atithi Haldar, one of Mondal’s employees and the second male victim. A district police officer said that although Mondal died, a case of culpable homicide has been registered. Mondal’s wife and son were not present in the house during the early morning explosion. The police are looking for them. “Laboratory tests can ascertain whether the chemicals were common ones used in making fireworks or something more powerful. The latter seems unlikely so far as the walls of the house are intact. Only a part of the roof in a room blew away, suggesting that the direction of the blast was vertical. Chemicals used by criminals for making bombs would have caused more severe damage around the epicentre of the blast,” said a second police officer. The victims were mutilated and charred, said officers involved in the investigation. Their bodies were hurled at least 15 metres away. A dish antenna installed on the roof was found more than 100 metres away. Glass windows in the neighbouring buildings were shattered but no one suffered any injury. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has mounted pressure on the Trinamool Congress since Nodakhali is part of the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency represented by TMC national general secretary and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. The BJP also pointed out that similar explosions took place at fireworks factories in South 24 Parganas district in the past. Three people died at Mograhat in 2018. Leader of the opposition in the Bengal legislative assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, and BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar have demanded a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Majumdar has also written to Union home minister Amit Shah. The local TMC legislator, Mohan Chandra Naskar, visited the spot. “The administration has initiated an inquiry to find out if the factory was running without licence,” Naskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/chemicals-stored-in-3-drums-blew-up-bengal-fireworks-factory-killed-three-police-101638449920675.html

02-12-2021||Mumbai||Court cancels order notifying Param Bir Singh as proclaimed offender||MUMBAI: A Mumbai judge on Thursday cancelled the proclamation declaring senior Maharashtra police officer Param Bir Singh, 59, a proclaimed offender in connection with an extortion case after the former Mumbai police commissioner, who was missing for months, surfaced last week and appeared before the Mumbai crime branch to join the investigation.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sudhir Bhajipale cancelled the proclamation on Thursday, two days after a non-bailable warrant (NBW) issued to ensure his presence in court was also cancelled.Judge Sudhir Bhajipale issued orders proclaiming Singh and two co-accused, Vinay Ramnarayan Singh, 46, and Riyaz Bhati, 56, as proclaimed offenders on November 17 following an application by the Mumbai crime branch which is investigating the extortion case.Apart from Param Bir Singh, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and civilians Sumeet Singh and Alpesh Patel are also named as accused in the case that was registered on a complaint by hotelier Bimal Agarwal, who alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar, owned by him. After taking over investigations, the crime branch arrested Vaze, Sumeet Singh and Alpesh Patel. Proclamations were issued against the 59-year-old IPS officer and two others as they were untraceable.Param Bir Singh, who emerged from hiding last week in Chandigarh and has since then joined investigations, told the Mumbai court that he was co-operating with investigating agencies.Incidentally, a similar proclamation issued by the judge against Param Bir Singh’s co-accused Vinay Ramnarayan Singh was set aside by the Bombay high court on Wedneday on the ground that the form in which the proclamation was published was not proper. Vinay Singh’s lawyer Aniket Nikam argued that under section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) a person against whom a proclamation has to be issued, should be asked to appear in “not less than 30 days” but the proclamation issued by the magistrate’s court said “within 30 days” which was not as per the stipulations of section 82.The court accepted the argument and held that the form, in which, the proclamation was published was not proper and hence set it aside. Special public prosecutor advocate Shekhar Jagtap for the state sought a stay on the operation of the order but was rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-cancels-order-notifying-param-bir-singh-as-proclaimed-offender-101638446680434.html
02-12-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray signs order suspending ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday signed the order on suspension of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Officials in the state home department said while a former order is expected soon, the action is being taken under All India Service Rules following recommendation by a panel led by senior IAS officer and acting chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty.The 1988-batch IPS officer was removed from the post of Mumbai police chief on March 17 following the bomb scare case at Antilia. He was then made the general commander of Maharashtra state home guard after he levelled corruption allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh.On November 29, a report in Hindustan Times stated that the Maharashtra government has accepted the report of the Debashish Chakraborty committee on the departmental inquiry against Param Bir Singh.

Tirkey was a former Sahebganj Mahila police station officer and was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her official residence in May this year. “The court has directed the SC/ST police to register the FIR under section 156 (3) of the CrPC. The order has been passed on the basis of an audio clip, which had turned viral in connection with the case. Now that the court has ordered for an FIR in the case, we will also file a writ petition demanding that the case be investigated by a senior officer as a city SP rank officer is also facing charges,” lawyer Rajiv Kumar said Tirkey was found hanging at her official residence in Sahebganj on May 3, 2021. The incident led to protests by social organisations even as Tirkey’s father had expressed lack of confidence in the Sahebganj police investigation that had declared it a case of suicide. A colleague of Rupa Tirkey was arrested by the local police for abetment to suicide. He is currently in jail. A petition was also filed in the Jharkhand High Court, which ordered a CBI probe into the case. The CBI has registered a case and investigation is underway. According to the complaint filed on September 23, 2021 with the special court, Tirkey’s mother had approached the ST/SC police station in Ranchi on September 11 for registration of FIR against the DSP and Pankaj Mishra in this connection but was turned away. “The officer in charge received the complaint, but did not act on it and did not file an FIR. The family had also approached City SP Saurav, but he too did not act. We have all the related records. Subsequently, Padmavati had lodged a court complaint against the four people,” said Rajiv Kumar. Radhika Raman Minz said on Thursday they were yet to receive a copy of the court order. “Once we get the order copy, we will see what we have to do. We have several legal options to move forward. We will take adequate action in consultation with our senior officials,” Minz said on Thursday. On why he did not act on the complaint he received on September 11, Minz said he was waiting for directions from his superiors in the case. “The complaint was against a senior police officer. So I could not have acted immediately without proper investigation and direction from seniors. Now that we hear from journalists that the court has directed us to file an FIR which also involves me and senior officers, we will act in consultation with my superiors,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/rupa-tirkey-case-special-court-orders-fir-against-3-cops-jmm-leader-101638444802807.html
02-12-2021||Pune||Taste of life: The sweet-sour story of Poona’s Seville orange marmalade||“In India, they have the naranj and the various fruits of the orange species. The orange grows in Bajour and Sewad, where it is both plenty and good…It is sweet-smelling, delicate, and fresh, and used for making marmalade. It is not, however, to be compared with the oranges of Khorassan…Another fruit resembling the naranj is the taranj. The inhabitants of Bajour call it baling. On this account marmalades of the peel of this fruit are called murabba-baling. The Hindostanis call the taranj the bajouri. It is of two species. One is insipid and sweet, but its peel is used for marmalade…” wrote Emperor Babur, who never liked the fruits in India, in his memoir. “Naranj” was most likely a variety of orange resembling the famous Seville orange. English and Scotch marmalades were usually made from “bitter” varieties of oranges from Spain, grown principally in the vicinity of Seville. The “sour”, “bitter”, “bigarade”, or “Seville” orange, in spite of its many names, was considered of minor importance in Europe. It was used for making tincture of orange peel, which was mixed with nauseous medicines, to disguise their revolting taste. From its skin, the orange candied peel was made. It was also used for flavouring the Curacoa liqueur. It was exported to Great Britain and other European countries for the manufacture of marmalade. The fruit was found to be high in both acid and pectin and no difficulty was experienced in obtaining a firm jelly-like marmalade from it. Marmalade then was considered the “king of British breakfast”. When the British settled in India, among the foods they missed from their land was marmalade. They believed that the varieties of orange native to India did not make a good marmalade. Some native varieties like “laroo”, grown in Poona, were so disliked by the Europeans that the local markets in Poona Cantonment stopped stocking them. Hence although India had many fine varieties of citrus, and many different climates and soils to grow them in, Bombay imported oranges and lemons from Europe, Africa, and Arabia. From the early 19th century, the British initiated agrarian reforms in India which would enable them to collect more land revenues and feed their troops, officials, and their families. The reforms included the introduction of certain varieties of fruits and vegetables liked by the British. In Gujranwala, Colonel Clarke introduced the Malta blood orange between 1852-56. The same was brought to Lucknow, Lahore, and Poona a few years later. Poona by then had a variety called “mosambi”, which evidently meant Mozambique, and might have originally come from that coast of Africa. The “penidodan” of Ceylon; The “bandir” or “chine”, and “Spanish” oranges of Thanjavur; the “mosambi” of Poona; the Malta and “paenbagh” oranges of Lucknow; The Suez, and blood-oranges of Jaunpore – all were of the Malta or Portugal sweet orange type. The so-called sweet oranges were distinctly divisible into two types, one, the Malta or Portugal orange – the Citrus aurantium sinense of Gallesio, and its varieties; and the other, the “santara orange of India”, the Citrus aurantium sinense of Rumphius and its derivatives. Another source of confusion came from calling the Seville orange “bitter”. It was simply sour. It was the rind that was bitter-sour and aromatic. Since many varieties of the Malta orange in the English, and hence Poona, markets had their skin so adherent to the pulp that it was next to impossible to remove it without cutting it with a knife, the preferred choice for making marmalade was the Seville orange, which was already grown in India. But the British did not trust the variety (or the ones closely resembling it) mentioned by Babur and hence reintroduced it to India. Two hundred saplings were brought to Poona in the early 1880s. The Seville orange began to be grown in most parts of India and Ceylon by the end of the 19th century. The British could now make the marmalade they liked. But there was little demand for it initially. The British still did not believe that Seville oranges grown in Poona, and elsewhere, made fine marmalade. Hence many tons of tinned marmalade continued to be imported annually from England. Treacher and Co. in Bombay and Poona sold Keiller’s Dundee marmalade. The brand was “pronounced to be the finest of all the preserves made from bitter oranges”. 1 lb. tin cost 6 annas. In 1915, a marmalade-making factory was established in the Poona Cantonment area to limit the import of marmalade. This factory was shut down in a couple of years due to reasons unknown. It was the First World War that made British women in India start using Seville oranges grown locally. Poona was touted as the biggest supplier of this variety. The “orangemaking” season then began in April. “Housewives” were told that the “best oranges went the farthest”. They were asked to use loaf sugar to make marmalade. “The Bombay Chronicle” printed the same recipe for marmalade every year – “To every dozen oranges allow two sweet ones. First, wash and dry the fruit, then cut into quarters, remove the pips, and cut into fine strips. Put into a deep pan, with two pints of water to each pound of fruit. Cover and let it remain for 24 hours. Put the pips in a basin, cover with boiling water, and leave until the next day; then strain, and add the liquid to the shredded oranges. Now weigh both water and fruit, and to every pound add 5/4 lb. of loaf sugar. Put all in the preserving pan with the juice of three lemons, and boil for one hour. Put into jars and tie down. This is a very inexpensive recipe and one which is generally liked by children on account of its having less peel and more jelly than most recipes. A perfect marmalade should be sparkling, transparent, and attractive in colour, and should have a strong flavour of the original fruit. It should not be sticky or syrupy and when cut with a knife it should have a sharp edge and a clear cut surface.” Another recipe for marmalade called for combining apple juice rich in pectin and acid with thinly sliced firm peaches or figs or with other firm fruits. The juice and sliced fruit could be mixed with sugar and concentrated to the jellying point. Electroplated jars for marmalade were marketed by Treacher & Co. These jars were “handsomely chased or engraved, or in glass-mounted in electro-plate”. They were imported from Belgium and Denmark, and the price ranged from ₹12 to 35. In the early 1930s, Ceylon Agricultural Board started endorsing the various advantages of grapefruit. They were first made available in the markets of Bombay and Poona. The fruit soon became popular as a breakfast delicacy. Some Europeans in Poona started using it for making fresh-fruit drinks and also for marmalade. During the Second World War, the import of marmalade stopped temporarily. Marmalade too lost its prominence. With that, Seville oranges, primarily grown in Poona, faded into oblivion.

We have forwarded the list to our health posts who will further take the necessary steps,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.The health posts’ staff will be tracing, tracking and testing these 76 returnees and checking their history of Covid tests and vaccination.“Once traced, we will conduct RT-PCR tests of those travellers who have symptoms or have not completed 14 days after returning. Their close contacts will be tested too,” said Panpatil. Meanwhile, all the RT-PCR and antigen tests conducted at the residential building of the 32-year-old Dombivli-based South Africa returnee who tested positive to Covid, are negative, claimed Panpatil.“We conducted 23 RT-PCR and 14 antigen tests at his building and all are negative. His nine family members and relatives are also negative,” added Panpatil.The genome sequencing results of the 32-year-old returnee are still awaited. The 50-year-old man from Dombivli who was in the same flight as the 32-year-old engineer who tested positive for Covid, tested negative to Covid, confirmed the KDMC on Thursday. “All four including his three family members have tested negative to Covid,” said Panpatil.The KDMC, on Thursday, urged to those who have returned to Kalyan Dombivli from high risk countries in last 10 days to inform the civic body about their return.“Considering the threat of Omicron variant of Coronavirus, we have asked such returnees to get in touch with the civic body. As per the government guidelines, it is very necessary to do RT-PCR of such returnees and even if they test negative, they will be in home isolation for seven days. A repeat test shall be conducted on the eighth day and again if the report is negative, that individual is supposed to keep a watch on health condition for the next seven days,” said an official of health department KDMC.Meanwhile, if the returnee tests positive, then that person will be sent to institutional quarantine by KDMC and the sample of the patient will be sent for genome sequencing.The civic body has urged the returnees to get the RT-PCR done at civic testing centres. It also urged the housing societies to keep a watch on such returnees and inform the civic body without fail.

02-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC proposes institutional quarantine for flyers from 6 ‘ultra risk’ countries, not all||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed mandatory institutional quarantine of seven days for passengers arriving in Mumbai from, or with travel history to either of the six ‘ultra risk’ countries — South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Eswatini.In a letter to the Mahrashtra government on Thursday, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal proposed that the city follow the protocols prescribed by the Government of India for passengers from other ‘at risk’ countries. This requires passengers to be tested for Covid-19 on arrival and those found negative, required to be in home quarantine for a week.Several countries have already barred passengers from the six countries, proposed to be classified by BMC as ‘ultra risk’, over concerns about the new Omicron variant of Covid-19. There has been no word from the state government on its decision on the BMC proposal, and no order has been issued yet that classifies the six countries as ‘ultra risk’.Also Read: How dangerous is the Covid-19 Omicron variant?The Maharashtra government’s existing order mandates institutional quarantine of seven days for passengers from all ‘at risk’ countries — Europe including UK, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel. This provision will be effective from 11.59pm tonight. The Union health ministry has asked the state to amend this provision and bring it in line with central guidelines.In his letter, Iqbal Singh Chahal suggested that airlines should de-board passengers from ‘ultra risk’ countries on priority, and the airport should have separate counters for verification and checking for them.BMC’s proposal also requires mandatory institutional quarantine for seven days for passengers with travel history to the six countries within the last 15 days. Any passengers who show symptoms should also be sent to mandatory institutional quarantine for seven days.Also Read: Omicron renews the need to focus on India-Africa tiesThe letter further proposes that RT-PCR tests should be conducted on the day of arrival, and again after completing seven days of institutional quarantine. If tested negative, they have to go through compulsory home quarantine for seven more days. If tested positive, they will be sent to Seven Hills hospital or a dedicated private hospital.The central government in its order dated November 30, said international passengers from ‘at-risk’ countries have to get tested at the airport on arrival, and cannot leave the premises or take a connecting flight until their test results arrive. If tested negative, these passengers have to be home quarantined for a period of seven days. They then have to retest on the 8th day of arrival in India, and if tested negative, have to self-monitor their health for seven days. If found positive in the test on the first or 8th day, these passengers will be taken to an isolation facility.The BMC letter also proposed that domestic passengers arriving from another state to Mumbai have to be double vaccinated, or should carry a negative RTPCR report conducted within 72 hours of travel. An order issued on November 30 said a negative RT-PCR test 48 hours prior to entering Maharashtra was mandatory for domestic travellers. But health minister Rajesh Tope told HT on Wednesday that this requirement was being deferred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-proposes-institutional-quarantine-for-flyers-from-6-ultra-risk-countries-not-all-101638441742727.html
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Of courtesy, currency, and cultural churnings||The most hilarious part of dining out with friends and family is the enthusiasm of the celebrants to foot the bill. Many a hand stretches out to quickly seize the piece of paper. The baffled bearer is forever a bemused spectator to this ‘comedy of bill grabbers’. At times it amounts to a virtual duel between guests before one crowns himself as the host and the others exhibit a shattering disappointment. Closely in tow is the genteel ‘pehle aap, pehle aap’ (PAPA) courtesy that food rituals entail. It starts right at the crockery/cutlery corner in case of buffet layouts. At sit down meals, platters and dishes are endlessly passed around the table with all hesitant to make the first dig into the delicacies. A single puffed up chappati could ride the merry-go-round of politeness forever and ever, delaying the breaking of bread at home get-togethers. One can always extend this exuberance to the ‘shagun scheme’ in our culture. Be it a newborn, a newlywed or a first-time visitor, the shagun envelope mysteriously pops up at the departure gates. And then the ‘no-no’, ‘not-again’, ‘next-time maybe’ refusals start, which all concerned know, are meant to fall on deaf ears. Though far from what French philosopher Georges Bataille, refers to as ‘unconditional giving’ to community, akin to the bounty of the sun, celebrations not too long back were a joint venture. ‘Neonda’ (donations to marriage festivities) were the mainstay of weddings. It has now metamorphosed into the inverse; the fancy shagun envelope, or ‘the cheque’ as a friend calls it, has a lot to do with the social standing of the host. The courtesy is mostly loaded with expectation and an understated ‘return it’ policy. It rests on the tenuous terrain of ego. The longer the delay in reciprocity, the more the resentment brews. Perhaps, the most generous of kings may have struggled to make gifting a one-way traffic. Happily, the millennials have reinvented the culture of courtesy with a fair amount of common sense. Digital apps, such as ‘Splitwise’, help youngsters staying, travelling or organising events together to split expenses without too much fuss. By keeping a track of, who owes who, how much, it helps in settling expenses squarely, saving time, effort and emotion. At times, one spots a waiter collecting a bunch of cards from youngsters dining on adjacent tables for equal splitting of the bill. More often you catch them just scanning with their mobile phones to electronically pay their ‘American share’. The youth have no time for ado. Hence, the ‘going Dutch’ dining etiquette now popular as TTMM (tu tera mein mera) has sorted and simplified payment issues. In times of flux, the PAPA versus TTMM debate is a bit complex to be easily decided. As of now, we are in a hybrid mode, enjoying the best of both worlds. For some reason, the hilarious Stephan Leacock’s story, The Lost Dollar, is circling in my head. The honest narrator is visibly disturbed when his friend, Todd, forgets all about the dollar he borrowed from him to pay for a taxi ride. A single dollar is enough to cause comic misery in the relationship. The universal appeal of the story says a lot about men and money matters! manindersidhu7@gmail.com The writer is professor of English, Government College for Girls, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/of-courtesy-currency-and-cultural-churnings-101638440902602.html

Channi said as many as 50 pro-people decisions were taken by the ruling Congress government since he took over as the chief minister and all of them were implemented.Channi became the chief minister of the poll-bound north Indian state following a bitter exit of Amarinder Singh due to a power tussle with state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sindhu“People say it's a Channi government, I say it's a changi (good) government,” the chief minister added.He said 68 lakh of 72 lakh consumers in Punjab were given electricity at a reduced price of ₹3 per unit from November 1 for up to 7 kilowatt load.Speaking about cheaper power from non-renewable sources, he said prices have been brought down to ₹2.34 per unit from Rs. 17.91 per unit during the previous government, led by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).Hitting out at Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal, Channi said comparisons cannot be drawn between him and the Delhi chief minister as the latter is an outsider.“How can he compare himself with me? I am a true Punjabi, he's an outsider. He can't compete with me in understanding Punjab, its requirements, culture and ethos,” Channi said.He further said the Punjab government will pay the bills for free power supply for rural water works. In cities too, water supply bills will be borne by the government.

02-12-2021||Delhi||National Pollution Control Day: Delhiites’ plea for public transport, plantation drives||Sore throat, watery eyes and breathing difficulties have become common to those living in the National Capital, especially in the months of November and December. With each passing year, the situation is reportedly getting worse. There were 11 severe days in Delhi this year, and still the AQI level is constantly rising to possibly break all previous records. Recently, the AQI level crossed 400 this year, which is alarmingly high.“Although there are smog towers in place, but it’s not really having much of an impact,” says Rohit Singh, a food blogger who lives in Connaught Place, adding, “The smog tower we have close by, yet the pollution in CP is a lot There is a lot of rush, so the smog tower isn’t able to make much difference. Due to Covid, we have to compulsorily wear masks now, and it has helped me a lot this year. Otherwise usually I don’t stay put in Delhi during this time of the year, that is after Diwali, as the air pollution is dangerously high. Even otherwise whenever I’m in Delhi, I usually get sore throat and watery eyes.” Problems are mostly known. And it’s in quest of solution that some citizens have taken it upon themselves to pitch in as much as they can, to resolve this perennial concern. Ruchika Sethi, an environmentalist who runs a collective Citizens for Clean Air, says, “We call our volunteers pollution cops and solution heroes. We note and report waste burning. We spread awareness through the collective that we have which has resident volunteers of 60 plus RWAs as well as medical practitioners, social sector and environment experts, early adopters of eco sustainable lifestyles, members from the scientist community also. Members take initiatives to showcase if solutions are implementable. We have a campaign called 3B Ka Funda and Use Resuables which showcases what an individual can do to minimise all kinds of disposable waste. We have written to a popular coffee shop chain after which they introduced bringing in your own mug to get a discount. We have green protocols in place as well.”Many such efforts are in place, yet the AQI level has increased to the extent that according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the AQI level this year has broken the record of 10 dangerous air days in November 2016! The AQI was recorded at 999 in 2016. Sachin Panwar, air quality monitoring scientist, says, “Indian AQI has now been capped at 500. This 999 was maximum pm 2.5 reported because of limitation of sensors.” The government authorities have resumed stressing on the need for people to walk down rather than driving private vehicles, but the unpleasant pollution levels don’t always allow this. Manishika Pawaia, a final year student of Delhi University’s Jesus and Mary College, who is also the head of Green Society, stresses all hands need to be at the deck, to ensure that the situation becomes better. “To reverse or at the very least stop the progress of deterioration, we, at Green Society, JMC, believe that action is the need of hour. We encourage our members to walk or use public transportations and have conducted multiple plantation drives,” she says.Dr Neeraj Chawla, a city-based ENT specialist, says that there are ways to safeguard yourself against pollution when outdoors. “Wearing surgical masks during walking in place of double layered cloth masks or N95 is a safe way to protect oneself from the pollutants in the air, and also manage the breathing in a safe way.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Twitter and Facebook||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/national-pollution-control-day-denizens-plea-for-public-transport-plantation-drives-101638428722759.html

The draft has been posted on the department website for feedback.All India Progressive Women’s Association national general secretary Mina Tiwari said measures for women empowerment should be planned as per the situation in the state. She said the draft proposes the written consent for night shifts but added what if employers do not follow this.“...no woman will be able to refuse the orders of the boss for fear of losing her job.” Tiwari said this proposal may be used to exploit women. “It should be dropped...” Tiwari said night shifts might also affect the family lives of women. “Many of them may have to face resentment in the families due to night shifts. More and more women are now working and families are coping with the new lifestyle. But night shifts might not be acceptable.”Tiwari said women have been doing night shifts in some essential services but it is not acceptable in many other sectors.Sumita Shahi, an entrepreneur, said working women are expected to handle all the household chores also. “Is it possible for a woman to work night shifts and sleep during day time? Who will take care of children and other family members? These are some major points which need to be considered before making any law.”Labour resources minister Jibesh Kumar was unavailable for comments.

Patna had the second-worst air quality on Thursday morning with an AQI of 294 at 7am and Chennai the best among 10 cities (AQI of 71 at 7am). The Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said that Delhi’s AQI was in the “very poor” category on Thursday.“The AQI today indicates ‘very poor’ air quality. Today (Thursday) and tomorrow (Friday) winds are likely to be calm reducing ventilation leading to a deterioration of air quality but within the same category. From December 3 (Friday) onwards winds are expected to increase dispersing pollutants but AQI is likely to remain in the very poor category. Low mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants.”The maximum temperature in the city was likely to be 22 degrees Celsius, one degree less than Wednesday. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 11.5 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, and the maximum 23, two degrees below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-worsens-yet-again-enters-severe-zone-101638418881101.html
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Cow, its calf die after being turned away amid hospital strike at GADVASU||For Gurdev Singh, a dairy farmer from Shah Abu Bokkar village, Zira, seeking medical assistance at the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) proved costly as both his cow and calf died after being allegedly denied treatment.Gurdev Singh said they decided to take the HF Cow to the premier veterinary university following complications during labour.“But to our utter shock, when we reached the veterinary hospital, we were told that the emergency services were closed and no help would be offered. I urged the staff but to no avail. Finally, someone standing there told me to rush the animal to the veterinary clinic of the animal husbandry department,” said Gurdev Singh.Singh revealed that by the time they reached the said clinic, the calf had already died. “The staff at the clinic, led by Dr Kirandeep Kaur, tried their best to save the cattle, but failed,” he added.He lamented the loss of a beloved companion and a major source of income, saying, “I had spent over ₹5,000 on ferrying the cow to the hospital. Nowadays, buying a healthy cow or a buffalo is not easy. It costs between ₹1 lakh to ₹3 lakh.” Ashwani Kumar, president of the GADVASU Teachers Association later revealed that they had to close the OPD and emergency services for one day to join an ongoing protest.“We are pained at the inconvenience and hardship being faced by people. We share a special bond with the dairy farmers from across the state, we do not want to lose that trust. But our demands are genuine and the state government is deliberately creating issues with our salary scales,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-cow-its-calf-die-after-being-turned-away-amid-hospital-strike-at-gadvasu-101638395177641.html
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Close shave for labourer as fire breaks out in cardboard factory||A major fire broke out at a cardboard factory on Daba Road, opposite Arora Palace, on Tuesday night. It took firefighters around six hours to douse the flames. It was a close shave for a worker, who was on the ground floor of the unit, as the fire broke out on the first floor of the building, and he was able to exit the building in time. Four fire tenders were dispatched for the firefighting operation. Factory owner Sushil Goyal, who was at his house at the time of the incident, said it is suspected that the fire broke out around half-an-hour before neighbours sounded the alert at around 8.45pm. “The worker who was downstairs was unaware of the blaze that had started on the first floor of the building. Neighbours spotted the flames, and called the fire brigade.”Goyal, who suspects a loss of ₹10-12 lakh, says, “It was fortunate that no casualties were reported.” Panic gripped neighbouring units after the blaze broke out, as the factory stands on a congested street, and a large number of people gathered at the spot. The reason for the fire is yet to be determined.Leading fireman, Vijay, said, “Our fire tenders had to be refilled over 25 times to douse the flames. The operation continued till around 3am on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-close-shave-for-labourer-as-fire-breaks-out-in-cardboard-factory-101638394817925.html

Sukhwinder Singh said that one-fourth of the land where the ‘GLADA Estate’ is to come up belongs to him, and another one-fourth is owned by his paternal uncle. “The land belonged to my maternal uncle and was transferred to me through his will. However, a few people who enjoy the patronage of politicians are trying to grab the land. They have entered into an agreement with GLADA, while the authorities are not paying heed to the matter.”“ We had also filed a petition in the local court (Case 9295/2019) around two years ago, and the matter is sub-judice. However, the authorities have still established roads and water tanks in the area. Since we failed to get a stay order from the local court, we moved the high court, and now a status quo has been ordered,” said Sukhwinder Singh.In its order dated November 22, the court has issued a notice of motion to GLADA officials for January 31, when the court will weigh in on the matter.It is learnt that a large number of plots have already been auctioned and allotted by the authorities. GLADA chief administrator Rishipal Singh said he had not seen the court orders yet, and could not comment on the issue without going through the files.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/glada-estate-project-hits-roadblock-hc-orders-status-quo-on-nature-of-property-in-daad-village-101638394577580.html

02-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Traveller’s stop, without the travellers||“As well as Indian staples, you’ll find everything, from banana pancakes to pizzas, Mexican wraps and Israeli falafel… all of which can taste remarkably similar to the Indian staples. Come here for low prices and the travellers’ hubbub rather than gourmet dining” - this is the Lonely Planet India (2013 edition) introduction to Paharganj. Delhi’s hotel district used to teem with foreign travellers, with almost each of them armed with a copy of Lonely Planet (LP). Indeed, the corner bookshelf in any self-respecting Paharganj café stocked at least a couple of these much thumbed LPs.And then the coronavirus arrived early last year. As the new variant Omicron spreads worldwide, Paharganj’s backpackers are no more than a dream remembered. But one place here embodies the spirit of that bygone time of international wanderlust. Jackson Books is still stocked with hundreds of used (and new) LPs.A tiny makeshift alcove by the roadside, the store has an extensive collection of novels in several European languages. But it is the LPs that stand out with their distinctive blue spines. Stacked across the shop’s many shelves, the paperback guidebooks are in many languages, and on many countries - more than 200 destinations, says bookseller Deepak Kumar Dilani. Flipping through the used editions is like travelling with their previous owners. Tips are highlighted, recommendations are underlined. A page in the richly annotated Lonely Planet Guatemala is scrawled with blue hearts.In the BC (before Covid) era, the bookstore sold three to four LPs daily to foreign travellers, but only three managed to move out since the pandemic began. The third left the shelves just this afternoon - it was LP India. “The buyer was an Indian… she said she was interested in travelling.”Founded in 1996, the shop itself has become a lonely planet. Many of Paharganj’s other used bookstores shut down long before the pandemic, but a determined Jackson is staying on despite the odds. “Foreigners were my prime customers,” notes Mr Dilani. The accents of those foreigners - he points out amusedly - played a vital role in corrupting the bookstore’s original name, from Jai Kishen (owner’s late father) to Jackson.While posing for a portrait with his vast collection of travel books, Mr Dilani is puzzled that Lonely Planet India has never listed his bookstore on its Paharganj page.He now takes out from the attic upstairs a fat copy of the equally prestigious Rough Guide to India, and turns to page 117 (he remembers the page number by heart). It says, “Jackson: Paharganj’s best address for secondhand books.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-traveller-s-stop-without-the-travellers-101638393001934.html

This casual and insincere attitude of the ministry is totally unwarranted and uncalled for. The committee, therefore, desires that the ministry furnish a consolidated reply to recommendations or observations,” on the issue of unpaved roads and generating funds from civil aviation and railways, the report said.Also Read | Capital turns dust bowl as AQI worsensThe committee also flagged the allegedly weak enforcement of a statutory ban on stubble burning by state governments (Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh) “coupled with laxity towards the sensitivity and gravity of the matter has also adversely affected the ongoing efforts to tackle the issue of air pollution in Delhi and NCR.”The Committee also recommended a scientific study to assess the environmental impact of crop burning on Delhi and NCR and the methodology to mitigate it in a time-bound manner, the report said. In response to this, MoEFCC has submitted that a study has been awarded to National Environmental Engineering Research Institute to monitor the impact of farm fires||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/paving-roads-must-to-cut-air-pollution-in-ncr-parl-panel-101638391744571.html

02-12-2021||Delhi||Local pollution sources at fault as stubble fire season wraps up||With farm fires falling to negligible levels in Haryana and Punjab, Delhi’s hazardous pollution levels were largely due to local emissions, showed data collated by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) decision support system.According to their recordings, since November 30, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution came down to zero, a level it is likely to stay at for the next five days, establishing the end of the stubble fire season this year.Also Read | Delhi: Pilot project to identify local pollution sourcesOn Thursday, vehicular emissions contributed to nearly 20% of the city’s PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), while industrial emissions from Delhi and peripheral areas contributed to over 11% of the Capital’s pollution levels, the data showed. “Farm fire season is over. Its contribution to Delhi’s air has been nearly zero for the past few days. The predominant contributors to Delhi’s pollution currently are its own local sources and some emissions from the National Capital Region,” said a senior IITM scientist, requesting anonymity.Environmental experts also stressed on the need to control local pollution sources.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said, “We are observing high PM2.5 levels during the morning and evening hours, when winds are typically calmer. While the government is taking measures to reduce emissions from trucks and construction sites, authorities should explore restrictions on private vehicles. Private offices should consider working from home.”She added, “Data from previous years suggests that the months of December and January experience poor to very poor air quality conditions. Therefore, it is critical to take all possible measures to reduce emissions and the exposure of vulnerable populations like children and elderly during these months.”

Since last one year when farmers’ started the agitation against Centre’s three farm laws, Chautala had failed to hold a single programme in his constituency, Uchana Kalan.Earlier in the day, Chautala had visited Rohtak and Jind where he had directed the party workers to ensure maximum presence in ‘Jan Sarokar Diwas’ rally to be held in Jhajjar on December 9.Farmers laid siege outside the village in the morning, prepared food at the protest site and didn’t leave the venue till late night.However, police officials and district administration authorities made futile attempts to pacify the farmers. The farmers said they voted for Dushyant but he deceived them which led to strong resentment among the farming community.BKU Jind district president Azad Palwan said they have sealed Daroli Khera village at all entry points to stop entry of Chautala.“We are seeking cancellation of FIRs registered on around 50,000 farmers in different police station across Haryana, a legal guarantee on MSP, and compensation to family members of those died during ongoing protest,” said Palwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-protest-after-getting-information-of-dushyant-s-visit-to-jind-village-101638390737364.html

Lambasting the Badals for allegedly looting Punjab by spearheading different mafias, he said that he was not afraid of anyone, especially when it came to taking on those who played with the state’s future by eating up its resources through tax evasions. “The Badals first murdered the soul of Punjab’s agriculture and then shamelessly started claiming to be their saviour,” he said. Reposing faith in what he termed as “pathbreaking policy initiatives” of the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government, Warring said that people of Punjab had seen what could be achieved with true political intent and they have made their minds to re-elect the Congress in 2022 with a thumping majority. Slamming Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Warring said the Aam Aadmi Party leader’s “shocking double standards” on the farmers’ issues have exposed him. “Punjabis will never forgive Kejriwal for backstabbing our farmers by passing one of these three black laws in the Delhi assembly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-a-liability-for-punjab-people-will-teach-him-bjp-a-lesson-minister-warring-101638390677345.html

This gave an impression of haze and it looked like the pollution levels have spiked exponentially. While there was an increase in pollution levels because of low wind speeds, the AQI remained in the very poor zone,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research centre.IMD forecasters explained that the overcast skies in Delhi and neighbouring areas was the impact of a western disturbance, which is likely to cause light, isolated showers in parts of the Capital on Thursday.The western disturbance will also lead to an increase in wind speeds from Thursday, which could improve the pollution in the city marginally.“The winds will be easterly, blowing at a speed of 4-10kmph on Thursday and Friday. This will lead to a marginal improvement in the air quality but the AQI will continue to remain in the very poor range,” Soni said.Delhi also saw temperatures climb marginally on the back of a western disturbance.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, was 23 degrees Celsius—two below normal, and the minimum temperature was 11.5 degrees Celsius, two above normal.This came even as the central weather office predicted that temperatures in the city are likely to fall from Thursday, even as it sees a largely normal winter, with few deviations in temperature.Wednesday’s dip came a day after the end of the worst November on record in terms of average AQI, with the number hitting 376, worse than 2016, when this touched 374.The national capital also recorded the maximum of 11 days in November when the index rose above 400, which is considered severe by the pollution watchdog, as it affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with prior illnesses. All days except two saw AQI values exceeding 300, which means residents had no respite from the toxic blanket that smothered the capital all November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-turns-dust-bowl-as-aqi-worsens-101638390327374.html

While disposing of the matter, the court of judicial magistrate Joshica Sood also directed the Kapurthala central jail superintendent to make necessary arrangements. Rajput was arrested in October for allegedly cheating the complainant of a huge amount of money on the pretext of getting him a student visa. In its application, the ED had mentioned that the proceeds of the crime appeared to have been used by the accused for acquisition of various movable and immovable assets, an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jalandhar-court-allows-ed-to-record-statement-of-jailed-immigration-fraud-accused-101638390316951.html

He said Gita Mahotsav is now being celebrated internationally and the most recent one included scholars from 27-28 nations.

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||J&K people unable to understand what they gained from scrapping of Article 370: Omar||Vice-president of the National Conference and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday fired fresh salvos at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said, “It came through the back door, formed a coalition government, pulled it down and then ruined the state before dissecting it into two parts.” Omar was addressing a public rally in Bhaderwah of Doda district. “We could not win the assembly elections in 2014. The biggest reason for our defeat was we weakened each other and the BJP took advantage of our weakness,” he said. Omar said the people till date were unable to understand what they gained from the revocation of Article 370. In 2014 assembly elections, the PDP had won 28 seats, the BJP 25, the NC 15 and the Congress 12. On February 27, 2015, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sealed the alliance between the PDP and the BJP to form a coalition government However, on June 19, 2018, the three-year old coalition government collapsed after the BJP pulled out of the alliance. Omar also expressed concern over worsening security scenario in the UT post-abrogation of Article 370. “Thank God you don’t have Kashmir-like situation here. Today, militancy is back in areas which were freed from it before 2014. No one feels secure now,” he said at the rally. “No one can say that they are coming from Pakistan or elsewhere. They are not coming from Pakistan. Unfortunately, several among them are Kashmiri youths, who have picked up guns over various reasons,” he added. Omar also regretted the ‘poor’ electricity scenario in Doda region and mocked at the central ministers’ recent visit to promote tourism. “The central minister, who had come here, must have brought generator and electricity with him. Tourists need electricity and warm rooms,” he said.
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Bring bill to safeguard jobs, lands of J&K people: Azad to Centre||Senior Congress leader and former Rajya Sabha member Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday asked the central government for inclusion of exclusive rights to jobs and land for the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the bill on statehood that it intends to bring in the Parliament. Addressing a public rally in Poonch, Azad said, “The government has agreed to hold elections and restore of statehood as well. So, it means they have promised these two, but I have added a little more to these promises. Till the time the Supreme Court decides on Article 370, we want the government to guarantee exclusive right to jobs and land to the locals in the statehood bill, which it intends to bring in the parliament.”Azad said it takes years in courts to decide cases and in such a scenario, it would be too late for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “By the time Supreme Court adjudicates on Article 370, we may lose all our jobs and lands to the outsiders. Therefore, we cannot wait. If you (BJP government) are bringing a bill on statehood, then incorporate these two key issues in it,” he added. “We don’t have to do anything with Article 35-A, but include these two key issues to the statehood bill,” he said. Azad again criticised the BJP for ‘arbitrarily’ revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and downgrading the historic state into two union territories. “Only J&K constituent assembly had the right to decide on it,” he said. “We have been saying all along that the method was wrong. J&K’s constituent assembly had the right to take a call on it. To remove it, add something to it or dilute it, the prerogative vested with the J&K assembly,” he added. The former MP also took a swipe at vice-president of the National Conference, Omar Abdullah, who had claimed that Azad and the Congress have given up on the restoration of Article 370. “I have said it repeatedly in the Parliament, but the matter is subjudice before the apex court. And therefore, if anyone says that we have not talked about Article 370, he is wrong. In the Parliament, I was the only one who talked about it in the past three years. No one else raised the issue,” he said. “But I think when the matter is in the Supreme Court, talking about it to appease the people would be unfair,” he added. Omar on Monday had slammed Azad for giving up the fight for restoration of Article 370. While Omar and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti these days are vociferously raking up the revocation of Article 370 to strike an emotional chord with the people in their rallies, Azad has also started addressing gatherings frequently in Jammu and Kashmir. The political parties anticipate assembly polls in June next year following the completion of delimitation exercise in March.

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||No decision taken on removal of Patiala mayor yet: Punjab govt to high court||The Punjab government on Wednesday told the Punjab and Haryana high court that it has not yet taken a decision on the removal of Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu. The government submitted in the court that the municipal corporation’s proposal is pending with it. Defence lawyer Arjun Atma Ram said the government also told the court that Bittu was still discharging his duties as mayor.The high court deferred the hearing on Bittu’s petition for Monday. The petition demands that the record pertaining to the proceedings of no-confidence motion against him be summoned and the MC’s communication to the government about the resolution on his removal be quashed. Besides, the state government be restrained from acting on the civic body’s communication, it was pleaded. The floor test against Bittu took place on November 25 in which 36 of the 62 members (mostly councillors) voted against him. “The 36 voters (of the 61 present) do not form two-third majority in terms of the mandate of section 39 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act,” the petitioner has contended.The resolution passed without 2/3 majority against Bittu was sent to the state government for approval with a further decision that during this period he will be treated as “deemed suspended, the petition says.On November 25, Bittu failed to prove majority in a high-voltage floor test in the presence of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra. Bittu faced a revolt from fellow councillors over his proximity with Amarinder.On Tuesday, Bittu attended the mayoral office and even locked horns with senior deputy mayor who was given the charge of acting mayor after the November 25 floor test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-decision-taken-on-removal-of-patiala-mayor-yet-punjab-govt-to-high-court-101638389836954.html

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Manish Sisodia visits govt schools in Punjab CM Channi’s constituency, claims deplorable conditions||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday visited government schools in Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s assembly constituency Chamkaur Sahib in Rupnagar district and raised questions over the “poor infrastructure” in the educational institutions.At Makrauna Kalan village of the constituency, Sisodia visited the local government primary school where the Aam Aadmi Party leader Sisodia met a teacher working on a salary ₹6,000. The teacher told him that the school did not even have drinking water facility for the students and the staff had to bring drinking water from the nearby gurdwara. The swings installed for children were found in a dilapidated condition. Sisodia said if the Punjab government calls the state number 1 in education system in such a situation, then it is messing up the future of students.Earlier, he visited the government primary school at Chakalan village, which had cobwebs grown and garbage strewn around. The toilets and furniture were in a rundown condition. Pargat Singh hits backLater, Punjab education minister Pargat Singh slammed Sisodia and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, saying the Delhi education model was “a bubble of water”. He accused the two of peddling “open lies” about their education system. “If you have such a wonderful system, then why there are 760 posts of principals and 479 of vice-principals lying vacant in Delhi schools besides the shortage of 41 per cent non-teaching staff. What is Sisodia trying to hide by not providing the list of schools?” he asked. The comparison of a border state like Punjab with the national capital is completely wrong, he said. “Punjab is an agrarian state whereas Delhi is a municipal city. Imparting quality education in the border areas has always been a challenge,” he added.Kejriwal slams ChanniDelhi CM Arvind Kejriwal wrote on his Twitter handle, “The condition of schools in Punjab is very bad. Channi sahib says that the schools in Punjab are the best. This means they have no intention of fixing the schools. These leaders have deliberately kept the government schools in a bad condition for 70 years. Now that won’t happen. Channi sahib, we will give a wonderful education like Delhi to the children of Punjab (sic).”
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana sounds alarm over fake birth, death certificates||The Haryana health department has alerted the Registrar General of India (RGI) a number of times about hackers generating fake birth and death certificates by breaking into the RGI’s centralised Civil Registration System (CRS) portal, according to the Right to Information (RTI) Act stamped documents.Between June 9 and October 14 this year, Haryana’s chief registrar (births and deaths) has shot off at least seven letters to the RGI seeking action on the “issue of national importance” while cautioning that if the illegality is not stopped immediately, the data “may lose its legal importance”.Miffed with the RGI office for not taking firm action and stopping “misuse of the portal despite repeated requests”, Haryana has listed details on how the security of the CRS portal has been breached, stating “thousands of fake birth and death certificates have been generated fraudulently” in state.“Despite repeated requests and showing information about illegal use of the CRS portal, no action has been taken at your end and misuse of the portal is yet to be controlled. The fake registration cases are still being informed to this office,” reads an October 13 letter of the Haryana health department marked to the RGI.Haryana health officials said they are trying their best to check fake registration of events on the portal at their end.In one of the recent letters to the RGI, which comes under the Union ministry of home affairs, the Haryana health department said they are unable to keep check on creation of fake registrar and sub-registrar on the portal as they don’t have control or access to the database.The state health authorities stated that despite earlier communications regarding “misuse of the CRS portal by hacking it”, at least 243 births were registered illegally in Panipat’s ESI Hospital and primary health centre using bogus user identification in October.The RGI officials in Delhi dealing with this hot-button issue remained inaccessible despite being contacted repeatedly in the past few days via their office telephones and mobile phones.V Shrinivasan, joint director (IT), with whom Haryana had directly taken up the issue in the beginning, said he was in a meeting and assured that he will call back. Later, he didn’t take phone calls or respond to text messages.The RGI’s office directed HT to contact Sandhya Singh, deputy registrar general, stating she is handling the issue in question.Her staff, quoting her, said she was in a meeting and will be available later. When contacted again, she was said to be unavailable. Next day, Sandhya Singh, in a text message said she is on leave till December 10.“The RGI staff have been in denial and are not addressing the matter which has a direct bearing on national security,” an official dealing with the issue said, adding that other states have also alerted the RGI office about fake births and deaths being registered in their states.HOW THE ISSUE WAS UNEARTHEDAs per information gathered under the RTI Act, initially, registrars and district registrars (births and deaths) of Palwal, Panchkula, Panipat, Nuh and Bhiwani had sounded the state health authorities and the local police about cases of fake birth and death registrations in their districts.Following this, additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora wrote to the then Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava to take immediate action on this issue of “national importance”.Police sources say FIRs were lodged in some districts and one FIR was registered in Jhajjar on November 30.Sources say what further set the alarm bells ringing was detection of vague emails during a review of the CRS portal and some unidentified people outside state even handed over such certificates to a health department official who was acting as a decoy customer.These fake email ids were used to log into the CRS portal as registrar, sub-registrar or data entry operator. The users of such bogus email ids manipulated the database of the CRS portal and generated fake birth and death certificates. Seven set of email ids’ details were shared with the RGI office, as per official records.Yet another alarming piece of information that the Haryana deputy director (monitoring and evaluation) has shared with the RGI office is the CRS portal showing 10 birth and death registration centres in Panchkula which are actually fake.Surprisingly, even after the RGI office deleted these registration centres from the database, a birth certificate was issued from the Institute of District and Child Care, Panchkula, a fake centre.“It seems that some outsiders have good control over the CRS website... it is beyond the understanding of this office as to how births got registered in a fake institution even after it was deleted from the database. It is a matter of serious concern. It is important to find the black sheep among the staff,” Haryana said, while again taking up the issue.
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP goes for image makeover after bypoll defeat||The outcome of the recently concluded bypolls for three assembly and one parliamentary segment in Himachal Pradesh, wherein the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered a crushing defeat, has forced the saffron party to make urgent amends to improve its image ahead of the general assembly elections due next year. After the party’s brainstorming session to assess the factors for electoral losses, the Himachal Pradesh cabinet that met for the second time after the bypolls results decided to take a series of steps to ensure speedy development works in the constituencies. The BJP was drubbed by the Congress in Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segments as well as in Mandi. The cabinet that met under chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday deliberated on ways to improve the governance. Delay in the execution of projects was leading to resentment among the public, while the opposition Congress had been repeatedly targeting the government over lack of development in the state. The poor condition of roads, mainly in the rural roads, was one of the main issues in the byelections, besides inflation and unemployment. The ministers in the cabinet meeting that lasted for nearly seven hours, besides giving approval to scores of decisions and welfare projects, held an informal discussion on improving the prospects of the party. Each minister will be assigned two assembly constituencies, it was decided. The legislators will coordinate with ministers to accelerate the development works in their respective constituencies. There are 11 ministers in the Jai Ram cabinet. The chief minister will look after five assembly segments of Mandi and five others will be assigned to senior-most minister Mahender Singh Thakur. Traditionally, the ruling party holds an edge in byelections. However, the BJP’s troubles from its crushing defeat have been compounded by the fact that its vote share declined drastically. In Fatehpur, the BJP’s vote share increased marginally from 30% in 2017 to 32% in the byelection, while that of the Congress went up from 32% to 42%. In Jubbal-Kotkhai, 52% votes went to the Congress kitty, while rebel Chetan Bragta managed to secure 41% votes, leaving the BJP’s share shrinking to mere 4%. In the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency, the Congress’ vote share rose from 27% in the 2019 parliamentary elections to nearly 49% in the recent bypoll. The BJP’s vote share has declined from 69.7% in 2019 to about 48% this time. The BJP’s state executive had in its meeting last month identified poor implementation of development projects on the ground as one of the factors due to which the party cadres were complacent, ultimately resulting in the party’s loss. It was also held that due to overconfidence, the BJP failed to counter the issues of inflation and unemployment which the Congress had made its main poll plank.

Meanwhile, councillor Chanderwati Shukla’s husband Gopal Shukla ‘Pappu’ has been nominated from Ward 15.  “The prime consideration for selection was their devotion to the party and ‘stainless steel’ image. Office-bearers at all levels were consulted and surveys were also conducted to finalise the names. After all the recommendations, the names of the candidates were announced with the approval of the national party high command,” said Arun Sood.Suspense over 3 ex-mayorsMost on the list are either from Sood’s or Tandon’s camps. With the party withholding the names of candidates for the remaining 12 wards, suspense prevails over the fate of former mayors Raj Bala Malik, Rajesh Kalia and Davesh Moudgil. Moudgil is a close aide of former MP Satya Pal Jain.Uncertainty also prevails over the name of senior deputy mayor Mahesinder Singh Sidhu, considered close to MP Kirron Kher.

The list also contains people from corporate sector, business community and social sector.By selecting senior office-bearers of different wings, such as Uttarakhand cell, SC morcha, mahila morcha, traders’ cell, medical cell, colony cell and media cell, the party has attempted to strike a balance between different sections of voters.

His wife and domestic help also have the same symptoms. Their health is continuously being monitored by doctors at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and required treatment is being given to them,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh. Meanwhile, the UT administration declared a part of Sector 36, where the family resides, as a containment zone. The authorities said regular screening and monitoring will be done and frequent sanitisation of the area will be carried out. Residents have been advised to follow social distancing norms, wear masks and take care of hand hygiene.The health department has also sent their samples for genome sequencing to the central laboratory in New Delhi to check if they are infected with the new Omicron variant, she said.Omicron (B.1.1.529), a new variant of concern, is believed to have originated in South Africa and has attracted worldwide attention.Though there is no case of Omicron in the country so far, medical experts from other countries have described its symptoms as “extremely mild”.Covid in tricity: 17 more test positiveMeanwhile, 17 more people tested positive for Covid-19 in the tricity on Wednesday. Chandigarh and Mohali reported six cases each while five people were found infected in Panchkula. On Tuesday, the tricity’s case tally stood at 13.However, no Covid-related death was reported on Wednesday. Last month, four people had succumbed to the virus.

Covid in Panchkula: Care centres to reopenIn view of a spike in Covid-19 cases, the Panchkula health department has requested the administration to reopen the Covid care centre and quarantine facilities, which were closed after the second wave receded.The issue came up during a meeting between deputy commissioner (DC) Mahavir Kaushik and members of the Covid-19 monitoring committee to check the arrangements in place for a possible third wave.In November, Panchkula’s caseload nearly doubled to 63 from 35 cases reported in October. It was the highest number of cases in the past five months.It was decided that a Covid care centre will be established again at the civil hospital to look after the new patients while a quarantine facility will come up in Sector 9 with a capacity to isolate at least 50 persons.Dr Mukta Kumar, chief medical officer, said: “The situation is quite unpredictable. We have to closely monitor the situation for a little longer to make any observation. However, we are making all arrangements.”In view of the Haryana government’s recent order, the DC said a prior permission will be needed if a gathering of over 500 people is taking place in open areas.Insisting on use of masks, he directed the police department and municipal corporation to create awareness and ensure strict compliance, especially at crowded areas.

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Ward 25 has a stinking neighbourhood||Foul smell from the landfill at Dadumajra gives the residents of Ward No. 25 a tough time, especially when it rains. The careless attitude of door-to-door garbage collectors, especially when it comes to lifting the domestic waste from upper floor, and poor sanitation in general is also adding to their woes. The ward comprises Sectors 37 and 38, which are situated in the landfill’s close vicinity. “One of the major issues, which we have been facing for years, is the dumping ground at Dadumajra. There is a mountain of garbage, because of which residents of neighbouring sectors have to suffer a lot,” says Major DP Singh, chief adviser to resident welfare association, Sector 38-A and B. Major Singh says that the stench becomes unbearable during the rainy season, or when the landfill catches fire, which happens quite often. It is also leading to major health issues, he says. The residents also complain of irregular garbage collection, especially from second and third floors. “The sanitation workers collect money from all three floors separately, but they don’t go to every floor to collect waste. I understand that it gets difficult for a worker to climb so many stairs, but they can be considerate in some cases, such as elderly people or working professionals who are not at home,” says Major Singh. Poor sanitation, in general, is also a major irritant. Shashi Sharma, a trader who lives in Sector 37, says: “Cleanliness is the least priority of MC officials. In the market area, garbage can be seen spilling out of the bins, leading to foul smell and unhygienic conditions.” Sharma also complains of irregular water supply, a sentiment echoed by Nirmal Singh, a resident of Sector 38D. “Four years ago, we were promised 24-hour fresh water supply, but things haven’t improved. Forget about 24-hour supply, we don’t even get water on top floors during summers,” says Singh. Singh also complains of uneven cycle tracks and pedestrian paths. “Challans are issued if someone parks a vehicle on a cycle track, but are these tracks worth cycling? The tracks are uneven, and at times, garbage is dumped on them,” says the resident. BJP councillor Arun Sood, who represents the area, says: “The problem of dumping ground arose due to poor decisions of the previous Congress government. We are trying our best to sort it out. By next year, garbage processing plant will become operational and the problem will be resolved.” Regarding door-to-door collectors, he says: “The MoU states that they have to collect garbage from every floor. Still, they are being reluctant and are creating issues. Whenever we get complaints, we make sure the sanitary inspector is informed and waste is collected from each floor.” According to Sood, estimates for repairing cycle tracks have also been passed and the work will begin soon. KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Sector 37 and Sector 38 General Ward Voters: 21,000 Key issues Dadumajra landfill in vicinity raising stink, leading to health issues Poor garbage collection and sanitation Uneven cycle tracks and pedestrian paths Local voices Foul smell from the dumping ground is a major issue. Every councillor makes promises to resolve it, but no one has done anything so far. Major DP Singh, RWA chief adviser, Sector 38 People throw garbage outside the park, which is very annoying. Another issue is that of speeding vehicles on internal roads. VK Bhardwaj, a retired government employee, Sector 38A The officials issue challans without checking whether the dry and wet garbage is mixed by residents from the first floor or second floor.

In a press release, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said the CM had surrendered to the whims and fancies of his ministers and Congress MLAs and was making one appointment after another at their behest without any regard for the future of the state. “In fact, Channi seems to have forgotten his own government’s slogan of ‘Ghar Ghar Naukari’ and haves changed it to ‘kewal Congress ghar naukari’. Within days of taking over as CM, Channi had appointed home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa’s son-in-law Tarun Vir Singh Lehal as additional advocate general bypassing the procedure and using the “exceptional circumstances” in the appointment clause,” said Majithia. Majithia said that Jalalpur’s name had earlier surfaced in an attack on a mining officer and an illegal distillery that was unearthed in Ghanaur last year. “Also, Congress leader Amrik Singh Dhillon’s grandson Karanvir Singh was appointed director (administration) of Punjab State Transmission Corporation Limited (PSTCL),” he said, adding that all such appointments will be scrapped once the Sad comes to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-has-surrendered-to-whims-of-his-party-mlas-sad-on-appointment-of-jalalpur-s-son-101638388878544.html

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Shooter Sarabjot sets eyes on Asiad after winning nationals in 10m air pistol||Until about six years ago, Sarabjot Singh had no little knowledge about shooting as a professional sport. A football enthusiast initially, he spent time representing his school’s team at national-level tournaments and honing his dribbling skills at school grounds in Ambala. A chance meeting with a family member at a shooting tournament, however, made him fall in love with the sport. Singh, who hails from a family of farmers from Dheen village, Ambala, picked up shooting in 2016 after his father Jatinder Singh enrolled him with the AR Shooting Academy in Central Phoenix Club, under coach Abhishek Rana. Results began to flow almost immediately and he has already combined a few good results in his young career. The 20-year-old recently lifted his biggest title by winning the 10m air pistol competition at the National Shooting Champions, held at the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, New Delhi.“I had worked really hard in the last one year or so on mental preparation and going for milestones. I have been winning so many medals in the sub-junior and junior nationals since 2017. Becoming a National champion has definitely done a lot to raise my confidence levels,” Singh said, shortly after his triumph. The youngster trailed teammate Shiva Narwal by 0.5 points going into the final two shots of the 24-shot final. He, however, eked out a victory after striking a 10 and 10.5 against Narwal’s 10.1 and 9.3.‘Confidence was the key’Singh, who had clinched two gold medals in the 10-metre air pistol mixed-doubles and team event at the Junior Shooting World Championship earlier this year, said he had come into the event feeling confident about his prospects.“I gained a lot of confidence when I won twin gold medals during the Junior Shooting World Championship in the team events at Peru. Shooting alongside India’s seasoned shooters helped. I want to do well in individual events too and win medals. Once that keeps happening, I would be able to do well in mega-events. I am focused on competing in the Asian Games next year and getting a podium finish,” Singh said.A former shooter, Rana, has been training Singh for six years. He helped Singh set up training equipment at his place during the pandemic.“It was really difficult for Sarabjot to stay away from shooting as he had done well in 2019 winning medals internationally at sub-junior and junior level. And then he had Senior World Championship in New Delhi to compete at, he tested positive for Covid-19 in March. So, he missed playing in that,” Rana said. Eyes set on meeting idol BindraThe next thing on Singh’s checklist, after winning the Nationals, is to arrange a meeting with his idol Abhinav Bindra, who lives in Zirakpur. “Meeting him would be so memorable. I really want to know from him how he managed to keep his calm and prepared ahead of events like the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the Olympics. And get an insight into his champion mindset,” Singh said.Singh, a student of DAV College, Sector 10, Chandigarh, also has his eyes set on doing well at the Asian Games and feels that any guidance could come in handy on the big stage. “I am keeping an eye on the Asian Games. I hope I can meet him when I visit Chandigarh next and take some tips,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shooter-sarabjot-sets-eyes-on-asiad-after-winning-nationals-in-10m-air-pistol-101638388157063.html

02-12-2021||Pune||Fergusson College professor conferred ‘Order of merit of Federal Republic of Germany’||PUNE: Professor Savita Kelkar, head of the German language department and first woman-life member of the Deccan Education Society, was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in the presence of the consul general of the Federal Republic of Germany, Jürgen Morhard, and other trustees of the Deccan Education Society.Receiving the award, Kelkar said, “I am honoured to be bestowed this merit and never expected this. I have always had a passion for the language and culture, and am happy to be a bridge between the two countriesOne of the major languages of the world, German is one of the most widely spoken and taught foreign languages. “The language has been influential in the fields of philosophy, theology, science, technology and commerce, and it is the second most commonly used scientific language,” said Kelkar.A recipient of several ‘best teacher’ awards including ‘corporation’s best teacher’, ‘Shri Saraswati Puruskar’ and the ‘state-level best teacher’, Kelkar, said, “German lessons in India began for the first time in Pune and are connected to the history of Bombay university as all colleges in Pune were affiliated to Bombay university till 1949. When the presidency of Bombay university proposed modernising university courses in 1908, the senate established a committee. Sir Raghunath Paranjpe, a member of this committee, proposed studying German with a degree (B.A.) on April 21, 1911 and the committee included German as one of the minor subjects. The senate agreed and German became a minor for all university exams from matriculation to B.A.”Tracing the history of the German language in India, Kelkar said that after completing his Ph.D. in Sanskrit and Comparative Linguistics at Leipzig university, professor Pandurang D Gune returned to India in 1913 and a year later in 1914, began German lessons in addition to Sanskrit lessons for an eighth-grade group at the New English school of Deccan Education Society. When professor Krishnaji Keshav Joshi returned from Germany in January 1915, he took over teaching German at the New English school from professor Gune, and also began the regular B.A. course at Fergusson college. The Bombay university’s first B.A. exam in German was held in 1918 which Pune’s Dattatreya Bapurao Davalbhakta passed with flying colours.Sir Raghunath Paranjpe was a great supporter of German lessons in Pune. In 1924, Fergusson college began a Master’s degree course in German and till the end of World War II, Fergusson college in Pune was the only centre for further studies in German in India. Ganesh Rahunath Kokil was the first student to receive a M.A. in German.While professor D. D. Karve introduced German courses for science students at Bombay university, these courses were hugely successful and went on till 1947 after which German classes were abolished at some of the colleges. At S. P. college however, German lessons were first started in the science department and later transferred to the arts department. Professor R. N. Chapekar meticulously built the German department of S.P. college and German classes began in 1939.Kelkar said, “Since 1954, German has also been taught as a minor subject for B.A. German major was taught at Fergusson college. In 1974, the German language department celebrated the completion of 60 years of the German language in Pune and in 2014, it celebrated the completion of 100 years of German in Pune,” Kelkar said.Conferring the honour on Kelkar, Jurgen Morhard said, “It is only bestowed for special achievements in life in certain sectors; namely politics, social work or anthropology. We have given this award to Kelkar because she has gone beyond teaching. She has a lot of energy and has set up things like 3/4 exchange programmes between Germany and Fergusson college. She was also part of the jury for the German drama competition. She was instrumental in creating a curriculum for the German language in Pune. She is the chairperson of the German Teachers’ Association. She also helped spread awareness about the cultural aspects of Germany within her excellent network.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fergusson-college-professor-conferred-order-of-merit-of-federal-republic-of-germany-101638387917344.html

This is the third consecutive procurement season when the cost sheet has arrived after the procurement got over. The current kharif season got over on November 30. The paddy procurement this year began on October 3, preponed from October 11 fixed earlier by the Centre at state government’s request as paddy arrivals had started. “In the absence of RDF receipt, we are at a loss of ₹1,091 crore. It’s an important source of income for our state,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, addressing mediapersons in Chandigarh on Wednesday. He said it was a successfully completed season, which had many challenges. Ashu said the state government will take up the RDF matter with the Centre. In the previous two seasons, the RDF was released only after the Centre sought a clarification from the state on its usage. “We have categorically conveyed to the government of India that the revenue hence generated is used on development works in rural Punjab, and they accepted it. We do not know why it has been stopped again,” said a department officer on condition of anonymity. The Centre has also asked Punjab to amend the Rural Development Fund Act, a state law governing its usage, with more focus on rural development. However, Punjab has also been using the RDF on works other than development in the rural areas. It was used to fund the ‘sangat darshan’ programmes during the tenure of Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister, and more recently for farm debt waiver scheme by the Capt Amarinder Singh government. For many years, the RDF has been kept out of the state’s planned budget and is used to raise funds from the banks. Mandi board records show future accruals of RDF were pledged from time to time to raise liquidity for state’s populist schemes. The cost sheet includes labour and transportation charges, arhtiyas’ commission, interest on the MSP and cost of gunny bags. It has also allowed 3% mandi fee on total cost of paddy purchased. Against a total of 188.26 lakh tonne paddy that arrived this season, 187.23 lakh tonne has been procured by state’s procurement agencies and 97,000 tonnes by private traders. According to Ashu, ₹36,257 crores have already been transferred to bank accounts of over 8.2 lakh farmers as crop payments. 
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Omicron scare:Punjab puts hospitals on alert, told to scale up facilities||Amid the Omicron coronavirus scare, the Punjab health department has put hospitals in the state on high alert. The department has been asked to scale up Covid-related infrastructure to tackle the possible third wave. In a state-level meeting, the health department has decided to add additional 3,500 level-2 beds, 142 ICU beds with ventilators and 1,215 paediatric beds across the state. To activate their isolation centresWith the dip in Covid-19 cases, a number of government and private hospitals in Punjab had shut down their Covid isolation centres and reverted all the beds reserved for such patients to the parent departments. But now, the state has directed all hospitals to activate their isolation centres and put Covid beds on standby. At present, the state has around 9,000 level-2 beds and 1,344 ICU beds with ventilator, but with 13% bed occupancy at Covid facilities, more than half of these are being used for non-Covid patients.Buffer stock of essential medicines Punjab will also make arrangements of buffer stock of eight essential drugs for the treatment of Covid patients admitted in hospitals, including—enoxaparin, methyl predinisolone, dexamethasone, remdesivir, tocilzumab, liposomal amphotericin, posaconazole and intravenous immunoglobulin. These medicines have played a key role in the treatment of Covid and post-infection complications. Some of these medicines, including remdesivir, tocilzumab, liposomal amphotericin, were unavailable during the peak of the second wave due to their high demand. The B.1.1.529 Covid variant or Omicron, first detected in South Africa last week, was designated by the World Health Organisation as a “variant of concern”, the health body’s top category for worrying coronavirus variants. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state Covid-19 nodal officer said: “We have asked the government and private hospitals to start reserving beds for Covid patients, which they had been using for other facilities. At present, only 13% of the Covid beds are occupied in Punjab. Looking at the possibility of another surge, we have decided to increase 3,500 L2 beds and 142 ventilator beds for severe the patients,” he said. To add more paediatric beds“Medical experts had predicted that the third wave will affect children and keeping in view of this possibility, 1,215 paediatric beds will also be added in the already exiting paediatric wards. Also, we have placed orders for the purchase of eight essential drugs, as per the guidelines from the Union government. We are stocking medicines for around one month so that no shortage can be faced in case of emergency,” he added. To speed up testing, the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, has sought permission from the state government to start the process to set up two genome sequencing labs at the government medical hospitals in Faridkot and Amritsar. Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor, BFUHS, said there is only one genome sequencing lab at the Patiala Government Medical Hospital, so they have asked the state government to grant them permission to set up two more labs in the state with the latest equipment. “After getting a nod from the state government, we will start the process to get due permission from competent authority to purchase equipment. At present, samples are being sent to other states which delay the detection process. As this variant is said to be transmissible, it is important to detect it as fast as possible. We are already setting up 5,000 more beds in the state and also purchased equipment to set up 20 more Covid testing labs across Punjab. The labs will be functional by January,” he added. “So far, delta variant is dominating in Punjab and we are yet to receive the genome sequencing reports of the sample that have been sent in November. No suspected case of Omicron has been reported in the state but as per guidelines, we will now send more samples of international travellers for genome sequencing, said Dr Bhaskar. Following the reports of Omicron in some parts of the world, the state government has already ordered 40,000 daily tests also directed the health department officials to make concrete arrangements regarding the arrival of travellers to Punjab from South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Not responsible for cancellation of bus permits: Raja Warring to HC||Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, who has launched a crackdown against private buses in the state, told the Punjab and Haryana high court that he was not responsible for cancellation of bus permits.“Orders have neither been passed by me nor does the answering respondent (Warring) have any authority vested in him by law to pass such orders,” the minister responded to a plea filed by firms of SAD leader Hardeep Singh Dhillon against cancellation of permits and impounding of buses.The minister said the allegations of political vendetta are wrong as the firms were tax defaulters. “The plea has been filed with an ulterior motive to malign the reputation of the minister and should not be considered. The answering respondent is not responsible for passing of the impugned orders, whatsoever passed in compliance of the Punjab Transport Scheme, 2018,” he told the court.On the other hand, the transport department says the firms’ plea said 86 permits were issued to it for 76 routes, but it concealed the fact that out of these, 42 permits on 36 routes have already expired and not renewed. As many as 113 buses are being plied against 87 permits illegally by playing fraud with state’s exchequer. Even as the permits had expired, the petitioners continued plying their buses. Hence, the cancelation order was passed as per 2018 scheme, the department said.As of discriminatory action of the state authorities, the department says till November 18, as many as 375 buses have been impounded and 151 challaned. “The petitioners act is a depiction of the transport mafia, whereby they are running buses illegally flouting the law of land and even having audacity to seek relief before the court,” the department said, demanding dismissal of the plea.On November 22, the high court had put the minister and others on notice on a plea from firms of SAD leader Hardeep Singh Dhillon. The plea of New Deep Bus Service and New Deep Motors, both owned by Dhillon alleged that 24 buses were impounded on different dates in October. After a meeting with the transport authorities, the petitioners offered to pay the entire amount in four instalments and paid the first after transport authorities agreed for this arrangement.But instead of releasing the buses, six were re-impounded and later on in some cases, permits were cancelled on November 12, the plea said.In the case of buses owned by the Badal family, the government told court that the firms only deposited the tax upon cancellation of permits. Action was taken as per the 2018 scheme and as per the law, they cannot challenge the action of cancelling permits and only remedy available with them was compensation. The response also says in the case of six permits, they got expired and were not renewed.On November 23, the high court had ordered the release of 32 buses of Badal’s firm forthwith and directed the Punjab transport department to permit them to ply provisionally on designated routes. The plea was filed by Orbit Aviation Private Limited, a firm owned by the Badal family, in which decision to cancel the permits was challenged. It had claimed that on October 11, the transport department had permitted to make the payment of the government dues of ₹77.15 lakh in four monthly instalments of ₹19.28 lakh. The first instalment was paid but a week later, permission to pay in instalments was revoked and it was told to pay entire amount. But on November 12, the permits of the petitioner were cancelled. The court had allowed plying of buses provisionally observing that the order to allow payments in instalments was withdrawn without even issuing any notice to the petitioner.

The state government would spend around ₹60 crore on the pilot project of an off-grid solar system. It would include solar panels, battery, charge controller, grid box, inverter and mounting structure.PEDA additional director Jaspal Singh said the work to install solar panels is expected to start within a week as all formalities have been completed. It will be a maiden initiative to bring people closer to renewable energy resources, he said.“Panels store enough sunlight during the day and use the excess power generated in the night or during a power outage. It will further reduce the load on power transmission,” said a district official familiar with the project.The ambitious project was pushed by the finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal for his constituency.In the run up to the local body elections in February this year, Manpreet had announced the pilot for the benefit of the underprivileged.In-charge of Manpreet’s political office in Bathinda Jaijeet Singh Johal, who is overseeing the implementation of the project, said the households with poor financial backgrounds who do not enjoy free power supply by the state, would be given a priority. The work of installation of solar panels will start from Friday, said an official from the finance minister’s office. “The finance minister has directed PEDA to ensure installation of 100 units every week. Beneficiaries will also include tenants on the basis of house-to-house assessment in a transparent manner,” said Johal.Officials said the off-grid solar systems work independently of the power grid but have batteries that can store solar power generated by the system. The off-grid system does not allow a subscriber to sell excess power to the utility but it can be used by the household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-to-roll-out-free-solar-power-to-5-500-poor-households-in-bathinda-101638387318117.html
02-12-2021||Pune||December forecast for Pune: Warmer nights, cooler days||PUNE December this year will have cooler days with below normal day temperatures, and warmer nights with above-normal minimum temperatures for parts of Maharashtra, including Pune, said the weather department on Wednesday.However, the winter this year may not be very harsh despite the La Nina conditions strengthening to moderate till February. On Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued its seasonal outlook for winter and rainfall forecast for December 2021. For Maharashtra, many parts will receive below normal rainfall in December. DS Pai, head of IMD Pune’s Climate Research and Services said that cloudy weather is likely in December in Pune. “This will result in solar radiation isolation making the days relatively cooler. But nights will be slightly warmer than normal,” said Pai. As per the seasonal outlook, at present the Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and the atmospheric conditions over the equatorial Pacific Ocean indicate weak La Niña conditions. “The latest forecast from Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) and other global models suggest that La Niña conditions are likely to strengthen to peak to moderate conditions during the upcoming winter season (that is till February). In addition to El Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions over the Pacific, other factors such as the Indian Ocean SSTs also influence the Indian climate,” said IMD officials. However, the La Nina conditions may not affect winter by much, said weather scientists. In a recent tweet by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) stated that for the second consecutive year, LaNiña has developed and will impact rainfall and temperatures across the globe. Despite the cooling influence of LaNiña, many parts of the world are expected to be warmer than average because of climate change, per new WMO Update. A similar trend may be seen over the Indian subcontinent as well, said weather department officials||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/december-forecast-for-pune-warmer-nights-cooler-days-101638387316779.html

As per the weather department, December rains are unusual for Pune. On Wednesday, Shivajinagar reported 16 mm of rainfall till 5:30 pm and had increased to 33.8 mm till 8:30 pm.On Wednesday, maximum temperature during the day was 19.4 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 17.3 degrees Celsius. India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that this year Pune city has received rainfall every month with some extreme and intense rainfall events. Pune city received its fourth-highest 24-hour December rainfall on Wednesday, since 1996. It is very likely that the monthly rainfall for December will be the highest so far, as rains will continue for the next few days, said IMD officials. Due to continuous showers, many parts of the city reported waterlogging which caused traffic congestion throughout the day. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune said that the ghat regions may receive isolated heavy rainfall. “Gusty rainfall is likely in the city. On Wednesday there was a five to six degrees Celsius drop in maximum temperature. During the day the cooler vibe sustained. Areas of the city may experience shallow fog early in the morning which may restrict visibility, partially. From afternoon of December 2 the weather is likely to improve,” said Kashyapi. Post-monsoon cyclone coming?A low pressure area lies over the central parts of the Andaman sea. It is likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over southeast and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal by December 2. “It is likely to intensify into a Cyclonic Storm over central parts of the Bay of Bengal during the subsequent 24 hours. Subsequently, it is likely to move northwestwards, intensify further and reach near north Andhra Pradesh– Odisha coasts around December 4 morning. This will be the first post monsoon cyclone this year,” said IMD officials. Along with this , a cyclonic circulation lies over Southeast and adjoining eastcentral Arabian sea and a trough in lower levels runs from this cyclonic circulation to Kutch which is resulting in rainfall in parts of Maharashtra. “Konkan and Goa and central Maharashtra received isolated heavy rainfall in 24 hours.

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet decisions: Govt approves scholarship scheme for college students||The Punjab cabinet on Wednesday approved the implementation of the “Chief Minister Scholarship Scheme” for higher education. The scheme will help bright students from financially poor backgrounds, particularly those belonging to the general category, besides boosting the gross enrolment ratio in higher education, according to a government statement. The scheme would put an annual financial burden of ₹36.05 crore on the state exchequer, said an official spokesperson. The scholarships will be applicable only to government college students and the scholarship amount shall correspond to the concession in terms of percentage of fee charged by universities. Students scoring above 60% but below 70% marks will be given a concession equivalent to 70% of the university fee, the government spokesperson said. Likewise, students scoring between 70% and 80% and between 80% and 90% marks will be given a concession of 80% and 90% in fee, respectively. Students with above 90% marks will avail free education, the spokesperson said. The scheme cannot be availed fully in tandem with any other scholarship. However, in cases where students receive a scholarship from any other scheme of the state or central government but the concession under the new scheme is higher, only the difference amount between the two scholarships will be paid, the spokesperson said.Exempts 1.5 lakh cases from Form ‘C’ assessmentThe cabinet also decided to exempt about 1.5 lakh cases from assessment related to of ‘C’ form between 2014-15 and 2017-18. Resultantly, about 8,500 such cases would now be assessed under this category every year. This trader-friendly decision would cost ₹200 crore on the state exchequer, according to the spokesperson. To further boost trade and economic activity in the state, the cabinet also gave approval to exempt the traders from making payment of 70% of the excess demand and now they would be only required to deposit 30% of the surplus demand. The spokesperson said the decision would cost the state exchequer ₹940 crore. Subsequently, traders will now be required to deposit the said amount i.e. 20% of the 30% portion of the additional demand by March 31, 2022 and the remaining 80% by March 31, 2023. Notably, the state government has taken these decisions to facilitate traders in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Though it has been nearly four-and-a-half years since the end of the VAT regime, there was still a heavy burden of VAT assessment on the traders coupled with difficulties in providing C-forms etc. to them. OTS for settlement of dues of PSIDC, PFS, PAIC okayed The cabinet approved a one time settlement (OTS) policy-2021 for Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (PSIDC), Punjab Financial Corporation (PFC) and Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) for settlement of dues. The move is aimed at rehabilitation and revival of the industries in the state by offering a unique opportunity to entrepreneurs of promoted and loanee companies, the spokesperson said. This policy will help to resolve long pending litigation and settlement between the corporations and the private investors besides creating a more business friendly environment in the state. The cabinet also approved upgrade of of Gharuan (SAS Nagar), Rajasansi (Amritsar) and Dorangla (Gurdaspur) as sub-tehsils. Gharuan would be upgraded as sub-tehsil comprising of one kanugo circle, 11 patwar circles and 36 villages, Dorangla will consist of two kanugo circles, 16 patwar circles and 94 villages where as Rajasansi would include three kanugo circles, 18 patwar circles and 44 villages.

This is the fourth time since the pandemic broke out that the semester exams will be held online.The decision has been taken based on the recommendation of a varsity panel, which was constituted to decide on the mode of examination. “The university authorities have allowed the conduct of the upcoming odd semester examinations online and detailed instructions will be shared with the students soon,” said controller of examinations Jagat Bhushan.Last month, PU had stated that they are planning to hold the semester exams in offline mode this time. But, various student bodies opposed the move and held a number of protests at the varsity campus to press for online exams. They had also submitted various representations with the varsity.The last three times that the exams were held online, there was no proctoring, and the varsity had received criticism over the sanctity of these online exams.The practical exams for undergraduate courses will be conducted from December 17 to 21 and for postgraduate courses from December 20 to 24. The theory exams of undergraduate courses will start from December 22 and for PG courses from December 27.The students however, have welcomed the move. Sandeep of Students For Society (SFS), said, “Our demand for online examination has been accepted after many protests by student organisations. Now the varsity authorities must reopen campus for all students immediately. Online classes are no substitute for offline classes and interaction between students and teachers.”PU may use proctoring this timeMeanwhile, the varsity is also planning the use of online proctoring during the upcoming exams. Although nothing has been finalised so far, a varsity panel has already been constituted to deliberate on the matter and the tendering process currently on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-to-again-conduct-semester-exams-online-101638386965110.html

Post Diwali, despite vaccines being abundantly available, there were limited numbers at centres as the fear of the infection had eased. However, with the new variant and the resultant restrictions coming in to place, demand for vaccines has gone up. In the past two days alone, on November 29 and 30, Pune city saw 78,000 Covid-19 vaccines administered. Dr Surykant Deokar, PMC’s immunisation officer said, “In the past two days the rush at vaccination centres has gone up to almost double of what we were seeing last week. Prior to this, despite efforts taken by the administration and running the centres 24x7, the turnout was very low and we had even started to assign staff from vaccination centres to non-Covid-19 duties at hospitals nearby. However, in the past two days, the demand for vaccines, both first and second doses, has gone up.” On November 29, 12,895 first doses and 26,022 second doses were administered, while on November 30, 14,247 were given first doses and 25,681 were given a second shot of the vaccine.

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||BSF recovers four packets of heroin along border in Amritsar||The Border Security Force (BSF) recovered four packets of heroin, weighing around 3.6kg, in the Ajnala sub-division of Amritsar. The contraband, according to a BSF release, was dropped by a Pakistani drone into the Indian territory. A BSF spokesperson said troops of 183 battalion heard humming sound of a suspected flying object coming from Pakistan side during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. “The troopers retaliated with fire in the direction of the buzzing sound to thwart the suspected smuggling attempt. Further, the troops heard the returning sound of the suspected flying object toward Pakistan side,” he said.“The area was cordoned and police was informed. During search of the area, a black colour bag with a ring attached with thread sling to hold the bag was found in a field. Four packets of contraband suspected to be heroin were recovered from the bag,” he added. The seizure comes on the occasion of the BSF raising day. The BSF has recovered 409kg of heroin along the Pakistan border in Punjab this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-recovers-four-packets-of-heroin-along-border-in-amritsar-101638386596612.html
02-12-2021||Pune||State clarifies rules for flyers after Centre redflags Maharashtra’s 4 new Covid guidelines||PUNE: The Maharashtra government, on Wednesday, clarified that its rules related to RT-PCR tests and quarantines for flyers are only limited to those arriving from high-risk countries and not for domestic air travellers. The clarification, seen as climb down by Maharashtra from its earlier position that mandated RT-PCR tests, as well as seven-day quarantine for domestic flyers, came hours after the Centre wrote a letter to state government. Speaking in Jalna, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The state has drafted its guidelines as per Centre’s notification. A fully-vaccinated local domestic passenger who has taken both doses of vaccine can travel without RT-PCR. However, those coming to India from high-risk countries and taing connecting flights to travel within Maharashtra will have to undergo a quarantine period and also conduct an RTPCR test.” Earlier in the day, Union ministry of health and family welfare told the Maharashtra government to scrap additional conditions imposed by the state for international and domestic passengers and align the state’s guidelines to the ones issued by the central government, people aware of the matter said.The Centre’s missive came hours after Maharashtra, in a late evening order on Tuesday, mandated Covid-19 testing for all international travellers at the Mumbai airport irrespective of their country of origin, 14-day home quarantine for all international passengers despite testing negative on arrival and for passengers taking connecting flights to first clear a Covid-19 test.Besides, Tuesday’s order issued by Maharashtra chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty also required domestic passengers to get themselves tested within 48 hours of flying to Maharashtra. Lohegaon to follow centre’s guidelinesAfter Tope’s clarification, an official from Lohegaon airport in Pune said, guidelines issued earlier by centre will be followed. “As of now we will continue with what guidelines centre government has given and flyers coming to Pune from other states will not be checked for RT-PCR negative report if they are fully vaccinated and completed the mandatory 14 days duration after vaccination. It is informed to us over the phone. For the next two days we will continue accordingly the way the central government has passed the order,” said the official at Lohegaon international airport. These four conditions highlighted in its letter by Centre were more stringent than the guidelines notified by the Union health ministry for international travellers a few hours before Maharashtra issued its own version, leading to some confusion and outrage among flyers who called them “unjust”.In a letter to Maharashtra additional chief secretary Pradeep Vyas, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan told the state government to align its guidelines to the ones issued by the Centre on these four points. HT reviewed the copy of the letter. “This (Maharashtra government’s order) is in divergence with the SoPs (Standard operating procedure) and Guidelines issued by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India. I would, therefore, urge you to align the orders issued by the state with the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. Of India, so that uniform implementation of the guidelines may be ensured across all States/UTs,” Rajesh Bhushan said. Bhushan also asked Maharashtra to give “wide publicity” to the modified orders, once they are issued “to obviate any inconvenience to travellers”.Flyers not happyMany reacted sharply to state guidelines saying they are unjust. Pune resident Ajit Thakhalkar, who is currently in Jammu and Kashmir and is scheduled to fly back to the city on December 3, said the Maharashtra government’s new rules have created problems for him.Thakhalkar said he was in a remote area of Jammu and Kashmir which did not have a Covid-19 testing facility. “How am I supposed to get the test done before coming to Pune,” he asked, saying his only option at the moment was to try getting a test done at Srinagar airport but wondered when the report would come in. He planned to fly to Delhi and take a connecting flight to Pune.Another passenger who was scheduled to travel from Jaipur to Pune on Wednesday said the government should have given them 4-5 days notice before coming up with such a rule. “Such sudden changes in travel requirements create panic,” he said, pointing that it will take him at least a day to get the report.Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture president Sudhir Mehta said they were in favour of reasonable restrictions but “reintroduction of RT-PCR Covid tests for domestic travel as done in Maharashtra serves little purpose for those already vaccinated.This needs a review, he said, wondering why it was safe for a passenger flying from Nagpur to Pune, but not from Delhi.As per the Centre’s guidelines, international passengers arriving from At-Risk countries were asked to remain under home quarantine for seven days and get tested again on the eighth day. While travellers coming from countries other than the flagged countries were allowed to leave the airport and were asked to “self-monitor” their health for 14 days from the arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-clarifies-rules-for-flyers-after-centre-redflags-maharashtra-s-4-new-covid-guidelines-101638386538815.html

02-12-2021||Chandigarh||Prominent Sikh face Sirsa gives BJP a shot in the arm in poll-bound Punjab||In a first major political ambush by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its former ally Shiromani Akali Dal, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa, considered right-hand man of SAD chief Sukhbir Badal, joined the saffron fold in Delhi on Wednesday. Sirsa also quit the gurdwara body post. Though Sirsa’s closeness with the BJP rank and file in the national capital was well known, but making a prominent Sikh face join the BJP is being seen as a signal that the saffron party will contest the 2022 Punjab assembly polls aggressively. However, Sirsa doesn’t have a political base in Punjab as such, but he was always a part of party’s think tank with strong links with young Akali leaders. He had also served as the political adviser to Sukhbir Badal when he was deputy chief minister in 2016-17. Sirsa was elevated to the core group of the party a couple of years back. Along with Sirsa, SAD’s student wing Student Organisation of India (SOI) former chief Parminder Brar also joined the BJP. He had recently switched sides to the Congress party. The SAD in the last few months had managed to rope in a few prominent BJP leaders into its fold, including former minister Anil Joshi. “It’s a tit-for-tat,” said a senior BJP leader while requesting anonymity. “It’s just a trailer. Many more big surprises are coming. Senior leaders from across parties are eager to join the BJP to bring Punjab back on track,” BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh said. According to a party functionary at the national capital, the BJP’s strategy for the Punjab polls is to tap the disgruntled leaders from the Congress and Akali Dal to claim ground in areas where until now it has only played the second fiddle. Notably, BJP’s electoral strategy for Punjab after SAD parted ways with it had faced a severe setback with the farmers’ agitation that virtually made it impossible for the party leaders to come out of their houses. According to a senior party functionary, the BJP is already in talks with some Punjabi actors who were active in the farmer agitation. Senior BJP leaders claim that Sirsa’s joining the BJP has set the tone for others to follow suit. “So far, there was reluctance to join the BJP. Now, that a prominent Sikh face has already joined the party, many more will follow. It’s a big edge for the party in the perception game,” said a former minister and core group member of the party. Amarinder to meet Nadda on SaturdayThe BJP is already in talks with former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who is scheduled to meet BJP president JP Nadda in New Delhi on Saturday. Both the leaders, insiders say, are likely to discuss seat sharing as Amarinder has already announced to join hands with the BJP after forming his own party, Punjab Lok Congress.

They are learnt to have discussed several issues, including those related to the party and its strategy for the Punjab assembly polls scheduled early next year. According to party sources, Gandhi also discussed the formation of election-related committees for Punjab with the state leaders. Jakhar, who was the president of the Punjab unit of the Congress before Sidhu, could also be accommodated as the chairman of one of the poll-related committees of the party, the sources said. Jakhar first met with Gandhi and later, Channi and Sidhu visited him, they added. Sidhu has been questioning the Congress government in Punjab over issues of ensuring justice in the 2015 sacrilege and post-sacrilege police firing incidents in Faridkot. A few days back, he had even threatened to fast unto death if a special task force report on drug menace was not made public. The Punjab Congress chief also questioned his party’s government for not moving the apex court against the “blanket bail” given to former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini by the high court. Last month, Sidhu had even taken a dig at his predecessor Jakhar, saying he never raised the issue, inviting a sarcastic reply on Twitter from him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-channi-sidhu-jakhar-meet-rahul-gandhi-101638385996691.html
02-12-2021||Lucknow||UP puts its decision to sell bio-diesel directly to consumers on hold||Uttar Pradesh has put on hold its two-week old decision that sought to permit direct sale of biodegradable fuel in the state after obtaining a licence for the same. The decision was taken after the state government officials sensed that the Central government may ban retail sale of biodiesel by manufacturers directly to consumers very soon. The decision that was taken in mid-November after a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary Rajenda Kumar Tiwari on October 2, however, did not come in the public domain and was made inoperative. “We have decided to wait and watch the Centre’s next move on the biodiesel before we go ahead with our decision,” a government official dealing with the issue said adding “We have been told that the Centre might soon issue an order banning the direct sale of biodiesel to transporters and other consumers.” The UP government on November 15 issued a circular putting in place a regulatory mechanism for issuing licence for production, storage and direct sale of bio-diesel in the state. As per the circular issued by the department of food and civil supplies following the chief secretary’s directives, the department of alternative energy resources was entrusted with the task of issuing permission/licence for the production/storage and sale of bio-diesel in the state. The department of food and civil supplies, as per the same circular, was made responsible to act against producers/sellers who were found blending biodiesel into diesel above the fixed proportion or found selling adulterated bio-diesel. Director UPNEDA and special secretary, alternative energy resources, Bhawani Singh Khangaraut said that the action on the circular issued by the department of food and civil supplies had been suspended because it lacked clarity. “We, on November 30, wrote a letter to them, seeking clarification or some points before our department can start giving licences for retail sale of bio-diesel in the state,” he said. “As of now, no additional permission or licence is required to be obtained for production and storage of bio-diesel in UP though no retail sale of biodiesel direct to consumers is permitted in the state,” he clarified. Prior to the Central government’s notification issued on April 30, 2019, the producers could sell biodiesel only to oil companies as per the formula fixed by the government and they were not allowed to sell it directly to any organization like railways or any other transporter or individual. “After the Centre’s notification of April 30, 2019 many states permitted direct sale of biodiesel but UP was yet to give any such permission though some people must be selling biodiesel illegally direct to transporters and individuals,” Khangraut said. People in the know of things said that the Centre was considering banning the retail sale of biodiesel in the country due to increasing number of complaints about unscrupulous elements selling adulterated biodiesel harming automobile’s engines on the one hand and causing revenue loss to the government exchequer. Only recently the Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association urged the Punjab government to act against the sellers of ‘fake’ biodiesel in the state. The association complained that a lot of low-grade oil was being sold in the market as ‘bio-diesel’ adversely affecting traders, government exchequer as well as vehicles’ engines. “Reports of sale of biodiesel missed with palmolive and other substances damaging hundreds of automobile engines also were received from Tamil Nadu recently,” an official here said suggesting that UP must be cautious while allowing retail sale of the biodiesel in the state. 
02-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Applications for occupancy certificate come down in November||htreporters@hindustantimes.comThe department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Wednesday said that the number of applicants seeking an occupancy certificate (OC) for their properties has gone down considerably after it started a drive against building plan violations on November 10 this year.The department said that on an average they received 150 applications for an OC in a month, but the number of applications in November came down to half. An occupancy certificate is obtained by property owners to get power, water and other basic amenities. It signifies that a house is fit for living. “We carried out an analysis of the past three months and found that in September the number of applications was 160 and 155 in October, but in November the number came down to only 80. The applications went down particularly after November 10, when the cancellation of OCs started,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement). DTCP officials also said that this was the first time the number of OC applications in a month has dipped so low. They said that it was possible that many contractors, who primarily build floors, delayed the applications to escape scrutiny while expecting the drive against building plan violations would slow down in the coming weeks. “The action against building plan violations after obtaining OC will continue. No one will be allowed to make illegal additions to their existing structures,” said Asish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-applications-for-occupancy-certificate-come-down-in-november-101638385877617.html
02-12-2021||Noida||CBSE Class 12 students appear for Term 1 exams in board’s new pattern||Class 12 students of the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) gave their first term-1 board exams on Wednesday according to the new pattern introduced by the board. According to CBSE guidelines, the 90-minute Term 1 examination will have objective type questions while Term 2 examinations, scheduled to take place in March-April next year, may have subjective or objective type questions, and will be decided as per the pandemic situation prevailing in the country at the time.The first term of Class 10 board exams began on November 30 and will go on till December 11 for major subjects. The exam for Class 12 major subjects is underway and will go on till December 22. “Today, Sociology term-1 examination for Class 12 students was conducted at our centre. These examinations are not like any other that we’ve seen so far, but this is the best that CBSE could have done in the given circumstances. Fewer candidates per room; shorter exam duration; only multiple choice questions; larger number of invigilators; same day evaluation; strict adherence to Covid protocols are the highlights of the first term CBSE board exams,” said Dr. Bhavana Kulshrestha, principal of Amity International School, Sector-1, Vasundhara in Ghaziabad. She added that the new exam pattern needed bolstered technological preparations in terms of enhanced internet connectivity in addition to more number of printers and photocopiers. Exams for minor subjects for classes 10 and 12 were held between November 16 and 29, which gave schools enough time to prepare itself for holding the exams for major subjects, said Kamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida. “We did not face any issues while conducting minor exams. We are yet to see how major exams go as there will be more children who will be taking these exams. We are fully prepared to conduct the exams,” said Bhasin.Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School, Noida said, “We have given sufficient practice to our students to fill in the OMR sheet by conducting pre-boards and mock board exams. We didn’t face any issues during the conduct of the minor exams. However, printing and distribution of paper posed a challenge for the major paper, since we have a huge number of students”. Teachers said students so far are happy giving the exams in a new pattern. “Students are happy as question papers are balanced. In the new pattern, the students need to be well versed with the concepts as they can either have a right or a wrong answer. Earlier, marks were given even for attempting a question or steps of a solution but this time, that is not the case,” said Dr Jyoti Gupta, director of DPS Sahibabad, Ghaziabad.Aditi Basu Roy, principal of Grads International School, Greater Noida and president of the Gautam Budh Nagar chapter of the All India Principals’ Association said the current pattern of exams are less stressful for students. “Students do not have to cram and write two-three page-answers for a question to get marks now. Moreover, students do not have the pressure of failing, passing or getting a compartment this time because final results will be declared after term-2 exams, so they have a chance to improve themselves,” said Roy. Parents further believe that the objective-type questions will help students get ready for competitive exams as well. “After students pass Class 12, they have to appear for competitive exams for higher studies and in India, most of such exams are objective type. With the new pattern, students will get to practice solving such questions,” said Manoj Kataria, founder of Gautam Budh Nagar Parents’ Welfare Society (GPWS). According to an official from the CBSE’s regional office in Noida, there are 16,000 Class 12 students in Gautam Budh Nagar and around 18,000 students in Ghaziabad. 
02-12-2021||Chandigarh||A conspiracy and a new low: SAD on DSGMC chief Manjinder Sirsa’s switch to BJP||Visibly rattled, Akali leadership went into a huddle immediately after former DSGMC chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal held a virtual meeting with senior party leaders to discuss the scenario post Sirsa’s resignation as DSGMC president. Reacting to the development, the Akali Dal described Sirsa’s crossover as an “attempt by the enemies of the Khalsa Panth to achieve through conspiracies what they cannot achieve with the will of the Sikh community”. “Khalsa Panth is too big, individuals come and go. The Panth is forever,” said a statement from the party headquarters here. According to SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, the BJP has stooped to a new low in politics by poaching Sirsa after implicating him in false cases. “Sirsa has been fighting issues related to the Sikhs. Our party feels sad that he succumbed to the pressure,” Cheema said. With 2022 Punjab polls round the corner and SAD making desperate efforts to rise from the dungeons, especially when it ranked number three in the seat tally in 2017 polls below the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Sirsa was seen as a tangible face to pep-up party’s poll prospects. Before the switchover by Sirsa, the party even discussed having his name in the electoral rolls in Punjab, insiders say. He was a member of the party’s top decision-making body and close to party chief Sukhbir Badal and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal. One of the suave Akali leaders, 49-year-old Sirsa, who moved to Delhi from Sirsa in Haryana, scaled the political ladder at a fast pace. Sirsa is currently one of the four BJP MLAs in 66-member Delhi assembly, representing Rajouri Garden constituency with a considerable number of Sikh voters.Sirsa became president of DSGMC ousting Manjit Singh GK in March 2019. In the DSGMC polls held in August this year, Sirsa, who led SAD’s campaign, lost to ex-DSGMC president Harvinder Singh Sarna, but the party got the majority by winning 27 of the 46 seats. Sirsa is facing at least five cases for alleged bungling of the DSGMC accounts. Despite cases against him, Sirsa has been vociferously raising Sikh issues. He even supported farmers’ agitation and recently went to Mumbai to lodge a complaint against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut when she wrote a post on social media platform, Instagram, that was construed as anti-Sikhs. “I have resigned not out of any grudge. I want to resolve Sikhs’ issues and do not want them to be on a confrontation path always. The BJP wants to connect with the Sikhs and I will play a role,” Sirsa said on his joining the saffron party. He said he has sacrificed the post of DSGMC president to which he was nominated even after he lost the election. “I want to get reservation for Sikhs in Jammu and Kashmir, resolve Gurdwara Gyan Godri issue, protection of Shillong Sikhs’ rights, representation for Sikligars in Madhya Pradesh and a Sikh university in Delhi. The BJP has recognised my work and my joining shows that they have given importance to Sikhs,” he added, clarifying that he didn’t speak to “Sukhbir Ji” before joining the BJP.

Such travellers will be tested for Covid-19 on arrival, and they will be kept under quarantine for 14 days,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram, after a meeting with the representatives of various hospitals on Wednesday.The officials said that the high-risk countries from where travellers would need to follow additional measures on arrival, including Covid-19 testing, are the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Israel. According to the health department, separate testing camps have been set up for international travellers outside the Civil Hospital, the only government hospital that is treating Covid patients in the district, and several private hospitals across the district, as many foreign nationals visit Gurugram every week for medical treatment.According to data from the district health department, there are around 85 private hospitals in the district. The CMO further said that in the coming days, a meeting will also be held with the big hotel operators and multi-national companies in the district to make them aware about the compliance of the prescribed guidelines. Yadav has appealed to the food vendors that while hiring any person in their organisations, they should ensure that the person has taken both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. He also asked the private hospitals to ensure that all their staff are fully vaccinated. During the meeting, the CMO directed the private hospitals to paste a citizen charter at their premises giving information on citizens’ rights, grievance redressal, testing rate, Covid treatment and referral mechanism, among others.On Wednesday, 3,575 Covid tests were conducted in Gurugram, the officials said, adding that the district has been conducting 3,000-3,500 daily tests for the past one month. Meanwhile, the district on Wednesday reported 11 fresh Covid-19 cases while eight people recovered from the infection, according to the state government data. There are 67 active cases in the district, of which 63 are in home isolation and four are hospitalised, the officials said. So far, the district has reported a total of 181,709 Covid-19 cases, including 925 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/omicron-gurugram-hospitals-asked-to-give-bed-details-in-48-hours-101638385638013.html
02-12-2021||Noida||World AIDS Day: ART helps 50 of 63 HIV+ women have healthy babies||In what could be termed as a testimony to success of the anti retroviral therapy (ART) and care given to HIV positive persons, of the 63 HIV positive women in Noida — all diagnosed in the past 12 years since 2010 — 50 now have babies that are HIV negative. Treatment of another 11 babies is still ongoing and they may turn HIV negative soon, doctors said on Wednesday, on the occasion of World AIDS Day. Two babies, however, continue to remain positive, they said. The Gautam Budh Nagar health department on Wednesday released data with regards to the treatment of HIV/AIDS in the district, and said it held counselling and awareness sessions at four educational institutions on the day. “With increased counselling, especially among specific target groups (such as addicts, sex workers) we have been able to test and identify more patients with HIV. in about 98% cases of infants born to HIV positive mothers, successful treatment has been possible,” said Dr Sirish Jain, district tuberculosis officer, and nodal officer for HIV/AIDS control.He said over the course of one and a half years (18 months), multiple courses of medication are given to the newborns along with several other treatment protocols. The pregnant women are also given anti retroviral medicines from the third month of pregnancy. “Until a few years ago, it was very difficult to prevent the newborn from having HIV, if the mother is positive. But newer medications have changed all that. There is a special safe delivery kit for such mothers. A newborn is given the first dose of medicine within half an hour of being born. Another medicine is given after 45 days. Meanwhile, the mother remains under lifelong treatment,” Dr Jain said.Testing as well as counselling for HIV patients has been gradually increasing in district till 2020, when Covid-19 hit and resources were diverted for its containment and treatment. In the past two years, fewer HIV positive cases have been identified as a result of this diversion, doctors said. While 129 person were diagnosed with HIV in the district in 2017, the number increased to 161 in 2018 and 203 in 2019. But it reduced to 91 2020 and 88 in 2021. In the past seven years since 2015, more than two lakh people have been tested and counselled and 868 people have been found to be HIV positive, health officials said.“In the past four years, we have increased our focused counselling among the susceptible population and received a positive response. People are very open to treatment options once they learn that they can help control the spread, especially among children. We also have an integrated disease control lab in the district, which has helped us increase testing,” said Dr Jain.There are four ICDC (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre) labs in Noida — at the district hospital, the community health centres in Bhangel and Dadri, and GIMS in Greater Noida — where HIV testing is done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/world-aids-day-art-helps-50-of-63-hiv-women-have-healthy-babies-101638385636724.html
02-12-2021||Delhi||Two held for stabbing man to death in west Delhi||A 26-year-old man was assaulted and stabbed to death by two men, allegedly due to personal enmity, in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar on Tuesday night, said police. Police added they arrested the suspects and booked for murder and destruction of evidence, as a knife they allegedly used in the crime was missing, police said.The dead man and his killers are from different communities and lived in the same neighbourhood. After the murder came to light, tension gripped the neighbourhood and some people tried to give it a communal colour. Police, however, clarified that there was no issue of communal disharmony in the area because of the murder. Senior police officers were monitoring the situation, they said.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said that on Tuesday night, the Rajouri Garden police station received a call regarding a medico-legal case (MLC) from Guru Govind Singh Hospital. The hospital said the patient had been stabbed. The police sent a team to the hospital where they learnt that the patient, identified as Dablu Singh, was referred to Safdarjung Hospital since his condition was critical.“Safdarjung Hospital informed us regarding Singh’s death. We learnt that Singh was stabbed in the neck by some locals due to personal enmity,” said DCP Goel, refusing to elaborate on the “enmity” between Singh and his attackers.Police said that a case was registered and two suspects were apprehended following raids. The two were identified as Farhan alias Ladla, 20, and his friend Shahalam alias Chhana, 24, both residents of TC Camp in Raghubir Nagar.A preliminary investigation into the case revealed that Singh was friends with the sister of one of the arrested men. The woman’s brother was against that friendship and had warned Singh to stay away from her. The two had an altercation over the issue previously as well and had threatened each other, the police said.On Tuesday night, the two men stopped Singh in a lane in their neighbourhood and assaulted him. One of them stabbed him in the neck before fleeing the crime scene. Singh himself reached the hospital in an auto-rickshaw. However, his condition deteriorated and he was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, said a police officer, who did not want to be identified.“We are probing if Singh’s murder has anything to do with his friendship with the woman from the other community. The other possibilities are also being looked into,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-held-for-stabbing-man-to-death-in-west-delhi-101638385576458.html

02-12-2021||Other||BJP, Cong top leaders in West UP today: Shah, Yogi to hold rally in Saharanpur, Priyanka in Moradabad||Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Yogi Adityanath would lay the foundation stone of a university named after Shakumbhari Devi in Punwarka district of Saharanpur on Thursday. The two leaders are also scheduled to address a public rally in Saharanpur. Many ministers and leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are camping here for preparations of the rally. The BJP had recently given Shah the responsibility of western UP. “The BJP nearly won all the constituencies of west UP in the 2017 assembly elections. But, due to the ongoing farmers’ movement, the situation has changed now. To cut losses, BJP is now banking more on new social equations of non-Jat and non-Yadav OBCs and that is why Amit Shah and other BJP leaders are visiting this region to push this new equation,” said Janata Dal (United) general secretary KC Tyagi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also expected in Meerut later this month to lay the foundation stone of state’s first sports university at Salawa in Sardhana area. BJP leaders said the Prime Minister is also expected to lay down the foundation stone of the proposed ‘Ganga Expressway’ between Meerut and Prayagraj and inaugurate the Meerut-Delhi Expressway. While Shah would be in Saharanpur, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi too is scheduled to address a party rally in Moradabad on Thursday. Imran Pratapgarhi, who heads the party’s minority cell and hails from Moradabad has been working hard to ensure that Priyanka’s rally is a success, Congress leaders said. Priyanka Gandhi had earlier organised ‘samvaad’ with her party’s frontal organisations from 14 districts of Meerut, Aligarh and Agra divisions in Bulandshahar. Priyanka had sought feedback from them and then directed them to work hard for party’s success. A similar ‘samvaad’ with party members of Saharanpur, Moradabad and Bareilly divisions and which was scheduled for Moradabad was cancelled as Priyanka Gandhi fell ill, party leaders said. In her absence, Uttar Pradesh (UP) Congress president Ajay Kumar’ Lallu’ and party leader from Haryana Deepender Singh Hooda had interacted with partymen and collected feedback from them. Jolted by the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 but revived by the ongoing farmers’ movement in western UP, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) too is looking to strengthen itself in its home ground. Party leader Jayant Chaudhary who had addressed several ‘kisan mahapanchayats’ in past one year, to revive his support base has been organising series of ‘Parivartan Sandesh Yatras’. Before the UP elections, the RLD and Samajwadi Party (SP) have inked a pre-poll pact and both Jayant and SP president Akhilesh Yadav are to jointly address a Parivartan Sandesh Yatra in Meerut on December 7. Earlier, Akhilesh Yadav had addressed a few public meetings in the region in which he received overwhelming response from people, party leaders said. Bahujan Samaj Party leader Satish Chandra Mishra too had participated in few meetings organised to associate Brahmins with the party and to seek their support in the elections. Political analyst Jamshed Zaidi said farmers’ movement has made a dent in the support base of BJP in western UP. “The party is now projecting itself as one that is concerned for the development of the region and hence laying foundation stones of few projects and inaugurating few others to counter the impact of farmers’ movement,” he said. Zaidi said Jayant was still struggling to revive his party’s traditional vote base in his home ground though his alliance with SP has strengthened him politically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-cong-top-leaders-in-west-up-today-shah-yogi-to-hold-rally-in-saharanpur-priyanka-in-moradabad-101638385516569.html
02-12-2021||Delhi||Trade, market groups share inputs on Delhi govt’s business portal||The Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDCD), the Delhi government’s think tank, on Wednesday organised a meeting with representatives of market and trade bodies across the Capital to seek their partnership and inputs to formulate the “Dilli Bazaar” web portal.Recently announced by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Dilli Bazaar will be the national Capital’s e-marketplace where shop-owners can set up a virtual store to sell their products online across the globe. Over 40 trade/market association representatives from areas such as Chandni Chowk, Bhagirath Palace, Sadar Bazar, Khari Baoli, Naya Bazar, Mori Gate, Chawri Bazar, Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar, Karol Bagh, Sarojini Nagar, Khan Market, Rajouri Garden, Kamla Nagar, Palika Bazar, Rohini, Pitampura, Laxmi Nagar, Krishna Nagar, and Gandhi Nagar discussed the role of market bodies in setting up the upcoming portal and ways to coordinate with Delhi government for the purpose.Chairing the meeting with trade/market association representatives, Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, DDCD, said, “Delhi government, under the leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal, has been working tirelessly to provide relief to businesses suffering from the impact of lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, the Delhi government set up “Rozgar Bazaar”, a simple job matching web platform on which over 1.4 million job seekers registered themselves and over 1 million jobs were advertised. Discussions with trade and industry associations led to the formulation of the concept of Dilli Bazaar.”“The quality of products and services in Delhi is praised all over India and globally, but many businesses suffer because they still lack an online presence and reach. During the lockdown, while physical retail stores suffered losses, e-commerce gained 150% in revenue and tier 2 and tier 3 cities also saw a huge surge in the demand for digital payments. Realising the support many sellers require to tap the online market to their advantage, CM Arvind Kejriwal announced that Dilli Bazaar, a path-breaking, the state-of-the-art e-marketplace will be built by the Delhi government where every trader, businessperson, professional, service provider, and shopkeeper of Delhi will be able to showcase and sell their products to anyone, anywhere in the world,” Shah said.The portal will support and strengthen both direct-to-consumer and business-to-business ventures. Shoppers will be able to go on virtual walkthroughs of Delhi’s markets and buy any product they like. The easy-to-use portal will help promote local businesses by providing them access to larger markets, Shah added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/trade-market-groups-share-inputs-on-delhi-govt-s-business-portal-101638385456565.html
02-12-2021||Noida||Noida police to probe assets of disbanded SWAT team members||The Gautam Budh Nagar police said on Wednesday it will launch an investigation into the assets of its SWAT team members, a day after the team was disbanded over allegations of taking a bribe from five suspects of a series of ATM thefts and allowing them to go scot-free three months ago.The alleged bribery came to the fore on Monday after the Ghaziabad police arrested the five men from Indirapuram. The suspects allegedly told the police that they had given ₹20 lakh and a car to the SWAT team to secure their release. Following an internal inquiry, SWAT team inspector Shahvez Khan and head constable Amrish Yadav were dismissed from service on Tuesday, while nine others of the team were recalled to the police lines, the Noida police said. The 11-member team was involved in conducting special operations and solving serious crimes until its disbandment. Joint police commissioner Love Kumar said on the directions of police commissioner Alok Singh, the assets of the SWAT team members will be investigated. “We will form another SWAT team with new members,” he said. DCP (crime) Abhishek, who conducted the preliminary inquiry into the bribery allegations, said, “Prima facie, my probe has found the involvement of two policemen — Shahvez Khan and Amrish Yadav. I submitted the inquiry report to my seniors. As it is a confidential report, I cannot disclose more details,” he said, refusing to reveal who else was involved in this racket. Late Tuesday night, police chief Alok Singh said, “SWAT team inspector Shahvez Khan and head constable Amrish Yadav have been dismissed from service for their involvement in the case. Based on the DCP crime’s report, I am convinced that they were involved in the case.” No police complaint has been filed in this regard as yet, said police on Wednesday. Shahvez Khan’s mobile number remained switched off and he could not be reached for comment. The Ghaziabad police and its cyber cell on Monday arrested five members of a gang of ATM hackers in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram. They were identified as Shanavaz Chaudhary, Mohammad Sageer, Mohammad Mehraj, Mohammad Umar and Zameer Seikh -- all in the age group of 25-30 years. The Ghaziabad police said Shanavaz and one of his accomplices, Kamal, have BCA degrees and the gang used to deploy softwares through pen drives to hack ATMs and withdraw cash.Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), said five members of the gang were arrested and four others were on the run. He said the gang admitted to their involvement in hundreds of cases of ATM thefts, amounting to crores of rupees, in the past several years. During questioning, they told Ghaziabad police that they were nabbed by the Noida police three months ago and allowed to go in exchange for a bribe, an information they shared with their Noida counterparts, leading to the dismissals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-to-probe-assets-of-disbanded-swat-team-members-101638385398064.html
02-12-2021||Noida||Fourth round of air monitoring finds high levels of PM10, PM2.5 in Kaushambi||Teams from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) conducted a special monitoring of air pollution at Kaushambi twice last month and found that the pollution levels have spiked sharply as compared to the previous round of monitoring conducted between October 6 and 9. Data from the recent rounds of monitoring shows that the PM10 levels have spiked to at least four times while the PM2.5 levels have spiked to 3.5 times the standard limit. In September, the UPPCB put in place special pollution monitoring machines in Kaushambi as the township experiences high levels of both noise and air pollution given that the ISBT at Anand Vihar, ISBT at Kaushambi, Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area and the Ghazipur landfill are in its vicinity. So far, it has conducted four rounds of special air monitoring in Kaushambi, the first of which was held between September 17 and 21 and the second from October 6 to 9. The first of the two recently concluded rounds of special air monitoring was held from November 15 to 17 while the second round was carried out between November 21 and 23. The air quality was monitored at three locations in the township-- near Kaushambi police post, near Meenakshi Hospital and near Panchmani Apartment. Data from the third round of air monitoring (November 15-17) shows that the average PM10 levels at the three locations ranged between 410.75 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) and 465.29 mpcm, at least four times higher than the standard limit of 100 mpcm. Likewise, the average PM2.5 levels at the three locations was in the range of 165.52 mpcm to 211.18 mpcm, way beyond the standard limit of 60 mpcm. During the fourth round of monitoring (November 21 to 23), the average PM10 levels ranged between 381.28 mpcm and 418.14 mpcm. The PM2.5 levels were, on average, in the range of 127.23 mpcm to 148.80, more than twice than standard limit. According to the UPPCB report, the two rounds of special monitoring were carried out in Kaushambi during clear weather conditions. “The PM10 and PM2.5 levels recorded during the last two rounds of special air monitoring in Kaushambi have shown a spike. The high levels of pollution can be attributed to the meteorological conditions prevailing this season , which has impacted the air quality in Delhi-NCR,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “The air pollution here is very bad and it is deteriorating. It is so because the agencies have failed to efficiently discharge their duties. Moreover, as a result of the blockade of national highway 9 by farmers, there is a major volume of traffic, which is getting diverted through Kaushambi. So, the pollution levels are out of control and is a cause of concern for every resident here,” said V K Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartment Residents’ Welfare Association (Karwa). The township comprises 22 high-rises with an estimated population of about 20,000 living near Delhi’s Anand Vihar. During the second round of monitoring from October 6 to 9, the PM10 levels at the three locations ranged between 161.59 mpcm and 372.58 mpcm while the PM2.5 levels were in the range of 63.10 mpcm to 92.51 mpcm. Data from the first round of monitoring (September 17- 21) shows that the average PM10 levels at the three locations was in the range of 80 mpcm-145.36 mpcm. Officials said results of monitoring PM2.5 levels could not be ascertained properly for all the five days due to some technical issues. Data of PM 2.5 levels at the three locations for some days is available. The Karwa moved a petition with the National Green Tribunal in 2015 contending about the high levels of air pollution and their probable sources. Last year, the association also moved a petition before the Supreme Court, which has issued directions to authorities to come up with a comprehensive traffic management plan for the township.

These depots will cater to the 500 new e-buses that will soon join the PMPML’s fleet.In December 2020, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) along with PMPML announced the inclusion of 650 electric buses that will join its fleet in a phase-wise manner. Currently, PMPML has a fleet of 150 electric buses. The 650 e-buses need 80,000 units of electricity daily. Considering the addition of another 500 buses, these new depots are constructed to maintain them.“Currently, to monitor the existing 150 e-buses, PMPML has two e-depots - Bhekrainagar and Nigdi. While the six new e-depots will be developed at Wagholi, Baner, Pune railway station, Bhosari, Moshi and Charholi. The depots will have charging, repairing stations; maintenance workshops and parking space. These depots will only cater to e-buses,” said Dattatray Jhende, PMPML traffic manager. Out of the total 500 buses, 150 electronic buses will come under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles - II (FAME 2) project of the central government. These buses will be taken on a gross cost contract basis for 12 years. While the other 350 buses will be taken by both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad corporations on a similar gross cost contract basis. “The agency which has been given the contract for running these buses will look after its maintenance, driver and charging infrastructure. We will only provide our conductor and give the electricity, charging the payment to them,” added Jhende.

The campaign, planned as part of the party’s preparations for the upcoming municipal elections, will start from mid-December, said Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta.Gupta said, “There are so many issues concerning villages, especially in rural areas, and unauthorised colonies, which the Delhi government has not resolved despite being in power for nearly seven years.”He said that the party plans to tell people about the failures of the AAP-led Delhi government and also about the various people-centric schemes introduced by the central government.“In rural areas, villagers are unable to get mutation done (a process to transfer property titles). While Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal says that he supports the farmers, his government doesn’t give any subsidy to farmers in Delhi for purchase of tractors, fertilisers, etc,” said Gupta.Gupta said that there are issues related to higher education, road and transport connectivity in the Capital’s rural areas. “There are not many colleges in rural areas. The road connectivity is really bad. What has the government done in the past few years?”The BJP also plans to hold meetings in unauthorised colonies, again an AAP stronghold, to highlight issues related to lack of development. Gupta said, “Unauthorised colonies are lying in a state of neglect and don’t have basic infrastructure. The government has all the money and still it is not able to do any work in these areas.”The party is also trying to make a dent in the AAP’s strong support base in assembly constituencies reserved for scheduled castes.The BJP, which is hoping for a fourth term in the municipal corporations, has started its poll preparations. The party recently concluded its slum outreach programme, which was attended by BJP president JP Nadda. Gupta said that the party has got a good response from slum clusters, which had voted in large numbers for the AAP in the assembly elections in 2020.Also Read | ‘Delighted’: Tamil author after BJP slum outreach posters feature his photoGupta said that the lakhs of people living in the city’s slum clusters, unauthorised colonies, and other areas, have been deprived of Central government schemes such as Ayushman Bharat because of the Delhi government. “It is important to tell people about the various schemes started by the Centre for poor people and how they have been deprived of it. We are in the process of preparing a detailed plan for the campaign and will start it after December 15,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-slums-bjp-plans-outreach-for-villages-unauthorised-colonies-in-delhi-101638385218314.html

The road will also be widened resulting in less traffic congestion.Talking about the issue the Pune divisional railway manager Renu Sharma said, “The development work of the Hadapsar railway station is currently underway. We are aware of the passengers’ issues, as a solution, we will remove the railway quarters in front of the main entrance gate. There are plans to start more train operations from here and for that good passenger amenities in and around the railway station are necessary,”The Hadapsar (Pune) to Hyderabad (train no. 07013) is scheduled for departure on every Sunday, Tuesday and Friday at 3.30 pm. While the same train returns to Hadapsar on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Passengers start arriving at 2.30 pm or even earlier as they have trouble locating the station which is located quite inside from the main Mundhwa road. The auto stand outside the station and the railway quarters makes it impossible for commuters to navigate.“I had gone to drop my sister who was set to board the Hyderabad train last week. We were afraid to miss the train as there was a lot of traffic congestion outside the railway station. The road is narrow, and hundreds of passengers come along with someone to drop them, then there are autos and other vehicles that add to the woes. If the railway quarters are removed then it will be beneficial for the passengers and more train operations can start from here,” said Amit Annal a passenger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/railway-quarters-at-pune-s-hadapsar-station-to-be-relocated-101638385158110.html

Civic officials said they already have six mechanical road sweepers and the addition of five more will take the tally to 11. “We have roped in a specialised agency for operation of road sweeping machines. Since it requires expertise to operate such machines and our manpower is not trained to handle such equipment and get the maximum output, we have selected an agency which will operate all the 11 mechanised road sweeping machines. These will be deployed fully to remove dust from major road stretches,” said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar. “We are regularly taking up water sprinkling, road sweeping and also using anti-smog guns to keep pollution levels minimum. Off late, the frequency of taking up such measures has also been increased,” he added. Environmentalists said dust on major roads is a big issue, which increases the PM10 levels, thereby aggravating pollution. “It has been observed this season that the air quality index has mostly ranged in ‘severe’ to ‘very poor’ category. The city has had ‘poor’ category of air on selected days. The road dust, combined with vehicular emission, is a major issue for spike in pollution levels in the city. At the ground level, agencies have failed to contain pollution. It is the meteorological conditions, which have helped improve the air quality and reduced pollution levels on selected days,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. The five mechanical road sweeping machines being procured will be from the corpus of ₹61.5 crore that has been provided to the city under the 15th Finance Commission. The funds are to be diverted and used in a dedicated manner for measures to improve air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-outsource-operations-of-mechanical-road-sweepers-101638384976647.html

District government counsel (criminal) Arvind Tripathi said that when the bail application of Sumit Jaiswal was put up before district and sessions judge on Wednesday, the prosecution urged the court to grant them 15 days time to complete the case diary. The prosecution told the court that the statement of some private persons and some government officials were yet to be recorded while some forensic reports were still awaited from forensic science laboratory, Tripathi said. The district government counsel added that considering the request by the prosecution, district and sessions judge fixed December 15 as the next date of hearing on Sumit Jaiswal’s bail application. Sumit Jaiswal is one of the 13 accused identified and arrested during the investigation of FIR number 219, which had been lodged with Tikunia Kotwali police station in connection with the killing of four farmers and a local journalist during the October 3 violence in Tikunia. MoS home Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra alias Monu is main accused in the aforesaid FIR. UP government had formed a nine-member special investigation team headed by DIG Upendra Agrawal to probe the Tikunia violence case, besides forming a single-member judicial commission headed by retired Allahabad high court justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava to monitor the probe. However, while hearing a public interest litigation recently, the Supreme Court reconstituted the SIT probing the case, inducting three senior IPS officers of UP cadre but not hailing from UP into it. These were ADG (intelligence) SB Shiradkar, IG Padmaja Chauhan and DIG Preetinder Singh. The apex court also assigned former Punjab and Haryana high court judge Justice (retd.) Rakesh Kumar Jain to monitor the probe, following which UP government cancelled its October 6 notification of single-member judicial commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tikunia-violence-hearing-on-bail-application-of-accused-deferred-till-december-15-101638384917151.html
02-12-2021||Lucknow||Denied permission, ABHM calls off Dec 6 ‘jalabhishek’ prog at Eidgah in Mathura||The Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) on Wednesday called off its proposed programme for the installation and ‘jalabhishek’ (offering of water as ritual) of lord Krishna’s idol at the Eidgah adjoining the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura on December 6.ABHM national president Rajyashree Chaudhri announced the ‘cancellation’ of the proposed event through a video message on social media, citing concerns raised by the Mathura district administration, sensitivity of the issue and safety of ABHM leaders.“We had announced to conduct the ‘jalabhishek’ at real the ‘janmasthan’(birth place), which is within the Eidgah premises adjoining the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura on December 6. However, a very concerned district administration denied us permission because of security reasons and sensitivity of the issue and thus we decided to call off the event,” stated Chaudhri on Wednesday.The district administration had warned against any such event at Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi or adjoining premises of Eidgah on December 6.On Tuesday, the Mathura administration also denied permission to the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi Mukti Dal for organising a public meeting and ‘sankalp yatra’ on December 6 in view of apprehensions over threat to communal harmony and violation of Covid-19 protocols.District magistrate (Mathura) Navneet Singh Chahal and SSP (Mathura) Gaurav Grover had visited Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi and Shahi Eidgah last Saturday and informed that Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code was in force and no one would be allowed to disturb peace in the area.“We have come to know from social media about such plans on December 6. Neither anyone has sought permission for any such event at Shahi Eidgah nor has any such permission been given to any individual or organisation. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code are in force in the district,” the DM (Mathura) had said.“Stern action will be taken against any one violating law and order on December 6,” warned SSP D Gaurav Grover.ABHM activists in Agra had taken out ‘Amantran Yatra’ on motorcycles on Saturday, inviting volunteers for the proposed programme at Shahi Eidgah in Mathura on December 6.On November 16, ABHM president Rajyashree Chaudhri said during a press conference that the organization would perform ‘jalabhishek’ after installing the idol of Bal Gopal at the “real Krishna Janmasthan within the Eidgah” adjoining the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura on December 6.There is a dispute over the land on which the Eidgah and Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi are located side by side in Mathura. Various litigations are on in the civil courts of Mathura by Hindu organisations and individuals who allege that the Eidgah was built after demolition of a temple by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb at the site where Lord Krishna was born.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/denied-permission-abhm-calls-off-dec-6-jalabhishek-prog-at-eidgah-in-mathura-101638384856678.html
02-12-2021||Noida||After a day’s relief, AQI spikes to ‘very poor’ in Noida, Ghaziabad||For the next couple of days, the air quality in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad is not expected to improve much as the winds that brought a temporary reprieve on Tuesday, abated on Wednesday, pushing the air quality back to the “very poor” category on the air quality index (AQI) scale. On Tuesday, the AQI had improved to “poor” in all three cities after remaining in “ very poor” for a whole week. Weather and pollution experts said the expected western disturbance on December 5-6 could improve conditions if it triggers moderate or heavy rain. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s 4pm bulletin On Wednesday, the AQI in Ghaziabad was 387, Greater Noida 358 and Noida 360, all in the “very poor” category. “The wind speed decreased on Wednesday and it resulted in very slow dispersion of pollutants which again spiked the AQI. Further, the temperature has also come down resulting in deterioration of air quality. At the local level, the municipal corporation is likely to get five new mechanical road sweeping machines within a week to tackle dust on roads,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board.Ever since the festival of Diwali, the AQI of Ghaziabad and Noida has been oscillating between “severe” and “very poor”. A temporary relief was seen on November 22 and 23 when the three cities for the first time in November registered just a “poor” AQI. “Not much improvement is expected in the coming days. The western disturbance, expected on December 5-6, is likely to cause light drizzle in Delhi-NCR, but it will be patchy rain. If the rainfall is moderate to heavy, it will surely bring down the pollution in the region. The wind direction is changing to easterly and it is expected to be completely easterly by Thursday,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. A western disturbance is an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure that travels from the “western” to the eastern direction, and bring with it rain, fog or snow to the northern states. The forecast by the Union ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said the calm winds will continue to prevail till Thursday and will reduce ventilation, leading to deterioration in air quality. “From December 3 onwards, winds are expected to increase dispersing pollutants but AQI likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category. Low mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersal of pollutants,” the forecast added. “The air quality is likely to remain in ”very poor” category. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from east of Delhi with wind speed up to 4-10 kmph; generally cloudy sky and possibility of light rain/thundershowers on December 2. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from north-west direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 8-12 kmph, partly cloudy and shallow fog on the morning on December 3,” the Safar forecast continued.

The police have also received a second complaint related to the same issue at Deccan police station. The arrested man has been identified as Vijay Murhade (29) a resident of Aurangabad district. He is a native of Nandi village in Ambad taluka of Jalna, according to senior police inspector Dagdu Hake of Cyber police station. “We have brought him to Pune, and he has been remanded to police custody till December 6. We received a tip from a complainant who happened to see the paper on a messaging application. So, we backtracked the messages and the trail ended on Murhade. But that was only on the messaging application. The paper has leaked from somewhere in the system, between the ones who set the paper and the ones who conduct the examination. We are investigating how Murhade got his hands on the paper,” said PI Hake. Murhade is accused of having leaked papers of not only the health department recruitment but also banking exams, according to the police. He also has a history of a criminal case against him in Begumpura police station in Aurangabad for appearing as a dummy candidate in place of one of his relatives, according to the Pune police. “It does not look like the candidates have made the payment yet. They had quoted an amount between ₹5 lakh and ₹12 lakh for one candidate from primary information,” said PI Hake. The issue was raised by those appearing for examination as the paper that was meant to be distributed on October 31, had appeared on social media before the exam time. The state government has outsourced the conducting of the exams to Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/health-dept-paper-leak-one-arrested-from-aurangabad-101638384678068.html
02-12-2021||Delhi||Respond to JNU student Sharjeel Imam’s bail plea: Delhi HC to police||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the police’s response on the bail plea of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam, currently in jail for allegedly giving an inflammatory speech and inciting violence during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)-National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests in 2019.Also Read | Sharjeel Imam’s speech did not incite violence: HCJustice Rajnish Bhatnagar issued a notice to the city police on Imam’s plea, which challenged the October 22 order of the trial court rejecting his release.Imam on December 13, 2019, allegedly delivered a provocative speech, which, according to the police, resulted in riots two days later when a mob consisting of over 3,000 people attacked police personnel and torched several vehicles in the Jamia Nagar area in south Delhi.According to the prosecution, Imam’s speech allegedly instigated a community against the government by creating unfounded fear in their minds regarding CAA and NRC.Also Read | Anti-CAA speech: Allahabad HC grants bail to Sharjeel Imam in sedition caseThe police had also alleged that Imam delivered provocative speeches on December 13 and December 15 in 2019 and January 16, 2020, which resulted in riots at several places.Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde said that his client has been in jail since February 2020.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad accepted the notice on behalf of the police and sought time to file a reply following which the court posted the matter for February 11.In his plea, Imam said that all the co-accused, arrested for allegedly causing the violence, were granted bail in the case while he was incarcerated for over 20 months.“Even after admitting that the evidence relied upon by the prosecution is ‘sketchy’ and all the co-accused... having been enlarged on bail, the applicant was not granted bail by the (trial) court,” the plea said, adding that Imam has not been named in the FIR and has no connection with the events.“Till date the prosecution has not been able to furnish the requisite sanction mandated under Section 196 CrPC to prosecute the applicant (Imam) for the offences punishable under Section 124A (sedition) of IPC in the present FIR,” the plea said.The trial court had denied him bail saying free speech cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony.Meanwhile, seeking bail in another case of sedition for his alleged inflammatory speeches, Imam told a city court that there was nothing in his speech that caused religious animosity.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat was hearing a case filed against Imam for the alleged speeches given by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.During the proceedings, Imam’s counsel said, “From the impugned speech, there is nothing which per se causes any kind of religious animosity. We cannot lose sight of the context. What Sharjeel Imam says, in relation to CAA-NRC, is that in as much as it affects one community directly, what kind of support is to be elicited from the majority community.”The court reserved its order for December 7 after the conclusion of arguments from the parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/respond-to-jnu-student-sharjeel-imam-s-bail-plea-delhi-hc-to-police-101638384676597.html
02-12-2021||Noida||Health services affected in Gautam Budh Nagar as NHM staff remain on strike||Health services such as Covid-19 vaccination and testing were impacted in Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday as all contractual staff of the National Health Mission (NHM) remained on strike for the second day.NHM officials have been demanding better pay, improved transfer policy, and compensation for Covid-infected workers as promised before by the government a year ago. The NHM union had informed the Uttar Pradesh government that they would start the strike in phases between November 25 and 30, and completely boycott work after November 30 if their demands were not met. However, none of the demands have been fulfilled in the past year by the state government.“The contractual workers have spent more time in the field than any permanent employee. We have worked during holidays and some have worked through months without a single weekly off. We are only demanding equal pay as per individual qualification. Some of the demands were agreed upon by the state, but they never came through,” said Ravindra Rathi, district general secretary, NHM union.Other officials said that the compensation announced for workers who contracted Covid-19 while working has also not been given. “The health insurance and compensation announced earlier has not been given to anyone in the past two years. We were hoping for an increase in salary, but we have not even been given a salary equal to others in the same position. It is unfair considering the amount of selfless work the NHM employees have done since Covid-19 began,” said Dr Matloom, district president of the NHM union.Around 1,500 NHM staff comprise over 80% of the district health department’s manpower. They include around 1,100 Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers who are on the frontlines surveilling, contact tracing, testing, sampling, and managing Covid patients ever since the outbreak of the pandemic. There are about 100,000 NHM officials and 200,000 Asha workers across Uttar Pradesh.With contractual workers absent, only 24 centres could offer vaccination and sampling services on Wednesday. Government vaccination centres had already reduced from 95 on Monday to 45 on Tuesday, the first day of the strike.Also, as compared 16,704 Covid vaccine doses administered at government centres on Monday, just 9,710 doses were administered on Tuesday. The number of administered doses fell to 7,004 on Wednesday.Union workers said that the permanent employees’ union has also supported the strike. Union members also met Noida MLA Pankaj Singh on Wednesday and submitted their list of seven demands. Doctors in Noida also say that the demands are valid, given the support system of the large contractual workforce.“Most of the Covid-19 fieldwork was done by the Asha workers. The entire pandemic was fought with their help. It is only fair to address their grievances,” said a senior doctor from the health department, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/health-services-affected-in-gautam-budh-nagar-as-nhm-staff-remain-on-strike-101638384616686.html

02-12-2021||Noida||Request placed for hiring new agency for development of Noida airport||The Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL)--the agency appointed by the Uttar Pradesh government to look after the development of Noida international airport at Jewar along Yamuna Expressway-- has asked the government to hire a new agency to oversee airport’s development. The move comes after the NIAL realised that it cannot carry out the technical job alone, said officials in the know of the matter. The NIAL has placed the request for a new agency a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the airport project, which is slated to become operational by September 29, 2024. Earlier, the NIAL had tried hiring an expert agency but it could not do so as not many eligible agencies had applied for the tender. “We have written to the state government so that they can get the necessary approval from the cabinet and hire the agency, which has expertise in overseeing such a mega project,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of the NIAL. In its board meeting on November 30 in Lucknow, the NIAL reviewed the airport’s ‘developmental plan’ submitted by the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited--the special purpose vehicle formed to develop and operate the airport project. “The NIAL is examining the technical details of the developmental plan before giving the green signal for the project. Once the developmental plan is approved, the YIAPL will start the construction on the passenger terminal, parking, runway and other facilities at the airport. We need an expert agency which can look after the work of the airport properly and make sure that the developmental plan, once approved, is followed in totality,” said Singh. The YIAPL has been carrying out the construction work of the boundary wall, levelling the field and also removing the structures coming in way of the project. 
02-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board to upgrade 20 sewage treatment plants in 15 months||Delhi water minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) will upgrade its 20 biogas plants and sewage treatment plants (STP) in 15 months. A review meeting on wastewater treatment held on Wednesday also decided the tariffs for supplying treated waste water for irrigational purposes to farmhouses and institutional facilities.A government official said that the 20 biogas plants under DJB have a capacity to handle around 400 million gallons per day (MGD), out of which only 240 MGD is currently functional. “Under the project, the biogas plants which treat sludge will also be upgraded to handle all types of solid waste, such as waste from STP, septage from septic tank, cow dung from dairies and municipal solid waste from mandis and nearby societies/colonies,” the official said.Jain said that though municipal waste handling comes under MCD, DJB will lead this initiative to clean waste in order to reduce the burden on existing landfills. Jain said that DJB will also introduce a new tariff to supply treated water from STPs to reduce the burden on groundwater resources. “An amount of ₹5,000 per acre per month would be charged from the beneficiaries apart from a one-time fixed cost of ₹10,000 per acre towards infrastructure charge,” he said. A government official claimed that a timeline of 12-15 months has been fixed to upgrade all STPs. “In the new method of upgradation, existing plants will be revived without additional civil work. Incentives will be provided for using energy-efficient equipment in these STPs,” the official stated.Jain said that the projects should be completed at least six months before the deadlines set for Clean Yamuna’ project. On November 18, 2021, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a six-point action plan to clean the river Yamuna by February, 2025. Upgrade of STPs is a key parameter under this project. Delhi has the capacity to treat only about 600 MGD of sewage currently because of which a lot of sewage is left untreated and released directly into the Yamuna. Under the six-point programme, this capacity will be raised to 800-850 MGD.As per NGT direction to save groundwater aquifers, DJB is currently laying of pipelines to carry STP-treated water to consumers. Jain stated that a decision has been taken to supply treated water to farmhouses in the areas like Satbari, Sultanpur and Jaunapur, among others, which are currently extracting groundwater for horticultural needs. Large parts of the Delhi have seen a drop in the groundwater level by four metres or more, a decadal analysis carried out by Central Ground Water Board between 2005 and 2014 has shown. Recent analysis have shown that the groundwater level in Delhi is dropping at least 0.2 metres on average every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-to-upgrade-20-sewage-treatment-plants-in-15-months-101638384316535.html
02-12-2021||Gurugram||MCG launches campaign to make Gurugram plastic-free city||In a bid to improve its ranking in the Swachh Survekshan 2022, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Wednesday started a special campaign to ensure the participation of citizens in making the city free from single-use plastic and polythene bags. The campaign titled ‘Carry Your Own Bag’ will be run till the annual cleanliness survey continues, MCG officials said.The officials said that citizens should always carry a cloth or jute bag while going to the market and ensure their participation in the campaign. The special campaign was launched by MCG additional commissioner Dr Vaishali Sharma and ward 34 councillor Rama Rathee at a shopping mall in DLF Phase 1, who called upon citizens, shopkeepers, and RWA representatives to ensure their participation in the initiative.“Waste management is the need of the hour and everyone needs to pay special attention to this. This city belongs to the citizens and it is important to have their participation. The MCG and the administration are working at their level, but people should also understand their responsibility under the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. They should boycott plastic and polythene bags, and instead always carry cloth or jute bags to public places,” said Sharma.The ward 34 councillor highlighted that Indore gets the title of the cleanest city in the country every time in the Swachh Survekshan as the participation of the public there is very high. “If the residents of Gurugram also decide that they, along with the MCG, have to make the city clean, then Gurugram can also get the title of the cleanest city in the upcoming cleanliness survey. For this, everyone has to cooperate at their own level,” said Rathee.The MCG officials will periodically visit malls and markets across the city to spread awareness among the public about the harmful effects of plastic bags and encourage them to use cloth/jute bags, Sharma said.Since December last year, the MCG has turned its attention towards curbing the use of polythene and plastic bags. In December 2020, it launched the city’s first cloth bag bank in Sector 8, and last month also started a similar facility in South City 2.In February this year, the civic body announced that using plastic or polythene bags can lead to a penalty of ₹25,000. However, an MCG official requesting anonymity said that enforcement on the ban has largely been restricted to markets such as Vyapar Kendra, and sectors 4, 46, and 23 markets.In the Swachh Survekshan 2021, rankings of which were released last month, Gurugram secured a ranking of 24 which was its highest ever ranking since the survey commenced in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-launches-campaign-to-make-gurugram-plastic-free-city-101638384199019.html
02-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up civic officials over rising dengue cases||The Delhi high court on Wednesday took strong exception to the rising cases of dengue in the city, and said “policies are being made in a populous way” and elections are being fought only on freebies. The real issues, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said, are lost in the process. It pulled up the authorities, especially the civic bodies, for their alleged inefficiency in controlling the dengue menace and said there was no preparedness on their part to tackle the annual outbreak.“Today you have become so populous in your approach; that people will get offended and you won’t get votes. Everything is driven by that one consideration. Administrators are not administering properly. Policies are being made in a populous way. If only elections were fought and one is lost on these (vector borne diseases) issues — the real issues — we would have a different city. But it doesn’t work that way,” the court said.It further said there was a “complete paralysis in the administration” and “nobody is bothered or accountable” for the current situation with regards to dengue.“If it happens, it happens. It will come and go. People will die. We have such a large number of population…doesn’t matter. That’s the attitude,” an angry court said.It further said, “You have to have a vision. You know this is going to happen. You have to plan. You have to be prepared. The work of the administration is such. On the ground, the situation has doubled. How does the measure (taken by the civic bodies in controlling dengue) help because the (case) numbers have doubled. If the number doubles, then all of this is meaningless.”The court was hearing a plea by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) against the Delhi government’s decision to seek retrospective recovery of grants-in-aid from municipal bodies.The court appointed a Central government officer as amicus curiae to assist it in the issue of vector borne diseases, including dengue, malaria, and chikungunya, and sent the case before the chief justice which is hearing another suo motu petition on the mosquito infestation in Delhi.During the proceedings, when the civic body counsel said there was heavy rainfall in October, leading to a rise in dengue cases. To this, the court replied, “If the rainfall has increased, the manpower and machines must be increased. When you saw rain in October, it must have struck you? Why didn’t you take an expert view?”“Please understand that the number of people who have been caught with dengue and the number of fatalities this year is unprecedented. It is not like Covid-19, which is happening for the first time. How is it that despite having science and technology, and machines and manpower, this problem cannot be addressed? Since 2013, there have been orders passed by this court, yet it (dengue situation) is not under control,” the bench said.The bench questioned the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) about the drains left open in its area. “When are you going to cover your drains? It is so difficult to even go to that area as the stench is unbearable,” it said.“Either we put our hands up and say nothing can be done. What has to happen will happen and leave people to fend for themselves. But if anything has to be done, it has to be done in a proper manner,” the bench said.The civic body counsel submitted that several residents’ welfare associations (RWA) were not cooperating with the authorities when teams went there on fogging drives to control mosquito breeding. He urged the court to pass directions for restraining RWAs from stopping MCD officials and increase the fine amount, for mosquito breeding on premises, from ₹500 to ₹10,000, which will be a deterrent.Agreeing with the counsel, the court said people do not listen unless there is deterrence, but it was not the court’s job to increase the fine amount.“You would be failing in your duty if the numbers do not go down. We would be failing in our duty if we do not do anything,” it said.During the hearing, when senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, expressed reservations about appointment the Central government officer, who is an expert in this field, as amicus curiae, the bench said, “Why to politicise mosquito breeding?”.
02-12-2021||Delhi||Talks between Delhi’s north corporation, teachers not able to end deadlock over wages||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday engaged in political blame game over pending salaries even as a first round of talks between civic teachers in North Delhi Municipal Corporation schools and civic administration for ending their strike ended in a deadlock.Over 7,000 teachers of municipal schools stopped teaching online classes from Tuesday over the salary delay.Also Read | Delhi: Over 7,000 North MCD teachers stop online classes to protest salary delayKuldeep Singh Khatri, the president of Shikshak Nyay Manch – an umbrella body of teachers’ association of all municipal corporations – said that North MCD additional commissioner Sunil Bhadu and director (education) Ranjeet Singh had called the meeting on Wednesday, with the teachers’ representatives. “They were offering us one month’s salary, which was turned down unanimously. We are not ready to call off our strike, unless all the pending dues of the teachers are cleared within seven days. On December 8, the teachers will demonstrate outside the BJP state headquarters and on the next day, we’ll lock all the municipal schools,” he said.When contacted, Alok Verma, the chairman of the education committee in the North MCD, also said that the teachers were “given the best possible offer”. “What else can we do if the Delhi government does not release funds? I respect the feelings of the teachers, but they must not forget our resources. We are chalking out some plans that should ensure they get their salaries regularly from January,” he said.Echoing similar views, North MCD additional commissioner Sunil Bhadu said, “Our talks did not yield results. We are looking at what else can be done now.”Meanwhile, AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj on Wednesday said that the BJP-ruled municipal bodies are deliberately playing with the lives of their employees. “Did the North MCD ever try to get the legitimate funds of ₹488 per person in a year, which is being given to all municipal bodies from the Central government? Even the valuable properties of the MCDs are being sold at meagre prices. The BJP-ruled civic bodies are intentionally creating a situation where their teachers, doctors and other employees are forced to go on strike. These agitations give them the opportunity to put the blame on the AAP-ruled Delhi government, so that they can get more funds by hook and crook,” he said.Responding to Bharadwaj’s charge, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor accused the Delhi government of “playing with the sentiments of municipal employees”. “For the last seven years, the Delhi government has been withholding increased amounts of municipal funds, recommended by the third, fourth and fifth Delhi Finance Commission. As far as AAP leader’s statement that North MCD has sold properties and yet not paid salaries of employees is concerned, it’s totally misleading as all the municipal proposals to sell properties are still on paper. No possession has been handed over and no payments have come as yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/talks-between-delhi-s-north-corporation-teachers-not-able-to-end-deadlock-over-wages-101638384138046.html

It means women can also call Dial 112 for making their complaints which will be transferred to women power line for further action and early disposal. Besides, their secrecy will be maintained, according to senior police officials. Moreover, a mass campaign “Mobile Hath Me 1090 Sath Me” has also been launched under the third phase of Mission Shakti in Prayagraj. A team from Lucknow with a ‘mascot’ will approach women in the city and rural areas to make them aware about Women Power line and various plans to empower them under Mission Shakti. ADG, Prayagraj Zone, Prem Prakash inaugurated the campaign at Police Lines on Wednesday. Motivating the women cops at the programme, the ADG said that they had to act as brand ambassador of Mission Shakti among women in city and rural areas and make them aware about gender sensitization and other schemes for empowering women. “Women should be encouraged to approach women help desk at police stations or call women power line if they need help as it is often observed that they themselves hesitate to approach police or are discouraged by others not to take help of police on different pretexts. In such scenarios, harassers and stalkers are emboldened and continue harassing the women,” he added. SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi said, “1090 has given a platform to women for making their complaints and receiving their early and quality disposal as many of them are still reluctant to go to police stations. Under the third phase of Mission Shakti, not only the women in even remote areas are being approached but a strict eye is also being kept on persons with a record of harassing women.” According to the SSP, through 1090 till now 2.93 lakh complaints have been received among which 93 per cent have been disposed of. Strict secrecy is maintained in complaints received through 1090 and no information can be given to anyone even through RTI. Moreover, a woman is not required to go to police station after making complaint on women power line. While women can call in both 1090 and dial 112 for making complaints, men can only dial 112 for making complaints regarding crimes against women. After receiving a complaint, the stalkers and offenders are counselled not to repeat the crime. In second step, FFR is followed under which family, friends and relatives (FFR) of stalkers are called to counsell them. However, strict action is taken if the offender repeats the offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mission-shakti-in-prayagraj-now-women-can-call-dial-112-for-making-complaints-their-identities-to-be-kept-secret-101638384136716.html

This fact was brought to the top court’s notice by senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the petitioner. He asked how work on the Central Vista was on even as the Supreme Court reimposed a ban on all construction activities in Delhi and the National Capital Region from November 24, with the exception of permitting non-polluting activities such as plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry.Also Read | Time for us to abandon symbols of the Raj: Bimal Patel on Central Vista projectThe affidavit filed by Ravi Kumar Verma, director, Central Vista, in the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs said, “So far as construction of new Parliament building and redevelopment of Central Vista avenue is concerned, the respondent (Centre) has taken all measures as contemplated under C&D waste management rules which includes measures like use of anti-smog gun, mist spray system, use of dust suppressant like magnesium chloride, use of conveyor belt to transfer construction material, keeping all construction material in wet condition, etc.”The Centre indicated that apart from the Central Vista and new Parliament projects, all other construction activities undertaken by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) in Delhi-NCR have been stopped.The Commission for Air Quality Management, the statutory body monitoring pollution from all sources in Capital, had on November 16 passed a slew of directions, including a ban on all construction activities. But as the air quality improved in Delhi, the ban was lifted by the commission on November 21.The top court was not impressed with ad hoc measures and directed the commission to carry out a detailed study by engaging expert agencies with domain knowledge in meteorological data and statistical modeling. The judges said, “The Commission must commission a scientific study of air quality based on available data of previous years bearing upon recorded levels of air pollution. The study must factor in seasonal variations and other relevant parameters.”The Court was of the view that once a scientific model is available, factoring wind velocity as well as natural and man-made phenomena, “the graded response plan can be modulated to provide for measures being taken in advance, based on anticipated changes in air quality without waiting for the air quality to deteriorate.” The commission was asked to carry out this exercise within a month and report compliance to the Court. In the meantime, the top court directed the Centre and states in NCR to take appropriate steps to deal with the deteriorating pollution situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/checks-in-place-to-ensure-central-vista-work-not-causing-pollution-centre-to-sc-101638384023893.html

02-12-2021||Noida||Noida: Homebuyers rejoice as registration of flats now to be done on carpet area||The Noida authority has issued an order mandating that the registry of flats will now be on the ‘carpet’ area, much to the relief of thousands of homebuyers who have long been demanding that the registry of a flat should not be determined by the ‘super area’--a factor that gives the scope to a developer to escalate the cost of an apartment. The new order has paved the way for apartment owners to pay less to a developer and also a lesser registration fee for a flat to the stamp department. Since 2016, when the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera) Act came into being, homebuyers intensified the demand for registry or sale of a flat on carpet area. Even before the Rera Act, homebuyers, citing the provisions of UP Apartment Act, used to demand that a flat’s rate be determined by the carpet area but the developers kept objecting to the demand. According to the provisions of the UP Rera that came into effect on May 1, 2016, the carpet area means the net usable floor area, excluding the area covered by external walls, service shafts, balconies, verandahs and open terraces. Buyers said the ‘super area’ refers to the common area that developers add to the actual size of the flat, thereby increasing the size of the unit to make more profit. “According to RERA, the developer should sell a unit on the basis of carpet area and not on the super area. The developer should make an agreement with a buyer based on the carpet area; if he does the registry of a flat on the super area, it is against the law. Be it agreement, sale or registry, if it is not determined by the carpet area, then it is illegal. Since Noida authority is a party in the sub-lease deed process, its circular (on registration of flats) will benefit customers. It was much needed to put an end to all confusions,” said Rajive Kumar, chairman of UPRera. “After a long battle, the Noida authority has finally issued an official order, sending a copy of the same to UP RERA, the stamp department and other agencies in this regard. We are delighted with this order as it will benefit scores of homebuyers, who are looking to buy an apartment or get a flat’s registry done. The move will bring down the overall cost for each flat by upto 28% ,” said Chakresh Jain, a homebuyer, who has been fighting for this demand for the last six years. Homebuyers had first raised this issue of developers charging more in the name of ‘super area’ of a flat before officials of the UP stamp and registration department in Noida on December 20, 2010. Subsequently, the administration had written to the Noida authority asking it to stop the sale of flats on ‘super area’ as it affects buyers. “From the model guidelines issued in 2018 by the UP Rera, it is clear that the sale/purchase or sub-lease deed should be executed on carpet area. In future, sale/purchase or sub-lease deed should be executed only on carpet area basis,” said Neha Sharma, additional CEO of the Noida authority. There are at least one lakh apartments, whose registry has to be executed in Gautam Budh Nagar. Developers also welcomed the move of the Noida authority. “The move will benefit homebuyers, who otherwise had to pay more in stamp duty at the time of registry. If the carpet area of a flat reduces, it will automatically bring down the cost of the flat, which in turn will benefit homebuyers,” said Subodh Goyal, secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), a builders group. S S Pal, assistant inspector general of UP stamp and registration department in Noida, said, “We are ready to implement this order if the Noida authority has agreed on doing the registration of a flat based on the carpet area. Our duty is to execute registry on the basis of details provided by the Noida authority, buyer and the developer.” 
02-12-2021||Delhi||East MCD move to give financial assistance for composting, waste processing units||In a bid to encourage municipal waste segregation in colonies and societies, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to provide financial assistance to subsidise the setting up of composting stations or waste processing units. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said that the civic body has taken the initiative to ensure segregation of waste at source, for which the corporation will either provide ₹25,000 to bulk waste generators in the residential category or 25% of the cost of the machine used for waste processing as a subsidy.“This will encourage bulk waste generators to adopt segregation of waste at the producer-level,” he added.According to the notice issued by the east corporation on Wednesday, bulk waste generators will have to undertake waste processing on their premises. “EDMC is offering 25% of project cost or ₹25,000, whichever is less. Interested residents can apply to avail the subsidy at the respective zonal office of the deputy commissioner in Shahadra South and Shahadra North,” the notice stated.A senior municipal official from the department of environment management services stated that municipal waste producers that generate over 100 kilograms of waste everyday are considered bulk waste producers.“Establishments such as hotels, eateries, restaurants, and farmhouses are part of the commercial bulk producer category, while co-operative groups housing societies, colonies, etc. are part of the residential bulk producer category. According to the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, it is mandatory for bulk producers to segregate and process their waste,” the official said.Despite being mandatory, waste segregation rules have been very feebly enforced in Delhi, and ensuring waste segregation at the source remains an uphill task in Delhi.Another sanitation department official said that there are various waste processing and composting units available in the market that cost ₹50,000- ₹40 lakh. “At the society or residential colony level, a cheaper non-mechanical composting unit can be sufficient. Drum composter units cost ₹40,000- ₹50,000, and two drum composters can be sufficient for a small area. In many societies, such as Navjeevan Vihar and Defence Colony, residents have also made composting pits to treat wet waste,” the official said.BS Vohra, who heads the East Delhi RWA joint front, said that there is a large number of plotted colonies and RWAs in the trans-Yamuna area, but they have no common space where composting can be carried out. “While co-operative group housing societies have space for such units, open colonies have no such provision, and EDMC should consider providing corner spaces in parks or open areas for composting units to such interested RWAs,” he stated.Vohra said that RWAs don’t have any financial revenue source and a mechanism should be developed to procure good quality compost by government departments or horticulture departments to incentivise the process.Under Solid Waste Management Rules, households are to be fined ₹200 daily, bulk producers like marriage/party halls ₹10,000, and establishments like clubs, pubs, and cinema halls ₹5,000 if they do not hand over segregated waste. But fines are rarely imposed.In 2018, the north corporation had issued show-cause notices to several hundred bulk producers with a warning to impose hefty fines, but the process did not move forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-mcd-move-to-give-financial-assistance-for-composting-waste-processing-units-101638383656496.html

The administration and police should register cases against the antisocial elements who are harassing Muslims praying peacefully,” he said.The protesters, who staged a sit-in at the camp office of the divisional commissioner, Gurugram, said that there was a need to ensure that the Muslim community felt safe in the city and was able to offer prayers at the sites designated by the administration.Also Read | Gurugram: Muslims to approach court for relief in namaz controversyAltaf Ahmad, founder, Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, said, “We have demanded that action be taken at the earliest against individuals against whom complaints have been submitted,” he said. Members of Muslim community on Tuesday submitted a complaint against three right-wing members who have been leading the protest against namaz on designated public land.Members of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), a left-aligned trade union, also supported the dharna. “The right-wing groups want to create deep divisions in the society. The purpose is to divide the people and reap benefits but we won’t let it happen,” said Satbir Singh, vice-president, CITU.The other groups which participated in the dharna included Loktantrik Manch, Janwadi Mahila Samiti, Students Federation of India, and Sarv Karmchari Sangh, Haryana.Darpan Kumar Kamboj, tehsildar, Gurugram, who accepted the memorandum on behalf of the divisional commissioner said that the protesting groups had raised concern about problems being faced by members of the Muslim community in offering namaz and harassment by a few individuals. “The protesters were assured that an impartial probe will be conducted and none will be allowed to take the law in their hands,” he said.The BJP denied allegations that it was behind the protests against Friday namaz and said that they were being carried out by local residents. “The Constitution clearly says that religion is private to citizens, and its practice too. Adhering to law and order and constitutional guidelines always helps in maintaining peace and tranquillity. Some politically motivated people always try and pin the responsibility of it directly or indirectly on the BJP and Sangh Parivar. Instead they should work this out with the administration as it is duty-bound to uphold the Constitution,” said Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson.

He further said that people will also not need to obtain a provisional registration certificate after they purchase a vehicle in any district within the state. “The dealer will directly issue the registration number of the district concerned,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dealerpoint-registration-begins-in-uttar-pradesh-from-dec-10-101638383476458.html
02-12-2021||Mumbai||Mamata Banerjee in Mumbai: What is UPA? There is no UPA||Mumbai: Trinamool Congress (TMC) president and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said there was no United Progressive Alliance (UPA) left in the country and made a pitch for unifying opposition parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre.“What is UPA? There is no UPA,” Banerjee told reporters after meeting Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar at his residence on the second day of her three-day visit to Mumbai. On Tuesday, Banerjee met leaders of the Shiv Sena, the biggest constituent of Maharashtra’s ruling alliance that also comprises the NCP and Congress.Also Read | Mamata Banerjee meets Sharad Pawar on Mumbai visit, talks of opposition alliance“Considering today’s situation and the ongoing fascism, a strong alternative force is required in the country against it. No one can do it alone. We all need a strong alternative and if someone is not ready to fight, then what can be done,” Banerjee said without naming the Congress.“We want everyone to join this fight,” she added. Pawar, however, said the intention was not to keep the Congress away but to take along everyone who wanted to be part of an “anti-BJP front”. “It is not about Congress. Those who are against BJP and if they want to come together, they are welcome,” Pawar said while addressing reporters along with Banerjee.“Her (Mamata Banerjee) intention is to bring all like-minded parties together at national level for which she has come to Mumbai. We need a platform of collective leadership which is strong and can be relied upon by the people of the country. This thinking is not for today but for the 2024 (Lok Sabha) polls,” the NCP chief said.The Bengal CM’s comments assume significance because she was a constituent of the Congress-led UPA, which was in power at the Centre between 2004 and 2014, and even served as the Union railways minister under then prime minister Manmohan Singh. Banerjee was a senior Congress leader before she left to form the TMC in 1998, fought several assembly elections in alliance with the Congress and was known to enjoy warm personal relations with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.Earlier in the day, addressing a gathering of former judges, writers, film personalities and activists at YB Chavan Centre at Nariman Point, Banerjee launched a veiled attack on the Congress and its senior leader Rahul Gandhi.“If you don’t do anything, if you stay abroad half the time, how will politics happen? You have to be in the field, if you are not in the field, the BJP will bowl you out,” she said.“If somebody is afraid, if they cannot take a decision, they just waste time and allow the BJP to become more and more powerful… we will not allow that. We are watching for the last six to eight years, but if somebody is not coming out openly, then somebody (else) has to bell the cat,” said Banerjee.The scathing remarks come amid growing distance between the Congress and TMC, which has poached several lawmakers and senior leaders from the former in its quest to expand its national footprint in recent months.Banerjee attacked the Narendra Modi government, alleging that the BJP was misusing agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The TMC chief said even she and her family members were targeted as were film personalities like actor Shah Rukh Khan and director Mahesh Bhatt.On Banerjee’s veiled remarks against the Congress leader, Pawar said she was speaking from experience. “In West Bengal, Mamata ji won because lakhs of TMC workers worked hard on the field. It is as simple as that. She has expressed her opinion based on personal experience which we also welcome,” the NCP chief said.To a question of who would become the prime ministerial face if they managed to stich an alliance, Pawar said, “It is not an important issue for us. It is necessary to provide a platform that will be a strong alternative and can be relied upon. Who will lead it is a secondary thing.”Replying to the same question, Banerjee said they had to first vote the BJP out to “save democracy” and then decide who would “become the Prime Minister based on the position of parties in the states”.“If all the regional parties are together, it is a very easy game to defeat the BJP,” Banerjee said.The Congress reacted sharply to the TMC chief’s remarks, saying a regional party cannot become an alternative to the BJP.Also Read | United front without Congress not feasible, state leaders tell Mamata“Mamata Banerjee is herself not part of UPA, what locus standi does she have to comment on it? Congress party has governments in many states with several UPA constituent/partners,” said Pawan Khera, Congress national spokesperson.Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said, “Considering the severity of the situation, national interest must supersede personal ambition and all like-minded parties must join hands for national interest and to save democracy and the Constitution... A regional party that is confined to just one state cannot be an alternative to the BJP. The Congress is the only alternate to the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mamata-banerjee-in-mumbai-what-is-upa-there-is-no-upa-101638380716206.html
02-12-2021||Lucknow||Omicron scare: Foreign buyers cancel visits to Kanpur leather units||The emergence of the new coronavirus variant Omicron overseas has led to the Kanpur leather industry seeing a high traffic of emails from buyers, cancelling their visits to India. No case of the Omicron variant has been detected in India so far.Similarly, Kanpur industrialists dealing in finished leather and leather goods have largely put their visits, particularly to Europe, on hold. The visits were planned for in the period starting before Christmas, during which the maximum orders are placed with the leather exporters who have registered a negative growth in the last two years.Taj Alam, former chairman of the Council for Leather Exports (CLE), said the buyers were hesitant to go ahead with the visits scheduled for the next three months.“I was expecting several buyers. They all have called off their visits, unsure how the situation will unfold globally,” he said.For this very reason, the Indian Leather Producers’ Association fair that was slated to open in Kolkata in January next year has been converted into a virtual one. There is no clarity on whether or not the important “Madras Fair” (India International Leather Fair in Chennai) would be organised in January 2022, said exporters.The same is the situation in Germany where the Spoga fair, which has participation from buyers and exporters the world over, was struggling to sell display stalls. Almost half of the exporters have not booked stalls. The Spoga fair is held each year in the first week of February in Cologne, said Alam.The visits planned to Moscow (Russia), South Africa, Italy, Germany and UK to showcase the new products have been cancelled in bulk, said Shariq Alvi, managing director of a travel company that handles exporters and their overseas visits.The Omicron scare in the past two weeks has further hit the industry that, as per CLE, has witnessed a 60% loss in sales and production in the wake of the Covid pandemic.“Just 40% business is left for us to navigate. It may us take years to recover if a third wave hits,” said Javed Iqbal, chairman of CLE, from Italy.“Some of us are going to the buyers, putting ourselves at risk. We are a handful, but doing the best to survive,” he said.According to the data available with exporters, all the sectors of the industry have seen negative growth expect for saddlery which has recorded 10% positive growth.Other than finished buffalo leather, Kanpur controlled 60% of the total exports, but this has seen negative growth, the exporters who did not wish to be named, said. Shoe manufacturing, leather gloves, bags and garments all have registered negative growth between 5% and 15%, they said.In order to tackle the situation, the top export houses have opened 38 corporate offices in Dubai in the past one month to stay afloat. The buyers who were unable to come to India could go to Dubai where they are shown the samples and they could place the order.“The virtual system was not working for us. That was the only alternative for us to explore. Let us see how successful it is,” said Mohd Abid, an exporter.Dubai has given the exporters an added advantage, issuing a multiple entry visa for a period of five years rather than the earlier one of three months.“It is morale boosting and I believe it will help in attracting buyers at a third destination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/omicron-scare-kanpur-leather-industry-feels-the-pinch-as-foreign-buyers-cancel-visits-101638377775168.html

Gulmarg observed minus 1.6°C temperature. Leh registered minus 8.6°C, while Kargil and Dras shivered at minus 7.4°C and 12.8°C, respectively.As per the weatherman, a fresh western disturbance is most likely to affect J&K and adjoining areas on December 4 (evening) till December 6 (afternoon) with peak activity on December 5.“There will be widespread light to moderate snowfall in middle and higher reaches of Kashmir and Jammu, while light snow and rain over plains of the region is expected. Higher reaches of Kupwara, Baramulla, Bandipora, Shopian and Ganderbal could receive 6-9 inches of snow during above period,” reads an advisory issued by MeT office.The advisory said that snowfall could lead the temporary disruption of air and surface traffic over passes like Zojila, Simthan Top, Razdan Top, and Mughal Road on December 5. The growers have been asked to properly prune orchards and withhold irrigation and fertiliser application in wheat and mustard crops in plains of Jammu during the above period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chill-in-hills-snow-rain-forecast-in-himachal-pradesh-till-december-4-101638339639903.html

Despite the free and widespread availability of vaccines, only 59.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated, which leaves them open to contracting and spreading the virus.President Joe Biden is scheduled to announce the measures later on Thursday.On Wednesday, the day the US reported its first case of the Omicron variant, he said the “new variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic” and said, citing his medical advisers, vaccination, along with the booster dose, remained the best protection against it.In a fact-sheet released on Thursday morning, the White House said the array of measures to be announced, the president will urge more than 100 million eligible Americans to get their booster shots and announce steps to expand availability through federal partner pharmacies because an ongoing surge in demand.The American president will also urge businesses to give employees paid time-off for their booster shots and call on them to take steps to protect employees at work.Biden will announce new measures to keep schools open that would include reviewing and implementing “layered prevention strategies”. More than 99% of US schools are open and are conducting classes in-person and their prolonged closure earlier had triggered widespread outrage, with political overtones in many states, especially those with Republican administrations.The administration also plans to expand the availability of free at-home testing kits. The White House said, “We are on track to quadruple the supply of rapid at-home tests that we had in late-Summer. Today’s actions will help Americans access the tests they need to help them stop the spread of Covid-19 to others.”On in-bound international travelers, the administration plans stronger health protocols in addition to restrictions announced earlier for visitors from some African countries with Omicron outbreaks. Travellers from other countries will be required to produce a negative test result done in 24 hours, “regardless of nationality or vaccination status”.Mask will be mandatory on international flights - and other public transport - till March 18. Fines will continue to be doubled from their initial levels for noncompliance with the masking requirements - with a minimum fine of $500 and fines of up to $3,000 for repeat offenders, the White House said in the fact-sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-joe-biden-to-announce-new-measures-to-tackle-covid19-101638466781899.html
02-12-2021||World||IMF warns of 'economic collapse' unless G20 extends debt relief||The IMF on Thursday urged advanced economies in the G20 to extend and improve their debt relief initiative, warning that many countries face a dire crisis without the help."We may see economic collapse in some countries unless G20 creditors agree to accelerate debt restructurings and suspend debt service while the restructurings are being negotiated," IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog, adding that it is critical private creditors also offer relief.The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) expires at the end of the year, and without a renewal, countries would face financial pressure and spending cuts just as new Covid-19 variants are spreading and interest rates are expected to rise, she said."Debt challenges are pressing and the need for action is urgent. The recent Omicron variant is a stark reminder that the pandemic will be with us for a while," Georgieva said in the blog co-authored by Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, director of the fund's Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.Georgieva did not specify which economies faced a crisis, but referred simply to "low-income countries."Advanced economies in the Group of 20 announced the program last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit poor countries the hardest, hampering the ability of those governments to service their debt and support their people.The G20 twice extended the DSSI, but the IMF and World Bank have been urging creditors to do more to help with the burgeoning debt load. There are 73 countries eligible for relief under the program.Debt distress The World Bank estimates that debt loads in poor countries surged 12 percent to a record $860 billion in 2020 amid the pandemic, and Georgieva said "about 60 percent of low-income countries are at high risk or already in debt distress."Given the problems with the debt relief program and the common framework for dealing with private creditors, only three countries so far have applied for relief -- Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia -- and they have faced "significant delays."The framework has "yet to deliver on its promise. This requires prompt action," she said.She noted that Chad's program is hung up due to the need to restructure a large amount owed to a private company.And with inflation surging in major economies, central banks are pulling back on stimulus and expected to begin raising interest rates next year, which would increase debt service costs for poor nations and likely would see capital flee those countries."No doubt 2022 will be much more challenging with the tightening of international financial conditions on the horizon," Georgieva said.The IMF is calling for improvements in the program, especially mechanisms to oblige private creditors to participate, which would encourage more poor countries to make use of the DSSI.In addition, "a comprehensive and sustained debt service payment standstill for the duration of the negotiation would provide relief to the debtor at a time when it is under stress," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-warns-of-economic-collapse-unless-g20-extends-debt-relief-101638462397696.html

France has already reported its first case of the new variant, being said to be more dangerous than the Delta strain.“We should see a progressive rise of the Omicron variant, which will take over from Delta, possibly by the end of January,” French government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy told BFM television, according to news agency Reuters.The "true enemy" for now was still the Delta variant, spreading in a "fifth wave", he was further quoted as saying.Also read | Omicron variant detected in India, two positive cases in Karnataka"Christmas is not at risk if the population and decision-makers are all very cautious," he said, emphasising that physical distancing and a booster shot of vaccines were key.French authorities on Thursday confirmed the first case of the Covid-19 Omicron variant on the mainland, a man in his 50s who recently returned from Nigeria.Omicron was first detected in South Africa in November and has spread to at least two dozen countries since. While much remains unknown about the new variant, South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said early epidemiological data suggested Omicron was able to evade some immunity, but existing vaccines should still protect against severe disease and death.Also read | Will Omicron be as deadly as Delta? Virologist on symptoms, prevention and scare around the new strainWorld Health Organisation (WHO) epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told a briefing that data should be available "within days" on Omicron's contagiousness.Meanwhile, France is facing a fifth wave of Covid-19 since the pandemic emerged last year, and three hospitals in northeast France have implemented emergency protocols because beds are filling rapidly with Covid patients. Health minister Olivier Veran has warned that average daily cases are likely to surpass the peaks of the third wave that hit last spring, possibly as soon as this week.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-could-soon-become-dominant-variant-of-covid-19-in-france-adviser-101638446436545.html
02-12-2021||World||Peng Shuai: China opposes ‘politicisation’ of sports||China said on Thursday that politics should be kept out of sports after the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) suspended tournaments in the country over concerns for Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai’s safety.The WTA, the global governing body for women’s professional tennis, on Wednesday announced the “immediate suspension of all tournaments in China”, including in Hong Kong, citing concerns about the well-being of Peng, a former doubles world number one, who accused a top former Communist Party of China (CPC) leader Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault a month ago.The WTA also cited concerns over the safety of other players as a reason for suspending tournaments.The Chinese foreign ministry did not directly respond to the WTA’s decision to suspend competitions, but said it was against politicisation of sport.When asked about the matter at a regular briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave a one line response, saying China “opposes the politicisation of sports”.China has remained largely silent over the huge scandal, blocking discussions of the topic on China’s heavily-censored internet.On November 23, the foreign ministry had said it hoped that “malicious hype” about tennis star Peng’s whereabouts and well-being would stop, and that her case would not be politicised.Instead, the Chinese government has allowed state-controlled media to go on the offensive, describing the global concern for Peng’s well-being as politicising sport.On Thursday, the editor of the tabloid, Global Times, accused the WTA of “coercing” Peng to “support the West’s attack” on China by suspending tournaments in the country until was assured of her well-being.The tabloid also cited a statement from the Chinese Tennis Association saying that it would defend its rights, and warning that the WTA should bear the legal consequences.In an editorial aimed at the WTA’s decision, the tabloid accused it of “bringing politics into women’s tennis” and of being a “lever of Western public opinion”.“WTA suspended tournaments in China amid so-called concerns about the safety of Peng Shuai. The WTA is expanding its influence in a speculative way, bringing politics into women’s tennis deeply, setting a bad example for the entire sporting world,” the editorial posted on Twitter – which is banned in China – said on Thursday.Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee said in a statement on Thursday that it had held a second video call with Peng, having held the first late last month.“We share the same concern as many other people and organisations about the wellbeing and safety of Peng Shuai. This is why, just yesterday, an IOC team held another video call with her,” the IOC said.The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one and one of China’s top tennis icons, have been a matter of international concern since November 2 when she posted a message on social media alleging that China’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.Peng’s post was immediately deleted and her presence scrubbed from China’s strictly censored web.In late November, Chinese state media released Peng’s photos and videos, following the release of an email purportedly written by her, to claim that the tennis player was safe but wanted to be left alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peng-shuai-china-opposes-politicisation-of-sports-101638445882850.html
02-12-2021||World||China summons Japan envoy over ex-PM’s Taiwan remarks||China’s foreign ministry summoned Japan’s ambassador for an “emergency meeting” on Wednesday to lodge its protest after former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said neither Tokyo nor Washington could stand by if China attacked Taiwan.Assistant foreign minister Hua Chunying said Abe’s remarks were “erroneous”, and a violation of basic norms of relations between China and Japan in the meeting with Japanese ambassador Hideo Tarumi in Beijing, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry.“A Taiwan crisis would be a Japan crisis and therefore a crisis for the Japan-US alliance,” Abe said in an online speech on Wednesday.“It’s imperative that people in Beijing not misjudge that, and most especially President Xi Jinping,” he said.“Military adventure would lead to economic suicide,” Abe added.Describing Abe’s remarks as “extremely erroneous”, Hua said it was “a brutal interference in China’s internal affairs and challenged China’s sovereignty.”“His flagrant support to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces seriously violated the basic norms of international relations and principles stipulated in the four political documents between China and Japan,” Hua said.“China is resolutely opposed to this,” Hua said, adding that China had made “stern representations” to Japan.Hua said Japan is a country that launched a war of aggression against China in history and committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people, and has no right to point fingers on the Taiwan question, according to state media.Abe’s remarks and China’s response indicate the growing tension in the region over Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy claimed by China as a breakaway region.“Japan, Taiwan and all the people who believe in democracy need to keep urging President Xi Jinping and other Chinese Communist Party leaders repeatedly not to step onto a wrong path,” Abe said, according to a Reuters report.Japan and Taiwan must work together to protect freedom and democracy, Japan’s former prime minister said.“A stronger Taiwan, a thriving Taiwan, and a Taiwan that guarantees freedom and human rights are also in Japan’s interests. Of course, this is also in the interests of the whole world,” Abe added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-summons-japan-envoy-over-ex-pm-s-taiwan-remarks-101638440362494.html
02-12-2021||World||Abe’s warning to China over Taiwan is a blunt message to President Xi||Former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe’s upfront warning to China that Tokyo and Washington will not stand-by if Beijing attacked Taiwan is a message to President Xi Jinping to tone down his belligerence over Taipei.Speaking virtually at a forum organized by a Taiwanese think tank on Wednesday, Abe said: “An armed invasion of Taiwan would be a grave danger to Japan. A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, and therefore an emergency for the Japan-US alliance. People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should not have a misunderstanding in recognizing this.” Abe is head of the largest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and remains a very influential figure in the party and the Island nation.Former PM Abe’s statement came at a time when Japan has decided to upgrade and extend the capability of its cruise missiles to hit objects over 1000 kilometres from the present capability of 100-200 km. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the missiles will be deployed in the second half of this decade with multi-spectrum capability. Essentially, the Japanese plan is to deter the increased missile development competition in the Asia Pacific Region.Given the past legacy of Japan, China and South Korea will be uneasy with this missile development plan but the fact is that Beijing is in a hyper-aggressive mode in the region. It has already deployed intermediate-range ballistic missiles that can target any city in Japan and the US base in Guam. The Chinese propaganda media has nick-named these missiles ship killer and Guam killer.While the US has already made it clear that it would take (unspecified) action if China was to use force to alter the status of Taiwan, the Biden administration, aided by the US Congress, is considering a plan to deploy an intermediate-range ballistic missile network on the first Island chain connecting Okinawa (which has a US base) to Taiwan and Philippines.In the light of the above, Shinzo Abe statement should not be taken lightly as it makes it evident that Tokyo will shed its pacifist posture (enshrined in article nine of their constitution) if China continues to steamroll its hegemonistic agenda in the Asia Pacific as well as towards Indian sub-continent.Just as the PLA has increased the number of intermediate-range missile launchers to as high as 82 towards Asia-Pacific adversaries, it has also deployed long-range missiles in Tibet to pressurize India and subdue the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. China has already started building an airbase in Burang county, just north of Lipu-Lekh pass, and it is only a matter of time when military aircraft and drones will be deployed at the new base. Already, the PLA has deployed two S-400 air defence systems against India in Tibet and three systems to handle the possible US-Japan threat on its eastern seaboard.Several China watchers believe that Beijing will become more aggressive towards Taiwan after the February 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as it does not want any games boycott from the participating nations like US and Japan in the worst-case scenario. The situation on the India-China border in Ladakh is no different with Beijing continuing its Sinicization of Tibet and Xinjiang agenda and turning the Himalayan plateau into a fortress. The contested Senkaku Island chain is just 100 km from Taiwan and the Burang airport mere 400 km from Delhi. A two-front deterrence may force China to abandon its belligerent path as any adverse action can spiral into a global conflict.

Here is what we do and do not know about the issue.What is causing concern?The data, released by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), shows that 52 infants under age 2 were among 452 Covid-19 patients admitted in Tshwane - the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria - in the period between Nov. 14 and 28, a higher number than for any other age group.However, taking into account the size of the populations of the various age groups, the risk of admission was higher for people over age 60.Have the admissions been linked to Omicron?No. Only a small percentage of positive test samples in South Africa are being submitted for genomic sequencing to detect the variant due to limited capacity. That means we cannot know for sure whether the infants in hospital were infected with Omicron, NICD scientists have said.There is also uncertainty about whether all of the infants included in the data are infected with Covid-19, as not all are tested for the virus, scientists said.For practical reasons, infants who present with respiratory symptoms are treated as if they had Covid-19, but they could be sick with another disease such as flu.Omicron may not evade all immunity: 4 new findings by South African doctors, scientistsHow sick were the admitted infants?The data shows that 29% of Covid-19 admissions in the 0-to-4 age group had severe disease - a proportion similar to that in several other age groups, and significantly lower than the percentage of severe disease among patients over 60.Among those age 4 or younger, 1% of admissions resulted in death, according to the data. However, the total number of admissions in that group was 70, making it unclear what the 1% figure represents.The NICD did not respond to a query from Reuters about that and other elements of the data, saying it would issue a new report on paediatric admissions later this week.Should we worried about a potential Omicron link?Asked whether people should be alarmed by the infant admissions numbers, Professor Anne von Gottberg, clinical microbiologist at the NICD, told Reuters: "Not yet.""It looks like in fact some of those admissions might have started before the emergence of Omicron," she said. "We are concerned enough that we are looking at the data very, very carefully, but at the moment I'm not too sure that we can link it definitively to Omicron."How is Omicron detected? What is S-gene dropout? All you need to knowWhat else could be going on?The province of Gauteng, where Tshwane is located, has experienced an increase in flu cases in the past month."We need to be really careful to look at the other respiratory infections and diseases to work out why were children being admitted. Were they being tested as they were being admitted or was it precautionary?" said von Gottberg.NICD scientists also said that parents with sick babies and infants were quick to bring them to hospital, while patients in other age groups were less likely to rush in.When will we know more?The NICD said it was preparing a report on paediatric admissions which should be available by the end of the week.The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it expected to have data on Omicron's transmissibility within days, but scientists said it could take two-to-four weeks to learn more about the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/does-omicron-pose-higher-risks-for-infants-than-other-coronavirus-variants-101638405630220.html

However, the number of daily Covid cases has doubled to 8,561.Mild or severe?South African doctors earlier said that they found mild diseases in Omicron cases. But scientists are saying it is still too early to determine whether going forward Omicron will only cause mild illness. The symptoms reported were mild as the cases were mostly reported in younger age groups but now older age groups are also becoming the target of this variant.Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist at the KRISP genomics institute, said the severity of disease caused by the new strain may also be masked by the fact that many people have already contracted other variants or have been inoculated, giving them some immunity.(With inputs from Reuters and Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-not-evade-all-immunity-4-new-findings-by-south-african-doctors-scientists-101638415401795.html

Neil Ferguson, the head of the disease outbreak analysis and modelling group at Imperial College London, told British parliamentarians that the threat posed by the Omicron variant will not be clear until the end of December, The Guardian reported.“The virus cares about replicating very fast within the respiratory tract and getting out into the environment. If that happens to kill somebody 10 days later the virus really doesn’t care,” Ferguson, who influenced the governments’ response around the world with his initial Covid-19 modelling, said.Omicron has prompted countries across the globe to tighten travel restrictions as uncertainty over the new B.1.1.529 variant grows. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned over the inequitable access of vaccines and overall low vaccine coverage globally as the highly transmissible Deta variant remains the dominant variant worldwide."Globally, we have a toxic mix of low vaccine coverage, and very low testing -- a recipe for breeding and amplifying variants," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."We need to use the tools we already have to prevent transmission and save lives from Delta. And if we do that, we will also prevent transmission and save lives from Omicron," he added.Covid in Chandigarh: South Africa returnee, wife have mild symptomsMeanwhile, the United States has confirmed its first case of Omicron variant in a traveller who has recently returned from South Africa.

What we know so far||The United States has announced its first confirmed case of Omicron, the new variant of Covid, in a traveller who has recently returned from South Africa. This is the first known case of the new variant, first identified by South African scientists, in the US, as several reports now suggest that the variant was present in Europe before South Africa reported the first case. Much about the new variant is not known yet, but its emergence has created fresh apprehension across the world with most of the countries putting travel restrictions.Here is what we know about US' 1st Omicron case:1. The traveller was fully vaccinated against Covid but did not receive any booster dose.2. The person returned from South Africa on November 22. All his contacts have tested negative.3. The person tested positive on November 29 and was in self-quarantine.4. At present, the patient is recovering from the symptoms.

If the test report comes negative, the traveller or returnee will have to remain under seven-day home quarantine mandatorily and again undergo another round of Covid-19 test on the eighth day, Even though all the returnees have been directed to carry Covid negative certificates while travelling, they still have been advised to undergo quarantine for a period of seven days,” said Mishra.Mishra said the details of these travellers have been shared with respective district administrations for follow-up action.Bijay Panigrahi, director, Health and Family Welfare said the total number of Covid-19 vaccines administered in Odisha has reached 4.38 crore.“Odisha had set a target of completing 90% vaccination as per Centre’s ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ or the door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination campaign but managed to reach only 86% so far. We hope the remaining 4% of people will get the dose in December. Our efforts are on to achieve 100% vaccination or to ensure that all are administered with the first dose by the end of December,” said Panigrahi.The state has increased the number of vaccination centres at the village level and teams are visiting villages to provide mobile vaccination facilities. But 46 lakh people are yet to take the first dose of Covid while 31 lakh people are yet to take the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/undergo-7-day-quarantine-odisha-tells-380-residents-who-returned-from-at-risk-countries-101638469782030.html

In an interview with Harinder Baweja, he speaks about the surgical strikes, the Mumbai attacks, and the UPA and NDA’s handling of security issues. Edited excerpts: You write in the book that the country does not have a national security doctrine. The Modi government certainly believes it does -- It has authored two surgical strikes against Pakistan.  Substantive changes have taken place over the last two decades, and India is now not only looking at how to deal with hijackings and non-state actors. If you look at what the PLA is doing, and the increased weaponisation of the cyber domain, it is clear that India is dealing with new challenges on the security front; challenges we still don’t have a response to. Vis-a-vis Pakistan, the optics suggests that the government has been aggressive but the hard question it should ask itself is: Has there been a change in Pakistan’s strategy to use non-state actors? The answer is, no. You have looked at flashpoints over 20 years. Who has fared better on the security front: UPA or NDA?The challenges are of the same order. In the case of Pakistan, the Modi-led NDA did initiate forward-leaning measures through the Uri and Balakot strikes but the jury is still out on whether Pakistan has changed its behaviour; whether it has stopped deploying non-state actors. Both NDA and UPA have tried to manage the challenges from Pakistan and China in different ways. In terms of trying to get peace, neither has succeeded. To be more precise, who has handled national security better, Modi or Manmohan Singh? To me, the proof of the pudding lies in the eating. I have raised the question of why there was no kinetic response by the Manmohan Singh government after the barbaric Mumbai attacks in 2008. Yes, the Modi government attempted surgical strikes but did the strikes alter Pakistan’s behaviour? The other important question is: Was the Modi government trying to address a domestic audience or trying to bring about a qualitative change in the security situation? To my mind, the Modi government has fallen between these two stools.Are you saying then that the Uri and Balakot strikes were aimed at the domestic audience?The Pulwama attack happened on the cusp of an election. The Kargil war was fought under a caretaker government. For every national security action, there will be domestic repercussions. That cannot be the defining impulse. Did Indira Gandhi create Bangladesh to win an election? No, she just won the election. Nobody accused Vajpayee or Indira Gandhi. Similarly, I would not accuse Modi of doing Balakot for political considerations. The question, and I have raised it earlier, is whether there has been a change in Pakistan’s behavior? The answer is No. You have said, and controversially so, that kinetic action should’ve followed the Mumbai attacks. Did you take up the issue with PM Mammohan Singh or Sonia Gandhi at the time? The UPA stayed in power for six years after and you were the national spokesperson at the time. The 26/11 attacks didn’t happen in isolation. They were a culmination of a nasty proxy war starting with Kargil, terror attacks in Kashmir and the attack on Parliament. 26/11 was a nasty finale to the humiliation meted out in Kargil. On November 28, when the Mumbai attacks were still in progress, when I briefed the media, I had said that we should initiate a kinetic response. I expressed my view as the national spokesman. I was neither in government nor in legislature, at the point and there was no occasion to take it up with the leadership.  Would you have written about kinetic action after 26/11 if you were not part of the 23 leaders that wrote a letter to the Congress President asking for sweeping changes in the party and a full-time President? Is it an attempt at selling the book? It has nothing to do with selling the book. I have been more than fulsome in my praise of Manmohan Singh vis-a-vis his handling of the economy and the nuclear deal. The group of 23 has nothing to do with national security. The reason I wrote this book is because there is not enough discussion and debate about national security and we think it can simply be left to some strategic experts. Is the book an attempt to cozy up to the BJP? There is no question of leaving the Congress party. I have been a Congressman for the last 40 years. In the book, I have been far more critical of the BJP’s handling of national security issues.India’s relations with China have deteriorated...The UPA government under Manmohan Singh maintained a modicum of stability with China. Intrusions in 2013 in Depsang were cleared within 13 days. Relations with China, under Modi, have steadily gone downhill, Modi has failed the China test. We lost 20 soldiers in Galwan and the downhill (slide) continues. That’s the reason why I say that Modi has failed the China test. In the book, you raise the question of why non-conventional means not been actively explored. What are you hinting at? As a democracy, there is a dilemma in the echelons of power, when it comes to hitting out at the fountainheads of terror… You mean Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar? You mean, target them, like the US did Osama bin Laden?Yes. The reason we have not gone down that street is because of the ethical dilemma and how that would be perceived internationally. So, in Uri and in Balakot, India’s response was aimed at the larger Pakistani state rather than the kingpins of the terror strike. 26/11 was a watershed in the sheer barbarity of the attack. It has few parallels. That’s why I have argued that there should have been a kinetic response. To end, what’s the way forward on the national security front? To quote from your book -- nuclear tests have not brought strategic windfall, coercive diplomacy has not entirely worked, nor have friendly overtures. The way forward is two-fold: a well articulated security doctrine and a policy that goes beyond partisan lines. Right now, we are not even willing to debate China in Parliament.

Arunachal Pradesh shares borders with China and Myanmar from where illegal migration of population has been taking place since Independence,” said Suhas Chakma of CDFI in a statement. “Further illegal immigration and settlement of people without Inner Line Permit has been taking place regularly and their settlements are visible in most parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Yet, the state government is targeting only Chakmas and Hajongs in clear violations of the Constitution of India,” he added. Authorities at Changlang district in southeastern Arunachal Pradesh, where this census is supposed to take place, have, however, said that there is no immediate plan for such an exercise and the issue is just at a proposal stage.“The move is just at a proposal stage now and nothing has materialised yet. An unnecessary controversy is being created. Before starting any such exercise, we will take all stakeholders into confidence,” Devansh Yadav, deputy commissioner of Changlang, said. “Similar exercises have happened in 2010 and 2015 as well. While local Chakma and Hajong groups don’t seem to have any issue, organisations based outside Arunachal Pradesh seem more bothered. As of now, no census will take place in December and in the near future,” he added.On November 26, Changlang district issued a letter to officials at Miao, Bordumsa, Kharsang and Diyun circles of the district for a “special census” to be conducted in all the Chakma and Hajong inhabited areas of Arunachal Pradesh.The letter reportedly asked officials in the four circles to finalise names of supervisors and enumerators by December 10 so that survey work can be completed by December 20 and the census report submitted to the state government on or before December 31. Chakmas and Hajongs, who are Buddhists and Hindus respectively, migrated to India between 1964 and 1966 from Chittagong Hills Tract (CHT) of then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to escape religious persecution and were settled in North East Frontier Agency (NEFA), present Arunachal Pradesh.The migrants were settled with a rehabilitation plan, allotted land and provided with financial assistance depending on the size of their families to help rebuild their lives. As per the 2011 census, there are 47,471 Chakmas and Hajongs in Arunachal Pradesh.

As many as 28 samples collected from both airport as well as field surveillance have been sent for genome sequencing. “Out of these, 25 are of international travellers and three belong to their close contacts,” ANI reported, citing the health department.Until Thursday morning, a total of 861 international passengers have been tested with RT-PCR in Maharashtra to find out if they are infected with Covid-19.Field surveillance of all int'l passengers who have arrived since 1st Nov is underway. A total of 28 samples from both airport & field surveillance have been sent for genome sequencing. Out of these 28, 25 are international travellers & 3 their close contacts: Public Health DeptThis development comes on the day India reported its first cases of Omicron Covid-19 variant, after two people tested positive for the newest strain. Two men, aged 66 and 46, tested for the Omicron variant in Karnataka, with state health minister Dr K Sudhakar informing that the 66-year-old man is a South African national, who has already returned to his homeland.Following the detection of the cases of Omicron Covid-19 variant in India, the country has now joined a list of 30 other nations, which have so far confirmed the presence of the strain.

Some countries have stopped flights from that region or countries they define vis-a-vis Omicron, We haven’t done that. We have instead intensified surveillance mechanisms and protocols for those who happen to come from at-risk countries and not just limited to Omicron,” he said. Travellers from at-risk countries have to take RT-PCR tests on arrival and undergo seven-day home quarantine. There are 11 entries on the list of at-risk countries, which were identified on the basis of facts and evidence from health and regulatory authorities. The list existed prior to the identification of the Omicron variant and it is based on the incidence profile of Covid-19 in those countries. The list includes all countries in Europe, including the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Israel. India, Bagchi said, has offered to provide medical supplies and vaccines to African countries and also cleared all requests for assistance from that region. “We stand ready to supply essential life-saving drugs, test kits, PPE kits, medical equipment and ventilators depending on the situation,” he said. India is also willing to look at deeper medical collaboration in areas such as genomic surveillance if any country in Africa makes such a request, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-new-travel-curbs-yet-says-mea-after-2-test-positive-for-omicron-in-bengaluru-101638467081869.html

The response measures for all variants, including Omicron, is the same as those for SARS-CoV-2.”Dr Singh said that comprehensive, tailored public health and social measures by governments, and strict adherence to preventive and precautionary measures by individuals, is a must.“People must wear well-fitting mask which covers their nose and mouth well, keep distance, avoid poorly ventilated or crowded spaces, keep hands clean, cover cough and sneeze and get vaccinated,” she said. “And continue to take all precautionary measures even after getting vaccinated. All travellers must adhere to public health and social measures at all times and remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of Covid-19.”The WHO regional director pointed out that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has a large of mutations, some of which are “concerning”. “Researchers around the world are conducting studies to better understand the transmissibility, severity and immune escape capabilities of Omicron,” she said. “WHO commends countries which have been able to quickly detect and report cases of the new Variant of Concern.”The Union health ministry on Thursday confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Two men from Karnataka, aged 66 and 46, tested positive for the variant on Wednesday, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary at the Union health ministry told reporters at a press briefing. The health ministry official also gave other information about the Omicron, which since its detection in southern Africa on November 24, has spread to 30 countries (India included).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-alert-who-south-east-regional-director-advises-increased-surveillance-101638463227607.html
02-12-2021||India||Instead of travel bans, India is keeping ‘watch’ on ‘at risk’ nations: MEA as Omicron reaches country||Following the detection of Omicron Covid-19 variant in India, the Centre on Thursday said unlike several countries, India is keeping a “watch” on ‘at-risk’ nations and not imposing travel bans of flights from such regions.Addressing a weekly media briefing, ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that the situation pertaining to the discovery of Omicron Covid-19 variant is “evolving” and at the moment, India has “increased surveillance and protocols like testing and mandatory home quarantine,” instead of travel bans.Talking about the ‘at-risk’ countries, Bagchi said that the list is decided technically and is “not entirely” based on the Omicron situation as it was prepared prior to the Covid-19 variant’s emergence.The MEA spokesperson pointed out that India is “ready” to supply medical tools, and also offer cooperative and collaboration to any nation amid the Omicron Covid-19 variant’s threat, if one comes forward with such a request.Notably, India implemented revised travel guidelines starting December 1. According to these, all travellers arriving from ‘at risk’ countries have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR testing upon arrival at the airport. If the result comes back as negative, he or she must compulsorily go through a seven-day quarantine period and take a retest on the eighth day. On the other hand, if the RT-PCR test report turns out to be positive, the sample will be sent for genome testing for detecting Omicron and the person will be treated at a separate isolation facility.Also Read | Don’t delay getting fully vaccinated: Centre after Omicron cases found in IndiaFor passengers coming from other non ‘at-risk’ nations, a random 2% of them will be selected for undergoing RT-PCR testing. If found negative, they will be have to self-monitor their health for 14 days and if the RT-PCR test report comes back as positive, the sample will be sent for genome testing to detect Omicron Covid-19 variant’s presence.Last month, India had expressed solidarity with the countries, especially in southern Africa, where Omicron Covid-19 variant cases have been confirmed. Earlier in the day, India also joined the list after two men aged 66 and 46 were found to be infected with the strain in Karnataka. Notably, the Omicron variant has been classified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation.At a press briefing earlier in the day, joint secretary of Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said that both the patients in Karnataka have mild symptoms. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar later informed media persons that as many as five contacts of the 46-year-old Omicron patient, who is a doctor, have been found to be Covid-19 positive.“A total of six people (including the doctor himself) have been isolated, [and] admitted to government hospital. None of them [are] showing serious symptoms.

02-12-2021||India||Attention invested has led to very impressive outcomes: Jaishankar on UAE||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has emerged as one of India’s key partners in the extended neighbourhood as it very important for the country’s national security and is home to a large number of Indian expatriates, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. “This is certainly a relationship where...all the attention that we have invested, and they have invested, it has been repaid in very, very impressive outcomes,” Jaishankar said during a virtual conversation at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. In recent years, the Indian government has assiduously courted several key players in West Asia, including the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar, even as it has built up its strategic relationship with Israel. Efforts have been made to diversify relations with these countries from the traditional field of energy by adding new areas of cooperation. The UAE is home to more three million Indian expatriates, the largest ethnic community in the emirates comprising professionals and blue-collar workers and their families. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the UAE in 2015 was the first by an Indian premier in 34 years, following a trip by Indira Gandhi in 1981. Jaishankar, who will travel to the UAE on December 4, said the country is important because it is a very big energy partner, has a large Indian expatriate population and a lot of offshore finance and business is done there. However, he noted that the UAE had “seriously suffered from a want of political attention” since the 1980s. He described it as one of the key countries in the extended neighbourhood, and said it is “enormously important” for national security, hugely relevant for economic growth, and is also extremely active in the international scene. The India-UAE relationship is a good example of the kind of things that have changed in the last few years, with New Delhi becoming more clear-headed about its priorities and the countries it should engage with to advance its interests, he said. Jaishankar added that the Abraham Accords signed by Israel and key Arab states such as the UAE had opened up possibilities in connectivity, logistics, trade, technology, innovation and agriculture. Instead of having only three separate relationships with countries such as the US, Israel and the UAE, India could also work with them through a collective to add an additional layer to do many more things, he said. West Asia is an example of the complex world that India operates in, and also how the country deals with partners with contradictory interests, he added. 
02-12-2021||India||‘Can’t have great relations with high friction border’: Jaishankar on China ties at HTLS 2021||NEW DELHI: India and China cannot simultaneously have a “tense, high friction border” and great relations in all other spheres, especially after Beijing violated clear cut commitments in two agreements on not massing forces on the frontier, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday.Participating in a virtual conversation at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Jaishankar listed India’s three top foreign policy priorities as focusing on countries in the extended neighbourhood, including Central and West Asia, good relations with big powers shaping the world order to advance the country’s interests, and developing a larger footprint for India.The challenges related to Afghanistan outlined in UN Security Council resolution 2593, which was passed two weeks after the Taliban takeover in mid-August, continue to be “live concerns” and justify the prudence displayed by India, which has been very careful in its assessments regarding the war-torn country, he said during a wide-ranging discussion.Jaishankar said two agreements with China contained no ambiguity on the issue of bringing forces to the border, as everything was laid down in “cold print”. He added, “There were very, very clear cut commitments not to mass forces on the border and those commitments stand violated as of 2020 spring.”He was referring to the standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which began in May 2020. Bilateral relations are yet to recover from the fallout of a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June last year that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops. Both sides have deployed some 50,000 troops each in the sector and several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have not led to disengagement at all the friction points.Jaishankar said: “And as we have made clear – the state of the relationship, at the end of the day, will reflect the state of the border. You can’t have a tense, high friction border and have great relations in all other parts of life. It doesn’t work that way.”It was inevitable that the standoff has “already spilt over into other domains and the expectation that somehow we will contain it in a narrow sense and carry on with the rest of life, I think, is not a realistic one”, he added.“We do have a significant issue there for us, and also for them because I frankly don’t think it’s in the interest of either country that our relationship goes off in this direction,” Jaishankar said.The Chinese side attempted to “unilaterally change the status quo or to violate the LAC”, and troops from both sides were “sometimes uncomfortably closely deployed”. With the standoff in Ladakh continuing for close to two years, there are now question marks against the assumptions, understandings and agreements which guided the management of border areas, he added.Asked about his foreign policy priorities, the foreign secretary-turned-minister said in geographic terms, these are the extended neighbourhood, including the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, West Asia and Central Asia, having good relations with the big powers which shape the global order “so that we are treated well and our interests are recognised and advanced”, and steadily developing a larger footprint through more relationships in order to have global visibility.In terms of issues, Jaishankar listed his number one priority as national security, which he put above all considerations in diplomacy as the stakes are very high. He contended that the country “sometimes got confused” on this issue in the past, such as during the 1960s, when the leadership didn’t put the necessary emphasis on security.He listed the two other priorities in terms of issues as economic development and national progress, where India could learn from East and Southeast Asia on using foreign policy to acquire capital and technology, and advancing the standing of the country.While speaking about the situation in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said UN Security Council resolution 2593, passed two weeks after the Taliban takeover, was an “expression of a widespread concern in the world on a set of issues, the most prominent of which was would Afghan soil be used by terrorists [and] foreign fighters to target other countries”.The resolution also addresses issues such as the nature of the regime in Kabul and whether it would be inclusive, and the nature of governance, including the treatment of women, children and minorities, and freedom of movement for Afghans.“I would say a lot of those concerns...remain live concerns,” Jaishankar said. The situation on the ground is complicated and justifies the prudence that India has shown. India has not been in a hurry, it has been deliberative about choices and careful about assessments, while at the same time not being led by arguments made by others, he said.There is also consensus on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan about not “staying away or being indifferent or unhelpful”. He said the consensus is that “however difficult the politics of the situation may be...we have to do something [for the Afghan people]”.India has helped previous regimes in Afghanistan, and it has offered to send 50,000 tonnes of wheat for the Afghan people. The country is seeking unhindered access to Afghanistan and ia trying to find a way the relief supplies are distributed in a responsible and fair manner, he said, without referring to conditions attached by Pakistan for the shipment of the aid.Jaishankar also indicated that the LAC standoff with China was not a “causal factor” for India’s participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which includes Australia, Japan and the US. He noted that the Quad, in its current incarnation started in September 2017, whereas the current difficulties on the LAC began in 2020.It is important for India as a Quad participant “to be very clear that the Quad is for something, it is not against somebody”, he pointed out. Quad’s efforts are focused on issues such as Covid-19 vaccines, developing more trusted and secure technologies, promoting reliable and resilient supply chains, connectivity projects, and ensuring maritime security and safety.Since no single country can respond to the contemporary big challenges, groups of countries with similar interests and concerns were coming together, he said. In this context, he referred to India’s four-way cooperation with the United Arab Emirates, Israel and the US.These are “combos of countries” that are not interested in a formal relationship and wanting no “detailed obligations or responsibilities”. Instead, they want a practical arrangement to work together to their mutual advantage through “ad hoc, open minded, open ended and comfortable” mechanisms, Jaishankar said.Asked about India’s participation in The Summit of Democracy to be hosted by the US during December 9-10, Jaishankar said he is “very confident” about the state of Indian democracy since elections and the electoral process are not in doubt, popular participation in elections is rising, and all indexes of “how democratised India has become” are growing.“In a way, in the very success lies a problem because to a large extent it has brought to the political forefront a different set of players, people who are not from big cities or from English medium schools,” he said, adding many of these players are self-made and this has led to a “political argumentation between the old order and emerging order within the country”.“Because the world is globalised, the world is polarised and the world is very ideological, a lot of this translates into people being judgemental [and saying] your democracy is not working well, largely because it’s not about people like us anymore,” he added.

Priyanka Gandhi said the Congress will give 2 million jobs and said that every district will have a manufacturing hub.“Congress will contest elections on the basis of development. Will provide 20 lakh jobs. Manufacturing hubs will open in every district,” Priyanka was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. She was addressing the Pratigya Rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad.She also slammed the Prime Minister and said that he did not show respect towards the farmers who died during the agitation against the now-repealed legislations that were introduced in Parliament’s Monsoon Session in 2020.“The PM didn't pay any respect to farmers who died in agitation against farm laws. It will take only ₹4,000 crore for clearing all dues of sugarcane farmers. Modi bought private aircraft for ₹8,000 crore last year amid Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre is paying ₹20,000 crore for beautification of Parliament but doesn't have the money to clear your dues,” Priyanka said attacking the Centre and the Yogi-led government.Priyanka Gandhi also criticized the government over the issue of farmers’ struggling to get access to fertilizers ahead of winter sowing season. Farmers from different parts of the country have alleged that they are having to buy key crop nutrients, especially DAP (diammonium phosphate) and muriate of potash (MPO), have hit a five-year low, at higher prices, according to a HT report. The DAP is an essential nutrient for the winter-sown wheat. Another report by HT also said that one farmer died as he was waiting in a queue to procure fertiliser in Uttar Pradesh’s Lalitpur earlier in October.“Farmers are committing suicide due to acute shortage of fertilizers. I met family members of two deceased farmers. We will buy paddy and wheat from farmers at ₹2500 per quintal, and sugarcane at ₹400 per quintal. We will waive loans of farmers,” Priyanka further added.--||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-polls-priyanka-assures-waiver-of-farm-loan-dues-for-sugarcane-farmers-101638459507629.html

02-12-2021||India||Maharashtra amends travel rules for international passengers after Centre's objection. Check details||The Maharashtra government on Thursday issued a set of fresh guidelines for international passengers arriving in the state amid concerns over Coronavirus' new variant, Omicron.The revised guidelines came a day after the Centre wrote to the state saying its order on travel rules was in divergence with the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.Responding to the same, the Maharashtra government today amended its air travel rules making seven-day institutional quarantine mandatory for passengers from only three countries -- South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe.However, categorisation of 'high-risk countries" is a dynamic exercise based on the evolving situation of the Omicron variant and hence will be updated as required by Government of Maharashtra, the state government said in its guidelines.#Omicron | Govt of Maharashtra revises its guidelines for passengers arriving in the stateIn the case of domestic air travel, Passengers will either have to be fully vaccinated or compulsorily carry RT-PCR Test certificate showing negative result within 72 hours before boarding pic.twitter.com/svHb56CHe8The state government's November 30 order had made institutional quarantine mandatory for passengers arriving from all `at risk' countries in the central government's list in view of the Omicron variant threat.Besides, the state has removed the rule that mandated negative RT-PCR test reports for fliers coming into Maharashtra from other states. Instead, passengers will either have to be fully vaccinated or carry an RT-PCR negative report within 72 hours before boarding.Notably, the 'at-risk' list issued by the Centre includes a number of countries including, The United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China and Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong among others.The new variant was first detected in South Africa last month, and many countries including, the United Kingdom, the US, Germany, have reported cases of the new strain since. India too confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, identified in two men from Karnataka, on Thursday.The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that most of the cases outside Africa are travel-related even as it expects local transmission in other countries as more information becomes available.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-amends-travel-rules-for-international-passengers-after-centre-s-objection-check-details-101638455883552.html
02-12-2021||India||Parliament passes Dam Safety Bill to prevent disasters||The Parliament on Thursday passed a bill to prevent dam disasters through regular surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance, with Rajya Sabha approving the legislation amid several Opposition parties calling it an assault on federalism and demanding that the bill be sent to the select committee for scrutiny. Lok Sabha had passed the Dam Safety Bill, 2019, which seeks to provide a robust legal and institutional framework for ensuring the safety of dams, in August 2019. The Upper House passed the bill by voice vote even as a motion to send it to the select committee of the house was defeated with 80 lawmakers voting against it and 26 in favour. Responding to a discussion on the bill in which 22 MPs took part, Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat alleviated the concerns of several opposition MPs that the Centre’s intention was to encroach on the powers of state governments, saying the government followed the principle of cooperative federalism in its working. Several parties, including the Congress, Trinamool Congress, DMK, CPI (M) and RJD, accused the government of usurping the powers of state governments as dams were a state subject and the Centre could not make rules for the states. Stressing on the need for a country-wide protocol for dam safety, Shekhawat said the government sought the solicitor general’s advice before bringing the bill and the legal opinion was that the government could legislate on dam safety under the relevant Constitutional provisions.The minister recounted several recent dam disasters and the destruction of lives and property caused by the incidents, adding that the dam safety law was essential to protect the country, its citizens and the riverine ecosystem. The bill addresses issues encompassing regular inspection of dams, emergency action plans, comprehensive dam safety review, instrumentation and safety manuals. It also fixes accountability for dam safety on the dam owner and provides for penal provisions for commission and omission of certain acts. It also lays down owners of dams will have to earmark sufficient funds for maintenance. Earlier taking part in the discussion on the bill, Congress MP Shaktisinh Gohil said the government had no right to legislate on a state subject and the bill was against the provisions of the Constitution. RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha said that the government was always trying to encroach on state subjects and violating the principle of federalism, even as he demanded that bill be sent to the select committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-dam-safety-bill-to-prevent-disasters-101638456100702.html

It was after this meeting that Sardesai announced his plans to ally with the Congress.The GFP show-cause notice asked Salgaocar to explain his silence after a BJP MLA, without naming him, claimed that he will join the BJP.“The Panaji BJP MLA (Atanasio Monserrate) made clear remarks to the media that one of the Goa Forward MLAs who was missing during the trip to Delhi to meet Rahul Gandhi is soon going to embrace the BJP. In spite of this news going viral, there was no denial or clarification from your side,” the notice said.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi’s group photo signals a new Goa alliance. It also hurts the TMCIt added that his conduct during the last few months indicated that he intended to work with the BJP for personal gains and compromise the values and policies of the party. “These repeated acts of yours clearly indicate that you are involved in unpardonable anti-party activities. You are hereby directed to respond to this show cause notice within 24 hours failing which disciplinary action would be initiated against you without any further notice,” the GFP notice to Jayesh Salgaocar, the Saligao legislator, said.Like his party boss, Vijai Sardesai was once part of the Congress before he switched over to the Goa Forward Party ahead of the 2017 goa elections. He defeated Dilip Parulekar, who was the state’s tourism minister in the outgoing Laxmikant Parsekar cabinet.Salgaocar has been widely perceived to have been to exit the Goa Forward Party ahead of next year’s elections.To be sure, Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade claimed that he was “not aware” if any leader is scheduled to join the party. “If there is any announcement to make, we will notify you,” Tanavade said in response to questions about Salgaocar’s entry.Vijai Sardesai’s decision to fight alongside the Congress after his meeting with Rahul Gandhi was a surprise, particularly since he was working to align his party with the Trinamool Congress during West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s visit to the state.To be sure, Sardesai did fight the 2017 elections in partnership with the Congress when his party won three of the four seats it contested. But after the results were out, he negotiated a deal with the BJP that enabled Manohar Parrikar to form the government. In exchange, Sardesai became Goa’s deputy chief minister; his two MLAs also got ministerial berths.The three GFP lawmakers, however, were evicted from the Goa cabinet in July 2019 by chief minister Pramod Sawant after 10 Congress MLAs en masse switched to the BJP, and he did not need the party’s support. Sardesai withdrew support from the Sawant-led government but stayed put in the NDA till April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-forward-mla-who-skipped-meeting-with-rahul-gandhi-may-join-bjp-gets-notice-101638455322204.html
02-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: December 3, 1989 — VP Singh sworn in as 7th PM of India, Devi Lal is Deputy||New Delhi- Mr. Vishwanath Pratap Singh, leader of the National Front Parliamentary Party, was sworn in as the seventh Prime Minister of India by President R. Venkataraman in the Ashoka Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan at 12.15 this afternoon, amidst scenes of wild enthusiasm and much goodwill from all present on the occasion. The new Prime Minister sprang a surprise by naming Mr. Devi Lal, the Haryana Chief Minister, as the Deputy Prime Minister, who was the only other member of the Union Council of Ministers to take oath today (December 2).Both of them took oath in Hindi, with the President first reading the text of the oath in that language, apparently written in the Roman alphabet. The entire assembly at the somewhat small Ashoka Hall, jostling and sweating because of the unprecedented influx of media persons in particular, greeted the two leaders of the new Government with clappings. The ceremony was watched by Vice President Shankar Daval Sharma, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, his erstwhile Cabinet colleagues, National Front chairman N. T Rama Rao, West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, Karnataka Chief Minister Veerendra Patil, BJP leaders Atal Behari Vajpayee and L. K Advani, CPI-M general secretary F M. S. Namboodiripad, CPI general secretary C. Rajeshwar Rao and a large number of leaders of political parties as also newly-elected Members from the non-Congress-I parties. Mrs. Najma Heptullah, Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, was also present. The Prime Minister, who was mobbed by media persons after the ceremony was over in less than 10 minutes, said he would form the Cabinet within two or three days. In reply to another question, he said he would call Parliament before the specified period of 30 days to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha. He did not however, mention any date as such.The swearing in of Mr V. P Singh as the Prime Minister ends the nearly 10-year-long Congress-1 rule at the Centre, which began on Jan. 15, 1980 when the Congress-I party was returned to power with a huge majority in the 1979 December elections, under the leadership of Mrs Indira Gandhi unseating the Janata Party-S Government led by Mr Charan Singh. The 58-year-old Mr Singh, looking younger than his age, was clad in an achkan and pyjama and a Kashmiri cap on his head, a familiar sight in winter. His wife, Mrs Sita Kumari Devi, and son Ajeya Singh accompanied by his wife also watched the ceremony.The National Front Prime Minister put up with the jostling and pushing at the adjacent hall where refreshments were served, but for at Icast one hour after the ceremony, mediapersons went on mobbing him and shooting all sorts of questions which he answered with characteristic grace and candour. Also to be mobbed in the hall were Mr Rajiv Gandhi, Mr Buta Singh Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, Mr L. K. Advani, cinestars Shatrughan Sinha and Raj Babbar, the last two had canvassed extensively for the former Opposition parties.Mr Singh exchanged greetings with Mr Gandhi and leaders of his party and of other friendly parties and spent time with the President and the Vice President as also with BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee. But most of his time was taken up with the mediapersons whom the security staff failed to keep away from the new Prime Minister. Mr V. P Singh is the eighth Prime Minister of India, taking Mrs Gandhi’s continuous terms of 1966-1977 and 1980-84 as two separate regimes. He is the third non-Congress-I Prime Minister, the other two being Mr Morarji Desai, who was in office from March 1977 to July 1979, and Mr Charan Singh, who remained in office from August 1979 to early January 1980. Mr Gulzarilal Nanda had acted as the Prime Minister on two occasions - in May 1964, when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had passed away and again in 1966 when Mr Lal Bahadur Shastri had suddenly died at Tashkent in the Soviet Union on Jan. 11. Incidentally, all these leaders were originally Congressmen and the three non-Congress-I Prime Ministers had left the party or were expelled under various circumstances. Only two of them, Mr Desai and Mr Nanda, were from outside Uttar Pradesh. Mr Singh does not have balmy days awaiting him in the weeks to come. For one thing, his Cabinet is not yet complete and it is still an open question if the parties supporting the National Front Government - the BJP and the Left parties - will join the Government. For another, Punjab problem still stares him in his face, and the price situation too is not something that can be swept under the carpet. Mr Singh is believed to have gone into a conclave with party colleagues to tackle the problem of Cabinet formation, which by all expectations should be completed on Monday. It is not known what surprises he may spring that day like the one he did today by nominating ‘Tau” Devi Lal as the Deputy Prime Minister. It is not known if he would appoint another Deputy Prime Minister too, just as Mr Desai had with him Mr Jagjivan Ram and Mr Charan Singh. The latter had made Mr Yeshwantrao Chavan as the Deputy Prime Minister in the Janata Party-S and Congress-S coalition government which was in office till January 1980. As already mentioned, this is independent India’s first multi-party National Government at the Centre and even with all goodwill for the new government, people at large are apprehensive about this experiment but want it nevertheless to succeed unlike in 1977 when the Morarji Desai Government was brought down by people belonging to his own party. That the task of Mr Singh will be an onerous one was indicated by the absence of Mr Chandra Shekhar from the swearing-m ceremony this afternoon. The “young Turk leader of yesteryears had not been too happy with the election of Mr V. P. Singh as the Prime Minister and he had, it must he admitted, made his views known publicly. That the possibility of the BJP and the Left joining the ministry was still an open issue was indicated by Mr Singh’s reply to one question in the presence of Mr Vajpayce. he told a reporter that the formation of the government had only entered the first stage today, and questions about the second had to be awaited. Mr Vapayee. the popular leader with the media, ducked and stepped backward all smiles when another questioner asked what portfolio the B)P leader would be given when he joined the V. P Singh ministry. The elevation of Mr Devi Lal to the post of Deputy Prime Ministership was seen as an expression of gratitude to him by Mr Singh, but it has its own political compulsion too. One of this b the fact that Mr Chandra Shekhar had proposed the Haryana Chief Minister’s name yesterday for the leadership of the parliamentary party. To that extent, it may be an attempt to mollify Mr Chandra Shekhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-december-3-1989-vp-singh-sworn-in-as-7th-pm-of-india-devi-lal-is-deputy-101638454721333.html

Bhargava pointed out that awareness is “absolutely essential,” but asked people not to panic.The ICMR chief pointed out that not attending as well as organising mass gatherings will help in “breaking the chain of transmission of Omicron.”India has now become the 30th country to have confirmed the presence of Omicron Covid-19 variant, which was first discovered in South Africa last month. Both cases have been detected in Karnataka, with two males aged 66 and 46, testing positive for the variant.The confirmation of Omicron cases in India arrived earlier in the day following genome sequencing results from a laboratory under the INSACOG consortium. Joint secretary of Union health ministry, Lav Agarwal said during the press briefing that all primary and secondary contacts of both the males have been identified and are under isolation.Though the Centre refrained from providing more information about the two positive males from Karnataka, a report by Hindustan Times stated that both had travelled to South Africa.Meanwhile, Dr VK Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog said that the detection of Omicron Covid-19 variant through genome sequencing proves that the existing screening systems are “working well.” However, he sidetracked any discussion on Covid-19 booster shots at the moment, saying that the Centre’s focus is to fully vaccinate all adults in India first.Also Read | Omicron makes its way to India. What we know about the 2 cases from Karnataka“Currently, let’s be very clear, our priority is very clear – complete the task of vaccinating all adults with both doses,” Dr Paul said, adding that “scientific reasoning” for offering Covid-19 booster shots and the nitty-gritties associated with it are “under examination.”Agarwal highlighted that both the patients of Omicron Covid-19 variant in Karnataka have mild symptoms so far, and such is the trend noticed not just in India but in all such cases across the world too. “[The] WHO has said that its emerging evidence is being studied,” he informed the press briefing.Notably, India on Wednesday deferred the resumption of international flights from December 15 onwards in view of the emergence of Omicron Covid-19 variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-delay-getting-fully-vaccinated-centre-after-omicron-cases-found-in-india-101638452288600.html

The two countries had decided during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh in March to commemorate December 6 as Maitri Divas as it was on this day in 1971 that India recognised the new country. This was done 10 days before the liberation of Bangladesh and India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic ties with Bangladesh, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. Besides being commemorated in Dhaka and New Delhi, Maitri Divas will be observed jointly by the two countries through events to be held in Belgium, Canada, Egypt, Indonesia, Russia, Qatar, Singapore, the UK, Australia, France, Japan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the US. A special event will be organised in New Delhi with the participation of both countries, Bagchi said. “The holding of Maitri Divas is a reflection of the deep and abiding friendship between the people of India and Bangladesh that has been forged in blood and shared sacrifices,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-to-observe-maitri-divas-on-december-6-101638453040555.html

At the same time, India continues to be part of discussions on Afghanistan with various countries in different formats, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. Pakistan has linked its decision to allow India to transport the wheat and medicines as humanitarian aid to Afghanistan to the condition that relief materials be moved only by Pakistani trucks. The two sides have been engaged in discussions since last week to find a solution to the impasse in view of the looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. India made the proposal for shipping the wheat and medicines to the Afghan people via Pakistani soil on October 7, and received a response from the Pakistan government only on November 24, Bagchi said. “Since then, we have had discussions with Pakistan on the modalities of this supply. These discussions are ongoing. Let me reiterate our belief that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” he said. The modalities being worked out by the two sides will cover various issues, Bagchi said without going into details. The Indian side is keen on using its own trucks as it wants to ensure the relief materials directly reach the Afghan people without being diverted. The Indian side also envisages the aid will be distributed only through the UN, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Bagchi said the meeting of senior security officials of regional countries, including Iran and Russia, that was hosted by India last month had offered an opportunity for nations with similar perspectives to share views, exchange ideas and “identify from a security perspective what is the way forward” in Afghanistan. “Issues were identified and India continues to be a part of discussions on Afghanistan with various countries in different formats,” he added. India and the world community’s expectations regarding Afghanistan are clearly outlined in UN Security Council resolution 2593, he said. This resolution, adopted in August, states that efforts should be made to form an inclusive government in Kabul and that Afghan soil should not be used to plan or execute terror attacks against any country.

She made the statement during her three-day visit to Maharashtra's capital city during which she planned meetings with leaders of the NCP and Shiv Sena.Notably, the Trinamool Congress was once part of the UPA or United Progressive Alliance, an alliance of several parties including Congress that remained in power at the Centre for 10 years from 2004 to 2014 when the BJP came to power.Mamata has been continuously pitching for a strong alternative at the national level to take on the BJP, but indirectly attacking Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modis-informer-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-slams-mamata-after-there-is-no-upa-barb-101638449589046.html

Recently, we launched the Uttarakhand ki awaaz (Uttarakhand’s voice) campaign to crowdsource ideas for the party’s election manifesto. We are also creating WhatsApp groups for all the proposed candidates and reaching out to people in each constituency through these groups,” he said.Over the past few months, Lal has been associated with the political strategy for Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh election. Prior to that, he also was part of the campaign strategy team for the Janata Dal (United) for the Bihar elections in November last year, a person aware of the matter said.

This Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions Jitendra Singh said this in the Rajya Sabha today on behalf of the Centre.He also said that a new nuclear project, the first in northern India, will come up 150 kilometres away from Delhi, in Haryana's Gorakhpur."By 2024 you will have nine nuclear reactors plus 12 new additional ones which were approved during the Covid times with a capacity of 9000 MW. Five new sites are also being identified in different parts of the country," the minister said.He was replying to the supplementary questions during the Question Hour.Asked whether the government is thinking of phasing out nuclear power plants on account of safety, the minister said, "We have not only increased the number but are also trying to make a pan-India generation project."The minister said that nuclear energy will soon emerge as one of the most important sources of alternative or clean energy for the increasing power demand of the country.Singh said it was during the tenure of this government that a bulk approval of 10 indigenous reactors was done in a single cabinet decision, which is a record in itself and has never happened in the history of independent India.On the expansion of Kudankulan nuclear plant, the minister said that "hopefully in 2021, we plan to start the construction of unit 5 and unit 6 as well."India is counting on its nuclear program to help meet its Paris climate commitments to reduce the emissions intensity of its economy by a third from 2005 levels by 2030.India has 6.8 gigawatts of existing nuclear generation capacity, which accounts for roughly 2 per cent of the nation’s total capacity. Coal-fired generation makes up about 53 per cent of India’s installed base, although its share has been declining in favour of cleaner generation and renewable power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-have-nine-nuclear-reactors-by-2024-govt-informs-rajya-sabha-101638446023319.html

They are the country’s first cases of the new variant of concern.“Two cases of Omicron have been found positive: a 66-year-old male, and a 46-year-old male. We got the results very late last night,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary at the union ministry of health and family welfare, told reporters. “All primary and secondary contacts have been identified and are under isolation.”The confirmation came after genome sequencing results returned from a laboratory under the INSACOG.While Agarwal refused to divulge any more details about the two positive cases, it is learnt that both men had travelled to South Africa where the new variant of concern (VOC) was first identified.“The detection of Omicron demonstrates that the screening systems are there and the systems are working well. As for the clinical implications or severity of the variant, it is still being studied,” said Vinod Paul, member (health) at NITI Aayog.The World Health Organization (WHO) labelled Omicron a VOC last Friday, and the UN health body suggested that preliminary evidence found an increased risk of re-infection with this variant, as compared to other variants of concern.The new variant is known to be heavily mutated, with up to 30 mutations observed in the spike protein.The number of people testing positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has been rising fast across the world after it was first detected in South Africa.

The MPs said that dams are a state government subject and the Centre cannot make rules for the state. Several MPs from parties like Trinamool Congress (TMC), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress said that the state government takes care of the safety of the dams and maintains them.“Tamil Nadu faced many problems regarding the sharing of water. We have to seek the refuge of the Court. We have certain problems and the Centre did not come to our support. You should not be bothered about dams but water, we are the owners of the dam and it is our concern. Do not follow Article 252 but also the consent of all states,” DMK’s TKS Elangovan said in the Rajya Sabha.Elangovan was referring to the water sharing woes faced by Tamil Nadu, Speaking of Article 252, which allows the Parliament to bring legislation on subjects in State List if two or more states pass a resolution requiring a law, he said power of states also should be taken into consideration, since state governments are also elected . He also pointed out that the Article 17 allows states to make laws on issues of water supply, irrigation and canals, drainage, water storage and water power.TMC’s Nadimul Haque, Congress’ Shaktisinh Gohil and Biju Janata Dal’s Acharya Prasanna also echoed similar concerns. Prasanna also said that Odisha has several committees to do safety checks on dams. He said that state governments should be allowed to function independently.YSR Congress' Vjiaysai Reddy supported the bill and said that Andhra Pradesh does not get fair share of water the state is entitled to. “This adjudicating mechanism is necessary for giving justice to states,” Reddy said.Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said 90% of India’s dams are built on inter-state rivers. He explained that when water is released by states then states downstream are affected due to this. “There have been several efforts undertaken to ensure a national body on dams has been constituted since the last 40 years. The Centre is trying to ensure that the body is constituted to ensure dam safety,” Shekhawat said. The ruling party also highlighted that the bill was first introduced by the Congress in 2010.The Dam Safety Bill, 2021 proposes constitution of National Committee on Dam Safety and National Dam Safety Authority. The National Committee on Dam Safety will form policies and recommend regulations to the National Dam Safety Authority.The National Dam Safety Authority implements the policies advised to it. It will also constitute two state bodies -- State Committee on Dam Safety and State Dam Safety Authority -- if the legislation is passed. The state committees’ functions are restricted at state level and are akin to those of national committees. The Centre, can however, amend the functions of these state committees through a notification, if and when it deems necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dam-safety-bill-2021-opposition-mps-want-bill-to-be-sent-to-select-committee-101638441979749.html

Kishor held a series of meetings with the Congress leadership. In the spring of 2020, he first met Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Kishor, who is credited with helping chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) return to power for a third time this summer, is believed to have engineered a series of defections from the Congress to West Bengal’s ruling party.Watch: BJP slams at Mamata for ‘insulting national anthem’; complaint filed in MumbaiHis attack on the Congress came a day after Banerjee said there was no United Progressive Alliance (UPA) left and called for unifying the Opposition parties to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Banerjee did not name the Congress, but said if a party is afraid and its leaders are absent from the field, the BJP will “bowl you out”. “What is (Congress-led) UPA? There is no UPA,” Banerjee told reporters after meeting Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. On Tuesday, she met leaders of the Shiv Sena, the biggest constituent of Maharashtra’s ruling alliance that includes the NCP and the Congress.In October, Kishor put out a cryptic statement about the Congress’s response to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri after the violence there. The violence was triggered after a convoy, including a car belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra, rammed into a group of protesting farmers, and left eight people dead.“People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP (Grand Old Party or Congress)-led opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting themselves up for a big disappointment. Unfortunately, there are no quick fix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of GOP,’’ tweeted Kishor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kishor-slams-congress-says-opposition-leadership-not-anybody-s-divine-right-101638440002566.html
02-12-2021||India||Govt once again forgetting devastation caused by second wave, says Cong’s Gogoi||Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi on Thursday said that certain MPs of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are forgetting the devastation caused by the second wave of Covid-19 earlier this year.“The Prime Minister asked the nation to remain vigilant regarding Covid-19. Other MPs of the BJP also need to ask citizens to remain vigilant and follow Covid-19 preventive measures. Earlier this year, on several forums the government declared victory over Covid-19 and it was months before the Covid-19’s second wave which caused large numbers of deaths and forced us to ask foreign nations for ventilators and equipment for oxygen generation,” the parliamentarian from Assam said.He said that the government imposed taxes on petrol, GST on several items, increased the price of LPG and taxed the poor while claiming that certain MPs of the ruling party said that it is providing the vaccines for free in an apparent reference to BJP's Dibrugarh MP Rameswar Teli saying back in October that the government procured vaccines using the tax imposed on petrol and diesel. The government, however, reduced taxes on petrol on the eve of Diwali. He said the government should have announced more economic relief as the second wave led to job losses and pay cuts.Gogoi inquired regarding the status of Covid-19 vaccine’s second dose and also sought clarification on the real number of deaths caused during the pandemic. Speaking on the vaccination drive, he said that vaccination records should not be only touched during events like Modi's birthday. “Citing Assam’s vaccination data, I can say that vaccination records rose leading to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday and it fell days after that and it was also low days before the event,” Gogoi said. He also disapproved of the usage of the Prime Minister's photos on vaccination certificates.He said that the government should own up to the mistakes it made. “Do not accuse us for the achievements you have failed to achieve. The government should take credit for the objectives it has achieved but also take ownership of the failure,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-once-again-forgetting-devastation-caused-by-second-wave-says-cong-s-gogoi-101638439403900.html

However, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is working on a project of FRT-based Biometric Boarding System as part of the first phase of Digi Yatra Implementation at four Airports (Varanasi, Pune, Kolkata, and Vijayawada).He added that the proposed Digi Yatra Central Eco-system is planned to go live in March 2022. It is to be scaled up in a phased manner for adoption across various airports of the country.On being asked about the safeguards taken by the Government to prevent the leakage of passenger data, he said that as per the Digi Yatra policy, registering for the Digi Yatra Central Ecosystem is optional to the passenger. For availing of the Digi Yatra services, passengers would send the travel details (Pax details, PNR and Facial Biometrics) through an app to the Biometric Boarding System of the respective departing airport.Moreover, if for a particular journey, the passenger does not want to avail of the Digi Yatra services then the passenger has an option to not send the data and use the existing manual process at airports."The Digi Yatra Central Ecosystem envisages assessments (by independent teams to assess the level of security and system resilience to protect PII) and periodic audits by governing/regulatory bodies twice every year. Facial recognition is as per Industry ISO standards with best in class National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) listed algorithms complying to Data Privacy and Data protection requirement as laid down by Government," he said.Data shared by the Passenger is to be used for the purpose defined and would not be shared with any other external stakeholders. It is important to note that data shared by passengers is to be retained during the transit of the passenger at the airport and will not be retained for more than 24 hours after Take-off/departure of the flight, he replied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-4-airports-in-india-will-have-facial-recognition-tech-by-march-next-year-101638437659674.html

02-12-2021||India||Prashant Kishor attacks Congress again. This time over 'divine right of leadership'||Election strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday said Congress's leadership is not the divine right of an individual especially when the party has lost more than 90% elections in the last 10 years in a veiled dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. The strategist who was, a few months ago, rumoured to be joining the party did not, however, dismiss the significance of the party in the present political landscape of the country. "The idea and space that Congress represents is vital for a strong opposition," Kishor tweeted. "Let opposition leadership be decided democratically," Prashant Kishor added. The IDEA and SPACE that #Congress represents is vital for a strong opposition. But Congress’ leadership is not the DIVINE RIGHT of an individual especially, when the party has lost more than 90% elections in last 10 years. Let opposition leadership be decided Democratically.The strategist, who is believed to have engineered the recent big-ticket exits from the Congress-- be it former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro or former Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma -- has lately become critical of the Congress leadership. Following the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which protesting farmers were mowed down by the car of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, Prashant Kishor said Congress was attempting to gain ground overnight over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. "People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP led opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting themselves up for a big disappointment. Unfortunately, there are no quick-fix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of GOP," Prashant Kishor had tweeted.The criticism of the Congress comes a day after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee questioned the existence of the UPA, creating a stir in the power corridors. "A firm alternative course should be made as nobody's fighting against ongoing fascism. Sharad Ji is the senior-most leader and I came to discuss our political parties. I agree with whatever Sharad Ji said. There is no UPA," Banerjee said after meeting Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai.Mamata Banerjee, who is advised by Prashant Kishor, took a jibe at Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday as she said one needs to be constant in politics. "You can't be abroad most of the time," she said.In another prediction, the strategist recently said the BJP will remain powerful for decades. “The BJP is going to be in the centre of Indian politics, whether they win, whether they lose - like it was for the first 40 years for the Congress. The BJP is going nowhere. Once you secure 30% vote at the India level, you are not going away in a hurry,” Prashant Kishore said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leadership-not-divine-right-prashant-kishor-s-veiled-dig-at-rahul-101638432683931.html

The decision comes after the chief justice of India, NV Ramana, rapped the Delhi government on reopening schools amid the threatening levels of pollution. Noting that while elders are allowed to work from home, the Supreme Court bench asked the government why the children are being exposed to the health hazard.“We had reopened schools considering the forecast that air quality would improve. However, the air pollution levels have increased again and we have decided to shut schools from Friday till further orders,” Gopal Rai said. Advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, informed the Supreme Court that sending their children to schools to attend physical classes is voluntary and if the apex court wants, the government can suspend offline classes. "Don't use our shoulder. You are the government, you have to take action. You are saying whoever wants to come, come; you want to stay at home, stay. If you give an option, everyone will come, who wants to stay at home," the CJI said."We take your statements in court seriously and true. One thing you told was schools are closed. But schools are not closed. Small children have to go in morning in fog. There’s no respect? See today’s paper. Children are going. I know children who are going to school. Don’t attract orders. Everything we need not tell you. We respect you. So elders have work from home and children have to go to school?" Chief Justice NV Ramana said hearing a case related to Delhi's air pollution.The pollution levels in Delhi worsened on Thursday as air quality went into the severe category from Wednesday's 'very poor'. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’ (CPCB) website, the hourly air quality index (AQI)) of Delhi stood at 416 at 7 am on Thursday. The average 24-hour AQI of the city on Wednesday was 370.The Supreme Court had earlier suggested a lockdown to address the issue of health hazards arising out of increasing levels of pollution in the capital. In the middle of November, the Delhi government announced the closure of physical classes and asked offices to work from home. Construction activities were also suspended. After being shut for a brief period, schools resumed physical classes from November 29, as teh air quality saw a little improvement in between.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-suspends-physical-classes-once-again-owing-to-pollution-after-sc-snub-101638430997941.html

02-12-2021||India||‘Talk it out’: Venkaiah Naidu’s advice to govt, Oppn on deadlock over suspension||NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday urged the government and the Opposition to find a way to end the stalemate over the suspension of 12 members of the House. After the House passed a resolution on Monday moved by the government to suspend the members for “unruly behaviour” on the last day of the Monsoon Session, Opposition lawmakers have been protesting against the decision.“It is human to err and it is also human to make amends. One cannot refuse to amend and insist on glossing over the wrongdoings….I urge both the sides of this august House to talk it out and let the House do its mandated job,” Naidu said.Rajya Sabha has been unable to transact business since the beginning of the Winter Session on Monday due to disruptions by the Opposition over the suspension of 12 members for “unruly behaviour” on August 11 in the House.Also Read: Parliament winter session: Opposition plans to continue protest in Rajya Sabha for a weekAs Opposition members continued to raise the demand for allowing Mallikarjun Kharge, the Leader of the Opposition, to raise the issue, Naidu reiterated that the members had “not expressed remorse.”“This is the fourth sitting of the first session of this august House in the 75th year of our hard-fought Independence. The House could not transact any business during the last three days,” he said. Even as the Opposition members kept pushing for Kharge to be given a chance to speak, Naidu said, “…Since I cannot go public with my anguish in any other way, the only platform to share my anguish and thoughts is to speak in the House. Some of the respected leaders and members of this august House, in their wisdom, chose to describe the suspension of 12 members as ‘undemocratic’. I have struggled to understand if there was any justification in that kind of a narrative being propagated but could not.”The opposition parties have closed ranks and called the suspension unfair. They have maintained the members were suspended without following proper procedure. The government has stuck to its stand that the action will be reconsidered only when the suspended members apologise in the House.“While calling this suspension as undemocratic both within and outside the House, not even a word is being said about the reasons given for the suspension, the disdainful conduct of some members during the last session, which I have categorically called as ‘acts of sacrilege’ on the last day of the last session,” Naidu said. “…I am deeply pained to know from media reports of categorical refusals to express any regret for the acts of misconduct during the last session that led to this round of suspensions. Then what is the way forward?”

By Thursday morning, the stranded vessel was towed to port by Coast Guard ship Samarth.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-on-stranded-ship-off-lakshadweep-brought-down-all-passengers-crew-safe-101638429232056.html

02-12-2021||India||'Only helping the ruling party:' Mallikarjun Kharge on Mamata Banerjee's 'what is UPA' remark||The Congress on Thursday hit out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after she said that United Progressive Alliance (UPA) does not exist. Criticising the Trinamool Congress supremo, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, as reported by news agency ANI, said, "Some people are only helping the ruling party at the Centre.""Mamata Banerjee is absolutely wrong that the UPA does not exist," Kharge said adding, "Congress is raising every issue and is fighting everywhere." "Our aim is to defeat the BJP but some people are helping that party only. Congress is in power in many states and also in Opposition in some places," the senior Congress leader also said.Kharge further said that the opposition should not get divided and fight amongst themselves while noting that Congress has tried to include them (TMC) in various socio-political issues where Congress made its name. "We have to fight against BJP together," Kharge added.On Wednesday, Banerjee who is on a three-day visit to Mumbai, met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar to pitch for a united alliance of opposition parties to oust the BJP from the Centre. Speaking after the meeting, Banerjee addressed a press conference, during which she said there is no UPA. "Considering today’s situation and the ongoing fascism, a strong alternative force is required in the country against it. No one can do it alone. We all need a strong alternative and if someone is not ready to fight, then what can be done.”The remarks have since irked the Congress, with senior leaders slamming the West Bengal chief minister and accusing her of "posturing for personal ambition".Trinamool Congress was once part of the UPA, an alliance of several parties headed by the Congress that remained in power at the Centre for 10 years from 2004 to 2014.After the TMC's landslide victory in West Bengal Assembly polls held early this year, Banerjee is continuously pitching for a strong alternative at the national level, in a seeming attempt to go national.On Thursday, reacting to Banerjee's remarks, Digvijay Singh took a swipe as he said, "Can any political alliance formed against BJP be without the participation of Congress?" "Our fight is against the ruling party (BJP). Those who want to join us should come with us and those who don't want to join us are free to do so," ANI quoted Singh as saying.Another senior leader and former Union minister Kapil Sibal also reacted to the remarks and said, without the century-old party, "UPA will be a body without a soul."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-helping-the-ruling-party-mallikarjun-kharge-on-mamata-banerjee-s-what-i-101638427999427.html
02-12-2021||India||India slams UN agency for ‘baseless’ allegations against security forces, defends UAPA||India on Thursday lashed out at the UN human rights agency for making “baseless and unfounded allegations” against the country’s law enforcement authorities and security forces and criticising the arrest of a Kashmiri rights activist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The ministry of external affairs said that the statement made by the spokesperson of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) “betrays a complete lack of understanding” of the security challenges faced by India from cross border terrorism and its impact on the ‘Right to Life’ of Indian citizens.“As a democratic country, with an abiding commitment to promote and protect the human rights of its citizens, India takes all necessary steps to counter cross border terrorism,” said MEA spokesperson Adrindam Bagchi in a statement, urging the UN agency to develop a “better understanding of the negative impact of terrorism on human rights.”The statement comes after the OHCHR raised concern over the arrest of Kashmiri human rights activist Khurram Parvez under the UAPA. On Wednesday, UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Rupert Colvill reiterated the call to amend the UAPA to “bring it into line with international human rights law and standards.” Colvill also urged Indian authorities to refrain from using the law in cases involving civil society, media, and activists.The recent civilian killings in the Valley prompted counterterrorism operations in which several terrorists were neutralised by security forces. But the operation also resulted in the killing of two civilians in Hyderpora encounter, triggering protests from human rights activists and kin of the deceased. While calling on security forces to exercise restraint, the UN rights agency said it was increasingly alarmed by the rise in targeted killings by “armed groups” in Kashmir.“Referring to proscribed terrorist organisations as 'armed groups' demonstrates a clear bias on the part of OHCHR,” said Bagchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slams-un-agency-for-baseless-allegations-against-security-forces-defends-uapa-101638427066951.html

All the top leaders of the party, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has made multiple visits to the state to give a boost to the party’s campaign.Shah, credited with the BJP’s brilliant performances in the last assembly elections and Lok Sabha polls, is looking after the entire strategy this time too.The BJP, also ruling the Centre, recently announced the scrapping of the three farm laws which triggered protests across the country, especially in farmer-dominant western region of the state. The move is being seen as the party’s efforts to placate the farmers and strengthen its presence in the western region of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-inaugurate-maa-shakumbhari-university-in-saharanpur-today-101638427205006.html
02-12-2021||India||Rajya Sabha adjourned amid protests over suspension of 12 MPs||The Rajya Sabha was adjourned minutes after the House convened on Thursday as Opposition members protested against chairman M Venkaiah Naidu’s refusal to allow Mallikarjun Kharge, the leader of the Opposition, to raise the issue of the suspension of 12 members.The Opposition members rose in protest as soon as Naidu referred to the suspension and reiterated the 12 have “not expressed remorse”. Naidu said the House has not transacted business since the beginning of the Winter Session on Monday. “This is the fourth sitting of the first session of this august House in the 75th year of our hard-fought Independence. The House could not transact any business during the last three days.”As the Opposition members kept pushing for Kharge to be given a chance to speak, Naidu said, “…Since I cannot go public with my anguish in any other way, the only platform to share my anguish and thoughts is to speak in the House. Some of the respected leaders and members of this august House, in their wisdom, chose to describe the suspension of 12 members as ‘undemocratic’. I have struggled to understand if there was any justification in that kind of narrative being propagated but could not.”The Opposition parties have closed ranks and called the suspension unfair. They have maintained the members were suspended without following proper procedure. The government has stuck to its stand that the action will be reconsidered only when the suspended members apologise in the House.“While calling this suspension as undemocratic both within and outside the House, not even a word is being said about the reasons given for the suspension, the disdainful conduct of some members during the last session, which I have categorically called as ‘acts of sacrilege’ on the last day of the last session,” Naidu said. “…I am deeply pained to know from media reports of categorical refusals to express any regret for the acts of misconduct during the last session that led to this round of suspensions. Then what is the way forward?”

It is expected to be introduced in the army by August 2022, said another official. The digitised print will vary with terrains such as mountains, deserts, and jungles.The new uniform pattern has been selected after a careful study of the army’s working requirements and the need to introduce uniformity in battle fatigues worn by soldiers. Variations in the existing uniform pattern worn by soldiers have drawn criticism from some quarters. The National Institute of Fashion Technology has helped the army finalise the new uniform.Experts said the need for a combat uniform switchover was long felt. “The cloth quality was not that good compared to the uniform of other modern militaries. Also, there was an issue of uniformity of pattern. With the advancement in detection capabilities, it was important to go for digitised prints to achieve proper camouflage,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).While soldiers wear the combat uniform in operational areas, officers posted in the Army headquarters in New Delhi also wear the combat dress on Fridays in solidarity with men operating in the forward areas. Unlike in the existing combat uniform, the shirt will not be tucked inside the trouser in the new battle fatigues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-to-adopt-new-combat-fatigues-next-year-101638427161876.html

Varun Gandhi, who has been critical of his own party over several policy matters, took to Twitter to raise issues of the delays, scams, and paper leaks in the recruitment processes.The Lok Sabha MP from the Pilibhit constituency has intensified his criticism of the governments in Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre, both led by the BJP, after the reports of the Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test (UPTET) examination paper leak emerged last month. Highlighting a series of obstacles faced by the youth, Gandhi said that about 1.25 crore applicants of Railway Group D are waiting for the results for two years.“First, there is no government job, yet if some chance comes, the paper gets leaked, if you give the exam, you don't have the result for years, then get cancelled in some scam. 1.25 Crore youth of Railway Group D are waiting for the results for two years. The same is true of recruitment in the army. Till when should the youth of India be patient?” the BJP MP tweeted in Hindi.पहले तो सरकारी नौकरी ही नहीं है, फिर भी कुछ मौका आए तो पेपर लीक हो, परीक्षा दे दी तो सालों साल रिजल्ट नहीं, फिर किसी घोटाले में रद्द हो। रेलवे ग्रुप डी के सवा करोड़ नौजवान दो साल से परिणामों के इंतज़ार में हैं। सेना में भर्ती का भी वही हाल है। आखिर कब तक सब्र करे भारत का नौजवान??The UPTET 2021 examination scheduled for last Sunday was cancelled due to an alleged paper leak. After the cancellation, Prashant Kumar, Additional Director General (ADG), Law and Order, said that at least 23 people have been arrested in connection with the paper leak. Amid the state government’s assurance of investigation by the Special Task Force, Gandhi demanded strict action against the “education mafia” and their “political patrons”."UPTET exam paper leak is like playing with the future of lakhs of youth. Action on small fish of this swamp will not work. Government should take strict action against the education mafia and their political patrons. Most of the educational institutions are owned by political influencers, when will action be taken against them?"

Speaking at a gathering in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, Azad said that "only the Supreme Court can decide on reversing the abrogation of Article 370" in Jammu and Kashmir or the Congress "has to come to power with 300-plus seats but he does not see that happening".However, the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir added that he prays the grand old party manages to secure over 300 seats in the next elections."Only the Supreme Court can decide on Article 370. Besides the apex court, only the ruling government can do it. The current government has abrogated it, how will they do it? And I cannot assure you that Congress will win 300 seats in the 2024 elections. I pray that Congress wins 300 seats but I don't see that happening now," the Congress leader was quoted as saying.The former Rajya Sabha MP’s statement came at a time when the Congress is facing a serious crisis of inner tussles besides a lot of leaders jumping ship in search of greener pastures. The party is also struggling to stitch a united Opposition during the ongoing winter session of Parliament.On Wednesday, West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) does not exist anymore. "What is UPA? There is no UPA," said Banerjee. “Considering today’s situation and the ongoing fascism, a strong alternative force is required in the country against it. No one can do it alone. We all need a strong alternative and if someone is not ready to fight, then what can be done,” she said.She said this after a meeting with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai to make a pitch for a united front of opposition parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The central government led by BJP had abrogated Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

Sharad Ji is the senior-most leader and I came to discuss our political parties. I agree with whatever Sharad Ji said. There is no UPA," Banerjee said after meeting Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai. Mamata Banerjee, who is believed to have been harbouring a national aspiration, also met members of civil society in Mumbai, where she raised issues like the victimisation of celebrities by the NDA. “I know Mahesh Bhatt is victimised, Shah Rukh is victimised. There are many more... Some can open their mouths and some can't,” Mamata said.In what is being seen as a veiled dig at Rahul Gandhi, Mamata said continuous endeavours are needed in politics. "You can't be abroad most of the time," she said. The comment at a time when several disgruntled Congress leaders are switching to the Trinamool stirred a row. Congress leaders reacted sharply to Mamata's assertion, as KC Venugopal said it is merely a dream to think that anybody can defeat the BJP without Congress. "No individual party can fight against BJP by directly or indirectly criticising Rahul Gandhi if that party continues to think about its political gain and personal ambitions. The Congress is the only viable option for the country and the democracy," Maharashtra minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said. “Rahul Gandhi and his entire family were subjected to personal attacks by BJP and other parties. Defamatory campaigns were carried out against him, but Rahul Gandhi did not back down,” Thorat said. “India has seen and supported the aggressive stand the Congress had taken for the withdrawal of the anti-people law of land acquisition and three black farm laws. In future also, this fight for the rights of the common people will continue under the able and strong leadership of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and our leader Rahul Gandhi,” Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan said. Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday said the opposition should not get divided and fight amongst themselves. "We've tried to include them in various socio-political issues where Congress made its name," Kharge said.As Mamata interacted with the members of civil society, she said she had suggested to the Congress that an advisory council of prominent personalities from civil society be set up to give a direction to the opposition, but it was not heeded. Defending Mamata's ‘What is UPA’ comment, Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien said Trinamool is a political party and not a football club. "We have to fight elections. We have a right to expand," Derek said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upa-will-be-a-body-without-kapil-sibal-replies-to-mamata-s-what-is-upa-101638418947483.html

It said the current regulatory bodies such as the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) are not as effective, and that their “efficacy is limited”. The panel said the NBSA, a self-regulatory body, “depends on voluntary compliance with its orders”.The panel reiterated the Press Council of India’s suggestion to bring e-newspapers, news portals, social media, and other platforms under regulatory control. It also referred to a discussion over an umbrella statute for the entire broadcasting sector covering print, electronic and online media.The panel expressed concern over the circulation of widespread fake news on social media and digital news platforms. It appreciated the establishment of Fact Check Units at 17 regional offices of Press Information Bureau. The panel asked the government to open more such offices.

02-12-2021||India||Cyclone Jawad: IMD issues red alert for heavy rainfall in some Odisha districts||Odisha government on Wednesday asked collectors to prepare for evacuation from 13 districts amid the forecast of a cyclonic storm, Jawad, reaching the coast on December 4. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the low-pressure area forming in the south Andaman Sea will intensify into a depression and move towards the Odisha coast as a cyclonic storm on December 4.As part of extensive pre-emptive measures, the government has chalked out a disaster management strategy for rescue and relief operations. National Disaster Response Force, Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force and fire department personnel have been requisitioned for the operations.State relief commissioner P K Jena said in an advisory that the sea condition is likely to get very tough as the wind speed reaches 45 to 55 kmph, gusting to 65 kmph on Friday. After the depression takes the shape of a cyclonic storm, the system will move northwestwards and reach north Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coast around Saturday morning. Cyclone Jawad: IMD issues alert for north Andhra Pradesh, Odisha coastsOn the morning of Cyclone Jawad landfall, the wind is likely to reach 80kmph gusting to 90 kmph.“Though it is clear that the cyclonic storm will approach the Odisha coast, it is too immature to say where it will make landfall and other details. However, under its impact, several coastal districts of Odisha will experience light to moderate rainfall from December 3. South Odisha districts may also experience heavy rainfall on December 3,” IMD director-general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.“Only after the depression is formed will we be in a position to predict the path and location of the cyclone crossing the coast and its intensity,” Mohapatra added.But the intensity of rainfall in Odisha will pick up from Saturday as the coastal districts and interior districts are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall. The IMD has issued a red alert for Gajapati, Ganjam, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts. An orange alert has been issued in Kendrapara, Cuttack, Khurda, Nayagarh, Kandhamal, Rayagada and Koraput districts for Saturday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-jawad-imd-issues-red-alert-for-heavy-rainfall-in-some-odisha-districts-101638404765105.html
02-12-2021||India||ED can interrogate Unitech promoters in custody: SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its August order sending former Unitech promoters, Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, to Mumbai jails at the request of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which wants to interrogate and confront them “with a lot of evidence”.The top court shifted the Chandra brothers out of Delhi’s Tihar jail to Taloja and Arthur Road jails in Mumbai on August 26 after a police probe ordered by the Supreme Court backed ED allegations that jail authorities were helping the two engage in illegal activities, including running an underground office in south Delhi.Also Read | SC orders probe into collusion of Tihar jail officials with Ex Unitech ownersED approached the Supreme Court to amend its August 26 order after jail authorities in Mumbai refused to honour production warrants issued by a Delhi court on the agency’s request and told officials to seek a clarification from the top court. Mumbai jail officials cited provisions of the Supreme Court order that required the two to record their presence in trial court proceedings via video conferencing.Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general (ASG) Madhavi Divan said, “We require their interrogation as they need to be confronted with a lot of evidence. For this, we require a clarification that video conferencing will not come in the way of our request to seek custodial interrogation.”A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah found the request reasonable. “We clarify that our order (of August 26) will not come in the way of the ED moving requisite application before the Special ED court for custodial interrogation,” the bench said. It further stated that once the period of custodial interrogation, if granted, is done, the accused shall be brought back to the respective jails in Mumbai.The also bench asked the senior law officer about the progress made by the Centre to take remedial steps at Tihar.ASG Divan said the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has drafted an affidavit ahead of the December 9 deadline set by the court but she suggested some changes and sought two more weeks beyond the deadline to file it. “We do not want an affidavit but action on the ground,” the bench shot back. “The report by Delhi CP was comprehensive in suggesting installation of body scanners, CCTVs among other steps. Do you want to improve the system? Then tell us what steps you have taken pursuant to the report.”A total of 32 jail officials at Tihar were named in the FIR by the Delhi police in connection with the probe into allegations that Chandra was working in connivance with prison officials was disposing of the proceeds of crime and influencing witnesses.Also Read | Raids at residences, offices of former Unitech promoters, 32 Tihar jail officersDivan said that the situation cannot be remedied just by installing CCTVs as there is a serious issue of grafts involved. The bench eventually agreed to give the Centre two more weeks to file the affidavit but asked the law officer to inform about the steps taken within a week.The Chandra brothers were arrested in April 2017 on charges of duping homebuyers in 74 projects. ED got into the picture after a Supreme Court-mandated forensic audit of Unitech conducted in 2018 revealed that part of the ₹14,000 crore invested by nearly 30,000 homebuyers in 74 Unitech housing projects was laundered to offshore shell companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-can-interrogate-unitech-promoters-in-custody-sc-101638392368973.html
02-12-2021||India||When did wealth become a measure of the worth of a man?||“When did money become the be-all and end-all of Indian society?” the man asked. Which I thought was a bit rich (ahem, forgive the pun), given that we were tucking into a lavish Sunday brunch (priced at about ₹5,000 a pop) at the Four Seasons Bengaluru. So there we were, India’s one-percenters talking about money and what it meant to us.We were college friends who had seen each other rise and fall. We had come far from our humble beginnings. Our problem was one that is felt keenly in Bengaluru where millionaires are made overnight: how could we enjoy the fruits of our hard work while ensuring that our kids stayed foolish, hungry and drive, to paraphrase Rashmi Bansal’s terrific book.Many middle-aged Indians who are successful professionals today have a similar trajectory. We have our “unreserved compartment” stories. You know what I mean? Or maybe you don’t. It is the moment when you travel by Indian trains. There you are, after an ungainly undignified scramble, sitting on the upper-berth of the unreserved compartment, surrounded by sweaty bodies. In a scene worthy of a Kannada movie, you swear that you will never put yourself through this again. Mostly you don’t. Every professional I meet at Bengaluru’s great companies, be it Titan or Flipkart, have their “origin tales” of how they struggled and succeeded. Equally, all of us, me included, now lead lives, where we do everything we can so that our kids don’t struggle. Our kids don’t take public transport, they don’t bike to buy vegetables, they have never travelled in the unreserved compartment on their trips home for vacation. Yet, we want them to stay grounded, hungry and driven, just as we were. The question is: can you get your kids to be hungry without letting them-- quite literally-- go hungry? How to keep them grounded if you live atop a glitzy high-rise?Different parents take different strategies. My friend, Leo, for instance, flies business class when he is alone but travels economy whenever the family goes on vacation-- so that his kids can learn the values of frugality. He also wants his kids to be ambitious, have a passion. “We mostly define success and ambition as linked with wealth which I think is totally silly. Ambition to me is about going after what you want and working hard.”As a parent, what are the two or three cardinal values that you would want to pass on to your children? For me, it would be frugality and grit, but it could be different things for you. North Indians tend to use words like courage and determination. Frugality, I find, is valued mostly by South Indians (not including folks from Andhra or Telangana). I think it is because we have a certain uneasiness about wealth. We don’t ‘own’ it emotionally, we have an inherent, and you could argue, well placed suspicion about whether it will change our character. Serial entrepreneur Ramji Srinivasan calls it the “South Indian hang up about financials and wealth.” He says, “My dad always says ‘material goods will never love you back.’ I try to remember that advice to this day.” Discussing frugality at the Four Seasons is a contradiction, you might say. But here lies the nuance. As adults, all of us want to enjoy our champagne brunch. Heck, we’ve earned it. But we don’t want our kids to grow up thinking that this is their reality. We want them to earn it as well. So what is a parent to do? One option that we all came up with was to take our kids to Woodlands for outings rather than, say Zen at The Leela. Let them struggle, let them earn and then let them go out wherever they want was the rationale. Did we do it? Not really. In this day of helicopter parenting, kids tag along everywhere the parents go. All is not lost though.Recently, Namu Kini, owner of the art gallery Kynkyny had put together a weekend market at Hatworks Boulevard, an oasis in the centre of Bengaluru. Titled Uru Collective-- it was a collection of homegrown brands-- all leaning towards plant-based and sustainable solutions. What I saw at the market gave me hope. Most of the founders Bengalureans in their 20s and 30s. They came from privileged backgrounds. Yet, there they were, ambitious if not hungry.

02-12-2021||India||Months on, Bengaluru roads’ audit stuck in a limbo||An audit of the money spent on road-related works in Bengaluru is not going according to the intent with which it was announced by Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai in September, a senior government official said on Wednesday. The official said that the audit was more an understanding of where the money was spent or appropriation of the said amount.“It (audit) is being done so that road repair works and the audit happen parallelly,” said the senior government official aware of the developments, requesting not to be named. The official said that even the base of the road needs to be checked. During the monsoon session of the state legislature in September, Bommai said that an amount of ₹20,060 crore was spent on road-related works in Bengaluru alone. The audit was announced to check the expenditure that was purportedly used for road works, which are among the poorest quality in the country. According to the BBMP’s estimates, one kilometre of a two-lane road under Smart City costs anywhere between ₹7.5 to ₹11 crores (including underground ducts), and the same for a tar road is around ₹80 lakhs to ₹1.3 crores. The Bommai government has said that there are around 1,344 kms of arterial and sub-arterial roads in Bengaluru, of which only 295 kms are said to be in good condition, and another 246 kms have now been ridden of potholes. The BBMP has said that it will commence work on repairing roads “as soon as the rains stop”.The government has surpassed many of its deadlines to fill these potholes despite the additional money put into an exercise. Bommai, who holds the Bengaluru portfolio, said that only 1,344 kms of roads, out of the over 11,800 kms, were motorable in the city, admitting to one of the biggest infrastructural challenges. The chief minister, his cabinet colleagues and several others pointed to the presence of multiple civic agencies that do not coordinate while cutting roads and then leaving without relaying them. Bommai has said that the government will try to ensure better coordination. “There is something called the defect liability period, which the BBMP has not been insistent on,” the officials said. The period states that the contractor will be liable for any damages on the roads for a certain amount of time. But contractors said that they cannot be held responsible if civic agencies cut open roads soon after it is asphalted. The poor civic infrastructure had been the cause of at least deaths in Bengaluru last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which is several times more than all other major cities combined in the country. Delhi had two deaths attributed to civic negligence while Mumbai had one, according to data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/months-on-bengaluru-roads-audit-stuck-in-a-limbo-101638386903707.html
02-12-2021||India||More clusters emerge as 15 students test Covid positive in Karnataka||As many as 15 more students have tested Covid positive in two nursing colleges in Tumkuru, said the district health officer on Wednesday. He said that all the infected individuals have been isolated at a quarantine centre and their samples have been sent for additional investigation. This comes a day after 13 students of a government-run residential hostel in Hassan district and seven medical college students in Chamarajanagar had tested positive. According to officials, most of the students who recently tested positive for the viral infection are from Kerala. Owing to fears surrounding the new Omicron variant, the state government has ramped up its testing and tracing measures. With the increase in the number of clusters in educational institutes and the scare over the new variant, several private schools have suspended offline classes, said the office-bearers of the schools’ association. M Srinivasan, president of Management of Independent CBSE Schools’ Association (MICSA), Karnataka, said that over half of their member schools that had resumed offline classes have reverted to offline classes. “There is a fear among parents, so these schools have gone back to online teaching and they are also holding their exams online,” he said. Srinivasan said that Covid-19 clusters have been reported at educational institutions which have residential facilities. He added that other schools may take a decision soon. Talking about reopening schools, he said schools would wait and watch before taking further steps. Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh however said there is no need to panic. “As of now the situation is under control. The government is constantly monitoring the situation. No government schools have reported any Covid-19 cluster since offline classes resumed. If and when the Technical Advisory Committee suggests going back to online classes, we will take a decision. As of now, classes will continue as normal,” he said. The minister added that there are over 48,000 government primary and high schools across the state and since the lack of technology have created a gap in education, it is important to continue offline classes. “Many students who didn’t have mobile phones were lagging behind. We are running special classes to make up for this. So at this stage, we will take a decision on closing schools based on the committee’s recommendation,” he said. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai also dismissed speculations that schools and colleges may be ordered to close in the state. “We have issued instructions on guidelines to be followed at schools and colleges. But educational institutions will not be closed,” said Bommai. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government has issued an advisory on the emergence of the new Covid-19 clusters and said that all social and cultural events, conferences, seminars, academic events, etc. in educational institutions may be postponed for two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-clusters-emerge-as-15-students-test-covid-positive-in-karnataka-101638386900278.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who served as Gujarat’s chief minister at the time, was among the people exonerated.Also Read | Gujarat riots: Wrong to attribute motive to SIT, says SCDefending its findings, the SIT, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said, “What was started by the complainant (Zakia) is now being directed by Teesta Setalvad who is being joined by RB Sreekumar (former Gujarat police chief) in making all kinds of allegations against all people with the singular motive to keep the pot boiling.”Also Read | Gujarat riots: No case made out of Zakia Jafri’s complaint, SIT tells SCRohatgi said that the top court should put an end to the matter in the ongoing proceedings, where both Zakia and Setalvad have challenged an October 2017 order of the Gujarat high court refusing to reopen the closure report of the SIT. “This court should give a closure to this case. Further agony should not go on at the instance of the second petitioner (Setalvad) who wants to keep the pot boiling,” he said.Rohatgi further stated that when the matter was assigned by the top court for investigation to the SIT in September 2011, “this court saw the tears of a victim of Gulbarga Society.” He was referring to Zakia, whose husband, former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri, was killed during at Gulbarga Society during the riots.“See what’s the kind of sinister plot coming out, her complaint had named 63 persons and in her appeal before Gujarat high court, further 50 more names were added. There is expansion of this case at every stage,” Rohatgi said, pointing to the 1,200-page protest petition, saying, “See the sinister purpose. No normal person can file such a huge protest petition.”Also Read | Question on Gujarat riots in Class 12 test inappropriate; will take action: CBSEThe bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar told Rohatgi to highlight this aspect in the form of a chart. “Give us bullet points on how the improvement in the complaint was made, first before the trial court, then in the high court and finally in the Supreme Court,” the bench said.The SIT gave further proof of the alleged plot by referring to three witnesses who came to depose their statements to the SIT when they were probing Zakia’s complaint. “They brought prepared statements to be taken on record. As the procedure requires the investigating officer to record statement on the spot, upon questioning, they gave different names of accused. Later, they confessed that the prepared statements were given to them by Teesta Setalvad,” Rohatgi said.Denying claims by the petitioners – Zakia and Setalvad – about the Godhra train burning, parading of dead bodies, late reaction by administration to call the army, and statements by police officials, the SIT said, “These are ramblings made on imaginary issues. The petitioner is drawing castles in the air. These are hard-to-swallow allegations without any basis that creates doubts for nothing.”Rohatgi admitted that there was “obviously a failure of administration as they were overrun on the day riots began”, and added: “Ultimately, you can say police was complacent and charge them for dereliction of duty but there is no criminal conspiracy.”He will continue with his submissions on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-keep-pot-boiling-sit-tells-supreme-court-on-zakia-jafri-s-plea-in-2002-gujarat-riots-101638386656824.html
02-12-2021||India||BJP’s rise in Telangana may be behind KCR’s attack||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), for long considered what is termed a friendly party in political circles by the Bharatiya Janata Party has finally jumped on to the Opposition bandwagon, a move that analysts attribute to the latter’s growing clout in the southern state of Telangana. For seven years now, the TRS, headed by Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, has largely voted along with the ruling party. The change was evident in the presence of TRS’ parliamentary party leader K Kesava Rao at the meeting of 16 Opposition parties at the office of Congress floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday condemning the suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha members. “The TRS is part of the Opposition team to protest the highhanded attitude of the NDA government. We have been protesting for the last two days and we shall continue,” Kesava Rao said. Back home, KCR, as the TRS chief is popularly called, has also been adopting an aggressive posture against the BJP for the last few days, attacking the local leadership of the party as well as the Narendra Modi government in particular. While the Centre’s refusal to purchase parboiled rice from the state is the trigger for the chief minister’s outburst against the BJP, many party insiders and analysts say the real reason is the growing electoral threat posed by the BJP in the state. The party did well in recent local body and assembly by-polls.Of late, KCR has lashed out at the Modi government on several other issues, such as the controversial farm laws, the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, power sector reforms, rising fuel prices in the country, Chinese aggression on Arunachal Pradesh borders and India’s performance in the hunger index . According to a senior TRS leader who asked not to be identified, the decision to give up the hitherto “neutral” stand of the party was taken at the TRS parliamentary party meeting held in Hyderabad on Sunday, where KCR gave a clear direction to his party MPs, nine in Lok Sabha and six in Rajya Sabha , to step up their offensive against the BJP-led NDA government in coordination with the other Opposition parties. Though KCR made an attempt to float a federal front of various regional parties before the 2019 general elections, there were no takers for his proposal, his party has largely supported the legislative agenda of the government in its first term, and thus far in its second. Analysts said that the change in position also means that KCR and the TRS now see the BJP and not the Congress as their main rival. In the December 2018 assembly elections in Telangana, the BJP could win only one seat in the 119-member assembly and its candidates lost their deposits in as many as 106 constituencies. It also failed to make an impact in the subsequent local body elections. But the party bounced back by winning four Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections, including in Nizamabad where BJP candidate defeated KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha, the TRS became alert. The subsequent win by the BJP in the by-election to Dubbak assembly seat and its showing in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation proved that the Lok Sabha performance wasn’t an exception. The recent victory of the BJP in the Huzurabad by-election was a big shock to KCR, the analysts said.  “He is perhaps, made nervous by the meteoric rise of the BJP in Telangana and hence, has decided to join the Congress under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, even if it is for limited time and purpose,” political analyst Sriram Karri said. Senior TRS leader and former MP B Vinod said the TRS has decided to join hands with the other Opposition parties to fight against the anti-people policies of the NDA government on an issue-to-issue basis. “We shall also take the support of the other Opposition parties on issues concerning Telangana, like the contentious paddy procurement.” The official spokesperson of the Telangana unit of the BJP K Krishna Saagar Rao said KCR’s strategy indicates that he might be preparing ground for an alliance. “We won’t be surprised if the TRS enters into an electoral alliance with the Congress in the coming elections.” Karri said KCR may well be creating a narrative of the TRS as opposed to BJP, while cosying up with the Congress. “His biggest strength is that his two rivals can never come together.” 
02-12-2021||India||Landslides hit hills in Tirumala, 20 pilgrimshave narrow escape||Around 20 pilgrims travelling in a state-run bus to the hill shrine of Lord Venkateshwara in Tirumala escaped uninjured after the bus driver noticed boulders rolling down the ghat road due to rain-triggered landslides in the early hours of Wednesday, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) chairman Y V Subba Reddy said. Reddy said the incident occurred at around 5.45 am when a series of landslides on the Tirumala hills resulted in huge boulders falling on the second ghat (for the upward journey of pilgrims from Tirupati to Tirumala) at four locations. He said the landslides were the result of recent torrential rains in the temple town and the Tirumala hills, after a gap of nearly 30 years. The retainer walls were broken and the ghat road caved in under the impact of the huge boulders falling on it. “A major accident was averted as the RTC driver stopped the bus on time. There were no injuries to anybody due to the blessings of Lord Venkateswara,” Reddy told reporters. He said the boulders caused huge damage to the road at five to six places and its protection railings at a height of 1,000 feet and 800 feet respectively on the 20 km long extremely curled serpentine road, forcing the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam authorities to close the road for vehicular traffic. This is the second time in less than two weeks that the ghat road was closed for traffic due to landslides caused by heavy rains that lashed the temple town, along with several parts of the south coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema districts, which are still reeling under the impact of the depression in the Bay of Bengal. The TTD chairman, along with the senior officials rushed to the spot to inspect the damaged road. “The TTD authorities and the police swung into action and sealed the road completely. There are no landslides on the first ghat road (bringing pilgrims from Tirumala down the hill). We are allowing the upward traffic also on the same route,” Reddy added. “While the vigilance and police officials have removed the rocks and other debris, the engineering department authorities have been pressed into service to study the situation. A team of experts from IIT Madras have inspected the road and another expert team from IIT Delhi will also inspect the site on Thursday morning to assess the extent of damage,” Reddy said, adding that it might take two to three days to restore the normalcy on the damaged ghat road. In the third week of November, too, Tirumala and Tirupati witnessed unprecedented heavy rains, and both the ghat roads were closed for a day due to landslides from the hills. The temple premises and its surroundings were submerged in water for nearly two days. The traffic was restored gradually, as the rains subsided. Reddy appealed to all the devotees who booked their darshan tickets to defer their travel plans to avoid inconvenience. He said all of them would be given options to use the tickets within six months.

More than a 100 of the I-T officials conducted searches at more than 20 premises in the districts of Chennai, Tirunelveli, Madurai and Coimbatore from Wednesday morning. The search operations included eight places in Chennai. “The searches have not concluded and it will continue on Thursday,” said the official requesting anonymity. The retail chain of stores primarily caters to the lower and middle income group. According to their website, their showrooms sell textiles, jewellery, vessels, water, sweets and a host of other products, at affordable prices. It is a major shopping hub in Chennai with four out of the six stores present in the city such as in T Nagar and Purasawalkam. Customers couldn’t enter the stores on Wednesday due to the on-going raids when business had to stop. The department has not released a statement following the raids on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-raids-saravana-selvarathinam-in-tamil-nadu-101638386356852.html
02-12-2021||India||Kerala rape case: High court cuts down former Catholic priest’s prison term to 10 yrs||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday reduced the sentence of former Catholic priest Robin Vadakumchery, 54, who was found guilty of raping a minor, from 20 to 10 years. The trail court in Thalassery in north Kerala had sentenced him to 20 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹2 lakh in 2019. Found guilty of rape and other provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act he was sentenced to 60 years but the trial court had fixed his jail term to 20 years. Hearing a plea against the trail court’s verdict the single bench of Justice Narayana Pisharadi altered charges from Section 376 (2) to Section 376 (1) of the Indian Penal Code (misuse of position to influence a victim) which reduced the sentence to 10 years. However charges under the Pocso will remain, the court observed. Vadakumchery, a senior priest, was convicted for impregnating a 17-year-old girl in Mananthavady (Wayanad) diocese in 2018. The case surfaced in early 2017 after the rape survivor, a higher secondary student, gave birth to a baby in the church-run hospital. She was a student of church-run school, one of the many educational institutions managed by Vadakumchery. There were many attempts to hush up the case but it came out. Initially, the victim’s father owned up the crime of raping his daughter and was arrested. However, police found major discrepancies in his statements and during sustained interrogation he broke down and named Vadakumchery. He said he was forced to own up the crime by church authorities. Vadakkumchery, who was once tipped to become Mananthawady Bishop, was arrested near Kochi airport while trying to flee to Canada. The senior priest’s arrest had invited enough embarrassment to the powerful Catholic church in the state. A year after his conviction, he was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019. In July the Supreme Court had turned down his plea to marry the victim, who is a major now. Both, victim and her tormentor, moved the plea together but the court refused to entertain it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-rape-case-high-court-cuts-down-former-catholic-priest-s-prison-term-to-10-yrs-101638386298606.html
02-12-2021||India||AIADMK changes bylaws to strengthen dual leadership||Chennai: In a bid to close the doors on expelled leader Sasikala, who claims herself to be the general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the party on Wednesday formalised its dual leadership by making a vital change to the bylaws in the party constitution. Now, the coordinator (O Panneerselvam) and joint coordinator (Edappadi Palaniswami) will be internally elected by a ‘single voting system’ directly by the primary members, who have been associated with the party for five continuous years.Hitherto, according to bylaws, the AIADMK’s members of the general council (roughly 3,000 of them) had the power to elect or remove the party leaders. This change has now solidified AIADMK’s dual leadership arrangement which has been in place since J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016 and to keep Sasikala and her supporters out. This was part of the 11 resolutions passed by the AIADMK on Wednesday during the meeting of its executive committee, a key decision-making body, in the party headquarters in Chennai.A senior AIADMK leader on the condition of anonymity explained that the change was done due to internal squabbling.“We don’t know who will go against the party in which forum,” he said. For the new process, a party cadre requires to have held a primary membership card of the AIADMK for a minimum of five continuous years to be eligible to vote. “Now, only one box will be kept and the primary member can cast one vote which will go to both posts of coordinator and joint coordinator. During Amma’s (Jayalalithaa) time, the post for general secretary used to be announced and no one would nominate themselves and we would pass a resolution that we have elected Amma unanimously.”Since the party was founded in 1972 by MG Ramachandran as ADMK (later renamed AIADMK) after he broke away from the DMK, the highest post in the party is that of general secretary which was held by him and later by Jayalalithaa. Following Jayalalithaa’s death in office, her close aide Sasikala took over as interim general secretary. But that lasted just for a month as the Supreme Court convicted her in the disproportionate assets case in February 2017 and was sentenced to four years in jail.While she was serving her sentence in a Bengaluru jail, the factions of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam merged on a few conditions which included expelling Sasikala in 2017. During the same year, the AIADMK repealed a bylaw that scrapped the party’s all-powerful general secretary post, and resolved that Jayalalithaa would be their eternal general secretary. It transferred the powers of the general secretary by introducing new posts-- coordinator and joint coordinator which went to Panneerselvam and Palaniswami respectively who were then ruling the state as deputy chief minister and chief minister.The new changes on Wednesday further strengthens the top dual leadership party structure amidst a faction rallying for a single leadership which has been the hallmark of the AIADMK where Jayalalithaa ruled the party and the state. The AIADMK’s resolutions come in the backdrop of several setbacks that the party is facing--voices growing in favour of Sasikala’s re-entry, the Madras high court rejecting government’s acquisition of Jayalalithaa’s residence for a memorial in her name and the re-opening of the investigations in the murder of Jaya’s former aide at her estate in Kodanad.Political experts say that AIADMK has restored the bylaws to the MGR period when all primary members had the powers to vote for the top party leader. “This will be a barricade for Sasikala if she wants to take over. How will she convene and consolidate the entire membership?” pointed out political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “Modifying the bylaws also gives the AIADMK leadership legal validity if it is challenged. And it is good for the Opposition to be led by a leader who enjoys the confidence of the cadre.” Sasikala’s petition against convening a meeting in 2017 to make changes in the bylaws and to expel her is pending at a city court in Chennai. “This move may also be to prevent Sasikala from poaching AIADMK members after the case is over.”Minority wing leader sacked On Tuesday night, the AIADMK removed the party’s minority wing secretary and senior leader A Anwhar Raajhaa for violating party principles. Raajhaa has been speaking in favour of re-inducting Sasikala, against the current dual leadership and he has been vocal that their alliance with the BJP has cost them the votes of the minorities. Sasikala recently found support in Panneerselvam who said that the party will discuss her re-entry which was dismissed by Palaniswami later. However, both leaders signed the party order to remove Raajhaa. “He is removed from the primary membership of the party for speaking against the decisions of the high command and bringing disrepute to the AIADMK,” the joint statement from the dual leadership read on Tuesday. The AIADMK has been sacking cadres who are in touch with Sasikala and have supported her. However, Raajhaa’s removal is the first major expulsion which is expected to cause a stir. A former minister in the Jayalalithaa cabinet and ex-MP from Ramanathapuram, Raajhaa in his interviews recently said that the AIADMK would have fared better in the elections if they had united with Sasikala. Since Jayalalithaa’s death, the AIADMK-led NDA alliance lost the 2019 parliamentary elections, 2021 assembly elections and the rural body polls in October. Former AIADMK minister and spokesperson D Jayakumar justified the expulsion. “We are a party that follows military discipline,” he said. “While he (Raajhaa) is in the party, how can we accept him criticising the party, and sharing what happens in indoor meetings to outsiders. If we allow this, the party will go out of control. It is the right decision taken at the right time.”

It was an advisory and would be considered only to that extent. For now, we are continuing with the guidelines that were issued yesterday (Tuesday),” Chakrabarty told HT.Meanwhile, senior officials said the state government was monitoring the Omicron situation daily, and if the situation improves, it will scale down the orders.The state government on Tuesday issued an order mandating international passengers from the so called at risk countries to undergo seven-day institutional quarantine upon arrival. They will have to take an RT-PCR test on days two, four, and seven. If tested negative, they will have to stay in home quarantine for another seven days. If found positive, the passengers will be shifted to a hospital. The order also makes it mandatory for all other international passengers (apart from those from at risk countries) to mandatory take RT-PCR at the airport upon arrival, and undergo 14 days of home quarantine, if they are found to be negative.

However, all international fliers will still have to undertake mandatory and paid RT-PCR tests at the airport upon arrival, effectively immediately, as per a separate order issued by the Government of India on November 30.BMC has decided to give a window of two days for all international fliers before implementing the government of Maharashtra guidelines — mandating seven days of institutional quarantine for international passengers from risk countries. In its circular on Wednesday, the BMC said since many fliers will have already finalised their plans of travel, maybe on the move, or might even be airborne and unaware of these guidelines, a window of two days shall be given to all passengers arriving in Mumbai from at risk countries. This will avoid major inconveniences to passengers and also give them time to recast their travel plans.When asked if these rules apply to domestic passengers coming to Mumbai if they are fully vaccinated, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “These issues are being considered. We will put up a revision in guidelines to the state tomorrow (Thursday) for approval.”In BMC circular also directed the Mumbai airport operators to communicate to all domestic airlines not to allow any passengers landing in Mumbai, to board flights without negative RT-PCR reports taken within 72 hours of travel.

The mosque has been at the centre of a legal battle for years with Hindu groups claiming that the Idgah was built on land where Lord Krishna was born.The tweet comes days after a right-wing group, Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, announced plans to install a Krishna idol at the Shahi Idgah after elaborate rituals. The group, however, cancelled the plan on Monday.Also Read | Denied permission, ABHM calls off Dec 6 ‘jalabhishek’ prog at Eidgah in MathuraTalking about the announcement coming close on the heels of the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, on December 6, Maurya said: “During the time of the Ayodhya agitation, we would raise the slogan that Ayodhya is ours, now is the turn of Kashi and Mathura. Now, a Kashi Vishwanath corridor has come up in Varanasi and naturally it would be the turn of Mathura next.”“With the blessings of the people we are confident that the ancient glory of our grand heritage would be restored,” he added.Reacting to the tweet, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav told news agency ANI, “BJP has the agenda of robbing the poor and filling the pockets of the rich, they have always worked to benefit the rich class. No rath yatra or new mantra is going to help BJP in the upcoming polls.”Also Read | Mathura: Sec 144 imposed after right-wing outfits’ threatCongress spokesperson Zishan Haider, too, hit out at the BJP. “The game plan is clear. A day before union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to west UP, a deliberate attempt has been made to polarise the society on religious lines. BJP is back to its favourite play - Hindu-Muslim politics,” he said.UP BJP leader Navin Srivastava, however, defended Maurya, saying: “There is nothing wrong in what Keshav ji said. We all should be proud of our heritage. Shame on these political parties who first tried to stall the construction of Ram temple and now are back to playing their favourite appeasement politics.”

Police have identified the terrorists as Jaish IED expert Yasir Parray and Pakistan national Ali Bhai.Confirming the killings, director-general of police Dilbag Singh termed the encounter a big success. “Both of them were involved in the terror activities. Yasir Parray was involved in an IED attack on the army in which two soldiers were killed and many others injured. He (Parray) was considered as an IED expert.”Ali Bhai, too, was involved in a lot of terror activities in the area. “Both of them were working jointly and they had more than one dozen FIRs registered against them.”Inspector-General of Police (Kashmir), Vijay Kumar, too, described both the terrorists as experts in handling IEDs.Army spokesman said that two AK 47s, two pistols and other warlike stores were recovered from the encounter site.Speaking about the growing threat of the The Resistance Force (TRF) -- an offshoot of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba -- DGP Singh said: “All the groups active in Kashmir like Jaish and Lashkar and its affiliates are carrying out attacks but TRF is claiming responsibility as if locals are doing this, which isn’t true.” “Furqan alias Ali Bhai was a category “A+” Pakistani terrorist who was known to be active with JeM since June 26 2020. Yassir Ahmad Parrey, of Qasbayar, Pulwama, was a category “B” militant who had joined JeM on June 20 2019. He was known to be associated with various Pakistani terrorists and acted as a guide for bringing them into Kashmir. He was a known associate of Pakistani terrorist Abu Saifullah alias Lambu, who had planned the Pulwama convoy attack on CRPF. He had orchestrated attacks on the Security forces using an improvised explosive device at Arihal on 17 Jun 2019,” the army spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaish-ied-expert-among-two-terrorists-killed-in-jk-101638385639148.html
02-12-2021||India||EU special envoy on Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson visits New Delhi, holds talk with Shringla||New Delhi: India and the European Union (EU) had an opportunity to exchange notes and discuss the way forward in Afghanistan as EU special envoy Tomas Niklasson visited New Delhi on Wednesday.Niklasson travelled to India after holding talks in Doha over the weekend with a Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. The EU made it clear the two-day dialogue did not imply recognition of the interim government in Kabul but was part of an “operational engagement in the interest of the EU and the Afghan people”.This is Niklasson’s first visit to India since he became the special envoy and comes weeks after India hosted a meeting of top security officials of regional countries, including Iran and Russia, to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla met Niklasson on Wednesday and exchanged views on the “current situation in Afghanistan” and agreed to “continue the ongoing coordination between India & EU on Afghanistan”, according to external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Security ties between India and the EU have been on the upswing in recent years in areas ranging from the Indo-Pacific to maritime security. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the EU special envoy’s visit will be an opportunity for the two sides to exchange views on the latest developments in Afghanistan, including the urgent need to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.The people further said that India’s position on Afghanistan remains unchanged and is based on UN Security Council resolution 2593, which calls for the formation of an inclusive government and steps to ensure that Afghan soil is not used to plan and execute terrorist actions against other countries.India has no immediate plans to reopen its embassy in Kabul, which was shuttered after all the diplomats and security personnel were evacuated in August, the people said.The immediate focus for India is ensuring unhindered and unimpeded access for humanitarian efforts in order to rush relief materials and medicines to the Afghan people as winter sets in, the people added.The Taliban delegation led by Muttaqi also held talks in Doha with the new US special representative on Afghanistan, Thomas West, who emphasised the “importance of the Taliban fulfilling its public commitment not to allow anyone to pose a threat to any country from the soil of Afghanistan” and the protection of the rights of all of Afghan citizens.The US side indicated there were no plans to lift American sanctions, as the treasury department had issued general licences for the continued flow of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The EU delegation, in its talks with the Taliban, highlighted the importance of democracy and called on the interim government to take “swift, meaningful and concrete steps towards an inclusive government” with all ethnic, political and religious affiliations in order to pave the way for national reconciliation.
02-12-2021||India||SC raps ONGC for haggling over arbitration fee, ‘insulting judges’||A public sector undertaking (PSU) cannot insult former judges of constitutional courts after agreeing to utilise their services as arbitrators, the Supreme Court observed on Wednesday, as it pulled up the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) for haggling over the arbitration fee.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, noted that two retired high court judges chose to opt out of the arbitration proceedings involving ONGC and a private entity, just to ward off any embarrassment to them due to the PSU’s conduct.“You (ONGC) are insulting judges because you think you have a lot of money. You think you can say anything, do anything,” the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli, told ONGC’s counsel after taking up the case on its own.The bench also called upon attorney general KK Venugopal to apprise him of the reason why retired judges of the high court did not wish to be part of the arbitral tribunal set up by the apex court to resolve the dispute between ONGC and M/s Schlumberger Asia Services Ltd.The bench read out to A-G a letter written by justice SC Dhamadhikari, former judge of the Bombay high court, who sought to recuse himself in October as an arbitrator following the recusal by justice SJ Vazifadar, former chief justice of the Punjab and Haryana high court in June. Justice Dharmadhikari’s letter stated that ONGC was not agreeable to pay the fee of the arbitrators as decided by the arbitral tribunal, appointed by the top court in January this year. ONGC maintained it would pay the fee only as per the terms of its contract with Schlumberger.“Mr Attorney General, we want to bring to your notice the arrogance, behaviour and conduct of ONGC. We think they have a lot of money so they think they can do anything. Judges are recusing because they don’t want to be embarrassed. What is this attitude of ONGC? We want to issue a notice of contempt,” the bench told Venugopal.The court added: “They don’t have any respect for the judges. Every other day, public sector undertakings are filing frivolous cases but they don’t want to pay fees to the judges and are making such arrogant arguments.”Venugopal said the January order of the bench made it absolutely clear that fee shall be decided by the arbitrators and will be borne equally by all the parties and therefore, ONGC cannot insist on fee as per the contract.“It is a very embarrassing situation. No former judge will come forward to act as an arbitrator for your PSUs. You appoint your own arbitrators and don’t ask for judges as arbitrators if you cannot respect them,” said the bench.As the top law officer assured that he would look into the matter, the bench deferred the proceedings by a week, recording Venugopal’s appearance in the case.Schlumberger, a Hong Kong-based company with its project office in India, is a leading oilfield service provider.By consent of ONGC and Schlumberger, the Supreme Court on January 4 appointed former Calcutta HC chief justice JN Patel and justice Vazifadar as arbitrators. Justice Dharmadhikari was appointed in place of justice Vazifadar in July after the latter recused himself.
02-12-2021||India||Goa BJP’s first response to Congress claim of ‘sex scandal’ is a dare||PANAJI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday brushed aside claims by Goa Congress leaders that an unnamed minister in Pramod Sawant’s team sexually exploited a woman, saying the opposition should name the minister if it really wants action to be taken,“The Congress should stop firing in the air and name the minister if they are serious about their allegations,” Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said, his party’s first formal response to a barrage of allegations from the state Congress over the last 24 hours.On Tuesday, Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar claimed that he has accessed a video clip where a minister was seen abusing his status to sexually exploit a young woman, and threaten her. He declined to name the minister concerned, insisting that chief minister Sawant is aware of the case.“When a minister misuses his status and his power in the government to sexually exploit a woman, this is a serious issue,” Chodankar said.“The minister is seen in compromising positions (in the video). And the manner in which he is speaking to a woman… he is not even fit to become an MLA. In the audio, you can hear how after she is sexually exploited, the woman asks for her right and the minister says ‘I am a minister and I can do anything’. He even tells her to go for an abortion, but the woman is clearly reluctant,” Chodankar said.Incidentally, BJP MLA from Vasco Carlos Almeida appeared to agree with the Congress leader and has asked his party to take action against the unnamed minister. Almeida, a two-term MLA, said the minister represents an area “around Vasco”, his constituency, and said that unless action was taken against the minister, it could hurt the party’s chances not just in Goa but in all the five states that go to the polls.BJP leaders said the allegation figured during a meeting of state party leaders where some sought action against the unnamed minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-bjp-s-first-response-to-congress-claim-of-sex-scandal-is-a-dare-101638385097929.html
02-12-2021||India||Consider having a council for judicial infrastructure at national level, Supreme Court asks Centre||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday urged the Union government to consider setting up a council for judicial infrastructure at the national level, stating that infrastructural requirements of high courts and subordinate courts in the country should not be left to the “mercy of the state governments” anymore.“Why don’t you consider having a council for judicial infrastructure at the national level? Let us tell you that we, as judges, are least interested in having control of this body. Judges obviously are in the know of things about judiciary but we are not interested in retaining control of such a body, if constituted. We would rather like this to go to the people who are experts in managing money,” a bench, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, told additional solicitor general KM Nataraj.The bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath, was categorical that chief justices of all the high courts were in unison in judicial conferences that while they were open to all the ideas of enhancing judicial infrastructure, they did not wish to keep pursuing the state governments for funds. “When we were recently interacting with chief justices on digitisation of court records, all of them had to say one thing -- don’t send us to the state government for support. If the Centre can do it, there will be a lot of help...Don’t leave high courts to the mercy of the state governments for funds,” the bench told Nataraj, who was appearing for the Centre in a case relating to judicial infrastructure and judges’ strength at state and district levels. The Centre and states share funds for judicial infrastructure for lower judiciary in the ratio of 60:40. Justice Chandrachud, who is also the chairman of the E-committee of the Supreme Court, pointed to the success of various projects initiated by the E-committee with direct involvement and support of the Union government, adding that this is a perfect example of how things can improve with centralisation of projects relating to judiciary.“Look at the enormous changes that we could bring with support of the central government in providing funds and channelising problems...There has to be an umbrella national organisation or we will have the same problem that bedevils us today,” the bench told the ASG. It highlighted that unlike the US where state and federal judiciary deal with different categories of statutes, judiciary is India is unified. “All judges deal with both central and state statutes. You need to look at judiciary from this perspective. So, you cannot hive off problems to states. It is already not working,” the bench said.The court also suggested that there should be a central pool of funds where states should also put in their share of 40% and the council, which may comprise the Union law minister, state law ministers, Union finance secretary and finance secretaries of all states, can manage the money. “Judges are very conservative about spending money because they are always circumspect. They are misers when it comes to spending money. This is all public money and the judges think hundred times before spending even a single penny. So, we would rather want experts to take control of this money. We may, however, tell you our priorities about courts and infrastructure,” the bench added. The court emphasised that “a radical change” is required to improve the conditions of courts and their infrastructure at state and district levels. “There has to be a more systemised monitoring mechanism at the Centre for disbursal of funds even for the high courts. Create a mechanism for judicial infrastructure. We are not saying you keep on funding and judges will be in-charge. Of course, litigants, lawyers and judges are consumers of this infrastructure. But you manage money,” it told Nataraj.The court gave Nataraj three weeks to meet with all the stakeholders to discuss the proposal of a national council for judicial infrastructure. “We are all working for a better future of the institution. This is a free-flowing dialogue. We are not issuing any direction. Let there be a discussion at an appropriate level. Let us know what their thinking is.”

Last month, Sidhu had even taken a dig at his predecessor Jakhar, saying he never raised the issue, inviting a sarcastic reply on Twitter from him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-meets-sidhu-channi-and-jakhar-to-chart-punjab-strategy-101638384978450.html
02-12-2021||India||Parliament winter session: Lok Sabha passes Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill to regulate IVF clinics||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020, to regulate assisted reproductive technology (ART) services such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) centres, sperm or egg banks etc that have mushroomed across the country.The bill was passed by a voice vote after Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that it was brought following due consultations and the need to regulate ART services is to protect affected women and children from exploitation.“Many such ART clinics have been running in the country without regulation. A need was felt for regulation of such clinics as there are implications on the health of those who undertake the procedure,” the minister told the Lower House.“If there is no regulation, the unethical practices will increase,” he added.The Union government had been working on the bill to regulate the ART industry since 2008 when it was first drafted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The bill was first introduced in Lok Sabha on September 14, 2020 but the House had referred it to a standing committee. Many suggestions came from the standing committee and the government considered them, the health minister had said earlier. The bill proposes the constitution of a national board that will set minimum standards of physical infrastructure, laboratory, diagnostic equipment and expert manpower to be employed by clinics and banks. It also proposes the establishment of a national registry and registration authority to maintain a database of all clinics and medical professionals serving in the field. It further seeks stringent punishment for those practicing sex selection, sale of human embryos or gametes, or found running agencies, rackets and organisations for such practices in violation of the law. The bill is the most recent, in a series of legislations approved by the Union Cabinet such as the Surrogacy Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2019 and Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, to protect and safeguard the reproductive rights of women. Some members in the House said since the surrogacy bill is pending in Rajya Sabha and the two (another one being on ART) draft legislations are inter-linked, both should be passed together.“The surrogacy bill is pending in the Upper House, that has not been passed. How can this House pass a law depending upon another law... My point is that this bill cannot be taken into consideration, this bill cannot be discussed,” RSP’s N K Premachandran said.Responding to this, Mandaviya said that the surrogacy bill was passed in Lok Sabha and now it is in Rajya Sabha, and immediately after that “we brought this ART bill” and both the bills will now be taken up in the Upper House together. Speaker Om Birla ruled that since the surrogacy bill is not pending in Lok Sabha, the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2021, can be taken up and passed by the Lower House.ART services in the country have seen a significant growth in the past few years, with clinics offering nearly all services -- gamete donation, intrauterine insemination (IUI), IVF etc., and gestational surrogacy. While there is no clear data, at least 3,000 clinics and banks are known to offer such services across the country.However, there are no standard protocols for such centres to follow and reporting remains inadequate in the country. “There was a need to regulate the sector because there is a lot about the sector that is not known, for example, how many clinics are there right now. There are many clinics that claim to be doing IVF, when in reality, they are just doing intrauterine insemination (IUI), and end up fooling couples. The bill will regulate such malpractices,” a senior government official, familiar with the matter, said on condition of anonymity.Any violation of norms listed under the bill may attract a penalty between ₹5 lakhs and ₹10 lakhs for first-time offenders. For subsequent contraventions, these offences will be punishable with imprisonment for a term between eight and 12 years, and a fine between ₹10 and ₹20 lakh, the bill’s provisions stated.Any clinic or bank advertising or offering sex-selective ART will be punishable with imprisonment between five and ten years, or fine between ₹10 lakh and ₹25 lakh, or both, it added. Experts, however, pointed out certain unreasonable penal provisions in the bill that may discourage people from practising in the country.“Many of my friends are already thinking of migrating to other countries as no country has the legal provision for non-bailable arrest for making a clerical error that may happen while filling up a patient form. People will have to employ extra full-time staff, and the cost will be borne by patients. The cost of IVF will definitely shoot up. This is a very wrong way of promoting adoption, if that’s the target,” Dr Shivani Sachdev Gour, senior gynaecologist-obstetrician and IVF expert, said.“Still, we would need to look at the final version of the bill as there seem to be a lot of amendments suggested to the bill,” she added.

It added that the outstanding debt of NHAI increased by 176% to ₹338,250 crore in three years. While Haryana incurred a loss of ₹1,319.61 crore, Punjab suffered a loss of ₹1,269.42 crore due to the farmers’ agitation. Rajasthan registered a loss of ₹142.29 crore, Union minister for road transport and highways (MoRTH) Nitin Gadkari told Rajya Sabha. “The farmers’ protest started affecting toll collection from October 2020. Initially, toll plazas in the state of Punjab were made non-operational by agitating farmers in October 2020. It eventually spread to the neighbouring states of Haryana and parts of Rajasthan. Overall, 60 to 65 NH toll plazas were affected due to farmer agitation resulting in loss of toll collection of ₹2,731 crore,” Gadkari said in a written reply to a query by Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Uttar Pradesh Anil Agrawal. The government also said that business at the toll plazas continue to remain affected as farmers have not yet vacated the sites, “MoRTH and NHAI have made continuous efforts to operationalise the affected toll plazas through active communication with the state administration, help of toll collecting agencies etc. State governments of Punjab and Haryana had assured to render full cooperation for resumption of toll collection at the affected toll plaza in their respective states. However, toll operation could not be started,” the minister said. “Further, NHAI invited bids for 14 non-operational fee plazas in the state of Rajasthan based on assurance from local administration and two plazas were awarded on September 3, 2021 and September 7, 2021. However, these plazas also could not be operated due to farmers’ protest,” he added. 
02-12-2021||India||CBI arrests 5 CPI (M) activists for murder of Kerala Youth Congress leaders||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday arrested five Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers in connection with the murder of two Youth Congress leaders in north Kerala’s Kasaragod two years ago. People close to the central agency said they will be produced in a court in Ernakulam on Thursday. One of the arrested is CPI (M) branch secretary K Raju and the agency did not rule out more arrests in the case. It is a big setback to the state government which tried its best to stall a central agency probe in the case. In December 2020, the Supreme Court had rejected its plea questioning the CBI probe. Youth Congress workers Kripesh and Sharath Lal were waylaid and hacked to death brutally in Periya (north Kerala’s Kasaragod) in February 2019. Initially the CPI (M) disowned the twin murders and condemned them. Later parents of both young men moved the High Court for a central agency probe saying the investigation was not on the right track and was opposed by the government. Though the crime branch arrested 10 people a week after the murder, all local CPI (M) workers, and parents alleged that it was a well-planned murder and many senior leaders were involved in it. A week before the murder the CPI (M) had organised a protest meeting in the area and senior leader had made a speech threatening both that their days were numbered, their parents said. The Congress and parents of both the victims lauded the latest arrests. “The state tried its best to contain the CBI and even took enough time to hand over the case diary. We are sure the poor parents will get justice,” said party leader Satheesan Pacheni. “We are sure all involved will be made accountable,” said father of Sharath Lal K Sathyanarayanan. CPI (M) leaders are yet to react. The CBI is already probing two political murders in north Kerala in which many senior leaders including former Kannur district secretary P Jayarajan were arrested as accused. So the party opposed the CBI probe fearing that senior party functionaries will be booked again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-5-cpi-m-activists-for-murder-of-kerala-youth-congress-leaders-101638384436428.html

The party, however, will stay away from the Congress-led opposition strategy meetings in the wake of growing distance between the Congress and TMC, especially after the latter poached several lawmakers and senior leaders from the former in recent months.“We are there on a larger issue but maintaining our own identity,” TMC leader Saugata Ray said.Opposition members, however, have decided not to create major impediments in the functioning of the Lok Sabha. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi, however, is likely to continue its protests over the Centre’s alleged low procurement of foodgrain in Telangana in the House, the people cited above said.Opposition leaders have also decided to seek time for debate on a statutory guarantee for minimum support prices (MSP). They wanted to raise it during a debate on the bill to repeal the farm laws earlier this week, but the bill was passed without debate, triggering protests in both Houses of Parliament.

Birla requested them to maintain decorum.He said, “You are a member of the House. Senior members are speaking and you are waving placards in front of them. What decorum do you want to create in the House?”Before adjourning the House till 12 noon, Birla said, “I have given your leader enough time, ample opportunity to speak on your issue yesterday (Tuesday).”“You have come to raise slogans, you have brought placards here. This is the wrong way,” Birla said.He also asked the House to take “collective” steps to stop disruptions. “I urge the Houses to make a collective effort to stop such wrong practices and traditions,” Birla said.“The House represents 130 crore people. You want to express the public’s sentiment. Question Hour is an important time. The government is ready to answer everything. You don’t want to hear the answer, this is not the right way,” Birla said.Less than 30 minutes into the Question Hour where only four questions were taken up, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings till noon even as TRS MPs continued their protests. Though the House resumed after 12 noon, the TRS MPs trooped to the Speaker’s podium and disrupted the proceedings, forcing him to adjourn the House again till 2 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behaviour-of-opposition-mps-not-justified-says-speaker-om-birla-101638383956416.html
02-12-2021||India||India’s active cases drop below 100,000 for the first time in 18 months||After a gap of nearly 18 months, the number of active cases of Covid-19 across India has dropped to fewer than 100,000 – a remarkable and encouraging statistic for a country the size of India. With 99,023 active infections across India as of Wednesday morning, the case burden on the country is at the lowest since June 2, 2020 – a time when the first wave of the pandemic was just beginning.Active cases – those Covid-19 patients still carrying the virus, and thus under treatment at the time – is a crucial metric representing any region’s battle against the coronavirus disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system. A look at how India’s prolonged fight to contain Covid-19 is reflected in this number.Steady recovery from the brutal second waveCurrently, there are 99,023 active Covid-19 cases in India. As stated above, the last time there were fewer active cases in the country was 547 days ago, when there were 94,656 such cases. But, at that time, the country’s first wave was only kicking off. This time, however, cases are declining and most importantly, are doing so at a steady pace since the peak of India’s brutal second wave of infections. Even in the trough between the first and second waves, the number of active cases in India dropped only to 137,552.The volume of active cases during India’s second wave of infections (and the first, for that matter) also provides context to how much things have improved. At its worst, there were more than 3.75 million active cases in the country on May 9. Most importantly, active infections have been declining nearly steadily since the May 9 peak – a period that now spans nearly seven months.During the first wave, active cases soared to a peak of 1.02 million, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. This means that the current active caseload, and by extension the burden on the country’s hospitals and nursing homes, is under a tenth of what the country saw during the peak for the first wave and only 3% of what it witnessed during the second wave.Where India’s active caseload is concentratedKerala, a state that has been one of the key regions that have seen a prolonged spell of the outbreak despite declining trends across the country since the second wave, continues to dominate national statistics. With 44,314 active infections, the southern state alone is responsible for 45% of the country’s active caseload. With 11,226 active cases as of Wednesday morning, Maharashtra – India’s worst-hit state –is currently home to 11% of such cases.Tamil Nadu, with 8,244 active cases, constitutes 8% of the national caseload, West Bengal (7,731 active cases) has 8% of the national tally, and Karnataka (6445) has 7% -- wrapping up the list of the country’s top five biggest states by active cases. Interestingly, Mizoram finds itself on the sixth spot in the country with 3,751 active cases (4% of the national caseload).Another interesting way of looking at this statistic is to factor in the population of the state. This lets us grasp how prevalent infected people are within a state. In such an analysis, the size of the current outbreak in the country’s North-East comes into context. With 3,147 active infections per million residents, Mizoram has the biggest current outbreak in the country respective of its size. It is followed by Kerala (1,262 cases per million), Ladakh (942 cases per million), Lakshadweep (353 cases per million) and Manipur (209 cases per million). For context, there are currently 74 active cases for every million residents in India. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have the fewest such infections – 0.3 and 0.4 active cases per million, respectively.How it was achieved: Seven months of case declineThe drop in active cases has been a result of a consistent decline in daily infections in the country over the past seven months. In the week ended November 30, India reported 8,896 new cases of Covid-19 every day on average. This is the lowest that the seven-day average (a number that denotes a region’s Covid curve) has dropped to since the week ended June 6, 2020. What is even more positive, is that this trend appears to be holding – in the past week, the case curve has dropped 10%.Rate of vaccination rising againIn other good news, the rate of vaccine administration across the country appears to be rising again. In the past week, 8.1 million daily shots have been administered across the country on average. This is a considerable improvement for a drive that has been patchy for long periods – particularly going through a lull in the past month. At its best, the seven-day average of daily doses has touched 9.8 million (for the week ended September 23). For the week ended November 4, this number dropped to an average of 2.9 million— a lull that has been largely attributed to the festive season by government officials.India has administered a total of 1.24 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine to 789 million people as of Wednesday morning. Of these, 452 million people have received both doses of the vaccine, while another 337 million people have been partially vaccinated. When these numbers are seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means that 83.9% of people above the age of 18 years have received vaccine shots – 48.1% are fully vaccinated and another 35.8% partially vaccinated. 
02-12-2021||India||HTLS 2021: ‘What’s better than one gold? Two golds’||They belong to the most unique and exclusive club in India — a club that has, out of a population of over 1.3 billion people, just two members. They are the only two people who have managed to win an individual Olympic gold medal in India’s 100-year history at the Olympics — they are, of course, Abhinav Bindra and Neeraj Chopra. No wonder then, that when the two of them came together for a conversation on Day 2 of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, they discovered that they had things in common — other than that Olympic gold.“One thing that Neeraj and I have in common is that I hated sports when I was young,” Bindra said. “In school I was very talented in finding excuses to escape from anything that involved running around. I was miserable in boarding school and my father would write me a letter almost every day, and one common thing was that I need to pick up a sport.”Chopra’s origin story is similar — when one of his uncles dreamed that someone from his family of farmers should do something different, he homed in on Chopra. Egged by his him and his parents, Chopra was “forced” to go to a nearby sports stadium to pick up a sport.“For the first few months they forced me,” Chopra said in a session moderated by Hindustan Times managing editor Kunal Pradhan. “I just wanted to come back from school and sleep. But slowly I started enjoying it. Then it got to a point that if I missed training even one day, that day felt incomplete. I got hooked to it.”Like Chopra, it was the “process” that drew Bindra into shooting as his journey began under a mango tree in his coach’s garden.“I loved training,” Bindra said. “Competition was very painful for me, but training was my love. It was like meditation, the time that I got to spend with my own self, learning about myself, and it was a fascinating process.”BREAKING BARRIERSChopra told Bindra about what the former shooter’s gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics meant for him — “what he broke was a mental barrier,” Chopra said. “Physically, we all work hard, but his gold, it showed us that it was possible, how to do it, how to conduct ourselves, and that changed a mindset.“At the time he won the gold, I did not know anything about sports really,” Chopra said, “so I did not know about this. But a couple of years after I came into sports, that’s when I started learning about his gold, our sporting history.”“It was a great weight off my own shoulders,” Bindra said. “For such a long time, being the only one was very lonely. I was happier when Neeraj won, more than when I won. While it was interesting to be known as the only Olympic gold medallist from India, it was also kind of embarrassing…”Chopra recalled that warm Tokyo night — August 7—when under the blazing lights of a spectator-less stadium, he created history with his soaring throw. Did he think, when he threw 87.58m on the second of his six possible attempts, that he had wrapped it up?“No,” Chopra said, “I only knew that I when all throwers had finished all their throws that the gold was mine. To think about the gold before that, it’s tricky, because then if someone throws a really big one, and I have to come up with something even bigger, I won’t be in the right frame of mind.”COEXISTING WITH PRESSUREChopra’s gold came in his debut Olympics, at the age of 23, and Bindra said he believes there will be another first for the thrower: the first Indian to win two Olympic gold medals.“For what’s better than one Olympic gold medal?” Bindra asked. “Two gold medals!”When Chopra asked Bindra — a veteran of five Olympic Games — for some advice going forward, Bindra said that the first thing to do would be to “accept and coexist with pressure…just like we are coexisting with Covid-19”.“The big mistake athletes make is that they try and run from the pressure, they make strategies on how to resist it, but that only makes things tougher,” he said. “The other thing is that we have to take the risk to get out of our comfort zone and get better, even when things are going well for us. We need to have the courage to change. Tiger Woods had the courage to change his swing when he was at his peak. Unfortunately, in sports you can’t stay still. It’s about your next performance. You reached a peak in Tokyo, so how do you get to the next peak? You need to come down, and climb again.”Chopra said that for him, there was something more than Olympic gold in his sport that drove him—the distance that he can get on his javelin.“I can keep shifting the goal,” he said.“When I first threw 70, I was very happy. When I threw 80, I was overjoyed. Then I threw 88. There is another goal now. The Olympic record is 90.58—that could be my goal. I can definitely throw longer (than his current best, 88.07m). The last two years, there was an injury, there was Covid, the time went past. Now my coach and I, we have talked, and he has drawn up a detailed plan with a distance in mind and my job is to follow that plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2021-what-s-better-than-one-gold-two-golds-101638383715783.html
02-12-2021||India||Parliament winter session: MPs’ suspension continues to rock House proceedings||Fierce protests continued to rock the Rajya Sabha in the ongoing winter session of Parliament for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, even as the Lok Sabha returned to partial normalcy by allowing the passage of The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020.Proceedings in the Rajya Sabha were disrupted amid unrelenting protests by opposition members over the issue of suspension of 12 MPs due to their “unruly” behaviour in the Monsoon Session. The suspended MPs, meanwhile, held sit-in protests near the Mahatma Gandhi statue in the premises of Parliament.Also Read | Parliament winter session: Opposition plans to continue protest in Rajya Sabha for a weekOpposition members demanded that the House take up the issue of suspension even as chairman Venkaiah Naidu reiterated that the MPs had “not expressed remorse” for the “sacrilege”.“It is sacrilege of the House, I have said (on the conduct of the 12 suspended MPs during the last session in August). There is no remorse by members who have really insulted the parliamentary system,” Naidu said.“…Coming to the well of the House, climbing on the table, throwing papers, snatching papers from the minister and also challenging the Chair... doing everything which is unparliamentary, undemocratic and they have no remorse. What can we do?” he added.Amid the protests, opposition members did not allow Union minister for Jal Shakti, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who was moving The Dam Safety Bill, 2019 for consideration in the House, to complete his speech.Also Read | Piyush Goyal defends suspension of 12 MPs, demands apologyCongress leaders wanted leader of opposition, Mallikarjun Kharge be allowed to speak on the suspension of the legislators.The protesting opposition members trooped into the well of the House and continued their sloganeering.The House was adjourned twice in the first half before getting adjourned for the day a little after 3 pm after Shekhawat introduced the Dam Safety Bill.“The government has not reached out to us. They have not initiated any dialogue,” Communist Party of India’s Binoy Visam, who is among the suspended MPs, said.Opposition members, who are united against the suspension of the MPs, asserted that the government will have to break the deadlock.“There has been no response to the letter that the LoP (Mallikarjun Kharge) wrote to the chairman on the suspension. There is no effort from the government’s side to break the deadlock,” Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Tiruchi Siva said.In the Lok Sabha, proceedings were adjourned till noon on Wednesday amid continuous protests by members of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) over farmer issues.The Question House was disrupted after TRS leaders shouted slogans and displayed placards over low procurement of the state’s farm produce by the Centre, in the Well of the House.Speaker Om Birla told the protesting members it was not the right thing to do and emphasised that the Question Hour was important.“When a senior member is speaking, you (people) are protesting... what kind of practice are you trying to bring into the House?”“Your behaviour in the House is not right, it is wrong and the House cannot run like this... I had given you time to raise the issue,” Birla added.Later in the day, as normalcy returned for a brief period, the Lower House passed the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-winter-session-mps-suspension-continues-to-rock-house-proceedings-101638383598122.html
02-12-2021||India||No checks on net shutdowns in India, govt must explore app blocking: House panel||The government should explore the possibility of banning particular internet services, such as messengers like WhatsApp and social media websites like Facebook, instead of putting in place blanket internet bans, a panel looking into shutdown of telecommunications and their impact said in its report to Parliament.The standing committee on communications and information technology, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, made close to a dozen specific recommendations, including for the government to lay down standard operating procedures and for assessments to be done on whether such shutdowns work at all.The recommendations were based on what the committee said was huge impact of such shutdowns, which curtailed access to critical services. “The committee notes that internet is of immense importance in the present digital era. It is the lifeline which is propelling businesses and services, permitting students to enrol for important examination, and enabling home delivery of essentials,” it said in its report.In particular, the committee said that the government must “lay down a clear cut principle of proportionality and procedure for lifting of shutdowns so that these are not extended indefinitely even when the situation comes under control affecting the life and liberty of people”.The panel said it found rules were lacking in clarity, the mechanisms did not include adequate safeguards, and there was limited consultation and oversight in the process. A standing committee’s report is not binding for the government to accept, but if it does not, it will need to outline reasons for not doing so in writing.The committee’s members visited Jammu and Kashmir as it looked into the issue, particularly after the internet shutdown there drew criticism and the intervention of the Supreme Court.“The committee notes that under the present mechanism... no parameters have been laid down to decide the merit or justice of the telecom/internet shutdowns. Internet shutdowns have been ordered purely on the basis of subjective assessment and reading of the ground situations by district-level officer and is largely based on executive decisions,” it said. “The committee, therefore, recommend that a proper mechanism is put in place at the earliest to decide on the merit or appropriateness of telecom/internet shutdowns.”According to a March 2021 assessment by advocacy group Access Now, India “shut down the internet more than any other nation — a total of at least 109 times” out of 105 countries from where data was collated. “It’s quite a strong indictment of the problem and the government’s approach to internet shutdowns is bringing India global infamy. The report enumerates issues of arbitrariness and the overreach, and it takes a position to call on the government to take action in specific ways to address problems. The report has been adopted by its members across party lines so if the government chooses to ignore this entirely, it will be concerning,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at Access Now, which coordinates the KeepItOn campaign against internet shutdowns across the world.The panel also noted that there was no centralised data on such orders and that many states did not yet have a review committee. It proposed that “both the department of telecommunications (DoT) and the ministry of home affairs should establish a mechanism at the earliest to maintain a centralised database of all internet shutdown orders in the country” with the reasons and duration for shutdown, the details about the decision of the competent authority, the decision of the review committees and whether any shutdown was ordered by resorting to Section 144 of CrPC. The panel particularly flagged the issue of several states using CrPC section 144 to order internet shutdowns when the proper channel would be to invoke the telecom suspension rules.The committee also said the review committees, which vet suspension orders, must be restructured. “There is a need to make the Review Committees more broadbased by including more non-official members such as retired judges, members of the public etc. so as to enable them to gauge the situation in the right broadest possible perspective and provide a critical and objective assessment of the ground situation,” the report said.The panel suggested that the government carry out assessments to determine whether there are any benefits to internet shutdowns from a law-and-order perspective and study how other democratic countries approach such rules.“The committee are of the view that one of the best mechanisms to deal with any law and order situation is the ability of the law enforcement agency to quickly respond to the crisis. Internet shutdown 57 cannot be a substitute for enforcing law and order,” it said.In its final recommendation, it asked DoT to explore whether it was technically feasible to block some services instead of the internet connectivity as a while. “The committee feel that it will be of great relief if the department can explore the option of banning of selective services, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc instead of banning the internet as a whole. This will allow financial services, health, education and various other services to continue to operate for business as usual thereby minimising inconvenience and suffering to the general public and also help in controlling spreading of misinformation during unrest. Adoption of such less restrictive mechanisms will be a welcome initiative,” it said.
02-12-2021||India||Resumption of regular international flights put on hold||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday postponed the full resumption of commercial international passenger flight services that was planned to start from December 15, citing the threat from the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) of the coronavirus.Several countries have imposed travel bans on people who have visited countries with confirmed cases of the VOC, with some even shutting their borders to all foreign arrivals. India has instituted a mandatory test-on-arrival and seven-day home quarantine for people coming in from 12 regions, including all of Europe.“In view of the emerging situation, we are postponing the resumption of international flight operations. We will, however, continue flights under the air bubble agreement,” said DGCA director general Arun Kumar told HT.Prime Minister Narendra Modi first suggested the government reconsider the December 15 reopening when he held a meeting to review the threat from Omicron on Saturday. India has air bubble agreements with 28 countries including some that ar part of the 12, including the UK, Netherlands, France and Germany. Earlier on Wednesday, DGCA issued a circular and said it was monitoring the situation related to Omicron and would notify the date of full resumption of commercial international passenger services accordingly.“In view of the global scenario with the emergence of the new variant of concern, the situation is being watched closely in consultation with all stakeholders and an appropriate decision indicating the effective date of resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services shall be notified in due course,” DGCA said in the circular.The World Health Organisation on Friday classified Omicron as a VOC after initial analysis showed it to carry an unusually large number of mutations, which could make it more resistant, more virulent (leading to severe disease), and perhaps more transmissible. Scientists in several parts of the world are carrying out tests and monitoring epidemic trends, especially in South Africa where most of the cases have been found, to establish if this is indeed the case. The VOC designation came on the day India said it will allow the full schedule of regular international flights to resume with all countries considered “not at risk” from December 15. The guidelines were on Monday revised and mandated all international travellers arriving in India to declare a 14 days’ travel history and upload their negative RT-PCR test reports. Airlines have been asked to ensure that passengers have negative test reports before boarding flights.Travellers coming from countries “at-risk” will have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR testing on arrival. If tested negative, they will have to undergo home quarantine for seven days and get re-tested. If tested positive in the initial test or on repeat testing, the passengers will be sent to isolation facilities while their samples will be sent for genomic sequencing.A random 2% of the travellers coming from countries other than those classified as “at-risk” will undergo RT-PCR testing at the airports on arrival. If they are found to have Covid-19, their samples will be sent for genome testing for the Omicron variant and treatment shall be conducted as per protocols. If tested negative the traveller will be asked to monitor health for at least the next 14 days.Travel industry experts said they expected the step to be taken and will wait for more clarity.Prashant Pitti, co-founder, EaseMyTrip said, “We understand the importance of taking precautionary actions and minimizing the risk of the spread to ensure the safety of everyone. We are hopeful to see normalcy in international travel as soon as the situation is safer.”Indiver Rastogi, president and country head, global business travel, Thomas Cook India & SOTC said: “While as a precautionary measure, the announcement to hold back restart of scheduled international flights planned for December 15th, is not unexpected, we look forward to a review once more data/clarity on the new variant is received from health experts/authorities.”Rastogi added, “Despite the current capacity constraints and resultant high airfares, consumer demand for travel has not abated and both our air and hospitality partners are witnessing significant high occupancy/loads this winter season.”Scientists have said that a lot remains to be determined about the VOC. “We don’t know many things about this variant yet. How much more transmissible is it? How virulent is it? How well will vaccines protect against it?” said professor Akiko Iwasaki, professor of immunobiology at Yale University, during the session on Covid-19 at Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Tuesday. “But what we do know is it has a lot of mutations. Therefore any pre-existing immunity from vaccines or a past infection may be less effective in preventing and disease,” she added.According to an analysis of case and hospitalisation numbers in Guateng province -- the region where most cases of Omicron have been found in South Africa -- by the Financial Times, while infections have risen far faster than past waves, the rate of hospitalisations was in step with past surges, suggesting it may only be as virulent as the other variants or even less severe. However, the findings are preliminary and could be skewed by infections being in younger people this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resumption-of-regular-international-flights-put-on-hold-101638383536371.html
02-12-2021||India||Assam: Lynching accused killed while trying to flee, say police||The prime accused in the mob lynching case of a student leader in Jorhat district of Assam was killed in an accident on the early hours of Wednesday while trying to escape from police custody, the police said.Niraj Das, alias Kola Lora, was among 13 people arrested by police in connection with the death of Animesh Bhuyan, an office bearer of All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) on Monday in a busy area of Jorhat town.The death of the accused was followed by a cryptic message by the state’s special director general of police (law and order) GP Singh who tweeted: “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction -- Newton’s third law”.Singh’s tweet was shared by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma with the message: “Assam will be free of crime and criminal, come what may”. Jorhat police superintendent Ankur Jain tweeted: “Niraj Das @ Kola Lora, you can’t escape every time”.According to officials, Das, a known criminal with a past record of drug trafficking, was taken by a police team to locate a consignment of drugs (which he had claimed to have kept hidden) when he fought with the accompanying policemen and jumped out from the vehicle.“During interrogation, he informed us about a consignment of drugs. Our team took him to recover it, but when the vehicle reached an empty stretch of road on outskirts of Jorhat, he managed to jump out of the moving vehicle. The incident happened around 2.10am,” said Jorhat police superintendent Jain.“Das was hit by the police escort vehicle which was following the vehicle carrying him. Our driver tried to avoid hitting him, but couldn’t. The driver of the vehicle also lost control and hit a nearby wall injuring three policemen. An injured Das was rushed to Jorhat Medical College Hospital (JMCH) where he was declared brought dead,” he added.Das is believed to have led a mob of nearly 20 people who assaulted Animesh Bhuyan and two of his acquaintances- Mridusmanta Mahanta (a journalist) and Pranay Dutta (another AASU leader)- on Monday over suspicion of them hitting his father Mohan Das, who was riding a scooter, with their vehicle.Police investigation has revealed that Mohan Das lost his balance and fell down. But, when Bhuyan, Mahanta and Dutta sought to help him, Mohan shouted that his scooter was hit by the trio’s car. This led to a mob gathering at the spot that brutally assaulted the three.A video, which went viral, showed a group of men, including Niraj Das assaulting Bhuyan in the middle of the road. A police team reached the spot and took the student leader to JMCH, where he was declared dead. The two others, Mahanta and Dutta, who sustained injuries, were released after treatment.On Tuesday, police produced 12 of the 13 accused in a local court, where seven of them were sent to police custody for five days, and the others to judicial custody. Niraj Das wasn’t produced in court on Tuesday.Reacting to Niraj’s death, human rights activist Dibyajyoti Saikia said: “We have seen a rise in so-called encounter deaths in Assam in the past few months. Though the Jorhat incident wasn’t an encounter, the escape of an accused from police custody and his death after allegedly getting hit by a police vehicle is bound to raise questions.”“The entire incident was the outcome of a lynching in which the accused was involved. We need to think of enacting an anti-lynching legislation for Assam. Slow pace of trial and faulty investigation which results in acquittal of criminals have eroded public faith in the justice system and that’s why when accused persons get killed even when they are in police custody, it is applauded by a section. We need to see that rule of law prevails and justice is delivered by courts and not on the roads.”
02-12-2021||India||GST receipts ₹1.31 lakh crore in Nov, 2nd best so far||Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in November this year surged to over ₹1.31 lakh crore, the second highest since the new tax regime was launched in July 2017, signalling increased compliance, and robust and sustained recovery of business activities after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic .This is the fifth consecutive month in which collections have crossed the ₹1 lakh crore benchmark.Also Read | Oct GST revenue hits new high at ₹1.3L-crThe indirect tax collections, a weathervane of economic health, also crossed ₹1.3 lakh crore for the second month in a row; the data comes a day after the country’s statistics office released data that showed that the economy grew at 8.4% in the second quarter ended September on the back of increased public spending, exports and agriculture.Together, the two, analysts said, show that the economic performance has surpassed the pre-pandemic level. According to data released by the Union finance ministry on Wednesday, the GST revenue in November (for transactions in October) at ₹1,31,526 crore is 25% higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year and 27% over the 2019 value. The highest ever GST collection of ₹1,41,384 crore was reported in April, ahead of the second wave.The value plunged below the benchmark in June ( ₹92,849 crore) because of a Covid-19 resurgence in April and May this year. The June collection figure indicates the volume of business transactions that took place in May. In May this year, most of the states were under complete or partial lockdown due to the second wave.MS Mani, partner at consulting firm Deloitte India, said GST revenues are in sync with the economic growth figures and reflect sustained economic recovery along with increased compliances. “There has been a significant increase in the GST surveillance activities in recent times based on the data available with the GSTN, these would have also contributed to the increased collections, over and above the economic growth, which is the key driver of GST collections.” GST Network (GSTN) is the IT backbone of the indirect tax regime.The recent trend of high GST revenues is the result of various policy and administrative measures that have been taken in the past to improve compliance, the finance ministry said in a statement. “Central tax enforcement agencies, along with the state counterparts have detected large tax evasion cases, mainly cases relating to fake invoices, with the help of various IT tools developed by GSTN that use the return, invoice and e-way bill data to find suspicious taxpayers.”In the past year, the GST regime took several initiatives to increase compliance such as enhancing system capacity, nudging non-filers, facilitating auto-population of returns, blocking of e-way bills and stopping input-tax credits to unscrupulous entities.Experts are, however, cautious due to the threat of new Covid variant -- Omicron, which may impact the global economy. Rajat Bose, partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co said, “The collections of November are indicative of a robust economic growth. The collections should continue to see a rise in the months to come, if we don’t see another wave in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-receipts-1-31-lakh-crore-in-nov-2nd-best-so-far-101638383535740.html
02-12-2021||India||Parliament winter session: No data on farmers’ death during protest, says govt||The Union government on Wednesday told Parliament it has no data on farmers who died during the year-long protests against the three farm laws repealed on November 29, sparking criticism from the Opposition and farm unions.In a written reply to six related questions, including whether the Centre proposes to provide financial assistance to the kin of farmers who died during the agitation, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government did not have any record of farmers who died during the protests and therefore there was no question for compensation to their families.
