The toll due to covid-19 remains at 16,275, with a case fatality rate of 2.1%.Experts have attributed the spike in cases to the possible beginning of the third wave in Mumbai.

30-12-2021||Pune||The year that was 2021: Pune metro, PMC’s property tax scheme gives hope; Covid-19 threat still looms large||As another pandemic-ridden year nears its end, here are some of the biggest stories from the city in 2021. Not all of these stories were positive, but the impact they had on the citizens was huge. As you go through these stories, you will realise that while there is hope for a better future in 2022, there are some warning signs as well. Covid, politics, Pune metro and crime were understandably the top topics of the year.Covid and vaccination campaign At the beginning of 2021 when everything was looking positive with Covid case tally on the decline and most of the restrictions being lifted, things changed suddenly as the second wave hit Pune. The number of cases and fatalities were quite high compared to first wave, and as a result, Covid dominated the year most. If 2020 was disastrous, 2021 was even worse. During the year, Pune district saw over 12,350 fatalities due to Covid, much higher than 2020 when the number was 7,767. At the same time, close to 793,000 persons were infected with the virus this year as against 372,655 infections in 2020. These were not just the numbers, Covid robbed many families of their near and dear ones. In some cases, virus claimed entire families as citizens witnessed health infrastructure such as beds, oxygen and medicines falling short. Although the first wave helped city ramp up its bed capacity, the surge in number of cases during 2021 exposed lacunas on the delivery front involving city and district administration. In January, India also began its ambitious vaccination campaign against COVID-19, one of the largest in the world. Starting with healthcare workers and frontline workers, the vaccination programme was gradually opened for all adults in the country. Infra projects drove Pune’s realty On the infrastructure front, the Pune Metro project, which was first mooted in 2002, completed five years of its foundation laying event in 2021 which saw the Prime Minister in attendance. The hope offered by the leaders- Pune metro to begin operations in 2021. Five years since, the on-ground reality is different. In reality, only 50 per cent work has been completed as the year ends. If operations on priority stretch – between Sant Tukaram nagar to Phugewadi - have been deferred multiple times due to the incomplete work; the mass exodus of migrant labours during May-June has only delayed the project that promises to be panacea for Pune city in absence of robust mass transport. For a city with over 50 lakh population (including that of Pimpri-Chinchwad) commutating through daily traffic jams, inferior air and poor roads is a daily woe no less than punishment. All this aggravates when the city streets flood every now and then even with a few centimetres of rain, something that Puneites meekly watch – and move on. At the same time, not much happened on the airport front as the government reconsidered its decision and explored another site for the proposed airport at Purandar. Though it could not settle for that too. While the existing airport at Lohegaon was also partially operational during some months of the year, while it had to be completely closed for two weeks ahead of Diwali. In the case of multilevel flyovers’; work at Chandani chowk was inaugurated by union minister Nitin Gadkari three years ago, the work of which only picked up momentum only this year. However, work of the proposed Katraj-Kondhwa road widening did not have any development. Political heat rises During a penultimate year for elections at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), differences among the ruling establishment and the opposition at local level often came to fore with both sides indulging into harsh criticism. However, at the same time, there were occasions when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as ruling party, and main opposition Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), joined hands, particularly on issues of big projects. At the same time, NCP and Shiv Sena also hinted at joining hands for upcoming municipal polls, while the Congress’ local leadership is still firm on going solo, although the three parties share power in state under the banner of Maha Vikas Aghadi. The year’s highlight was also the new swanky offices that the NCP and BJP constructed. With this, party offices of Congress, NCP and BJP have come closer. During the last month of the year, the BJP sounded beguile for polls by bringing Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Shah attended various programmes including PMC premises event where foundation stone for Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue was laid while another statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was inaugurated. Best of PMC is yet to come Among the issues that mostly dominated this year, was the proposal to rent out amenity spaces in the city. Although the BJP was insistent on it, other parties and environmentalist opposed it, which eventually led the civic body to not go ahead. The PMC after opposition from local population had to put on hold the proposal to redevelop Taljai hills, which included developing some theme parks. During July this year,the PMC started its special air-conditioned bus service running through some of the most congested parts of Pune central. The highlight of this new bus transport service is its fare. The PMC-controlled public transport body, PMPML will charge only ₹10 for a ticket that will be valid for the entire day and a commuter can travel to any central parts of the city. For now, the service has received a positive response from the people. The PMC with the help of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) also managed to initiate work at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) square where an existing flyover had to be demolished due to proposed metro rail work. On the property tax front, PMC did a commendable job as it increased its revenue due to the amnesty scheme it offered. However, the 24x7 equatable water supply scheme was a complete mess as the project is moving at slow pace, while the roads dug up at various places in peth areas has caused great inconvenience to the people. Considering that, the PMC is all set for elections early next year. Violent crime up slightly in Pune this year City’s crime record during 2021 was rocked with series of firing incidents in the last three months of the year. There were five incidents with criminal on record killed in some cases. There were isolated murder cases too. The year began with news about the death of a woman who was connected with former minister Sanjay Rathod. Although her death never turned into an FIR as police only registered it as an accidental death case, the minister had to resign after criticism from several quarters including the BJP. The cyber offences have also seen increase on year-on-year basis with rise in use of digital mode for transactions. For city police, the last month of the year turned good as they cracked a series of recruitment and paper leak cases while uncovering a big nexus of agents, officials and private firms responsible to hold exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/the-year-that-was-2021-pune-metro-pmc-s-property-tax-scheme-gives-hope-covid-19-threat-still-looms-large-101640887484650.html

While the lounge can be used by students visiting the office of DSW (Dean Students Welfare), they can use the e-rickshaw to move freely within the campus. The move is also part of our aim for a clean vehicle-free campus,” said the VC.Rai moved to Lucknow University as V-C from Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in 2019, at a time when the LU administration was marred with allegations of financial and academic mismanagement. Since then, Lucknow University celebrated its centennial year and has managed to steer clear of trouble even in tough Covid-19 times. The working sphere of the varsity has also expanded considerably from Lucknow to four other districts.The university has managed its finances well and has rejuvenated the academia from Diploma to D. Litt, which now will cater to the requirements of modern age students, claimed V-C. V-C said that ordinances have been passed for all these newly designed courses. LU is the first university amongst all the state universities to get NIRF (National Institutes Ranking Framework) ranking and is the new NEP (National Education Policy) complied institution of the country.“In the coming year, the university plans to overcome the deficiency of faculty members in different departments. University will focus on human resource rejuvenation, would try to secure a better rank in NIRF, and get NAAC accreditation. Effective measures will be taken for the better utilisation of available infrastructure such as redesigning the auditoriums in different departments to strengthen the soul of the university,” said the VC. Jump in enrolment of foreign studentsThe LU saw a considerable jump in foreign students taking admission in the last two years. In the session 2021-22, 357 foreign students enrolled themselves in different courses of the university, which is around a 100% jump in comparison to the 2020-21 session.The spike in enrolment of foreign students helps boost the brand of the university, said the V-C. The LU’s admission notification is now communicated electronically to all the foreign embassies.Increase in digital footprintThe number of visitors to the refurbished website of the university, which was launched last year in April, has doubled in a short period. All the department of LU and offices have their YouTube channel and Twitter account.

Bapat said, “The shifting of FDA office from PMRDA building in Aundh to Moshi will be a faraway location for both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/girish-bapat-opposes-shifting-of-fda-office-from-aundh-guruwar-peth-101640885680295.html

The doubling rate, which was 2,820 days last week, has come down to 1,033 days. The active cases, too, have increased from 327 to 688 cases.Meanwhile, the average testing has remained almost the same. Last week, it was 10,506 testing per day average, which is now 10,795 per day.“The testing that NMMC conducts is the highest in the state. There is no reason why this should not be considered as the beginning of the third wave. Looking at it, the cases are increasing. People should, by now, understand that the third wave was not media hype but a reality. It is a trend that is seen in countries across the world and it is time that people understand that everything is normal yet. The New Year celebrations should be done strictly with Covid protocols, which by now is known to even the children,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Even as there is a rise in the cases, around 60% of the cases are asymptomatic. “Most of the asymptomatic cases are found to be negative in the antigen test and hence we have increased the capacity of the RT-PCR. With the increasing number of Omicron cases in Navi Mumbai and also the overall cases, structural, fire and oxygen audit of all the hospitals have been ordered,” Bangar added.The primary centre for admission will remain to be the CIDCO exhibition hall. Radha Swamy Satsang Hall, which was used during the second wave, was shut after the cases decreased. If needed, the hall would be used again, Bangar said.Dr GD Pol Institute and Mayuresh building would also be kept ready with the beds for use if the cases increase.“Even as the cases have increased, there is no surge in critical cases. The per day demand of the oxygen remains to be around 1.5 tons to 2 tons daily since last one month. During the second wave, the highest demand was around 18-20 tons per day. Currently, we are in a position to provide around nine tons per day,” Babasaheb Rajale, oxygen nodal officer, said.On July 25, 2021, there were 107 cases reported, which was the last time the 100-mark was breached. Now on Wednesday, 165 cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-positive-cases-in-navi-mumbai-cross-100-for-first-time-since-july-101640884065430.html

He would take care of their educational expenses till their studies are completed.Although schools were resumed, these students were not able to attend due to several financial issues. To solve this problem, Harne has come forward and adopted these children and pledged that they complete their education.As schools have resumed all over the Thane district, every school teacher (both government and private) from the rural areas is trying his/her best to convince and get the school children back to school and to encourage them to study.In the same way, supervisors of NEW English School, Junior College of Dolkhamb noticed that before the pandemic they had more than 1,500 students in their school from Classes 5 to 12.But, even after three weeks of school resuming, only 1,000 to 1,200 students rejoined the school. Being the only semi-English school and college in the area, its principal, Pushplata Thakur, decided to find the root cause of it.The students were coming to this school from Chinchpada, Khokarwadi, Dehane, Dolkhamb, Katkariwadi, Jambhulwadi, Ranvihir and Talwade adivasi villages which are almost 8km to 10km away and it is the only school near them.Supervisor of the school, Madhukar Harne, said, “We decided to reach the house of every child who is absent and find the reason behind it. More than 300 children have been found having financial problems. All these families have lost their jobs and lost their farm cultivation due to heavy rain. They don’t have minimum grains to survive and the only way to get out of the situation is to earn money with any kind of daily work. The school is so far away, how will they travel by bus? We teachers decided to give them travelling expenses but we also have a shortage of money and we discussed this problem with Harne. He decided to bear all the expenses of the students whose conditions were extremely poor.”Hiraman Pardhi, a 17-year-old, was happy to send his sister, Shobha Pardhi of Class 9 to the school. Pardhi said, “We are residents of Chinchwadi. The school is 8km away. There are nine members in my family including three children. We are struggling each day to earn ₹10 or ₹20 collectively. I was very disheartened when school started and my talented sister who loves to study could not go to school. She passed with an ‘A’ grade all these years. She loves English and teaches other children in my village. To travel 8km, we didn’t have money. She had to spend the whole day in school and we cannot earn enough for our family. But as Harne has adopted her, she can go to school for half a day and work for the rest of the day.”Harne said, “Being a farmer, I know all of us have faced huge losses in the rain. Adivasi people here do not have another source of earning. Therefore, I decided at least the needy children in these areas should not be deprived of education and therefore I took this decision. I will provide expenses for school, travelling and books for 51 children. The happiness on these children’s faces was phenomenal when they joined their first class. All of us should come forward for their education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmersocial-worker-adopts-51-children-s-educational-expenses-in-shahapur-101640883100294.html

30-12-2021||Lucknow||Covid-19 booster shots: Preparations begin to administer third dose to medical, frontline workers||Following the Central government’s instructions to administer booster dose of Covid-19 vaccines amid concern over the highly transmissible variant Omicron, preparations have begun in earnest to administer the doses to medical professionals, frontline health staff and senior citizens with comorbidities in Prayagraj and Pratapagrh districts from January 10, 2022, informed district medical and health officials. Similarly, preparations to administer the vaccine to 15 to 18-year-olds from January 3, 2022, are also underway, they added.Officials claimed that a major challenge in this direction are those frontline and health workers who have not yet got the second dose of the vaccine. They have been asked to get their second shots by December 31 at all costs. Such individuals are being identified and being contacted personally by the department in this regard, informed a senior district health official.District immunisation officer, Prayagraj Dr Tirath Lal said that so far 35,172 health workers of the district have been immunised, along with 43,228 frontline workers, which include employees of the police, revenue and municipal departments and others. “Now, all of them would be given the third booster dose of the vaccine from around January 10. Those individuals who have been administered the two shots of the vaccine and suffer from comorbidities would also be administered the third dose of the Covishield or Covaxin,” he explained.These persons are now being informed about this through their contact numbers available with the district medical and health department, he explained.Around 3,000 health workers and 5,000 frontline workers, who have not taken their second shots, are also being asked to get their booster shots immediately, Dr Lal said.Meanwhile, school and madarsa officials are also being contacted to ensure that a maximum of 15 to 18-year-olds take their first shots in the first week of January, as soon as the districts start immunisation drive. These teens would get their jabs on the premises of their schools themselves, officials say.In Pratapgarh district too, preparations have begun in earnest. Here too, the plan is to kick-start administering the Covid vaccine to 15 to 18-year-olds from January 3 and the third dose to medical professionals, frontline health staff and senior citizens with comorbidities from January 10, 2022. “The data of the people to be immunised will be prepared development block wise and sent to the community and primary health centres (CHCs and PHCs) by the district medical and health department. The plan is to set up separate booths for this at the CHCs and PHCs of the district, shared assistant district immunisation officer,” Pratapgarh Dr Mahesh Kumar Singh.He said that the 15 to 18 years old would be administered Covaxin in accordance with the government’s instructions. 
30-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah says no bahubalis, only Bajrangbali under Yogi rule in UP||Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday blamed Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav for glorifying Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the run-up to assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, and said there were no bahubalis but only Bajrangbali was present every where under Yogi rule .Addressing a rally in Aligarh, Amit Shah asked people not to vote for those who remember Jinnah, who had divided the nation. Such people did not remember the late Kalyan Singh, who sacrificed his chief minister’s post for cause of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the home minister said.Amit Shah reached Aligarh for the public meeting after addressing another rally in Moradabad. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and Union minister of state Arjun Ram Meghwal shared the stage with the Union home minister who remembered Swami Haridas, Rishi Vishwamitra, prominent Jat leader and freedom fighter Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, poet Gopal Dass Neeraj and Kalyan Singh for their Aligarh connect.Amit Shah alleged that it was the Samajwadi Party regime which opened fire on kar sevaks in Ayodhya in 1990 and resorted to lathi-charge when former BJP president Lal Krishna Advani was leading the “rath yatra” during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.“On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did “bhoomi pujan” for Ram temple in Ayodhya (on August 5, 2020). Akhilesh Babu can try his best, but in a few months, there would be a sky-high temple of Prabhu Sri Ram in Ayodhya as is the desire of crores of Ram bhakts,” said Shah.“There were bahubalis (mafias) snatching land from the poor in the Samajwadi Party regime, but under Yogi Adityanath’s rule, there are no bahubalis and only bajrangbali (the Hindu god Hanuman) is present everywhere in Uttar Pradesh,” he said.Referring to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi as “behenji” travelling across UP these days, Amit Shah recollected that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was in Aligarh to address public meeting in a previous election and was planning to have a factory for potatoes.“Rahul Gandhi is not aware that potatoes do not come from factory, but are grown on land,” Shah said.Comparing Samajwadi Party with BJP, Shah said that SP stood for triple P i.e. Pariwarvad (dynasty rule), Pakshpat (​favouritism) and Palayan (exodus) while BJP represented triple V —Vikas (development), Vyapar (trade) and Virasat (heritage). “Can BSP, SP and their leaders Bua (Mayawati) and Babua (Akhilesh) do any good to UP? Can they provide free ration, toilets, medicines and electricity to the poor in the state? It is only Narendra Modi who can do so and has done it. There is huge turnout for Jan Vishwas Yatra of BJP in the state and it is enough to communicate to Akhilesh Yadav that he can try what he can, but the BJP is winning more than 300 seats in the UP assembly elections,” said Amit Shah.He also said, “The Congress, the BSP and the Samajwadi Party all were against abolition of Article 370 in Kashmir, but Narendra Modi scrapped it on August 5, 2019. Prime Minister Modi gave a befitting reply to terrorism by carrying out surgical strikes within Pakistan.” 
30-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah takes swipe at Mayawati, says she needs to step out as polls are here||Union home minister Amit Shah on a whirlwind tour of Uttar Pradesh (UP) continued to play up the temple theme and target the main opposition Samajwadi Party, though on Thursday he also picked on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, claiming that she was “afraid” and yet to join her party’s campaign in the poll bound state. At a public meeting in Moradabad during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’, said the BSP chief was yet to shake off the cold. “Behenji ki toh abhi thand hi nahin udi hai ... woh bhaiybhit hain .. behenji chunaav aa gaya hai, thoda bahut bahar nikaliye, baad main ye na kehna ki maine prachaar nahi kiya tha (behenji hasn’t shaken off the cold yet. She is afraid. Behenji elections are here, now step out a little else don’t say later that you didn’t campaign),” Shah said in his first sharp, pointed attack on Mayawati during the 2022 UP campaign. Shah’s attack had a context. While SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has been touring the state as part of the Samajwadi Party’s ‘Vijay Rath yatra’, Congress general secretary and her party’s UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi too has been actively campaigning across the state. The BSP’s campaign so far has been largely focused on party’s national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, a point Shah chose to highlight in the UP campaign. He claimed that even if “bua, babua aur behen (referring to Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi)” contest jointly, they won’t be able to stop the BJP. Shah, who also addressed public meetings in Aligarh and Unnao, cited his government’s decision to do away with the instant triple talaq (Islamic divorce) law as proof that the BJP didn’t engage in appeasement but cared for all. “Our political opponents are getting stomach ache over the decision and asking us why we did that. I want to ask why Muslim mothers and sisters didn’t have any rights? Akhileshji, Muslim women too have seen how much you opposed (the scrapping of triple talaq),” Shah said while accusing the SP chief of appeasement politics.Claiming that against 700 riots under Samajwadi Party rule, the BJP rule was free of riots, Shah pointed out a battalion of Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) would be set up in western UP’s Shamli district. The 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots had started from nearby Shamli.“You know that with PAC around, there are no riots and now in case of any need, one needn’t requisition PAC from Lucknow,” Amit Shah said.Decoding Shah’s political messaging, BJP said that the reference to PAC was also aimed at highlighting how previous governments, especially the SP one, treaded the path of appeasement for vote bank concerns. Shah also coined NIZAM, an Urdu word which he explained meant ‘rule’.“UP doesn’t need bua, babua’s ‘Nizam’ for that meant Naseemuddin (Siddiqui), Imran (Masood), Azam (Khan) and Mukhtar Ansari,” he said. Naseemuddin Siddiqui, a former Mayawati aide is now with Congress. Imran Masood is a Congress leader who made news for a disparaging remark on PM Narendra Modi in 2014. Azam Khan is a senior Samajwadi Party leader, currently in Sitapur jail while mafia turned politician Mukhtar Ansari, a BSP lawmaker, is also behind bars. He also talked the ‘ABC’ of politics – coining ‘LAB’ to claim ‘loot, atankwaad (terrorism), bhrastachaar (corruption)’ under non BJP rule, ‘PPP’ (parivarvaad (dynastic politics), pakshpaat (nepotism) aur palayan (exodus) syndrome to describe SP rule. In contrast, BJP had “VVV” that meant focus on ‘vikas (development) aur sanskritik virasat (cultural heritage)”. Amit Shah, who is set to visit Ayodhya on Friday, said, “Akhilesh ji no power on earth can now stop a grand Ram temple from coming up.” He told the audience that this has been possible as people provided BJP with a clear majority in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Shah also slammed Akhilesh for praising Pakistani founder Jinnah and said in west UP, “Jinnah nahi ganne ki baat ho (talk not Jinnah but sugarcane).” “Jinnah chose Pakistan and has no business here. It’s sugarcane that matters and Yogi Adityanath government made record payment to cane farmers,” he added.

They believe that to make better citizens of the country, one must know the Indian Constitution. They would continue this for another month and would also perform at various locations on the New Year’s eve.Seven group members in the age group of 25-30 years of Yug Kranti Sanskrutik Yuva Manch and Udan Shahiri Jalsa decided to start this initiative recently and after performing at least two places, they received appreciation and have also been invited to perform in different villages, cities and societies.While most youngsters all over the city are gearing up for New Year celebrations, this group is creating awareness amongst the people about their basic rights mentioned in the Constitution.Akash Pawar, a 28-year-old writer by profession, currently enrolled for Law, said, “We, as a people of this country, are literally ignoring what is being written in the Constitution for our betterment and good governance. But, due to lack of interest in knowing it, we are lagging behind. We don’t pay attention to things like whether those who are taking decisions on our behalf are fairly representing us or not, what our duties as a resident of the country are, etc. Therefore, to encourage youngsters and also in keeping touch with our authentic culture, we decided to start workshops to learn our Constitution. “As a lyricist, I and other group members who are artistes and law students, came together to frame songs to entertain people and also provide information. People liked them so much that many of them have invited us to different places to perform and also conduct workshops on the subject.”The group will start the New Year by entertaining and educating people about the same. Sharmila Joshi, a resident of Kalyan, said, “I attended the programme with my children and I feel that it is really important to reach out to people in such a manner because my children remembered some of the lines from the songs that give information about the names of our Constitution makers and the basic rights of the people of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/youth-remind-residents-of-importance-of-constitution-through-street-plays-songs-101640882080193.html

Later, they also distributed pamphlets among the drivers and others requesting them not to indulge in alcohol and other narcotics.Ajit Magdum, director of the NGO, said, “Millions of litres of alcohol are consumed in our country every year during the New Year celebrations. Some people even drive vehicles under the influence of alcohol and thereby put their lives as well as the lives of others at risk. Therefore, the message we wanted to convey by organising the programme was ‘Welcome the New Year, but not in intoxication’.“A large number of youth consume alcohol for the first time during occasions like New Year celebrations. Studies have shown that in India, 15% to 20% youth consume alcohol just for fun at first and then turn out to be addicts at a later stage of their lives. So, we tried to explain to the people that alcohol may give one momentary pleasure but it also carries a punishment for lifetime. We also gave them an idea about the diseases that one might get due to the consumption of alcohol and other narcotics.”Anvay Pratishthan was established in 2012 with a vision to curb the menace of alcohol, tobacco and drug addiction that is crippling the youth of India. They are now operating five de-addiction centres – Vashi (NNMC Hospital), Nerul (DY Patil Hospital), Turbhe (NMMC UHC, Indira Nagar), Kalamboli (CIDCO Community Centre) and Panvel (Prabhakar Patwardhan Hospital).Eighteen trained and dedicated volunteer counsellors help operate these centres. All services to addicts including counselling, medication and follow-ups are offered free of cost.“Our services provided by Anvay centres have impacted and benefited more than 3,000 addicts, helping them to alleviate their addictions. We also keep conducting different awareness programmes for the vulnerable sections of the society including the commercial sex workers and rag-pickers,” Magdum added.

30-12-2021||Lucknow||Prime Minister may launch tap water facility for Bundelkhand, Vindhyachal in New Year||Prime Minister Narendra Modi could launch the tap water facility for residents of Bundelkhand and Vindhyachal regions in the New Year. Officials of the rural water supply department have nearly completed the trial run for the scheme ahead of Modi’s likely visit. “The exact date of the VIP visit is yet to be decided but it is expected to be in the initial days of the New Year. During his visit, the Prime Minister might gift tap water to lakhs of families who reside in these regions,” a senior official said, adding that the state government has already made a request to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in this regard. On the occasion, the Prime Minister could also lay the foundation stone of about 8,000 drinking water schemes for 45 lakh families of 13,000 villages. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, several of his ministers and party leaders could also be present on the occasion for the launch of the facility that the BJP is expected to market big time in the run-up to the 2022 UP polls. The official privy to the PM’s likely visit said that the rural water supply department has completed preparations to connect more than 18 lakh families with water supply in the first phase of the Har Ghar Nal Yojana under the Jal Jeevan Mission and the Centre’s Namami Gange programme.“Once water supply is operational, millions of villagers residing in hundreds of villages of Bundelkhand and Vindhyachal regions will get clean drinking water at their homes, which will also reduce the risk of waterborne diseases that they have been exposed to in the past due to non-availability of safe potable water,” the official said. “In the villages of Sonbhadra and Mirzapur districts of Vindhyachal along with seven districts of Bundelkhand, the trial run is nearly complete. Every day, dozens of villages are being connected with tap water supply in the two regions and the feeling of relief is clearly visible on the faces of the villagers,” the official said. “Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, the government has decided to provide a functional household tap connection to people through the Har Ghar Nal Yojana. Many people in Bahadurpur and Piparat villages of Lalitpur got emotional during the trial run itself as they saw water coming from taps after decades,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prime-minister-may-launch-tap-water-facility-for-bundelkhand-vindhyachal-in-new-year-101640881540014.html

30-12-2021||Other||Bihar set to touch 100mn vaccination mark today||PATNA: Even as the government is gearing up to tackle the looming threat of a third wave and the new Omicron variant, the state is set to touch the 100 million mark in vaccination against Covid-19, said health officials.On Thursday, Bihar had administered over 99 million vaccinations by afternoon and hopes to touch the 100 million mark by December 31 evening, said additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit. The state on Thursday had recorded over 600,000 vaccinations.The figures are significant as the state had initially planned 60 million doses in six months amid supply shortages in July and has almost reached the 100 million mark as supplies improved over the months, with the government making proper arrangements to take the vaccination drive to all parts of the state.“We have reached over 96.5% of the vaccination target. The Centre had given us a target to vaccinate over 73 million people between 18 and 45 years of age, but our own door-to-door survey showed the eligible population in Bihar was just over 59 million due to migration and other reasons. Out of that, we have vaccinated over 57 million, which comes to over 96.5%. If the vaccination percentage is calculated on the basis of the Centre’s target, it comes to 78%, but we cannot vaccinate the population that is not in the state. We have also apprised the Centre about it. Similarly, the second dose can be administered only to those who have taken the first dose and we are close to 90% on that count,” said Amrit.A senior health department official said that the government might announce more curbs due to ominous signs of a third wave. “It is time for utmost precaution. Things are not looking good and by mid-January Bihar, too, may start feeling the heat, as Delta variant is still being found in the state,” he added.The Bihar government is now gearing up to vaccinate those in the 15-18 age group from January 3. Vaccination camps will be organised in high and higher secondary schools and beneficiaries can get their dose either through prior registration or they can walk in, the official said.The health and education departments will carry out the exercise, involving nearly 8.5 million adolescents. Those born after 2007 and up to 18 years of age are eligible for the dose. They will be administered two doses of Covaxin at an interval of 28 days.On the day of vaccination, all the schools have been asked to organise parent-teachers meet to disseminate information about dos and don’ts in wake of a potential new wave of Covid and the advent of the highly contagious Omicron variant. Even if schools are shut due to the spread of Covid, one school in every block will be used for vaccination and one teacher of every school will be made the nodal officer for the purpose, the official added.The additional chief secretaries of health and education departments, Amrit and Sanjay Kumar have jointly written to all the district magistrates, civil surgeons, and district education officers to ensure smooth vaccination by making proper arrangements, including the availability of adequate manpower and publicity.
30-12-2021||Patna||FIR against Tej Pratap for hiding property details in poll affidavit||An FIR (first information report) has been registered against Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav for failing to mention some of his immovable properties in his election affidavit filed during the 2020 assembly polls which he successfully contested from Hasanpur in Samastipur district, police said.The FIR has been lodged with Rosera police station on the statement of subdivisional officer Brajesh Kumar under section 125A of the Representation of People Act, 1951, which deals with electoral malpractices. In his complaint, the SDO has alleged that Tej Pratap, who had filed his nomination papers on October 13, 2020, as RJD candidate from Hasanpur, concealed his immovable properties in Gopalganj district. Sources said the Janata Dal (United) had lodged a complaint in this regard with chief election officer of Bihar, who forwarded the same to Election Commission of India (ECI). The national poll panel wrote to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). After investigation, the CBDT served a show cause notice to Tej Pratap and sought a reply within three weeks, but he failed to do so. Following this, ECI ordered Samastipur district magistrate to lodge an FIR against Yadav. In 2020 polls, Yadav had wrested Hasanpur seat from sitting JD(U) MLA Raj Kumar Roy. In 2015, he had fought his maiden election from Mahua constituency in Vaishali and won. 
30-12-2021||Patna||Polls over, panchayat rule in Bihar set for overhaul||Bihar is set to transform rural governance by gearing its panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) towards delivering at the grassroots, state’s panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary has said.In an interview to HT, Choudhary said quality of work will also be regularly monitored and accountability ensured for every rupee spent. “The emphasis now is to work with a transparent system. Panchayati Raj Bhawans are being built so that it could work as a secretariat at the grassroots level and the people could get their work done through a centralised system in panchayats. At present, there is no proper system for audit of funds, leading to non-submission of utilisation certificates or monitoring of work being done,” the minister said.Utilisation backlogChoudhary said that the report of the comptroller and auditor general has also pointed to non-submission of utilisation certificates for around ₹37,000 crore of funds spent through PRIs. “It is important to know the trail of funds spent by PRIs, but right now there is neither any engineering cell nor any mechanism for periodic auditing. For the piped water scheme alone, the department has given ₹2000 crore to the public health engineering department for execution. More funds under different schemes are coming and efforts are on to create a system for it,” he said. The minister said the government would now appoint audit officers at the block and district levels for up-to-date figures at the state level. “Now we are creating an engineering cell for executing and monitoring work, which will also track the fund flow for different schemes. There are also efforts to reduce red tape by appointing dedicated officers. The panchayati raj officers have already been notified as the new executive officers of panchayat samitis, replacing the block development officers (BDOs). Now the role of district development commissioners (DDCs) will also be curtailed with CEOs in place,” he said.Quality controlQuality has been a major constraint for the work being carried out in the panchayats and blocks, be it is the tap water scheme or the construction of rural drainage and roads. The minister said the quality aspect would be taken care of with the constitution of state quality monitor (SQM), which would supervise and inspect work down to the block and panchayat level.“The SQM will comprise retired officials from the administration and engineering fields. We have already created 131 posts. Besides, there will be 8,000 executive officers. When I assumed the charge of the department in February 2019, there were around 4,000, which will bow be increased to 8000 so that complaint redressal at the panchayat level is never disrupted due to deputation of officers for elections, Covid or any other requirement. We are also going to get 3000 more panchayat sevaks within a month in addition to around 3000 already there,” he said.The minister said that the department has also decided to ensure that the panchayat secretariat runs properly. “There will be schedule for officers from various departments to address people’s complaints and issues on assigned dates and carry forward real development work, which will pick up momentum in the coming years,” Choudhary said. Increased fund flow The minister said that under the 15th Finance Commission, the Centre would give Bihar ₹1000 crore through the panchayati raj department every year for the next five years to cater to healthcare needs in the rural areas. This will involve setting up primary health centres (PHCs), additional PHCs and health centres as well as supply of medicines. “At present, we get the work done through health department on the recommendation of the local MLAs. Now we are making provisions so that the work could be done directly through the department. The idea is to make panchayat government fully functional and accountable,” he said.Eco-friendly The department has embarked on an ambitious mission to revitalise wells and around 82,000 of them have been identified for the purpose. The minister said all new Panchayat Bhawans would now use fly ash bricks and blocks only. Earlier, traditional bricks were used, which were not eco-friendly. “Each Panchayat Bhawan costs around ₹1-1.5 crore. Around 3,000 Panchayat Bhawans are being built and more will be required. Environment protection requires major work and that can be done at the panchayat level only,” he said. 
30-12-2021||Patna||A tumultuous year for alliances in Bihar||After decimating the opposition in Lok Sabha polls in the first half of 2019 and barely managing to form the government in 2020 in state, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar was suddenly beset with numerous problems in 2021. For the Opposition Mahaghatbhandhan (Grand Alliance), the year proved to be tumultuous, with two major players of the alliance, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress, all but snapping ties. The year also saw former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s legacy split into two. The Lok Janshakti Party formed by Paswan was divided into two – the LJP (Ram Vilas) headed by his son Chirag Paswan and the LJP (National) headed by his brother and union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras --- barely eight months after his death.The ruling allianceThe 2020 assembly polls, which saw Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) underperform and BJP becoming a senior partner in the alliance, opened a new chapter in the relation between the two parties and the beginning of differences. After assembly elections, chief minister Nitish Kumar started facing more opposition from ally BJP than the opposition. To be sure, the alliance saw some friction in the past too, but the current scenario is unprecedented. BJP leaders and ministers publicly denounce the policies of a government of which they are a part. Senior NDA leaders say the baton of BJP is slowly passing on to an “aggressive bunch of young leaders” and “no longer seasoned BJP leaders like Sushil Kumar Modi and Nand Kishor Yadav are involved to modulate the pronouncements of party members.”What has added to the bitterness is the recent Niti Aayog report ranking, which puts Bihar as the poorest state. It irked the JD (U) to no end, forcing it to renew its demand for the special status. BJP only rubbed it in, with its ministers, including deputy CM Renu Devi, dismissing the demand. Differences between the two also surfaced in the Lok Sabha when BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav said the Bihar government was lagging behind in completing road projects under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). Union minister for rural development Giriraj Singh also quoted statistics to back Yadav’s claims, leaving JD(U) leaders fuming. Not only that, the BJP has been targeting government on prohibition too and demands were raised from saffron party for the review of the policy.However, the spokespersons – BJP’s Prem Ranjan Patel and JD (U)’s Neeraj Kumar — downplayed the differences. “Such differences are there in every alliances,” said Patel. “These things won’t affect health of the government,” said Neeraj Kumar, an MLA.The two parties, though, presented a united face during the bypolls for two assembly seats which JD (U) won.The Opposition allianceThe relation between the two main partners, Congress and RJD, hit a rock bottom during the bypolls with angry exchanges. Congress’s Bihar in-charge Bhakt Charan Das, who was at the receiving end of the RJD’s diatribe, even announced snapping of ties with the RJD. The differences between the two arose over distribution of two seats. Congress wanted to contest Kusheshwar Asthan seat, leaving Tarapur for the RJD. The two contested independently and both lost, adding to the blame game. Lalu Prasad’s return to Bihar politics after more than three years did not help the RJD’s cause. Prasad addressed two election meetings but failed to swing it in RJD’s favour, leaving people wondering if he had lost his charisma. Congress, already reeling under the impact of its dismal performance in assembly polls, sunk further. However, the party, has resolved to strengthen its moribund organization “The by-elections taught us the lesson that we need to work on our organisation in Bihar. We are going to do that in the two-and-a-half years that remain before the country goes to polls,” AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar said.Split in LJPThe biggest drama of the year came from the LJP, which split into two parties. Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV), in which he is the lone MP, did not cause any worry for JD (U) this time as compared to 2020 assembly polls. Paras, who enjoys the support of five of the six LJP MPs elected in 2019, managed to get a berth in the union cabinet.It remains to be seen which of the two factions inherits the political capital of Ram Vilas Paswan.

While entering the school premises to purchase urea, the crowd went berserk, which led to a stampede,” said one of the farmers present there.The farmers vandalised the school properties and later blocked the National Highway-57 in protest.Araria district magistrate (DM) Prashanth Kumar C H and district agriculture officer (DAO) Manoj Kumar did not respond to calls. Forebesganj subdivisional police officer (SDPO) Ram Pukar Singh, who rushed to the site after the incident, said, “The situation has been restored to normalcy, and fertilizer is being distributed peacefully. A few women were injured in the stampede and they are undergoing treatment.”Bihar has been facing an unprecedented shortage of fertilizers, such as urea, and has witnessed several demonstrations for a month.Kaimur’s district agriculture officer Rewati Raman said he has informed the department about the urea crisis and has requested immediate supply.Chandradeo Prasad, district agriculture officer (DAO), East Champaran, on Thursday said the district has received a mere 24,000 metric tonnes (MTs) of urea as against the requirement of 62,000 MT. “The supply received is a mere 40% of the requirement. We are constantly following up for the replenishment,” said Prasad.Vijay Prakash, district agriculture officer (DAO), West Champaran, however, said, “Urea is available in adequate quantity. We are set to receive the next consignment on January 2 and 5.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/8-women-injured-in-stampede-for-fertilizer-101640880101144.html

He was missing since December 18.Investigation revealed that his wife and her paramour, Avshisht Kumar, 40, a professor in polytechnic college in Jahangirabad (Barabanki) allegedly murdered Yadav after kidnapping him with the help of three associates, said Chandra Shekhar Singh, inspector, Vibuti Khand police station. Those arrested were Avshisht Kumar, one Sushil Kumar and his girlfriend Kunti, Santosh Kumar and the victim’s wife Sangeeta Yadav. They were booked under sections 364 (for kidnapping), 302 (for murder) and 201 (for concealment of evidence) of the IPC and on charges of possessing illegal firearms, said police.The inspector said Avshisht approached Sri Ram as a prospective buyer of his car that he wanted to sell out and took him along for a test ride. With the help of his accomplice Sushil Kumar and his girlfriend Kunti, Avshisht allegedly shot Sri Ram dead after taking him to a deserted stretch near Kursi road and later disposed of his body into Indira Canal with help of another accomplice Santosh Kumar, who along with Sushil Kumar, runs a fishery business near the polytechnic college, said Singh.He said the victim’s wife, who was part of the entire conspiracy, had an extramarital affair with Avshisht and eloped with him nearly five months ago after Sri Ram came to know about their relationship. The woman had returned to her husband’s house after family pressure but was still in touch with Avshisht. Avshisht and Sangeeta allegedly planned the conspiracy as Sri Ram was mounting pressure on her to end her relationship with the professor, said police.The victim’s car was found abandoned near Kurauli on link road alongside Faizabad highway on December 22, after his wife lodged an FIR at Vibhuti Khand police station on December 19 regarding his disappearance.The arrested accused revealed that they had purchased three illegal firearms from a Barabanki-based arms dealer, BP Singh, for ₹50,000 a few days before committing the crime.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Khattar plays down row over home portfolio||Playing down the row over the move to divest his cabinet colleague Anil Vij of the home portfolio, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said Vij is a senior person and a good friend.“We have a good communication and talk to each other in a frank manner. At times, he says whatever he feels like and so do I. Neither do I get worried over it nor does he,” Khattar told a group of women journalists in New Delhi on Thursday.Anil Vij had told HT on Wednesday that he had offered to resign from Haryana council of ministers on Tuesday after the chief minister expressed his intent to divest him of the home department, a key portfolio Khattar wanted for himself.Vij said he was initially told by the chief minister that he will have to shed one portfolio for allocating it to newly-inducted cabinet minister Kamal Gupta, which he readily agreed to.“But then, the CM told me that he also wanted the charge of home department for himself. So, I told the CM that I was ready to relinquish the charge of all portfolios and will give this in writing to the governor,” Vij had said.Following portfolio reallocation on Wednesday, Vij now holds charge of home, health, medical education and research, Ayush, technical education and science and technology departments. The urban local bodies portfolio held by him was allocated to newly-inducted minister Kamal Gupta.The home minister, however, on Thursday said allocation of portfolios was the sole prerogative of the CM and he has no issues with it.“I am saying this again. I have no desire to cling to power or positions of authority. I am quite happy and contended being a BJP worker and work for the people,” Vij said.“Everyday people from across the state come to me with their grievances. I attend to them in Ambala in the morning and later at my office in Chandigarh and try to redress their problems,” he added.With the chief minister seeking to bury the controversy on Thursday, it is apparent that the home portfolio will continue to remain in the hands of Vij, as of now.
30-12-2021||Chandigarh||New Year resolutions that don’t go poof!||On New Year’s Eve, it’s time for all those jokes and memes to do the rounds on social media platforms. One such meme that never fails to tickle my ribs is where a cartoon character asks another, “What is a New Year resolution?” “It’s a ‘To Do’ list for the first week of January.” Ever since I was exposed to the concept of New Year resolutions in childhood, I’ve been making and breaking them with equal gusto. One such New Year, I promised to brush my teeth regularly at night but when night came it brought along with it the lure of the warm bed and my lazy bones preferred to surrender to its charm. After all, I’m a lesser mortal who has to succumb to the demands of Hypnos, the God of Sleep. I also made numerous resolutions, such as to read 100 books a year; to polish my school shoes every night before going to bed; to eat healthy; and the most fragile yet favourite one of all, to lose weight. Needless to say, my gluttony ensured that the resolution went poof in thin air at the sight of divine pastries and sumptuous cakes gifted by nefarious relatives and friends who care two hoots for your grit and determination. But this time, the story took a different turn. The past two years have been extremely agonising with the Covid pandemic spreading its tentacles all around the world and snuffing out lives. The coming New Year, too, shows little signs of uplifting the pall of gloom. Amid all this pessimism, I decided to take up a spiritual resolution. I made a resolve to stay happy at all cost and focus on my core strength instead of trying to obliterate my weaknesses. The initial few months of 2021 were tough and traumatising with external pressures testing and trying both my will and resolve. But this year, my fortitude supported me and every time I was ready to cower down, I joined hands and muttered a silent prayer to the Omnipotent, “Lord, I do not ask for anything but for the peace of mind.” With peace restored in my heart, I decided to give up all those pursuits that were bogging me down. I broke the shackles of my own limitations and embarked upon a journey that led me to the path of self-discovery. I recognised that with self-discovery came self-realisation and fulfillment of all those dreams that once were cherished but left mid-way due to distractions galore. On my way to self-actualisation, I thanked Mr Phunsuk Wangdu, the adorable character played by Aamir Khan in the movie 3 Idiots who gave the mool mantra to follow one’s dreams and not run after success: Do what you love and success will follow in its wake. I followed my dreams and sat down to finish my second collection of stories, On the Wings of Wrath, a phrase popularised by German poet Bertolt Brecht.

30-12-2021||Gurugram||Disruption of Xmas event at Gurugram school was unfortunate: Manohar Lal Khattar||New Delhi: Days after a Hindu group disrupted a Christmas event at a primary school in Haryana’s Pataudi, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the incident was “unfortunate’” and shouldn’t have happened.On Christmas Day, a group called Dharam Jagriti Mission, disrupted a congregation gathered to celebrate the day through song, dance and teachings of the Bible, local residents said on condition of anonymity. Children and women had gathered for the event, when a group of men barged inside the hall and stopped the programme, they said. There were no arrests and no police action because they said that no complaint had been registered.When the chief minister was asked about the ruckus created by the group at the school and the disruption of Friday prayers, and the impact of this on Haryana’s image, he said during an interaction with members of the Indian Women’s Press Corp, “It shouldn’t have happened. If people have a problem with any event, they should talk it out and resolve it.”The chief minister also has an optimistic outlook on the impact of the recent farm agitation after the repeal of the three laws. “Many people think that the PM can be kathor (harsh) but his decision to repeal shows that he is not. He realised that it was not being accepted in certain quarters and so took it back,” said Khattar, adding that the overall impact was going to be beneficial for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The three farm laws were repealed this month by Parliament after the Prime Minister’s announcement and a yearlong agitation by farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/disruption-of-xmas-event-at-gurugram-school-was-unfortunate-manohar-lal-khattar-101640874939345.html

30-12-2021||Pune||Pune needs coaches who can channelise talent: Sanjay Sharma||PUNE Pune is the birthplace of badminton, and it also has a good infrastructure, but it is yet to make a mark at the international level when it comes to producing top-class shuttlers.Sanjay Sharma, former Indian captain, coach, writer, author and TV commentator, who was in the city on Thursday, feels Pune needs coaches who are ‘best’ and who can channelise talent.“In Pune, there is no shortage of talent. In our time as well, there were good players, the Badminton Association of India (BAI) has also done its bit,” he said.Nandu Natekar, in badminton, dominated the world stage from 1950 to 1970. The Pune resident became the first Indian player to win an international event when he won Sellanger International in Malaysia in 1956. “I feel coaches should have ‘mission’ and ‘profession’ – so if I am giving you coaching then yes I am coaching you but my mission should be every time you come to play, there should be some improvement every day that should be your motivation as the coach,” explains Sharma who launched his book – Match Point: A Shuttlers Story on December 2.“During my coaching stint, I always maintained that If I am a world no 14 doubles player in my time, then you should be at least 13, then I will have that satisfaction that I am doing my work properly. I think Pune is not getting that sort of coach. Pune association should get somebody to channelise the talent, and they should get a coach with a ‘mission’,” added Sharma, who hails Pune’s badminton infrastructure as one of the best in the country.Strong Bench strength: Key to successSharma stressed that BAI should focus on strengthening the bench strength. “You need to have a lot of bench strength, so when we talk about PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal, after that, there is a big vacuum. Not so much in men’s singles, as we have got Srikanth Kidambi, HS Prannoy, Lakshya Sen, Verma brothers (Sameer and Sourabh); we have two more three youngsters in the queue.”“In last two-three years, we have found depth in men’s doubles with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, Dhruv Kapila and MR Arjun so we have got strong players,” added Sharma who want BAI to focus on finding more women singles player who can share to load from PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal.We need more academiesAccording to Sharma, there is a need for more than four to five academies like Pullela Gopichand Academy and Prakash Padukone academy.“You require four-five more world-class academies. The competition between academies will help raise the standards of the players. BAI is working on it, and they have their academy in Assam, and they are also working to create academies at other places as it is critical,” added the 65-year-old.India should aim at winning major tournaments“For Thomas Cup, Uber Cup and Sudirman Cup – there should be some think tank on deciding who is going to play, how long they are going to play when they will take a rest. Such things have not yet come in from BAI, and we must think and work along those lines,” he said.“This is the year we should eye Thomas Cup, the biggest prize in badminton– we have three singles good players and bench strength, two doubles and one more doubles player pair can get in by May-June this year, and we have a strong chance of upsetting anybody in Thomas Cup. We need to plan out in advance,” added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-needs-coaches-who-can-channelise-talent-sanjay-sharma-101640874819411.html
30-12-2021||Pune||Two-wheeler riders flout traffic norms, risk lives at accident spot near Navale bridge chowk||PUNE Major traffic violations occur at the tragic accident spot near the Bhumkar bridge near Navale bridge chowk on the bypass highway. Here two-wheelers ride into the ‘no entry’ zone on the wrong side of the bypass highway increasing the chances of an accident.Despite repeated action taken by the Pune traffic police department, commuters risk lives to save time.“If we want to go to the nearby Navale bridge chowk, rather than to take the long turn from opposite side many people on the two-wheelers go through the wrong way. To save time people risk their lives,” said Sunny Navghane, a nearby resident.On December 28, a speeding truck carrying industrial equipment from Pimpri to Satara, hurtled down almost 600m in a reverse mode on the Bhumkar bridge near Navale bridge chowk on the bypass highway, running over three people and hitting a car and two SUVs before coming to a halt at 9 am on Tuesday morning.In the accident, Hemant Yashwant Talale (27) and Chetan Ramesh Solanki (31), both residents of Narhe, and Nitin Chandrakant Dhawale (29) of Shivane were run over by the truck.Atul Namekar, secretary of Sinhagad road-Warje residents association, said, “It is not the only duty of traffic police or civic body to provide infrastructure or take action on violators but people should themselves realise the risk of riding on wrong side of the road and that too on the bypass highway which has round the clock traffic.”“We try to create awareness among people through social media and other forms of communication, but many are ignorant,” he said.Vijay Chaudhary, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “Our traffic police personnel take action against people who come in the no-entry or wrong side through the bypass highway. But people should follow traffic rules for their own safety.”Meanwhile, the driver of the heavy vehicle truck who dashed three-person and several other vehicles on Tuesday was arrested by the Sinhagad police on Thursday. The process of lodging a first information report (FIR) against him is in process and further investigation is going on in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/twowheeler-riders-flout-traffic-norms-risk-lives-at-accident-spot-near-navale-bridge-chowk-101640874219679.html
30-12-2021||Pune||Genome sequencing report indicates spread of Omicron variant at local level||PUNE The rise in Covid-19 cases with some of them detected with the Omicron variant has prompted experts to believe the new variant has spread at the community level.On Wednesday, Maharashtra reported 85 cases of Omicron variant, 38 cases of them are from community surveillance. Based on the report experts predicted Omicron’s spread at the community level. As per the preliminary information these 38 cases do not have a history of any international travel.“We have started community surveillance in Mumbai and Pune. Out of these 85 samples in which Omicron has been identified, 38 samples were picked up as a part of community surveillance. Primarily there is no history of international travel in these cases. We may need to take detailed information on this. But based on the report, we can say that local transmission of Omicron is being spotted,” said Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer in a video message.Of the 38 Omicron cases from community surveillance 19 are from Mumbai, five from Kalyan-Dombivali, three each from Navi Mumbai and Pimpri-Chinchwad, two each from Vasai Virar and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and one each from Pune rural, Bhiwandi Nizampur, Panvel and Thane Municipal Corporation limits.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the State Covid-19 task force, attributed the huge surge in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai to the Omicron variant.“In Mumbai, we are reasonably certain with indirect evidence that the current wave is being driven by Omicron. We will avail confirmation with the genomic sequencing labs. There is a mild nature of the disease. There is rapid doubling time, and also the cluster outbreaks are witnessed. In the first week of December, we were reporting 150 cases, then 1,336 Covid-19 cases jumped to 2,500 cases, and the Covid-19 cases had reached the number of 1336 within three days from 600 cases. Clearly, this doubling and double doubling pattern that this is an Omicron like variant which is driving the current trend,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, in an interview with a private news channel.Earlier the directorate of health services had issued a letter stating that community surveillance on the emergence of the Omicron variant will be carried out from December 21 to 31. Daily positive samples of RT-PCR from PMC, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Mumbai are being collected and sent for genome sequencing.According to experts though the cases have been increasing, no exponential rise in hospitalisations has been recorded and which is a good thing.“Good news is that this infection is mild. On Wednesday, in Mumbai 2,500 Covid-19 cases were reported, but most of these cases are asymptomatic. It is a good thing that symptoms are mild, hospitalisation is less and mortality is less. But still, we need to take precautions to avoid its spread,” said Dr Pradip Awate.While mentioning that the delta variant is still in existence, Dr Joshi said that it is important to identify which variant has caused the infection.“We still get severe disease or hospitalisations, but they are largely driven by Delta variant. That is our current worry. Because we are in the transition time, it is important to identify whether it is Omicron or Delta variant. Let’s hope that Omicron replaces Delta variant. We need data to suggest that. We will have clear answers in a week or two whether a replacement has happened. Till that time, it will be all informed speculations or clinical judgements,” said Dr Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/genome-sequencing-report-indicates-spread-of-omicron-variant-at-local-level-101640873979242.html

HT has reviewed a copy of the order. The bar on flights from the UK will apply “till further orders”.“The union civil aviation ministry seeks a NOC from the respective state governments before allowing any flights to land in the state. Now that the West Bengal government has suspended flights from the UK, the ministry will suspend them too,” said C Pattabhi, Kolkata airport director.West Bengal has reported 11 Omicron cases so far, and the new Covid-19 cases being reported every day have doubled over the past week. On Wednesday, the state government crossed the 1,000-mark. In all, the state has 7,727 active casesThursday’s order also said that flights, which is coming from an ‘at risk country’ as notified by the union health ministry will not be allowed in the state and any NOCs which have been issued stand withdrawn.

The airlines will randomly select 10% of the passengers for RT-PCR test and the rest 90% would have to undergo Rapid Antigen Test on arrival. Passengers will have to mandatorily pre-book the test before boarding to reduce waiting time on arrival. “The maximum number of Covid-19 cases are being detected among passengers coming from the UK. If there is one Omciron case on the flight, there are chances of spreading to other passengers. We are reviewing the situation. We have to check what the civil aviation ministry is doing. The Centre should take a decision,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee told reporters earlier in the day.The Mamata Banerjee government has already ordered officials to follow up on international fliers landing at the NSCBI airport in Kolkata. “While passengers need to undergo RT-PCR tests after landing at the Kolkata airport, the contact tracing cell of each district and the civic body in Kolkata will contact and remind each passenger for a re-test on 8th day. There would be follow-ups. If the passenger is found to be positive, the samples would be sent for genome sequencing. Home isolation of 14 days would be advised if found to be negative,” said a senior official of the health department.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: SAD expels ex-CPS Mohinder Kaur Josh||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday expelled former MLA from Sham Churasi, Mohinder Kaur Josh, from the party for anti-party activities. Also read: Another jolt for Punjab Congress, Lalli Majithia quits as Pungrain chiefSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced the party’s decision at a rally in Sham Churasi. He said the former chief parliamentary secretary had breached discipline earlier and was given a chance to return but this would not happen again. “She is expelled from party’s membership for life,” he declared. A three-time MLA from Sham Churasi who came to the political centre stage after she was picked by the SAD to contest the byelections in 1998 following the death of her father and sitting MLA Arjan Singh Josh, Mohinder Kaur had contested as an Independent when she was denied the ticket in 2002. She lost to the Congress nominee. She, however, won the subsequent election on the SAD symbol in 2007 and again in 2012. In 2017, she secured the third position. Josh started showing signs of revolt soon after the seat was allotted to the Bahujan Samaj Party but on Thursday, she threw an open challenge to the party president by holding a parallel rally at a venue just metres away from where Sukhbir Singh Badal was addressing a gathering. Responding to her expulsion, Josh said Sukhbir Badal might have expelled her but her constituents had not. “I am determined to contest the elections as an Independent,” she said, adding that she had deliberately organised a show of strength on the day of Sukhbir’s visit and it was as per the wishes of her supporters. Later talking to the mediapersons at the residence of former Rajya Sabha member Varinder Singh Bajwa, who himself had returned to the party fold only recently, Sukhbir said that his party would not take back leaders who stabbed it in the back. He said only those persons were leaving the party who had been denied tickets. “Those who are joining the BJP are disregarding the sacrifices made by farmers to get the farms laws repealed,” he said, adding that the SAD had parted ways with the BJP on the sole issue of the controversial farm laws. He alleged that national parties were trying to establish their rule by using money and power but the people of Punjab would stand by the SAD, a local party that has and will stand by them. “The national parties have never done any good to Punjab. Their sole motive is to gain power, Punjab’s interests are secondary. The SAD has always fought for the state’s rights and will continue to stand by its people. Assi jeena marna ikathe (We will live and die together)”, he claimed. He said that the PGI satellite centre of which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to lay the foundation stone on January 5 was, in fact, got sanctioned by him. Ruling out any alliance with the BJP, post-elections, he said that the SAD would win at least 85 seats. Sukhbir held a roadshow in Hoshiarpur town in favour of BSP candidate Varinder Parihar and paid obeisance at several places of Sikh and Hindu faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-sad-expels-ex-cps-mohinder-kaur-josh-101640865278244.html

30-12-2021||Delhi||In a first, Delhi commuters vandalise buses at 2 spots over Covid curbs||NEW DELHI: Commuters waiting for buses to get to work on Thursday morning vandalised buses at two locations to protest the shortage of buses after the government decided to cap the number of passengers in buses and metros at 50% of its seating capacity.Additional deputy commissioner of police, south district, Mandava Harsha Vardhan said window panes of six buses were damaged by the public in two incidents. Legal action is being taken in these cases.The first incident was reported at about 8.15am when the police received multiple phone calls about a traffic jam near Jamia Hamdard on south Delhi’s Mehrauli Badarpur Road. When the police reached the spot, they found that some bus commuters instigating others as well to sit on the road as bus drivers and marshalls were not allowing more than 17 passengers in each bus in line with the Covid-related curbs ordered by the government, the police officer said.The restrictions came into force from Wednesday as authorities sounded a yellow alert to contain the spread of Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease. As part of the curbs put in place as part of the first phase of the graded response action plan to stop the spread of the infection, Delhi Metro and buses operate at 50% seating capacity with no standing passengers.“The police tried to convince the agitated public to allow the traffic to pass by but in vain. After some time, the public started causing damage to the buses and broke window panes of five buses. To defuse the situation, the protesting public were removed with help of women police staff (since some of the protesters were women),” Mandava Harsha Vardhan said, insisting that the police did not use force to disperse the crowd as alleged by some people.“In the process one police person also sustained injury,” the officer said.The district police received a second report of passengers creating ruckus at 10,30am, in Sangam Vihar, about 3km from the spot where the first incident was reported. They were also angry about not being allowed to travel into the buses due to the cap on seating capacity.Mandava Harsha Vardhan said a group of men blocked the road and broke the window panes of a DTC bus around 10.30 am. “Police dispersed the crowd and a case is being registered at Sangam Vihar police station.

Also read: Drugs case: HC defers hearing on Majithia’s anticipatory bail plea till January 5Addressing AAP workers at the Vijay Yatra (victory procession) after his party won 14 of the 35 seats in its debut Chandigarh MC election, he said: “Our workers have to work so hard that people vote for the AAP across the country.” This was the first municipal corporation outside Delhi that the party has won. The incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 12 seats, while the Congress won eight and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) managed to win one ward. “From the Chandigarh results… a wave has started in Punjab. I hope to be back to attend the oath-taking ceremony (of the Punjab government),” he said addressing a large gathering after the roadshow. Kejriwal was accompanied by Punjab AAP chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, Chandigarh unit leaders Chander Mukhi Sharma and Pardeep Chhabra besides the 14 councillors on the truck from Sector 22, one of the oldest sectors in the heart of Chandigarh. Makes newly elected councillors pledge loyalty Kejriwal said that it was not easy for the AAP to defeat the Congress and the BJP, both established parties. “If they voted them out and brought you in, work day and night to serve the people of Chandigarh,” Kejriwal said, adding “the trust shown by people should not be broken”. He made newly elected councillors take an oath that they would not leave the AAP. “All workers and councillors should ensure that from whichever party people come to you, there should be no discrimination. Don’t discriminate against those from the BJP, SAD or the Congress. All of them are our own people. Work more for people from other parties so that they vote for us next time,” he said, urging them to work towards restoring Chandigarh’s “glory as City Beautiful”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hope-to-be-back-for-punjab-oath-taking-aap-s-kejriwal-101640861019471.html
30-12-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Foods, traditions are vital ties that unite people||Twenty-five years ago, on a muggy Saturday evening in Tardeo, Mumbai, I was browsing through a cupboard full of books to choose a few to carry back to my hostel. The books belonged to Durgabai Bhagwat - scholar, writer, and champion of free speech. She had been kind enough to lend me a few every week to read. That evening, I laid my hands on a stack of some very old books. Some of them were in Hebrew, others in Marathi and English. They were classic Hebrew texts, Jewish prayer books, rabbinical commentaries, and sermons. There was also a Hebrew-Marathi Haggadah. All of them were printed in Poona in the late nineteenth century. The books were gifted to Durgabai by Rebecca Reuben, the great Jewish-Indian writer, and educator. Reuben was the first woman to secure first rank in the matriculation examination for the University of Bombay. She went on to study at the University of London and upon returning to India taught at the Deccan College, and at Huzoor Paga Girls High School. In 1922, Reuben became the principal of the Israelite School in Bombay. Durgabai quit college in 1930 to join Gandhiji’s Civil Disobedience Movement. The next year she spent a few months in Poona. That’s when Reuben wrote to her that she was visiting the city and would like to spend a couple of days with her. Reuben was a friend of Sitabai Bhagwat, Durgabai’s paternal aunt. “I was living with one of my aunts in a small room in a chawl in Narayan Peth then. We had carried a stove and only a few utensils from Mumbai with us. My aunt was an excellent cook and I was still learning from her. We knew Reuben would not complain, nobody complained in those days anyway. But we were a little worried because she was visiting us on Rosh Hashanah. It was a special day for her”, Durgabai told me. Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year. It is an auspicious time, meant for new beginnings and good luck. Durgabai and her aunt cooked rice pudding, “saat padar puri”, fried okra, and bottle-gourd curry. There were pomegranates, dates, and slices of quince dipped in honey. The star of the feast was the black-eyed peas curry with tomatoes. Reuben was overwhelmed at the gesture. She gifted some books belonging to her father to Durgabai. Jewish families eat black-eyed peas on Rosh Hashanah. Also known as cowpeas, they are not peas, but rather a relative of mung beans. The Talmud states, “Since symbols are meaningful, everyone should eat the following on Rosh Hashanah: “kara” (a type of gourd), “robiya” (black-eyed peas, or fenugreek, depending on how one translates), “kareti” (a leek), “silka” (a beet), and “tamrei” (dates). The tradition might have arisen in the Middle Ages, out of mistaken identity: the word for black-eyed pea in Arabic, “lubiya”, was confused with the Talmudic “rubiya” (which is actually fenugreek in Aramaic). “Rubiya” was included in the Talmud as one of the simanim (food for good omen) on account of its similarity to “yirbu”, the Hebrew word for “multiply” or “increase”, making the food bearing this name a fitting symbol for fertility and prosperity in the coming year. Families from Egypt, Syria, and other Sephardic traditions often serve black-eyed peas as part of a “Rosh Hashanah seder” consisting of seven symbolic foods, or “simanin”, each of which receives one of a series of blessings. Bene Israel Jews in India borrowed some traditions from the Sephardic Jews that had settled in the coastal region in the 16th century. One of them was eating black-eyed peas on Rosh Hashanah. Black-eyed peas are associated with a mystical power to bring good luck. There are plenty of ways in which black-eyed peas can be seen as symbolising abundance: for one, they expand when cooked in water; for another, a dish of black-eyed peas consists of many individual legumes. Black-eyed peas with cornbread represent gold. Stew your black-eyed peas with tomatoes and they become a symbol of health and wealth. Eating them along with collards, with their green colour, represent a financially prosperous new year. Celebrating the first day of the solar year is more of a global, secular tradition. People the world over have fully embraced the idea that doing something, or having something happen, on the first day of the year would have year-long consequences. If you are eating good food going into the New Year, then you would be good and healthy all through the year. While collards were served in the Anglo-Indian households in Poona on the New Year Eve, many educated and “Germany-returned” Chitpavan Brahmins in Pune, who were strongly influenced by the Germans, and Hitler in particular, in the last century, often enjoyed cabbage on the first day of the tropical New Year. Black-eyed peas are a longtime staple, having been cultivated for more than two millennia in Africa, India, and China. Before European contact, West Africans did not have an analogous New Year’s Day food tradition, but as with many cultures around the world, they celebrated auspicious days with symbolic food. Black-eyed peas were frequently on the shortlist for special occasions. Enslaved West Africans brought their food traditions and beliefs to the American South. Slave ships departing West Africa were provisioned with black-eyed peas to sustain the captives during the Middle Passage across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. The enslaved grew black-eyed peas in their plantation gardens. A few decades later, both the enslaved and slaveholders were eating black-eyed peas on a regular basis. No one knows for sure exactly when and how this happened, but the various ingredients blended to create a new New Year’s Day tradition in Southern kitchens. While Sephardic Jews kept eating their traditional black-eyed pea dishes, African – Americans in the South began eating the beans on January 1, most commonly in the form of “Hoppin’ John”, as a symbol of their hope for a prosperous new year. Dr Gangutai Bhide came to know of these traditions while studying for the FRCS degree in Dublin in the late 1930s. When the persecution of Jews began in Germany and elsewhere in the 1930s, many Jews sought refuge in Britain and in the US. They brought with them what they could of home – language, cuisine, culture. Bhide befriended many Jew students and professors in Britain and from the US. She learned about their customs and traditions and brought some of those to Pune with her. So, in 1958, when she invited Durgabai and her sister Dr Kamal Sohonie, the first Indian woman to receive a PhD. in a scientific discipline, for lunch on the New Year’s Day, on the table were fritters, soup, and curry made of black-eyed peas, along with okra, cabbage, and wheat flatbread. Durgabai had requested Bhide to give her the recipes for the soup and the fritters. She had cooked black-eyed peas curry for many years on Rosh Hashanah after the day Reuben had visited her. I assume Bhide never stopped cooking fritters on New Year Day either. The process of cultural diffusion, borrowing, appropriation, although often messy, coalesces into the tradition we have now. “I am not superstitious. I know certain dishes are not going to bring me any luck. Don’t you think it is important to carry on certain traditions, especially those involving food, of those who have come before us? These rituals bind us to the people we love”, Durgabai said and asked me to help her look for the recipes Bhide had given her decades ago. Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

A case under relevant sections is being registered at Sangam Vihar police station and five people have been detained. It was due to non-availability of seats in the buses due to Covid-related restrictions,” he said.In videos of the incident that have emerged on social media, it was seen that green and red air-conditioned buses have been damaged. Windshields and side mirrors were broken.The conductor of a bus, in a video, said, "We have instructions to allow only 17 commuters at a time. When there are 20 people, including the driver, conductor and marshal, on the bus, we do not stop it. If we stop and more people enter the bus, we will be fined ₹2,000.""When we did not stop the bus today, people got agitated and started pelting stones. However, nobody inside the bus was injured," he said.Amid a spike in COVID-19 cases following the emergence of the Omicron variant, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday declared a 'yellow alert' closing schools, colleges, cinemas and gyms.Shops dealing in non-essential items will open on an odd-even basis, and metro trains and buses will run with 50 per cent of seating capacity in the city.Under the four-stage Graded response Action Plan (GRAP), the 'yellow' alert will kick in if the positivity rate settles at 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days, leading to a host of restrictions.GRAP was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority in July in anticipation of the third wave of Covid.

The government is deliberately not arresting him,” Lalli Majithia alleged. In the runup to the Punjab assembly elections, he said he would consider resigning from the Congress at an “appropriate time” and joining another party in the coming days. It is learnt that he is likely to join the BJP.

He cited the latest genome sequencing reports and added 46% of Covid-19 patients in the Capital suffer from the Omicron variant of the disease.

Out of the 200 patients, 102 are from Delhi and 98 are from outside. None of those admitted have any symptoms and have been admitted as a precautionary measure,” Jain said.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drugs case: HC defers hearing on Majithia’s anticipatory bail plea till January 5||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday deferred the hearing on the anticipatory bail plea of Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a drugs case till January 5. The matter was listed for physical hearing before the bench of justice Lisa Gill. However, as senior advocate RS Cheema, who appeared for Majithia, sought a virtual hearing and the court did not agree for the same during its vacation, the matter was deferred for January 5. The virtual hearing was being sought in view of Supreme Court advocate Mukul Rohatgi to appear for Majithia, said lawyers. The Punjab government has roped in Supreme Court lawyer and former Union minister P Chidambaram to argue its case. Mohali court had dismissed Majithia’s bail plea On December 24, a Mohali court had dismissed Majithia’s plea, observing that though his claims are of political vendetta but he himself was a powerful person in state politics till 2017 during the Shiromani Akali Dal’s rule. Majithia was booked by Punjab Police on December 20 under cognizable sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, including Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises), 27 (A) (whoever is financing any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). Majithia’s whereabouts are not known. The plea says the FIR is an “election stunt” and for the purpose, the government has changed three Punjab Police chiefs in three months The Bureau of Investigation has also seen three departmental heads change. It also accuses Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of demonstrating “intense hatred” towards Majithia. While rejecting his plea, the Mohali court had observed that the delay in lodging the criminal case against Majithia cannot be a ground to presume that the whole case is false. His name cropped up in 2014 and the SAD was in power till February 2017. Special judge Sandeep Kumar Singla also said that the FIR has been registered on the basis of a report that prima facie shows the “involvement” of the applicant in the drug trade and harbouring of accused involved in the drug mafia. The question on legality of the criminal case, whether it is borne out of political vendetta or not, cannot be a ground for granting anticipatory bail, Singla had held. Plea cites ‘political interests’ of rivals The plea claims Siddharth Chattopadhyaya was given the additional charge of DGP only to act as a “tool to advance the political interests” of the present government. The plea also referred to the controversy involving ADGP SK Asthana, claiming that he refused to investigate the matter and raised questions whether the matter can be investigated, it being sealed before the court; superseded by other reports and whether investigation can be initiated without the permission of the court. The plea says the report of the special task force (STF), which is the basis of the FIR, was either superseded or merged with the subsequent report of a state government committee. But this fact was ignored and the FIR was registered. Moreover, in the entire lengthy FIR no fresh evidence has been collected or statement recorded, it says, adding that in all drug cases registered, trials have been concluded with the acquittal of some accused and the conviction of others. None of the accused made any reference of the petitioner, it says.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sikh body demands 4 seats for the community in Jammu and Kashmir assembly||The All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee on Wednesday demanded reservation of four seats for the community in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.“Despite our meeting with the Delimitation Commission headed by Justice (retired) Ranjana Desal, no reservation whatsoever has been earmarked for the Sikhs even though we demanded for the same in the meeting, and it was also mentioned in the memorandum submitted to the Commission,” APSCC chairman Jagmohan Singh Raina told reporters here.Raina said the “cold-shouldered attitude” of the commission means that basic rights in Jammu and Kashmir will not be extended to the Sikh minority in the forthcoming delimitation of assembly segments.“We demand reservation of four seats for Sikhs in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly,” he said.The APSCC chairman said all governments of Jammu and Kashmir in the past have “deliberately ignored” the basic issues of the community.“The issues have piled up due to non-resolution and we fail to understand the measuring rod used by the people at helm to measure or understand the problems of Sikhs of Jammu and Kashmir. We have been neglected and discriminated against all along even in the new set of Union Territory,” he said.Despite repeated promises, he said, the Sikh community is not given the status of minority in Jammu and Kashmir.Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been praising the historical contribution of Sikhs in the country, he never tried to understand the issues faced by the minority, the APSCC chairman alleged. Raina said Sikhs are “openly discriminated” in various government orders and packages, while other minorities are getting exclusive and secret packages of jobs for their youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-body-demands-4-seats-for-the-community-in-jammu-and-kashmir-assembly-101640811511738.html

The protestors, however, were not allowed by the police to move towards the civil secretariat.Later speaking to mediapersons, Bukhari said they were not allowed to hold a protest. “What sort of democracy is this. They claim about normalcy even a peaceful protest wasn’t allowed. We just wanted to highlight the aspirations of our people against the Delimitation Commission. The draft report is against the mandate of the commission. These people formed the commission, otherwise, it should have not happened before 2026.”Bukhari sought the intervention of the Prime Minister and the home minister. “The PM and the home minister should intervene and reconsider this draft and come up with a new draft in front of the people,” he said.The Apni party leader also raised concern over the real estate conference that was held in Jammu on Monday. “The way domicile has been omitted through the backdoor. If this is an endeavour to get land houses and flats for non-locals. This is against the mandate and the order of the Government of India,” he said.Bukhari said, “After J&K became UT, we were given two assurances -- there won’t be demographic changes and the jobs and land of J&K will remain confined to the youths and people of the UT. This protest is against that as well.”He alleged that the press wasn’t allowed to work freely which was against the essence of democracy. “This protest is also against giving clean chit to the forces while the probe is still on,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-apni-party-protests-against-delimitation-commission-draft-proposal-101640811507414.html

The state government has announced a slew of reliefs to the general public as well as employees since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost byelections to the three assembly constituencies and one parliamentary seat.The decision to cut the bus fare is also seen as a step to regain the favour of the public.Transport minister Bikram Singh Thakur has directed the transport department to prepare a proposal to slash the bus fare.The minister said the department was getting complaints that bus conductors sometimes charge ₹10 as minimum fair and don’t refund the remaining ₹3 citing lack of change or some other pretext.“People had even complained about this on chief minister’s helpline number 1100,” he said, adding that reducing the minimum fair was the best solution to the problem.He said a decision to cut the bus fare would be taken soon.Bus fare hiked twice in pastIt is worth mentioning that the present state government had hiked the bus fare twice in its four-year rule. The first hike was done in September 2018 when the minimum fare was increased from ₹3 to ₹6 while the fare per kilometre was increased from 20 to 25 percent. However, after protests by the people, the minimum fare was reduced to ₹5 in October 2018.The second hike was made during the Covid-19 pandemic in July 2020. Facing pressure from private transporters, the bus fare was increased by 25% per kilometre and the minimum fare was increased from ₹5 to ₹7. The government had cited the losses to the transport sector due to the pandemic while increasing the fare.Buses are the only means of transportation in rural Himachal as the state lacks air and train connectivity in these areas.The HRTC has 3,300 buses in its fleet while there are 3,100 private buses in the state.At present, the fare of ordinary buses in Himachal is ₹1.40 per km in the plains and ₹2.19 in the hills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-govt-mulls-cut-in-minimum-bus-fare-by-2-from-new-year-101640811460486.html

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Hyderpora encounter: House owner’s kin contest SIT clean chit to security forces||. A day after the police had indicated no wrongdoing on part of the security forces in the Hyderpora encounter, the family members have contested the claims.The police on Tuesday had said that the house owner got killed in “crossfire” after being used as a human shield by a foreign militant and described both Mudasir Gul and Amir Magrey having links with militants. The family members of the civilians have contested the police probe.On November 15, two militants and two local businessmen, identified as Mohammad Altaf Bhat and Mudasir Gul, who were described by the police as “overground workers” of militant outfits, were killed during the operation in Hyderpora. The police said the terrorists had been hiding inside the shopping complex owned by Bhat. However, families contested the police claims and said the forces killed “innocent civilians” in a fake encounter.Sujit Kumar, DIG, said the family members of Altaf Bhat, who owned the building, didn’t give satisfactory replies about the tenants in the building.Brother of Altaf Bhat, while rejecting the SIT report, termed the report “fabricated”.“It’s false. I reject it. My brother had severe torture marks on his body. How come he was made a human shield as claimed by police when 2,000 security forces personnel were present on the spot,” Abdul Majeed Bhat told a local news agency in Srinagar.Saima Bhat, niece of Altaf Bhat, said he was the sole owner of his property so only he was aware of the documents like building permission, rent deed with his tenants and the mode of payment with his tenants. “We checked them at home but we got only a few documents which we have produced before them. The rest of the documents must have been in his personal room in the building, where the firing incident happened. The building was returned on Tuesday and we opened his room, all of the documents regarding his business and files were scattered, we couldn’t find that file and the locker was also open. Whenever they summoned us, we went to meet them,” she said.“It was not repeated summons. In the second summon they asked for documents and on Wednesday they gave us the third summons. The first was to appear before the DIG as the eyewitness. The summons were addressed to Altaf’s eldest brother, Abdul Majid Bhat,” she said.The wife of Mudasir Gul also termed the report “fabricated”. On Tuesday, the PAGD had termed the press briefing of police as a repetition of the old story and cover-up to the incident.Sajjad Lone of the Peoples Conference and Altaf Bukhari of Apni Party also raised questions over the SIT.“The Hyderpora probe was on expected lines. One more addition to hundreds of ornamental probes Any victims of the past or of the future better ensure that they are not caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time or even right place at the wrong time. The onus to save oneself is on the self,” said Sajjad Lone in a tweet.Apni party president Altaf Bukhari said the way SIT had given clean to the forces in the Hyderpora encounter case has raised several questions. “What sort of probe is this. Already the people of J&K have no faith in these probes,” he said.SIT warns political leaders of panel action for ‘speculative’ comments  The police on Wednesday warned political leaders for casting doubts upon the evidence obtained by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on the Hyderpora encounter case.Soon after SIT head DIG Sujit Kumar on Tuesday during a press conference indicated no wrongdoing on part of the security forces in the Hyderpora encounter, almost all top leaders of mainstream political parties questioned the probe of SIT. Even the families of civilians termed the probe fabricated.“Today, SIT came across several posts on media from some political leaders and family members where they have cast doubts upon the evidence obtained by SIT so far. These people have tried to call it ‘concocted cover-up Story’, ‘ornamental probe’, ‘clean chit to killers’, ‘fairy tale of police’, etc. A magisterial inquiry was initiated and accordingly, the inquiry officer issued a general notice through the electronic and print media and invited members of the general public to record his/her statement if any such person has any acquaintance or knowledge or proof regarding the incident. All such person making statements should have approached the inquiry officer with genuine evidence they have for corroboration or contradiction of the facts surfaced in the case,” the SIT chairman said in a statement.“The SIT constituted in the instant case is still investigating the matter and all such persons are once again advised to provide any type of evidence if they have regarding the incident so that every aspect of the investigation is covered and concluded on merits,” he said.The statement further said that such speculative statements from political leaders have the tendency to create provocation, rumour, fear and alarm among the general masses or particular sections of society.“This kind of approach is against the rule of law and may attract appropriate penal provisions as envisaged under law,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hyderpora-encounter-house-owner-s-kin-contest-sit-clean-chit-to-security-forces-101640811458011.html

The accused has been identified as 34-year-old Imran Solanki, a resident of Rajkot, Gujarat. The DSP, headquarters, Kamal Kishore Verma said Rajesh, a commission agent at Bhattakufar fruit market, had sent a consignment of apple to Imran Bhai Solanki Fruit Company, a fruit trading company based in Rajkot. The deal was finalized at ₹ 50 lakh. The buyer paid ₹15 lakh to the commission agent but kept on delaying the remaining payment of ₹35 lakh on one pretext or the other. The bank cheques he had given to the agent bounced. After the agent did not get the payment after over a year-an-a-half, he filed the complaint with the police. The police are also scrutinising the documents related to apple purchases. A local court has sent the accused to police remand. Business worth crores runs on credit The apple business in the fruit markets is carried out on credit. Orchardists sell the produce to traders through commission agents. The buyers make the payment for procured apples to the commission agent who then pays the fruit growers after deducting their commission. However, in the process, the buyers sometimes dupe the commission agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-police-arrest-gujarat-fruit-trader-for-duping-commission-agent-of-35-lakh-101640811454955.html

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||NGOs allege violation of religious freedom by Chinese government in Tibet||Tibetan NGOs in exile have alleged violation of religious freedom, human rights, arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions and torture by the Chinese government in Drago of the Kham region.The Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) and the Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) in a joint statement alleged that another evidence of the grim religious freedom is the fact that recently the Chinese government destroyed a statue of the Buddha in Drago which stood over 99 feet high.“The monastic and lay communities of Tehor, Drago in the Karze region of Kham jointly spent over 40,000,000 Yuan on this statue for the purpose of staving off the danger of war, natural disasters and alike,” said Sonam Tsering, general secretary of TYC, adding that the practice of constructing statues to prevent catastrophes is well known amongst Tibetans.He said that the statue of the Buddha was legally erected on May 5, 2015, with authorizing documents in order from the district office.However, recently on December 12 the Chinese government ordered the demolition and destroyed the statue as well as the 45 prayer wheels in the vicinity of Drago Monastery.Furthermore, in November this year, Tsering said, they also demolished Drago Monastery’s Gaden Namgyal Monastic school, which served as an important hub of education in the area. The school accommodated over 100 students.The curriculum included Buddhism, general Tibetan language studies, English, Chinese and a few more. Nevertheless, the Chinese government completely destroyed all this in their continued disregard and desecration of the religion of the Tibetan people, their culture and their custom, he alleged.SFT’s programme coordinator Tenzin Passang claimed that China’s policy of Sinicisation has caused the assault on all the Tibetan national identity, most notably their language, religion, and culture. The Chinese government accelerated policies that reduce Tibetans as a proportion of the population and undermine their cultural and religious identity in 2020.“The CCP crackdown against freedom, democracy, and human rights has intensified beyond belief and international governments must come together to take strong, joint, immediate action to send a clear message to China and boycott the Beijing winter Olympic 2022 games which only attempts to ‘sport wash’ the most heinous of human right abuses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngos-allege-violation-of-religious-freedom-by-chinese-government-in-tibet-101640811447327.html

According to police, the suspect was calling a victim again and again and was pressurising him to get married or settle the matter after paying her in lakhs. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspect has registered eight rape and molestation cases at different police stations. “We received a complaint against the suspect on December 23 at New Colony police station from a family who lives in Karnal. The mother of the victim alleged that her son took a house on rent in Gurugram and came in contact with the suspect who met him a couple of times. She started pressurising him to get married but when he refused, she threatened to implicate him in a fake rape case,” he said. Sangwan said the suspect lives with her mother in Gurugram and she called the family from Karnal to Leisure Valley Park for settlement and called a man also to settle the matter. “Despite their meeting, the matter was not solved. So the woman filed a rape case on October 24 at DLF Phase 3 police station,” he said. Fearing arrest, the victim’s family fled to Karnal but the woman kept calling and demanding money and her calls were recorded, police said. On October 26, the Haryana State Commission for Women had written a letter to the state’s director general of police (DGP) demanding a probe into the matter by a special investigation team, alleging that the cases lodged by the suspect are “false”. Of the seven rape cases the suspect has filed, three have been closed, including one in which she changed her statement, said police. Sangwan said the woman has confessed to the crime and has revealed names of her associates. During questioning, the suspect revealed that she filed rape cases at Rajendra Park, Sadar, City, Cyber Crime, Sector 5, New Colony and Sector 10 police stations, police said. Police have recovered a mobile phone from the suspect and it will be scanned by cyber crime police team to check who all were duped by her, Sangwan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-held-for-implicating-men-in-false-rape-cases-in-gurugram-101640810907122.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A temple in Daryaganj||The scenes outside are passing in a blur. All you can see are lights flashing on the glass window. It’s like sitting in a super-fast Shatabdi.But this isn’t a train. It’s a small, little-known temple in Old Delhi’s Daryaganj. The lights are flickering on the glass panes that protect the niches, enshrined with idols of gods. The effect is surreal — you stand still and watch the moving lights, including the reflection of buses and autos wheeling along the road outside, and you feel like you are moving.This afternoon, Pracheen Shiv Mandir is empty. It is difficult to spot the temple from the pavement outside — the entrance consists of a barely discernible opening between a bookshop and a store selling motor tyres. To make it even more discreet, this narrow entry is mostly taken over by a staircase. But inside, it’s a large, airy room. No bulb is lit for the time being, and the temple is immersed in a partial darkness that feels welcoming to a person coming from the chaotic daylight of the world outside. A handful of bells are hanging low from the roof, along with a couple of damru, the drum often identified with Lord Shiv. Indeed, a whole part of the floor is taken over by the temple’s sanctum sanctorum, a shiv lingam. The two damrus are hanging right above it.The temple may be pracheen (ancient), but the building is modern. The cream-coloured wall would probably go unnoticed somewhere else, but here, because of the combined influence of lights and shadows, it has acquired a remarkable presence, and catch the eye with character and limpidity. Towards one corner of the roof lie two broad slots that let the sunrays partly percolate into the temple.Although you can clearly see the busy traffic from inside the temple, and hear the sounds of the car horns, and the blab of the pedestrians, the place is permeated with the feel of a remote mountain cave. The light outside is very close, but appears inaccessible, like the clouds one can see from a plane window. Sitting in this temple brings utmost restfulness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-temple-in-daryaganj-101640809525811.html

All these properties would be sold through online auction, said Dhanda, adding that once the approval comes from the headquarters, they will put the sites on auction.

They would bank on individual councillors’ decision, said party chiefs. Congress has eight seats, BJP 12 (13, with a MP vote) and AAP has 14.Meanwhile, behind the scenes, parties have stepped up their efforts to generate the requisite numbers in the MC House for getting their candidate elected.Both parties approaching us: Congress chiefCongress councillors are particularly facing the pressure from other parties, claims the party. Congress president Subhash Chawla, said, “Both parties are approaching our councillors. They think Congress has the lowest number of councillors and the party doesn’t have a chance to win the mayoral election. So, they believe that Congress councillors can be easily poached. But they are totally mistaken. The people’s mandate is with the Congress, we have the highest vote share, and the next mayor will be from Congress.”Party’s first-time councillor and former Panjab University student union president Sachin Galav even claimed that he was approached with an offer of ₹2 crore to switch sides. He didn’t produce any evidence for his claim but alleged that both AAP and BJP tried to fix a meeting with him, and their “representatives” made the offer.Senior Congress leader Devinder Singh Babla, whose wife Harpreet Kaur got elected from ward 10, also claimed that both AAP and BJP have sent feelers to them. “All parties are contacting us. We are in a wait and watch position,” Babla said. AAP internal strains spell troubleAAP, which made major and surprising gains in its first MC election in the city, is facing internal strains on the choice of candidate for the mayor’s post.The mayor’s post is reserved for a woman councillor in the first and fourth year of a MC house.“AAP has seven women councillors. Their alignment is different groups within the party. Even though, among the four-groups within the party, the group led by the party’s co-incharge Pardeep Chhabra has ascendency, the other three groups led by party president Prem Garg, veteran leader and former MP Harmohan Dhawan and election campaign committee chairman Chander Mukhi Sharma can still make their presence felt,” said a senior party leader requesting anonymity.On the selection of the candidate, Chhabra, said, “We are yet to decide on this and will take a call on it later. We are currently busy with preparations for Thursday’s road show of AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal.”On the party’s strategy for mayoral elections, Chhabra, said, “After the first round of voting, Congress will be eliminated. Thereafter, AAP, which has the maximum 14 votes, will be declared the winner. Though, voting will be done through secret ballot, there is always a fear of cross-voting.” Kejriwal in city todayAAP national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will lead the “Victory March” on December 30, 2021. The march will start at Hotel Arima light point at 12.30 pm and will continue for around a kilometre towards Sector 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-hung-verdict-parties-in-chandigarh-hold-cards-close-to-vest-in-race-for-mayor-s-post-101640809886841.html

The incident took place in Pakhal village near Dhauj in Faridabad around 2.30pm when the victim, Rakesh Kumar, had gone to pick up his children from school, said police. According to police, Kumar wanted to install a borewell nearly 25 days ago in his fields but the suspects opposed it as the power cable (needed to run the borewell) was passing through their fields. The victim was beaten up five days ago too by the suspects over the dispute, police said. After stabbing Kumar, the suspects, identified as Lalit, Nitesh, Bhavinder and Sonu, fled the spot, police said, adding that the villagers took him to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead. Police said that they arrested Sonu on Wednesday.Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said, “Kumar was attacked by his cousins with a sharp object. They stabbed him several times following which he fell on the road and was bleeding profusely,” he said. On the basis of a complaint filed by deceased’s father Krishan Kumar, a case under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon),149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the four suspects at Dhauj police station.However, the father, a retired army man, alleged that he had complained to police when the tiff broke out five days ago but no action was taken against the suspects. “I have CCTV footage of the incident which took place on December 23. The suspects’ father is a retired policeman, so he had influenced the police teams not to take action against his sons,” he said. “The dispute escalated about a week ago and the police control room was informed, after which police reached the spot and they made both of us compromise with each other,” Krishan said. He also alleged that his son was assaulted by one of the policemen posted at Dhauj police station while he was not even at fault.  Kadiyan refuted allegations levelled by the victim’s father and said that police were conducting investigation and later both parties had compromised following which no action was taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/faridabad-man-stabbed-to-death-by-cousins-over-dispute-101640809648271.html

We have also set a deadline to complete the work by June 30 next year before the onset of monsoon,” said Yadav.The matter of reviving ponds was also brought before MCG councillors and senior officials during the civic body’s House meeting on Monday. Ahuja had apprised the House that the entire initiative has been taken up with the aim of water conservation, water management, and mitigating localised waterlogging.As per the district administration’s groundwater cell report, the water table in the city dropped to 36.99 metres in 2021 from 33.23 metres in 2018.“Of the 72 ponds, 58 are under MCG’s possession. Directions have been issued to ensure all paperwork for the project is completed by January 31 and on-ground work starts immediately,” said Ahuja.Ahuja said that he also issued directions to ensure the project is not cost intensive, and that the officials achieve the basic motive of desilting a pond, erecting a path around it, securing it with a boundary wall, and also planting native vegetation for its revival.“Any cost intensive purpose in the ponds such as electrification, constructing themed based park, amphitheatres, localised museum will be taken up in subsequent phases,” said Ahuja.The MCG commissioner said that he has also directed the officials to prepare details of the other 24 ponds identified within the MCG area from departments such as the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, and send them to departments concerned by next week so that the taking over process can be started on an immediate basis.
30-12-2021||Chandigarh||After MC poll debacle, knives out against Chandigarh Congress chief Subhash Chawla||The voices of dissent and chorus for a change in Congress’ city leadership has burst on to the surface as the party finds itself relegated to the third spot in Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) elections. In a city, once considered a Congress stronghold, the party has been outsmarted and out-campaigned by debutant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which grabbed most of the anti-incumbency votes against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Congress could secure only eight seats, while AAP won 14 and BJP retained 12 seats. Attacking Congress’ Chandigarh state president Subhash Chawla, senior party leader Devinder Singh Babla said, “It was Congress which allowed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to stand up and get so many seats. This is the failure of the party’s city president. He couldn’t even get his own son elected.” Babla himself didn’t fight the election, but his wife Harpreet Kaur contested from his seat and won by the highest victory margin in this year’s civic poll. “Party president didn’t cooperate with candidates. While other parties were funding their candidates, the Congress was asking for money from candidates. Nobody from the party came to our ward to support us during the campaign, it was only because of our family’s hard work that we could win,” said Babla. Putting the entire blame for the loss on Chawla, Babla, said, “It is the president who is responsible for the win and loss. He was deciding on tickets and managing the entire show. It is not for me to say, but for the party to decide whether they continue with him (Chawla) or not.” Babla’s sentiments were echoed by party’s chief spokesperson HS Lucky, who lost by 11 votes from ward 2. “There was no support from the party to the candidates. We were on our own. High command and Pawan Banal should reconsider all these factors so that Congress can become strong again,” said Lucky. Stating that bad decisions by the leadership cost Congress heavily, Manoj Lubana, president Chandigarh Youth Congress, said, “There was a massive flaw in ticket distribution. The stage was set, Congress was certain to return in the municipal corporation but internal conflict for the seat distribution and denying the deserving candidates a chance to contest the election has proved to be a nightmare for Congress.” He further questioned, “What was the need to delay the distribution. Declaring the tickets two days before the last date of nomination only took us away from victory. No step was taken to talk to the candidates who were not given tickets so as to channelise their efforts for Congress’ victory.” Demanding action against all those who deprived us of this victory, Lubana, added, “It is time the Chandigarh Congress unit changes for a better future.” Meanwhile, a senior party leader, requesting anonymity, said, “While other parties were bringing big guns to support their candidates, Congress didn’t get anybody big except for Randeep Singh Surjewala. They could have brought Navjot Singh Sidhu and Charanjit Singh Channi. Congress didn’t even do outdoor advertising for its candidates.” Chawla meets high command, accepts moral responsibilityResponding to criticism, Chawla, said, “I have made my position clear to the high command. I have explained the reasons for rge party’s performance. As the party president, I have taken the moral responsibility for the party falling short of the expectations.” Talking to HT from Delhi, Chawla, said, “I am in Delhi today, and met the senior party leaders and shared all the details with them. I have left it to them to decide on my future in the party.” On the party leaders gunning for him at public forums, Chawla, said, “I will advise party workers to air their opinions in the party meeting being called to discuss all these issues. We will analyse what factors lead to these results, and all their opinions and suggestions will be taken on board.”

Currently, relatives of the inmates from Nuh lodged in the Bhondsi jail have to travel around 50km to meet them. Muhammad Akil, director general of police (prison), said the project started in May 2018 but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it got delayed by almost a year. “Now, the jail will be operational by February, 2022. The prison building is constructed over 29 acres and has the capacity to accommodate over 1,000 inmates,” he said. According to the officials, the prison will have an administrative block, five male barracks, one female barrack, three special security enclosures of various capacities, a 30-bed hospital, a warden’s hostel, an electric sub-station, and 69 houses of various categories for the officials posted in Nuh prison, among other facilities. Besides, there will be one sewage treatment plant of 1.25 millions litre per day capacity. The jail is just one kilometre from the mini secretariat, said the officials, adding that one underground water tank of 500,000 litres capacity to meet any emergency and seven rain water harvesting wells have also been constructed. The new jail will take extra load off the Bhondsi jail, which is overburdened. The Bhondsi jail was constructed in October 2003 over 98 acres of land. In many cases, inmates from other jails in Haryana are also brought to Bhondsi jail on medical grounds and due to administrative reasons. “Bhondsi jail has a capacity to accommodate over 2,500 inmates, but it is packed beyond its capacity. Managing all the inmates with limited resources is difficult,” jail superintendent Harinder Singh said, adding that over 3,300 prisoners are currently lodged in the jail. There are 19 jails across Haryana and Bhondsi jail has the highest capacity, said the officials. Farooq Ahmed, a resident of Jajuka village in Nuh, said that currently he has to travel over 50km to meet his children lodged in Bhondsi jail. “My two sons are lodged in Bhondsi jail. For the last two years, I have been visiting the jail twice a week. We are poor people and cannot afford the expense. Since a jail has been built in our district, it will benefit family members of inmates,” he said.

This is the highest single-day spike in cases in Gurugram since May 28, when the district had reported 171 new cases. Officials from the district health department said that on Wednesday, the test positivity rate in the district was a little over 2.5%, which stood at 0.5% a week ago. In the past 24 hours, 5,628 tests were conducted in the district, they said, adding that 27 patients also recovered on Wednesday. Also, the last time when Gurugram witnessed over 500 active cases was on June 9 when the district had 581 active cases. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Cases have been increasing in Gurugram in the past few days and testing has also been increased. Cases are being reported as individual incidents and in small clusters of four-five cases, which are mostly from the same family. We will be sending suggestions for new micro containment zones to the district administration on Thursday. We urge people to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and take all precautions, along with timely vaccination.” Meanwhile, the district on Tuesday reported two cases of Omicron, with the patients having no travel history, the officials said, adding that the two patients who have already tested negative for Covid-19 were fully vaccinated. The patients tested negative on December 26, but the genome sequencing results came on Tuesday, the officials said.The Gurugram administration on Monday declared five containment zones in as many localities amid rising cases of Covid-19 in the district. The deputy commissioner issued an order in this regard on Monday, a copy of which is with HT. The five containment zones include residential societies in Sector 58, Sector 69, Sector 28, and two houses each in Sector 45 and Palam Vihar. With this, the total number of containment zones in the district is 14, the officials said.Amid the rising cases, doctors are wary and urging people to follow Covid-19 safety protocols. Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director for internal medicine at Max Hospital in Gurugram, said, “Most of the Covid-19 cases are people with mild symptoms. If the patients do not have any travel history, they usually are infected from people having a foreign or domestic travel history, with whom they might have come in contact during social gatherings. The recent Omicron cases in Gurugram can be one such example, and as samples of not every patient is being sent for genome sequencing, we do not know how much the variant has already spread among the public.” Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute in the city, said, “The recent cases show that even those who are fully vaccinated can get infected. As the new variant spreads fast, people need to follow Covid-19 safety protocols all the more now. People must go for vaccination for developing immunity and not think that they will develop immunity after getting infected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-cases-in-7-months-101640807786694.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s test positivity rate snaps 212-day streak, surges across 1%||The Covid-19 test positivity rate in Delhi went past the 1% mark for the first time in 212 days on Wednesday, as the city’s case graph continued to bend upwards in a surge likely driven by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Delhi added 923 cases of Covid-19 on the day, as infections increased 86% over the previous day, when the city had 496 new cases, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. These infections came on the back of over 71,000 tests, of which 1.29% samples tested positive. The bulletin did not add any Covid-19 deaths to the tally.Over the past week, the city added an average of 370 cases each day, the highest this number has been since mid-June.The test positivity rate in Delhi was below 1% for 212 days; it was last above this mark on May 31 when 1.25% of tests were positive. Tuesday’s number was the highest since May 28, when the positivity rate was 1.59%.Experts regard the test positivity rate as an important statistic to evaluate an infection outbreak in a region. The trajectory of this number can provide insights into whether cases in a city will rise or fall in the coming days: a rising positivity rate generally means cases will rise in the immediate future, while a dropping positivity rate tends to precede a drop in new infections.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control.New infections started increasing sharply since mid-December, with the caseload now at levels of early-June, when the city was beginning to recover from the effects of the brutal fourth Covid-19 wave. In the first week of December, Delhi added an average of 48 cases each day. This number crept up to 49 in the second week. The city then logged 85 cases on average each day in the third week of December. In the eight days since then, Delhi has added an average of 339 fresh cases every day.To be sure, an overwhelming majority of hospital beds are unoccupied even amid the rise in cases. Data from the state government on Wednesday showed that more than 97% of over 21,500 beds for reserved for Covid-19 patients in the Capital are vacant. Further, the state government has also previously assured that the number of beds can be scaled up to 37,000 in days, if required.The state’s larger plans involve setting up over 65,000 Covid-19 beds in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-test-positivity-rate-snaps-212-day-streak-surges-across-101640807274236.html

Multiple missed deadlines The ₹120-crore project, which had been initiated in December 2020 under the Smart City Mission, was initially supposed to be completed by August 31, 2021. However, the deadline was extended to December 31, 2021, and then March 2022. The closure of a stretch of Pakhowal Road, extending from Pakhowal Road Canal Bridge to Hero Bakery Chowk, had inconvenienced commuters and shopkeepers, whose businesses were hit due to the low footfall. In fact, several shopkeepers had to relocate from the stretch in the wake of mounting losses.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala’s cloth traders anxious over GST hike from Jan 1||As the year draws to a close, cloth and textile traders in Ambala are anxious over the hike in GST from 5% to 12%, which is applicable from January 1. Merchants dealing in clothing and allied products in Ambala prosper in areas like Railway Road, Kalka Chowk and Agrasen Chowk and draw customers from across North Indian states. Traders say that even manufacturers have stopped supplying goods for the past few weeks, and will also face problems adapting to the new tax, while the end consumer will ultimately have to bear the brunt. The Ambala Wholesale Cloth Market is the largest cloth trading market in the sub-continent and has a dense cluster of nearly 1,000 shops, employing thousands of people. The market specialises in handloom, suits, shirts and allied clothing accessories.Harish Ahuja, adviser of the Ambala wholesale cloth market association, said that the industry is already struggling due to the pandemic and rise in yarn prices. Ahuja suspects that the GST hike will further give space to illegal trading. Vishal Batra, president of the association, said that the tax increase will also affect their sale and they will have to change the labelling of the existing goods, which is time consuming. The body has also wrote to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union textile Minister Piyush Goyal and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in October this year, seeking repeal of the hike. “The inverted tax structure impacts a small part of the industry. Barely 15% of the industry is impacted by an inverted rate of tax on input, using man-made fibres. Around 85% of the industry uses natural fibres grown and produced within the country and taxed at the lowest rate of 5%. Sacrificing the interest of the whole industry for the correction of a small portion will not be a good proposition. Proposal to enhance rate on the entire industry to correct the anomaly in a smaller portion of the industry would not be justifiable,” an excerpt from a copy of the letter reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambalas-cloth-traders-anxious-over-gst-hike-from-jan-1-101640807136685.html

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Cong not to name CM face, reiterates Jakhar||Chandigarh : Punjab Congress campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar on Wednesday said that the Congress will not announce a chief ministerial face for the upcoming polls in the state. Jakhar said the party had never named its CM-face before the elections except in 2017 when Capt Amarinder Singh’s name was announced. “We will contest the elections under collective leadership,” the former Punjab Congress chief said after a meeting of the Congress screening committee in Delhi. The campaign committee head’s statement, a reiteration of the decision taken by the panel in its meeting on December 15, is significant as state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu is making a case for naming the chief ministerial face, obliquely positioning himself for the position. Candidates shortlisted for 55 seats The screening committee, constituted under All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Ajay Maken for the selection of candidates, is learnt to have shortlisted candidates for about 55 of the 117 assembly seats in the state. “In these constituencies, the party either has sitting MLAs or not more two claimants for the ticket. These names will be soon recommended to the Central Election Committee which takes the final decision on candidates,” a party leader privy to deliberations in the screening panel meeting said. The panel is also not in favour of allowing change of seats even as some party MLAs and ministers are keen to move to safer segments. Besides Maken and Jakhar, the screening panel meeting was attended by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Sidhu, Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary and joint secretary Krishna Allavaru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cong-not-to-name-cm-face-reiterates-jakhar-101640807010583.html

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | After court complex, alternative routes sealed to police commissioner office||Two days after alternative routes leading to the district court complex were sealed in the wake of the blast, cops on Wednesday blocked all passages leading to the police commissioner’s office from the deputy commissioner’s office. While senior officials remained tight-lipped about the development, an official, privy to the matter, on condition of anonymity, said the passages had been sealed after receiving “certain intelligence inputs.” The blockage of certain routes left several citizens disgruntled, and they could be seen arguing with cops. “Please enter from the main door near the CIA staff office. We have orders not to allow anybody to enter from here,” a cop, deployed near one of the barricades, was heard reasoning with a displeased local. Pathways blocked to stop protesters: SADAlleging that the routes had been blocked to stop protesters from entering, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said the cops were merely using “security threat” as an excuse. “It is citizen’s democratic right to protest. With the law-and-order situation in a shambles, people are trying to reach out to the top cop seeking redressal of their grievances. However, now entrances to the commissioner’s office have been plugged,” Grewal said.Staffers strike adds to confusion Some visitors complained that the excise and taxation department and government treasury were also located in the same building, but cops were not letting anybody enter, claiming that the staff was on strike, and the departments were closed. Gursewak Singh, a resident of BRS Nagar, who was headed to the excise taxation department, said, “First the cops asked me to visit from the main door, which was a mile away, the cop sitting at the entrance told me that I could not visit since the department was closed due to a strike. I told him that I was to visit an official, but he refused to hear me out.” District court complex fortified On December 27, the passage and the main door of regional transport office (RTO), which led to the district court complex, were sealed. The door was primarily used to present persons facing trial under Sections 107 (which pertains to the powers vested with an executive magistrate who may order detaining a person, he thinks, could commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity), and 151 (prevention of commission of cognizable offences) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).A notice was pasted on the wall redirecting litigants to appear from the main door of the police commissioner’s office. The door leading from the district excise and taxation department towards the district court complex was also sealed. It was primarily used by excise and taxation lawyers. People are only being allowed to enter the district complex from the main door of the deputy commissioner’s office where a door frame metal detector has been installed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-after-court-complex-alternative-routes-sealed-to-police-commissioner-office-101640806827964.html

The team was visiting the under-construction STPs in Jamalpur to review the progress of the ₹650 crore project to clean the seasonal rivulet, which flows through Ludhiana, the most populous district of the state. Task force member Colonel JS Gill (retd) said, “The deadline to clean the nullah is December 2022. Even if authorities spend hundreds of crores to upgrade the STPs, all of it will go to waste unless the municipal corporation finds a way to stop dairy waste from being dumped into the Buddha Nullah. The MC has been dithering over taking a decision regarding the dairy units for over a year. Either the dairy units should be shifted or effluent treatment plants or biogas plants should be established to deal with dairy waste.” “The progress of other aspects of the project, including upgrading and setting up new STPs is on track,” said Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/upgrading-stps-won-t-help-till-ludhiana-mc-deals-with-dairy-waste-buddha-nullah-stf-101640806766578.html

He accused the Congress government of having “struck” at the very livelihood of small truckers by abolishing truck unions.We will revive truck unions to ensure that small truckers get their due. We will also ensure there is no outside interference, including political, in the truck unions, by laying down guidelines that only a member of the union can become its president.”Simultaneously, coordination committees would be established with members from truck unions, trade representatives as well as the government to ensure the interests of truckers as well as the industry are safeguarded, he said, adding that the transporters welfare board would ensure extension of monetary help to members in case of emergency such as the Covid pandemic.Among other measures aimed at ensuring the welfare of truckers, Sukhbir said local truck union would get precedence in the tendering process. “We will also end harassment being done to truckers by issuing annual stickers, which will ensure that no truck is stopped on the road for checking of papers, he said.

Of ₹132-crore development projects that Channi launched, ₹95 crore are for widening and the maintenance of roads; another ₹2.8 crore are for sprucing up infrastructure. He also announced ₹28 crore for other development works.In his speech, Channi claimed that till Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Bikram Singh Majithia remained with that party, there was no hope for revival. “Majithia is now on the run from law after registration of FIR against him in a drugs case,” touting it as his government’s achievement. Taking on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal for his antics, Channi said Kejriwal was indulging in theatrics with the sole aim of capturing power in Punjab but is unable to keep his flock together as 10 of his MLAs and 3 MPs have already bid goodbye to him. Expressing gratitude to the CM for bestowing special attention on the Ghanaur constituency, Jalalpur hailed him as the people’s CM. Later in the day, addressing another rally at Samana, Channi said that on demand from local MLA Rajinder Singh, the state government will takeover Public College, Samana, and the upgrade of the local civil hospital from 50-100 beds, with the announcement to be approved in the Cabinet meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/channi-launches-slew-of-projects-in-ghanaur-mla-was-first-in-patiala-to-rise-against-capt-101640805566384.html
30-12-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Man cheats a person by promising job in Indian Railways, arrested||The Gautam Budh Nagar police arrested a 32-year-old man on Wednesday afternoon from Greater Noida for allegedly duping a person on the pretext of getting him a job in the Indian Railways.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Railway traffic resumes in Punjab as farmers end protest||Ludhiana The railway traffic across the state resumed on Wednesday, a day after the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), an umbrella organisation for smaller farmers’ groups, called off its “rail roko” protest. The farmers had been staging sit-ins at railway tracks in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Tanda, Tarn Taran and Ferozepur since December 20, demanding a loan-waiver and relief from paying outstanding electricity bills and allotment of plots by the state government. With the protests affecting train schedules, passengers had to face the brunt of the situation.“Due to the blockage of rail traffic mainly at Jalandhar-Amritsar, Ludhiana-Ferozepur and Jalandhar-Jammu rail lines, even the prominent trains including New Delhi-Amritsar Shatabdi were not able to go beyond Jalandhar. Either those were short terminated or else they were cancelled,” an official at the Ludhiana Railway station said.Speaking about the traffic on the day, officials said that while most of the trains resumed running on schedule on Wednesday, the footfalls were relatively low.“The trains are expected to run with full capacity from Thursday as many passengers must be unaware of resumption of railway traffic on Wednesday”, stated an official at Ludhiana.Notably, the Northern Railways had issued notifications requesting passengers to check the status of the trains before heading to the station for the complete eight-day duration of the protest.Maintenance operations back on trackWith the farmers’ protest ending, operations at the maintenance depots located at Amritsar, Ferozepur and Katra also resumed.The sit-ins had prevented trains from reaching their designated maintenance depots, putting the onus staff of the Delhi maintenance depot to carry out operations for the eighth day.“We were not able to clean and wash the trains at these centres due to blockade by the protesters. The elite trains including Shatabdi or Vande Bharat Express couldn’t be run without proper cleaning due to the railway’s reputation. Since the pressure majorly shifted to Delhi, we had to cancel the trains,” an officer added.
30-12-2021||Mumbai||Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari pained by threatening tenor of CM’s letter||Mumbai: The tussle between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari continued as he told chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a letter that was circulated on social media on Wednesday that he was “pained” by the “threatening tenor” of the CM’s letter pertaining to the election to the Speaker’s post. Thackeray had written a letter to the Governor on Monday informing him of the cabinet’s decision to conduct the assembly speaker’s election on December 28 by open vote instead of a secret ballot. This was the third letter addressed to Raj Bhavan on the matter; a letter recommending election to the Constitutional post was sent to the Governor on December 24, and a delegation of senior MVA leaders approached Koshyari with another letter from the CM, requesting his assent to hold the election, on December 26. However, the Governor did not give his approval to hold the election and objected to an amendment in the rules for the election, made on December 23, which provided for open voting instead of a secret ballot. Terming the amendment “unconstitutional” and “illegal”, Koshyari’s letter which circulated on Wednesday with its date cropped, said that he cannot be pressured to consent to the process as it needed to be legally examined. The position fell vacant after senior Congress leader Nana Patole resigned to take up a party post (state party president) on February 4. Since then, deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal is holding charge of acting Speaker in the lower House. “You mentioned that the said rules have been framed under Article 208 of the Constitution. It would be pertinent to mention that the same Article clearly elucidates that ‘A House of the Legislature of a State may make rules for regulating, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, its procedure and the conduct of its business…’ I am personally pained and dismayed to see the intemperate tone and threatening tenor of your letter which has belittled and denigrated the highest Constitutional Office of the Governor,” Koshyari’s letter stated. “Consent for holding of this election under the amended rules which prima facie appear to be unconstitutional and illegal cannot be given at this stage. It is also noteworthy to mention that you have taken nearly eleven months to initiate the process of election of speaker and the Maharashtra Assembly Rules 6 and 7 have been amended drastically. Thus, the impact of these far-reaching amendments needs to be examined legally,” the letter added. “I have never questioned the prerogative of the House in the matter of its procedure/proceedings; however, I cannot be pressurized to give consent to a process which prima facie appears to be unconstitutional and illegal as enshrined in the Article 208 of the Constitution,” Koshyari wrote. “The Governor is expected to take decisions on the advice of the state government. We have been taking utmost care so that the position of the governor is not disrespected. Yesterday, the matter would have gone to extreme level but the MVA government chose to exercise restraint and it was decided that the Speaker election will be held with Governor’s permission,” Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai said. Sena MP Sanjay Raut blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government and said that Koshyari was “under pressure”. “Koshyari is probably unhappy because he is under pressure from the central government. The union home ministry is pressuring him not to nominate 12 persons recommended by the MVA government as members of the legislative council,” Raut said. Koshyari is still to clear the 12 names recommended by the state cabinet last year for appointment to the legislative council. Out of the 78 members of the upper house, 12 are appointed every six years by the Governor on the recommendation of the state government. “The Governor has not said anything about powers of the legislature but sending him a letter in a threatening tone and giving an ultimatum to the Governor is shameful and has brought disgrace to the state. The unhappiness expressed by the Governor was obvious. The chief minister needs to take a stand as the head of the state and not as head of a party. He also needs to show some restraint,” state BJP leader Pravin Darekar said. Congress, one of the three ruling parties in the state coalition demanded that Koshyari be recalled by the Central government. Congress state working president Arif Naseem Khan said, “Governor Koshyari is behaving like leader of a political party while working at a Constitutional position. He has been creating obstacles for the state government. This time he did not allow holding of the Speaker’s election. This is despite the state government following all the rules and procedures. He should be recalled by the central government,” Khan said in a release issued on Wednesday. “Under Article 178 of the Constitution, the Speaker is chosen by the Assembly, which means it is an internal procedure of the House and the Governor has nothing to do with it. Similarly, Article 208 of the Constitution also states that the internal matter of the legislature is decided by the House, however, it must be in conformity with the Constitution, which has been followed in this case. It again means that it is the prerogative of the state Assembly whether the election is conducted by a secret ballot system or voice vote etc,” Ulhas Bapat, a constitutional expert said. “In contrast, going by Article 163 of the Constitution, it is binding on the Governor to accept the whatever advice is given by the council of ministers with chief minister as its head, except in matters related to his discretionary powers and in this case he has no discretion given by the Constitution, thus the Governor has to accept the advice,” he added. The MVA government and governor have been engaged in a series of spats over various issues. In February, the state government denied Koshyari permission to use the state’s airplane to travel to Dehradun. Last October, Koshyari and the CM wrote letters to each other over the reopening of places of worship. The Governor mocked the CM as “secular” while Thackeray reminded him of the Constitution and the oath he had taken. In September 2021, Governor wrote to CM following the Saki Naka rape incident, asking him to hold a two-day special session over security for women in the state. In response, Thackeray wrote back to Koshyari, saying that since violence against women was a national issue, the latter should request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to call a four-day special session of the Parliament to discuss the same. On December 28, the state passed the Maharashtra Public Universities Act Amendment Bill to curtail the powers of the Governor in appointing vice chancellors of various universities.

30-12-2021||Noida||Agency for extension of Metro to Greater Noida West to be finalised soon||The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Wednesday said it will soon finalise the company for the construction of the 14.5-km long Greater Noida West Metro project. The NMRC opened the financial bids of three agencies, who have evinced interest in the construction of the project , on Tuesday. The corporation will soon finalise one of the agency to start work on the ground, said officials. The NMRC received the financial bids from GR Infraprojects Limited, which placed the lowest bid of ₹592.99 crore; Ashoka Buildcon Limited, which placed a quotation of ₹646.97 crore for the construction of the project and Sam India Buildwell Limited--the agency that was disqualified on technical grounds. “We have opened the financial bids and the process to finalise the agency is still underway,” said Ritu Maheshwari, managing director of the NMRC and CEO of the Noida authority. However, the NMRC is not sure as to when work will begin on ground. “The Government of India is yet to approve the detailed project report of this project... work cannot start without the approval,” said Maheshwari.Earlier, the NMRC was supposed to start work at the site by December end. But since the approval from the ministry of housing and urban affairs is awaited, it may take some more time to start work on the ground. “The process of sanctioning approval for the project is underway at the central government level. The approval can come anytime and the work will start soon. But the date cannot be fixed as to when the work will begin. However, in many cases the approval from the Government of India for Metro projects came later and we already started the work at the site. But here, it is the state government and the Noida authority which will decide the date from when work will begin on the ground,”said an official from the Noida authority requesting anonymity.In May 2020, the NMRC started the survey for testing the soil, topography and geography for the 14.95-km long Metro Corridor, which is set to branch out from the existing 29.7km-long Aqua Line.The new Metro link will start from the existing Metro station in Noida’s Sector 51 and go towards Knowledge Park 5 in Greater Noida. The line will pass through Greater Noida West (earlier known as Noida Extension), which shelters newly constructed group housing complexes. On December 12, 2019, the Noida and Greater Noida authorities decided that they will pool in money for the project, which passes through areas falling in the jurisdiction of the two authorities.The works proposed in the project, which is pegged at ₹2,682 crore, will be carried out in two phases.According to the detailed project report (DPR) submitted in December 2016, the first phase of the project, which will be 9.15km long, will have five Metro stations—Sector 122, Sector 123, Greater Noida Sector 4, Ecotech and Greater Noida Sector 2.In the second phase (5.8km) , four Metro stations—Greater Noida Sector 3, Greater Noida Sector 10, Greater Noida Sector 12 and Knowledge Park V—will be developed. The first phase of the project is scheduled to be completed by 2022.

30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Major blaze breaks out at fabric export unit||A massive blaze broke out at a fabric export unit in Bholapur village on Chandigarh Road on Wednesday afternoon. Labourers working at the fabric unit, Jawandsons, had a close shave as operations were on when the fire broke out at around 3pm. Panic gripped the area as thick clouds of black smoke were seen rising from the building. The staff was immediately evacuated, and no injury or casualty was reported. Ten fire tenders were pressed into service from five fire stations across the city. Sub-fire officer (SFO) Maninder Singh said, “This was a major incident. The windows on the top floor were broken with a crane and water was poured from all directions to try and restrict the flames to a single floor. The fire tenders were refilled around 100 times.” Fabric had been stocked on the top floor of the building, where the fire broke out. The reason for the fire is yet to be ascertained. Shed collapses Thick smoke and the collapse of a shed on the fourth floor hampered firefighting operations. Fire safety arrangements were in place at the unit, and the factory workers joined the firefighters in the operation. Fire safety arrangements were also made at the unit and workers helped the fire fighters in dousing the flames. The operation finally came to an end around 10pm. Absence of hydraulic ladder hinders opsThe absence of a hydraulic ladder added to the firefighters difficulties in extinguishing the flames in the high-rise building. The firefighters had to climb trucks and fire tenders to douse the flames on the fourth floor. The proposal for purchasing a hydraulic ladder for the fire brigade had been hanging fire for over a decade. Earlier this month, the MC finally received the go-ahead to purchase a 50m ladder under the Smart City mission. 2nd incident in 3 days This is the second fire incident reported at a fabric unit in three days.

30-12-2021||Noida||Noida: Parents demand closure of schools amid rising Covid-19 cases||Citing the spread of the Covid-19 infection among school-going children in the light of the new Omicron variant, the All Noida School Parents Association (ANSPA) shot a letter to the district inspector of schools (DIOS), Gautam Budh Nagar, demanding closure of schools in the district.Following an order issued by the Uttar Pradesh government, Gautam Budh Nagar DIOS Dharamvir Singh issued directives to all schools in the district regarding the continuation of physical classes albeit with the stringent implementation of Covid safety protocols.Yatendra Kasana, president of ANSPA , said physical classes should be discontinued and schools should go back to holding online classes.“Even the fully vaccinated individuals are at risk of contracting the Omicron variant of Covid-19, so how can parents take chances with the lives of their children, who are not vaccinated at all? We have written to the DIOS demanding closure of all schools and discontinuing physical classes amid rising cases of Covid-19 in the district. Once the children are vaccinated, we can think of sending them to school,” said Kasana.When asked, the DIOS said that in the fresh guidelines issued by the state government, parents’ consent has been made mandatory for schools to call children for physical classes.“This provision was not mandatory earlier. However, keeping in mind parents’ concerns, it has been issued as a directive to schools in the new guidelines. The new guidelines also direct schools to continue with a hybrid model of classes, wherein online classes need to be arranged for those children whose parents do not give consent for physical classes. This gives an option to the parents to decide whether or not they want to send their wards to schools,” said Singh.Education experts said the hybrid model works for those students who cannot afford to continue online classes. “All through the pandemic, students from financially humble families had to struggle for online classes. The government’s decision to allow hybrid model of classes gives all students an option that is suitable for them,” said Aditi Basu Roy, principal of Grads International School, Greater Noida and president of All India School Principals Association, Gautam Budh Nagar.

Police is probing from where Gagandeep, who was now a cloth trader, received the amount. The bank employee with whom Gagandeep was is touch has also been questioned. The woman constable, who was allegedly her lover, maintains that she did not hand him the money. Two former SHOs of Sadar police station, Khanna, have also been questioned, without much success. The role of Sukhwinder Singh Boxer, who is on production warrant till January 1, could provide crucial lead to investigation agencies.A resident of Rohno village near Khanna, Boxer and his three accomplices were arrested with 260-gm heroin and illegal weapons, when they were on their way to Doraha from Mohali on October 10. Investigators believed that Gagandeep (who was then a head constable) had come in touch with Boxer and later joined him and Ranjit Singh, a former cop who was also held on a drug smuggling case, in jail. “Ever after coming out of jail, Gagandeep was in constant touch with Boxer and Ranjit Singh,” sources said. Police being arrested, again, in 2019 Boxer was in touch with some militant groups in J&K, when he went there to procure AK-47 rifles, sources said. Boxer was lodged in Nabha jail, where he developed friendship with Khalistan Liberation Force terrorist Kashmir Singh Galwaddi, who had escaped during the Nabha jailbreak in 2017 and was later arrested.“Boxer is facing trial in 11 cases, including cases under the UAPA. He was also a friend of notorious gangster Harinder Singh, alias Rinda, of Nanded.

30-12-2021||Delhi||Omicron probably behind case spike in Delhi, shows analysis||More than half of the Covid-19 samples analysed in the last seven-day period by one of Delhi’s main hospitals carrying out genome analysis are of Omicron, according to data accessed by HT, which suggests the surge in cases in the city is being driven by the new variant of concern (VOC).Between December 21 and 28, the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) analysed 125 samples, of which 67 were of the Omicron variant. A person aware of the matter said the samples were from labs in different parts of the city, suggesting the virus may be in community transmission.“These positive samples were taken as part of sentinel surveillance as Delhi government has now decided to sequence all samples that test positive for Covid-19. We were suspecting it to be Omicron even before the whole genome sequencing results came as doubling time has been around 3 days, and Delta was not spreading this fast,” said a person familiar with the development, asking not to be named. This person said that based on the experience of other countries where the VOC has spread, cases will rise, perhaps peaking around the end of January, before the wave recedes sharply. “It looks it will subside soon after, and people should not panic. We are a Delta-infected community with 100% coverage of first Covid-19 vaccine dose; therefore, disease is likely to be less severe,” this person said. “Having said that, people must not drop their guard and strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing a masks, maintaining social distancing and hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded spaces etc,” added the person. The documents seen by HT included sequencing results from the National Centre for Disease Control and Lok Nayak hospital. It was not immediately clear what proportion of these were community samples since they also sequence samples from international travellers who test positive.At NCDC, a total of 263 samples were analysed out of which Omicron was found in 101, Delta variant in 27 samples, while the rest were unclassified. At Lok Nayak hospital, of a total 80 samples analysed, 12 were of Omicron while 62 were of the Delta variant. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, said the laboratory at the hospital has the capacity to analyse 100 samples in a day. “The capacity of the laboratory has been recently increased. Earlier the laboratory was able to analyse only around 40 samples in a day,” Kumar said. Dr Kumar said that since December 2 a total of 70 Omicron patients have been admitted to Lok Nayak hospital, out of which 50 have been discharged after treatment and 20 are currently admitted. “All had international travel history or were common contacts of those who arrived from abroad except two persons who apparently got infected at some wedding parties,” said Dr Kumar. Apart from Lok Nayak, Delhi has four private hospitals that have set up Omicron isolation units. Delhi government on December 18 asked Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket; Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlakabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj; and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital for institutional isolation facility for Omicron patients.Experts said it is clear that the variant was in circulation within the community because of the way numbers are escalating.“It is already there; we have been genome sequencing less samples, if we did more then, the number would go up further. The way number of cases are going up, it couldn’t be the delta variant. However, preventive measures remain the same- masking-up, vaccination, following other Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.
30-12-2021||Noida||Noida: 98% of cases reported in December vaccinated, no severe symptoms||Of the 127 adults who tested positive for Covid-19 in Noida from November 30 to December 28, 123, or 98%, were administered both vaccine doses, according to data from the health department. However, doctors said no one displayed severe symptoms, which was a positive sign. A total of 148 cases were reported in Noida from November 30 to December 28. It includes 21 patients below the age of 18, who were not eligible to take the vaccine, shows the health department report that was sent to the state government on Wednesday. Health officials said of the 127 adults who tested Covid positive, two were partially vaccinated while two others had not even taken the first dose yet. Additionally, there has been just one case of reinfection in the entire month--of a doctor from a private hospital. “These are positive trends. We have seen that most people who were infected were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. It is possible that their symptoms were mild because they had taken both vaccine doses. People need to take the vaccine doses on time. It is as important for preventing the spread of Covid, as sanitisation or social distancing,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer. He added that since the patients had mild symptoms and none of them required admission, Noida Covid hospital and Kailash hospital are the only two hospitals in the district as of now notified for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. 21 fresh cases in Noida As many as 21 cases were reported in Noida on Wednesday, taking the tally of Covid infections reported in the month of December to 162. Over 20 fresh cases have been reported for the second day in a row. There are a total of 99 active cases now in Gautam Budh Nagar, the highest in the state, shows official data. The health department is on alert and has increased daily testing to around 3,000 now. So far 63,582 Covid cases have been reported in the district on the back of 1,750,558 tests, with a positivity rate of 3.6%. The state government also conducted a sero survey from December 24 to 28 in 15 districts--Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Muradabad, Meerut, Prayagraj, Bareily, Banda, Agra, Kanpur, Maharajganj, Deoria and Azamgarh. A total of 1,496 samples were collected from across the state. “This is the second sero survey being conducted by the state government. We were given a list of people by the state. We contacted them and collected samples from those who gave consent. About 100 samples have been collected from people under five categories,” said Dr Amit Kumar, public health expert of the health department. He added that the categories included those over 60 years of age, healthcare workers who tested positive, healthcare workers who have not tested positive yet and those between 18-44 age group among others. The first sero survey conducted by the state in the first week of June after the second wave showed that 66.4% people had developed antibodies against the Covid infection in Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-98-of-cases-reported-in-december-vaccinated-no-severe-symptoms-101640804552300.html
30-12-2021||Mumbai||Healthy democracy can thrive with independent press: CJI Ramana||Mumbai Chief Justice of India (CJI) N V Ramana during his keynote address at the RedInk Awards for Excellence in Journalism hosted virtually by the Mumbai Press Club on Wednesday evening, while speaking on the current state of journalism and media, lamented the decline in the credibility of the noble profession which is “suffering due to lack of facts verification in the age of digital media” and stated that a professional journalist is one who does not permit “seeping of ideological stances and biases into the news story.” The CJI added that “A healthy democracy can thrive and survive only with a fearless and independent press.” CJI NV Ramana praised Mumbai city for being at the forefront of protecting the freedom of speech and expression and has produced great patriarchs, freedom fighters, human rights activists and journalists of great professional integrity. Stating that as he had started his career as a journalist and was aware of the difficulties and struggles faced by the scribes, the CJI said, “Speaking truth to power and holding up a mirror to society is an immense responsibility that is extremely difficult to fulfil. There is enormous pressure and stress upon you. In the contemporary world performing your duty as a journalist is akin to dancing on a razor’s edge.” While referring to the safety of journalists and their stress faced by their families CJI Ramana said, “Those in powerful positions, both political leaders and bureaucracy, the mafia of all shades and those on the wrong side of the law – none of them are comfortable with a professional journalist. As a result, you keep getting unpleasant and disturbing messages.” Stating that there were efforts to bracket journalists into a particular category and how painful it was, he said that it is yet an extremely satisfying profession to pursue and like the legal profession, the journalist’s job is noble. “Like the legal professional, a journalist also needs to have a strong moral fibre and moral compass. The freedom of the press is a valuable and sacred right enshrined in the Indian constitution, without such freedom there cannot be discussion and debate that is essential for the growth of democracy. There can be no flow of information that the public requires and democracy demands but the profession is vastly different from when I was a journalist. All things change, it is inevitable. Unless you are willing to evolve and change you will stagnate and be left behind,” said CJI Ramana. Speaking on the transformation of traditional journalism, he said that there is digital news media platforms and social media reporting. CJI Ramana said that while the transformation was good as more information was available for the people but added that there was cause for worry as well. Referring to the adverse and incorrect reporting which cannot be taken back from social media like YouTube, the CJI Ramana said, “You media professionals will have to voluntarily come forward with solutions for such a menace. I will advice all of you to follow the principles of natural justice before making adverse comments against someone who is not in a position to defend himself.” Referring to the bias in reporting, CJI Ramana said, “Another trend that I witness in reporting nowadays, is the seeping of ideological stances and biases into the news story. Interpretation and opinions are colouring what should be factual reports. News mixed with views is a dangerous cocktail.” “Nothing can be more lethal to democracy than the deadly combination of confrontational polity & competitive journalism. Tragically, they feed on each other. History is witness to this hard truth. Allowing yourself to be co-opted by an ideology or the state is a recipe for disaster,” said CJI Ramana. He also exhorted the media to defend the judiciary from motivated attacks by evil forces. “We are together in the mission of democracy and in promoting national interest, we have to sail together,” said CJI Ramana. The CJI also appreciated the work of Reuters photojournalist late Danish Siddiqui who was killed in Afghanistan and called him - the foremost photojournalist of this era. He also highlighted the dangerous working conditions of journalists working in areas of conflict. He also lauded the work of the journalists who lost their lives while reporting during the pandemic and thanked all others for highlighting the plight of citizens too. Speaking about the RedInk Awards for Excellence in Journalism, Gurbir Singh, chairman of Mumbai Press Club said that the awards had special significance this year as they marked the 10th edition of peer recognition for excellent writing and good journalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/healthy-democracy-can-thrive-with-independent-press-cji-ramana-101640804550870.html

As they had closed the door, they got suffocated, said the police. Officials said the victims hailed from Bulandshahr district in Uttar Pradesh and their relatives were informed about the incident. The last rites of the children will be performed on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-children-die-of-asphyxiation-in-abohar-101640804256126.html
30-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Proposal for urban ropeway project forwarded to Centre for approval||The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has forwarded a formal proposal of the urban passenger ropeway project in Ghaziabad to the ministry of road transport and highways (Morth) for approval while the permission for the project at the local-level will be sought in the authority’s board meeting scheduled on January 7, said officials in the know of the matter on Wednesday. The GDA’s ropeway project has been planned as an alternative to a Metro extension to connect Mohan Nagar on the Red line and Vaishali on the Blue line of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in Ghaziabad. General (retired) V K Singh, who is also minister of state for road transport and highways and civil aviation and also and MP from Ghaziabad, floated the proposal earlier this year. “We have forwarded a formal proposal of the ropeway project to the Morth for approval after we received the in-principle approval for the project at a meeting, which was attended by General Singh and other officials of the Centre, earlier in December. We will put forward the proposal before the GDA board in the upcoming board meeting, from where it will be routed to the state government,” said Ahish Shivpuri, GDA’s chief architect and town planner. “Once we get the approval from all the concerned authorities, the project may get a head start in June/July next year. As discussed, the Centre will bear 20% of the project cost, 60% will be borne by the agency which will develop the project and the GDA’s share will be 20%,” said Shivpuri. Ropeway is a transport system for ferrying goods or people, especially in mountainous areas or mines, wherein the carrier cars are suspended with the help of moving cables powered by a motor system. Earlier in October, the cost of the project, which was originally pegged at ₹ 487 crore, was reduced to ₹450 crore. GDA officials said the entire ropeway project will be elevated on 27 pillars and will move over the Regional Rapid Transit System alignment near Sahibabad. The project’s detailed project report has proposed four stations for the ropeway at Mohan Nagar, Sahibabad, Vasundhara and Vaishali. The first and the last stations will be connected to the respective Metro stations with the help of 150m-long skywalks, which will be constructed by the GDA. According to the DPR estimates, a passenger will have to shell out a minimum fare of ₹20 and a maximum of ₹30 for travelling the entire distance. It is also estimated that the ropeway system will be used by 80,000 passengers in a week once it begins full-fledged operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-proposal-for-urban-ropeway-project-forwarded-to-centre-for-approval-101640804246250.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||2 weeks after Omicron hit Delhi, fewer than 3% Covid hospital beds occupied||Fewer than 3% of the 21,518 beds in hospitals earmarked for Covid patients are currently occupied, leaving over 97% beds vacant even after more over two weeks of Omicron invasion in the Capital. For a city reeling under multiple travel and economic curbs imposed to contain rapid Covid spread, the negligible hospital beds occupancy as of December 28 is a major relief. It underlines that the variant appears to be in line with global trends that it is more transmissible but less virulent, and that the variant of concern (VOC) does not crowd hospitals like the Delta variant did.Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, the Delhi government’s largest hospital, said most of the Omicron positive patients test negative for Covid within a week, while those infected with Delta variant took around 11 days to turn negative. “Almost all the Covid-positive cases admitted at Lok Nayak Hospital did not have any symptoms and recovered very fast,” Kumar said.A Delhi government official said that the faster recovery rate, and lower requirement for hospital treatment or oxygen suggests that the bed occupancy is likely to remain low even if the current level of spike in Covid cases continues for weeks.As of December 28, only 2.92% of thededicated normal beds and 3% oxygenated beds are occupied, while ICU occupancy is only 0.97%, and only 1% of ventilators are being used. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said, “Although the Omicron variant is highly transmissible is mild in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely to have high hospital admission rate in India. Another reason of the lower health impact of Omicron is the high percentage of infection during previous waves. People with positive RT-PCR tests but with mild symptoms should not rush to hospital, be calm, and manage with home isolation, as suggested by the government,” said Dr Kishore.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also appealed to people not to panic because Omicron variant is highly transmissible, but extremely mild with fewer hospitalisations and casualties.The government is also strengthening the home isolation model to deal with the spike in cases. Under the home isolation system, as soon as someone tests positive, they will get a phone call from the government. “They’ll be told that the authorities will be in constant touch, and provide all the help you need. Then, a team from the Delhi government will visit their house and give them a Covid kit with all required items, including an oximeter. From then on, doctors will counsel them every day till they get cured. Whatever agencies that are needed to be on-boarded for this whole arrangement will be employed within a couple of days. I have given strict orders to get this done. We are taking radical steps to take care of the situation. Till now our home visit capacity was around 1,000 cases a day. We are now escalating it to 1 lakh a day,” Kejriwal said on December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-weeks-after-omicron-hit-delhi-fewer-than-3-covid-beds-hospitals-occupied-101640804186366.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||Woman gang-raped inside car in Delhi, 2 nabbed||A 30-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar by two men inside a moving car on early Monday morning, police said on Wednesday. Police said the suspects were arrested from their homes in outer Delhi’s Ranhola, a few hours after a case was registered at the Hari Nagar police station on Monday. Police said the suspects were drunk, and were driving around the area when they spotted the woman walking on the road at 3am. Investigators said it is one of the rare rape cases in the city, in which the survivor -- who is not known or related to the accused person. About 1,500 rape cases are registered in Delhi each year, of which less than 2% fall in this category, they said. In almost 98% of the cases, the alleged rapists are usually friends, neighbours, family members, partners or someone known to the survivor.Investigators said the woman called up the police control room at 4.30am on Monday. They said that the woman reported that she was offered a lift by two men in a car from Hari Nagar, and raped her inside the vehicle. She said that the suspects threw her outside in outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar area.A police team reached the spot, and took the woman to a nearby government hospital. Investigators said a medical examination of the woman has confirmed sexual assault. A police officer involved in the probe said the woman could not tell the police the exact spot where she was offered the lift by the two suspects. She was also not aware of the route that they took to Nihal Vihar since it was dark, the officer, who asked not to be named, said. Quoting the victim’s initial statement to the police, the officer said she left her house in west Delhi after a fight with her husband. “We had basic details. She said after she walked for some time on the road, two men in a car offered her lift. The woman said that she asked them to drop her at a nearby place,” said a second officer who is also part of the probe.The police checked footage from the CCTVs installed in the areas mentioned by the woman, and found that she left her house around 2.45am. At 3 am, she was picked up from Hari Nagar, and was thrown out of the car at 4.25 am in Nihal Vihar – nearly 10 kms away from where she was offered the lift. Referring to several posts on the social media about the case which mentioned that the police were fighting over jurisdiction, instead of investigating the matter, senior police officers confirmed that initially there was a confusion over the issue since Hari Nagar is part of west police district, and Nihal Vihar falls under the outer police district. The officer added that as soon as the facts of the case became clear, the matter was resolved and the case was immediately registered at the Hari Nagar police station. Additional DCP (West) Prashant Gautam said a case under sections 376 (D) (gang rape) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC has been registered. “Teams were immediately formed to crack the case. With the help of a technical investigation, two people were apprehended,” he said.Investigating officers said they got the registration number of the car through CCTV footage, and found that it was registered on an address in Ranhola. “A woman who lived at the address said her relative Vinit was using the car. We arrested Vinit and his friend Sagar. The two confessed that it was Sagar’s birthday on Christmas, and they were celebrating it on Sunday night. They confessed that they found the woman standing alone, and offered a lift after which they raped her,” one investigating officer said. Vinit, 29, and Sagar, 20 were both referred to only by their first names in the FIR.Police said Vinit has a criminal background. “There were four cases of robbery and other petty crimes registered against Vinit. Sagar does not have a criminal record,” said a third officer, adding that police were checking the records of the two suspects with all other stations in Delhi.Between January 1 and November 30, Delhi reported at least 1,845 rapes, compared to 1,448 in 2020. Cases of outraging a woman’s modesty, which police tags as “eve teasing”, also increased this year with 2,193 cases being reported this year so far. Last year, 1,824 such cases were reported, according to Delhi Police data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-gang-raped-inside-car-in-delhi-2-nabbed-101640804007723.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||Woman moves Delhi HC over delay in genome test report of her Covid+ son||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the response of the Centre and the city government on a plea by a woman who sought to know the outcome of the genome sequencing test of her Covid positive son.The petitioner added that her son was not being discharged by a private hospital for the lack of clarity on the virus variant.According to the plea, the 18-year-old arrived at the Delhi airport from one of the “at-risk” countries and tested positive for Covid-19. He has been in isolation at a private hospital since December 25 morning, the plea said.Justice Jyoti Singh said the protocols imposed by the authorities ought to be followed, but the petitioner was entitled to know the genome test result as it was not a “national secret”.“They (governments) have to tell who has done the genome sequencing and when the report is going to come. The court will ensure that it comes to you (mother) and for that, we have to give them a day’s time… It’s your son and his genome sequencing. Why shouldn’t you know it? I don’t understand if there is any national secret in that,” the judge told the petitioner.The court issued notices and granted time to the counsels for the two governments to seek instructions.The judge said that the court expected both the governments to inform “what has happened to the genomic testing; who is doing it; where is the report and when will the report come”.The Centre’s counsel said the Delhi government was “managing the whole scenario”, and the Delhi government counsel stated that it was “not clear from the petition” as to who carried out the genome test.The matter will now be heard on December 31.“There is a boy in the hospital for the past couple of days. You have to tell the court what happens to your genomic testing. You are right, these are the guidelines. Protocols have to be followed. These are good things but at the end of the day, she wants to know where my genomic testing report is because my child is being kept in the hospital to await the outcome of the report. She is entitled to say that and entitled to know that,” the court said.The counsel for the petitioner informed the court that upon the arrival at the Delhi international airport from one of the at-risk countries, the son tested positive for the virus and then a second swab was collected by the authorities for genome sequencing but no “lab reference number” was provided to enable the patients to track the report.The petitioner, who was present in person, claimed that her son was in isolation at a private hospital since the morning of December 25 and was not being discharged to await the result of the genome sequencing test.She claimed that in spite of her son being a mild case of COVID-19, the private hospital was not re-testing him.Following this, the court asked both the Centre and the Delhi government to resolve the issue and tell the court as to who had taken the swab for conducting the genome test.“I’m not meddling with your guidelines and protocol. I’m not interfering in anything else. My only concern as a court … (is) when children are coming from foreign countries, they are anxious and their parents are anxious,” the court responded.The court also asked the authorities to inform it about the status of the petitioner’s son’s COVID-19 re-test, if any.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-moves-delhi-hc-over-delay-in-genome-test-report-of-her-covid-son-101640803947636.html
30-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Camps to be set up in schools to administer jabs to children||The district health department has chalked out a strategy to inoculate as many as children as possible in two weeks starting from January 3, the day from when the vaccination programme for beneficiaries falling in the 15-18 years age group is supposed to roll out. In his address to the nation on December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccination for children in the 15-18 years will start from January 3, 2022. Health officials said they have sent communication to schools to collect data of children falling in the 15-18 years age group. The district currently has 250 teams involved in the vaccination process and about 50-75 teams may be diverted for vaccinating children. “We have planned to set up camps in schools for inoculating children. We will divert about 50-75 teams, which will set up vaccination camps and cover all private and government schools. Children can also come along with their parents to the regular vaccination centres. This way, we will be able to enhance our vaccination coverage and ensure maximum children are inoculated within two weeks,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer.Officials said they will be concentrating all their efforts on vaccinating children as of the 107 Covid patients reported in Ghaziabad district so far in the month of December, 17 of them are children. According to official data, there are nearly 250,000 children in the district in the 15-18 years age group. Officials said that they are also waiting for the guidelines for the vaccination of children from the state health department.Experts said the vaccination strategy for children should also include allotment of exclusive online slots and special vaccination centres only for children. “Such measures can be taken up to boost vaccination coverage among children.More vaccination camps should be set up in schools, as children will find it more convenient and be more comfortable there unlike in regular vaccination centres.The severity of infection among patients nowdays is almost negligible and most patients have remained in home isolation with mild symptoms,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). Tally of Covid cases breaches 100-mark The tally of Covid cases in Ghaziabad district crossed the 100 mark as 12 fresh cases were reported on Wednesday, taking the tally of infections reported in the month of December to 107. Of the 12 cases, six are from Kaushambi, three from Indirapuram and one each from New Vijay Nagar, Vaishali, and Shastri Nagar. There are 73 active cases in the district, with 68 patients in home isolation while the remaining are taking treatment in healthcare facilities. According to official records, the district has so far recorded 55,789 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. With the rise in cases, the sample positivity has also gone up to 0.07% on Wednesday, while it was 0.01% on November 30. The overall sample positivity rate now stands at 2.68%.

Five rescue teams are still camping in the area to avoid any possible man-animal conflict,” said Ravi K Singh, divisional forest officer on Wednesday. Forest officials said that chances were that the animal might have retreated to the forest area. The forest department has issued guidelines for locals to stay safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/leopard-spotted-in-lucknow-3-days-ago-still-untraceable-forest-dept-101640803766094.html
30-12-2021||Noida||Covid curbs: Commuters in Ghaziabad wait in long queues for Metro ride||Long queues were spotted outside Metro stations in Ghaziabad as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) started restricting passengers’ movement at stations after the Delhi government issued a ‘yellow alert’ under the first phase of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital.The Delhi government issued the yellow alert as the Covid positivity rate has been above 0.5% for two consecutive days---0.68% on December 27 and 0.89% on December 28. Queues of people started piling up outside different stations on the Red line and the Blue line of the DMRC network in Ghaziabad as the time taken for entering the stations increased. The DMRC’s Red line has eight stations in Ghaziabad with the Metro corridor terminating at the New Bus Adda station while the Blue line has two stations with the terminating station at Vaishali.Passengers were seen waiting outside the New Bus Adda, Arthala, Mohan Nagar and Vaishali Metro stations. “The time taken for entering stations has increased. I had to wait for about an hour to enter the station at New Bus Adda and got late for office,” said Monu Sharma, a resident of Kavi Nagar. “I waited for about half an hour outside the New Bus Adda Metro station and then decided to take an auto to Anand Vihar border to reach Delhi. The queues outside the stations were very long and hardly any social distancing was being observed,” said Mohammad Nazim, a passenger. The Delhi government on Tuesday announced a series of curbs in the national capital in the wake of rising Covid cases. According to the new guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), Metro trains have to run with 50% occupancy on the seats and no standing passengers are allowed. A spokesperson of DMRC said the waiting time increased due to restrictions which were rolled out on Tuesday. “We have advised passengers to keep extra time in hand for their journey. The seating capacity has been restricted to 50% in a coach and no one will be allowed to commute by standing.The movement of passengers and queues inside the Metro station premises are being monitored by the DMRC; the queues outside the stations falls under the jurisdiction of the local administration. The schedule and number of trains have not been curtailed,” said the DMRC spokesperson. After the new guidelines were announced, the DMRC said of the 712 Metro gates in the network, only 444 will be kept open. The DMRC has also urged people to travel only for essential activities. “In view of the restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, entry through some of the gates will be regulated. Passengers are therefore requested to travel only if absolutely essential and keep some additional time for their travel,” it tweeted on Tuesday. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the DMRC said they have deployed 15 flying squads across the network to ensure that Covid safety protocol is being strictly adhered to by passengers inside trains and in the premises of the Metro stations. Officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said they have advised residents and commuters to strictly follow Covid protocols. “We again urge people to follow Covid protocols; violation may lead to imposition of penalty as well as legal action. We have also directed our teams to carry out inspections at Metro stations to check for violations,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city). 
30-12-2021||Delhi||Miles to go for a Metro as Covid curbs limit train capacity in Delhi||Commuters waited in serpentine queues before Metro stations across Delhi, Ghaziabad and Gurugram on Wednesday as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation regulated entry of passengers to prevent crowding as well enforce the DDMA rule to allow only 50% seating capacity that was issued under the Yellow Alert on Tuesday, after a fresh spike in Covid cases and the positivity rate staying above 0.5% for two consecutive days. Commuters at several stations said they had to wait up to an hour that resulted in a prolonged travel time. They added that since both government and private offices are still open, and there were no curbs on movement of people during the day, adequate public transport arrangements should have been made. Travellers also said that since DMRC allowed passenger entry from few gates, it led to long queues outside the station, and flouting of social distancing norms. Public bus users too complained that they had to wait for nearly an hour at bus shelters due to limited carriage capacity. The DDMA order says that both Metro and public buses will be allowed to carry passengers up to 50% seating capacity, and that no standing travellers will be allowed. At Laxmi Nagar Metro station in east Delhi, there was a long queue outside the station in the morning. A similar situation was reported from Akshardham, Mohan Garden, Rohini West, Kirti Nagar Metro stations in Delhi, and Shaheed Sthal (new Bus Adda) and Arthala stations in Ghaziabad. In Gurugram, there was rush outside Iffco Chowk and Huda City Centre stations, but only in the evening. In the evening, hundreds of people were seen waiting outside several gates to the Rajiv Chowk Metro station.Office goers were also seen waiting outside Mandi House and Barakhamba Metro stations. Many Metro commuters tweeted to share the inconvenience they had to face to enter the station as well as prolonged travelling time. Pronjoy Kumar Ghose, a banking professional, tweeted, “Shame on Delhi metro @ArvindKejriwal we bank employees need to attend office any how and you are letting us stand in kilometre long que ! Please arrange priority entrance for essential service provider (sic).”To manage the crowd at the stations, the Metro on Tuesday decided to open just one or two gates at all stations. Of the total 712 gates at its stations, only 444 were kept open on Wednesday, said a DMRC official.In some cases, however, all gates at a few stations for shut to regulate the crowd. But, they were opened soon. Pradeep Singh, who works with a private firm, waited for nearly 20 minutes outside the Laxmi Nagar station on Wednesday morning before taking an auto to reach his office in Karol Bagh. “I usually take the Metro, as it takes just half an hour of commuting time. Today, I had to take an auto since there was a long queue before the station, and couldn’t waited so long to board the train. Instead of reducing the capacity by 50%, they should just ask Metro to ensure social distancing in trains,” he said.Transport experts also pointed out that the Metro systems are designed to provide more standing capacity than seating in order to carry a large number of commuters.According to DMRC officials, on an average around 1,800 passengers can travel in a six-coach train in one trip. But as standing passengers are not allowed and seating has been reduced to 50%, only 300-odd passengers can travel on one trip.With almost 400km-long network in Delhi-NCR, the Metro is considered the transport lifeline of the capital. But post-Covid pandemic, there have been several challenges for both for the commuters and the operators in order to ensure Covid protocols are followed. Metro services were closed for over five months since March last year when the nationwide lockdown was announced due to the pandemic. Even after the services resumed in September last year, Metro operated on 50% seating capacity. In July this year, the Delhi government allowed 100% seating, and standing passengers (30 per coach) were allowed last month.Raja Chowdhury, who works with a private firm, said, “It was the fastest and most convenient mode of travel in Delhi. But today, it was a pain, as I had to wait for almost 40 minutes outside Rajiv Chowk in the evening. Now I’ll take a cab or auto till this restriction continues.”Metro deployed multiple teams to check violations of Covid norms in trains and at stations. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC said, “As part of the intensified measures for containing Covid-19 spread, 15 flying squads have been deployed across the Delhi Metro network to ensure that the Covid safety protocol is strictly adhered to by the passengers inside trains and premises. The frequency of checking drives is also being increased to ensure strict adherence to the guidelines and offenders are also being penalised on the spot.”Some Metro users requested the DMRC on social media to increase the number of security check counters at the stations. Ankit Sharma, a Metro user, tweeted, “It is fine that some gates have been closed due to the new restrictions due to the rise in the number of Covid cases. But please increase the number of security check counters so that there is no crowding at the platform.”Public busesFor lakhs of Delhiites, especially in rural areas or those not having direct Metro connectivity, the cluster and Delhi Transport Corporation buses are crucial for daily commute. But with the carrying capacity of buses restricted, those dependent on public bus service faced difficulty in travelling to their workplaces on Wednesday.There are currently over 6,700 DTC and cluster buses in the capital. At its full capacity, including standing passengers, these buses carry about 4.2 million people every day.A senior transport department official said, “Due to the restriction, the capacity capacity has reduced drastically as only 50% seating is allowed.”When asked if the DTC was planning to rope in private buses to enhance the bus fleet till restrictions are in place, the official said, “Private buses are roped in during peak pollution time, especially during odd-even. But this restriction is related to Covid. There is no plan as of now to rope in private buses.”Due to the restriction, the capacity of para transit such as autorickshaws, taxis, e-rickshaws etc has also been restricted to two passengers per vehicle.Experts speakTransport experts say that there is a need to make short and long-term plans to address the challenges in order to stop public transport users from switching to personal vehicles.To immediately address the problems being faced by the commuters, the experts suggested that the government should add buses to the public fleet, and coaches to Metro trains to enhance carriage capacity.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “There is an urgent need to augment the capacity of the public transport infrastructure. The Metro should add more coaches and the number of public transport buses should be increased so that commuters don’t face much problem. This will also prevent people from switching to personal vehicles for daily commute.”He said that private bus operators can be roped in, like it was done during the odd-even scheme, to provide better services.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said that augmenting the bus fleet will provide immediate relief to commuters, but measures should also be planned for short distance travel. She also suggested that staggered working hours should be implemented. “A lot of people use public transport or personal vehicles for short distance travel within 3-4 km. There is a need to develop efficient and safe walking and cycling infrastructure so that people can walk or cycle. Staggered working hours will also help in bringing down the pressure on the public transport system during peak hours,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/miles-to-go-for-a-metro-as-covid-curbs-limit-train-capacity-in-delhi-101640803526751.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||2021: The year when Delhi broke a weather record every month||It was a year of extreme weather events and records being broken in the Capital each month this year, which could indicate that the impact of the climate crisis is becoming more prominent over time. Not only did Delhi see extreme cold waves at the start and end of the year, it witnessed an intense monsoon that continued well into late October as the city recorded 1,512.4mm of rainfall till December 29, the second highest ever, behind 1,534.3mm in 1933.The heat was just as intense, with a “severe heatwave” recorded in June, while Delhi recorded its second warmest February in the last 120 years. March was little different, bringing the hottest day that month in the last 76 years, data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows.The year began with January recording the highest number of cold wave days (seven) since 2008, and breaking the record for the highest rainfall seen that month in the last 21 years with 56.6mm of precipitation. February on the other hand was a complete contrast, with the cold dissipating to bring uncomfortable heat for that time of the year.The month recorded a mean maximum temperature of 27.9 degrees Celsius for the entire month, making it the second warmest February in the last 120 years, behind only 2006, when the mean maximum was 29.7 degrees. In March, the maximum touched 40.1 degrees Celsius on March 29, eight degrees above normal for this time of the year.Then, April brought an unusual cold spell back to the region. Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 11.7 degrees Celsius (°C) on April 4 – the lowest minimum for the month in 12 years.In May came the impact of Cyclone Tauktae, and several records tumbled. The cyclone brought 119.3mm of rainfall to Delhi on May 19, the highest single-day rain for the month ever. The same day, Delhi’s maximum temperature was just 23.8°C — the lowest for May since 1951. The monsoon was erratic, arriving only on July 13 — 16 days after the normal date of June 27. This meant that June sizzled, with a heatwave recorded on June 29, which turned into a “severe heatwave” on June 30, taking Delhi’s maximum to 43.5°C – seven degrees above normal. From July onwards, several rain records were broken. There were three “heavy rainfall” spells recorded during the month, with the cumulative figure hitting 507.1mm, the second highest ever seen in the city. In August, Delhi recorded a “very heavy” rainfall spell of 138.8mm in a single day – the highest single day rainfall for August since 2007. And in September, Delhi recorded 413.3mm of rainfall – an excess of 230%, making it the highest rainfall for the month since 1944 and the second highest in 121 years. The monsoon’s exit was delayed by 13 days, finally withdrawing on October 8. However, a “heavy” rainfall spell of 87.9mm on October 18 led to Delhi receiving 122.5mm of rainfall during the month, making it the fourth highest for the month since 1900. Though no major weather record was broken in November, it was unusual as no western disturbances were recorded for the month, as opposed to usual one to two, making it a polluted month, and one in which the average monthly maximum was 27.8°C, the lowest since 2013.December so far has been warmer than usual, with the mean minimum temperature hovering at 8.4°C, the highest since 2017, but the Capital saw three “cold wave” days between December 19 and 21, which saw the mercury touching a season-low of 3.2°C. This is Delhi’s lowest for December since 2019. R.K Jenamani, scientist at the India Meteorological Department, said Delhi has had an unusual year, with frequent western disturbances and wet spells impacting the Capital. “Barring an unusually hot day in March, the period from March to May saw six to eight western disturbances in each month and there were plenty of wet spells. Annually, Delhi has received over 1,500mm of rainfall, but to link it to climate change, one will have to assess data over time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2021-the-year-when-delhi-broke-a-weather-record-every-month-101640803466753.html

This was the first time the MNNIT had participated in the rankings. I congratulate the entire MNNIT fraternity for this achievement,” said MNNIT director Prof Rajeev Tripathi. According to Tripathi, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras has been ranked best in this sub category followed by IITs of Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur and Roorkee, respectively, making up the top 5. These institutions are followed by Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, IITs of Hyderabad and Kharagpur, besides National Institute of Technology (NIT), Calicut along with MNNIT-Allahabad making the Top-10. ARIIA-2021 classified participating institutions into two major categories: Technical and non-technical. The technical category in turn has five sub-categories: CFTIs, central university and institute of national importance; state university and deemed university (government and government aided); government college/institution (government and government aided); university and deemed university (self-finance/private) besides private college/institute (self-finance/private). The newly introduced non-technical category classified higher education institutions into two sub-categories: CFIs/Central University/Institute of National Importance (non-technical) and general (non-technical). The ARIIA is a joint initiative of the ministry of education and AICTE to systematically rank higher educational institutions in India on indicators related to innovation, start-up and entrepreneurship development amongst students and faculty.It evaluates institutions on parameters like patent filing and grants, number of registered students and faculty startups, fund generation by incubated startups, specialised infrastructure created by institutions to promote innovation and entrepreneurship, etc. The first edition of the ARIIA was launched in 2018. This achievement comes close on the heels of MNNIT-Allahabad being awarded four stars in the annual performance result of Institution’s Innovation Council (IIC): 2020-21, announced recently by union ministry of education’s innovation cell (MIC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/atal-rankings-of-institutions-on-innovation-achievements-mnnit-bags-10th-position-among-cftis-and-cus-101640803347890.html

30-12-2021||Delhi||Visibility below 100m amid season’s first ‘dense’ fog spell in Delhi||Delhi recorded its first “dense” fog spell of the winter season, with visibility dropping below 100 metres at Palam on Wednesday between 9am and 10am. The IMD classifies fog to be “dense” when visibility drops below 200 metres, while it is classified as “very dense” when it drops below 50 metres. Visibility between 200 and 500 metres is “moderate” while between 500 and 1,000 metres is “shallow” fog. Delhi is expected to record “moderate” fog on Thursday as well, with isolated parts recording “dense” fog. “Visibility was down to 100 metres at Palam between 9 and 10am, while “shallow” fog was recorded at Safdarjung. This is the first “dense” fog spell of this winter season and fog intensity is expected to remain high for the next few days,” says RK Jenamani, scientist at India Meteorological Department.While no flight cancellations or diversions were reported at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, some flights were delayed during this one hour-window.An airport official, requesting anonymity, confirmed there were minimal delays due to the fog, with no cancellations or diversions reported either. “Some flights were delayed, but the impact was only for around an hour. During this period, flight operations functioned smoothly,” the official said.Due to increased moisture in Delhi’s air after Tuesday’s light rain, the Capital’s air quality improved to “poor” with the Air Quality Index (AQI) recording a reading of 267 -- down from Tuesday’s reading of 305 (very poor).An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is considered “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 8.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday – one degree above normal– while the maximum was 21.2 degrees, also one degree above normal for this time of the season. Jenamani said the minimum temperature could hover between 5 and 6 degrees Celsius for the next two days, with the maximum temperature settling at around 21 degrees Celsius. “Another western disturbance is expected to influence northwest India in the next two or three days, which will bring coldwave conditions to Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh between December 30 and January 1; however, the impact in Delhi will not be much and the minimum could hover around 5 to 6 degrees Celsius,” Jenamani said.Delhi’s air quality is expected to hover between the “poor” and “moderate” categories in the next few days. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a forecasting body, wind speed will remain high on December 30, 31 and January 1, allowing air quality to improve further. “Delhi’s AQI has improved due to Tuesday’s rain but is still within the ‘poor’ category. Relatively high wind speeds are likely for the next three days (December 30, 31, January 1), enhancing ventilation and affecting AQI to be in the lower end of the ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category,” said Safar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/visibility-below-100m-amid-season-s-first-dense-fog-spell-in-delhi-101640802986080.html
30-12-2021||Mumbai||State advises people to keep New Year celebrations low key||Mumbai The Maharashtra government has issued fresh guidelines asking people to welcome the new year from home and avoid stepping out as far as possible. The guidelines also urged citizens to keep the new year celebrations low key. The directives have been issued amid concerns of a spike in Covid cases owing to the outbreak of the Omicron variant.The guidelines were issued by the state home department on Wednesday.It reminded the order issued by the state Disaster Management Authority on December 24 and said that a night curfew has already been imposed prohibiting gathering of five or more people at places between 9 pm to 6 am.“People up to 25 per cent of the total capacity can come together to celebrate the New Year event at an open space, while for events to be organised in a closed enclosure, people up to 50 per cent of the total capacity will be allowed. But there should be no crowds and social distancing should be maintained along with masks, sanitizers and other Covid appropriate norms,” states the order.The state government asked citizens above 60 years of age and children below ten years of age to avoid stepping out of their homes. They have also asked people not to crowd beaches, gardens, parks and roads during the night of December 31 especially popular destinations in Mumbai such as Gateway of India, Marine Lines, Chowpatty and Juhu beaches. The state home department guidelines also said that no religious or cultural programmes or marches be organised. “Those like to visit religious places on the first day of the new year should also avoid going to religious gatherings. Do not have a display of firecrackers during the New Year celebrations and follow sound pollution rules,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-advises-people-to-keep-new-year-celebrations-low-key-101640802746257.html
30-12-2021||Delhi||‘Wait, watch’: Delhi to not raise alert level yet||Yellow alert Covid-19 restrictions will continue in the Capital for the time being, the city’s administration decided on Wednesday, holding off on more curbs immediately if the next level according to its graded response action plan (Grap) is breached, while monitoring the nature of the outbreak and its severity. The decision comes at a time when scientific and epidemiological evidence from other countries suggest the Omicron variant is significantly less virulent than Delta, and is likely to lead to mild, often asymptomatic disease, even if the surge is sharp. “It was decided to continue with the existing restrictions imposed recently in view of rising cases and to keep a close vigil on the ground situation. The health department was advised to enhance the health preparedness to deal effectively with the emerging situation and to closely monitor bed occupancy besides strengthening the home isolation strategy,” lieutenant government Anil Baijal stated in a tweet.Under the government’s Covid-19 graded plan Grap, curbs on activity and movement become stricter if the number of new cases, the positivity rate or the rate of hospitalisations breach certain threshold. On Wednesday, one of these thresholds – 1% positivity rate – was breached after a gap of 212 days. “No fresh restrictions will be immediately imposed after the positivity rate remains over 1% for two consecutive days. The government is monitoring the situation and, will take any decision about imposing fresh curbs when the needs arise,” said a senior Delhi government official, who asked not to be named. According to the health bulletin released by the government on Wednesday, of the 2,191 active cases, 55 were on oxygen support with the rest being asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The number of new cases were 923, comprising 1.29% of tests that were conducted.The yellow alert, triggered when positivity rate stayed above 0.5%, led to a night curfew, closing of schools, colleges, movie theatres and gyms, triggering concerns from parents, child health experts, and the business community. Most of these groups said the government must readjust to account for Omicron variant’s reduced virulence.When amber alert is activated, public parks and gardens will have to close, Delhi Metro occupancy will need to be capped at 33%, restaurants and bars will need to shut for dine-in, and a weekend curfew will come in force.Wednesday’s decision was taken in a meeting of the DDMA chaired by Baijal, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendra Jain, and revenue minister Kailash Gahlot in attendance, in addition to Dr VK Paul from NITI Aayog, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, and others.The CM, people aware of the matter, said the DDMA should not rush to impose more curbs at this moment since the overall caseload was low and nearly 98% hospital beds were still vacant. The people added that deputy CM Manish Sisodia suggested the emerging Covid situation should be closely monitored before more curbs are imposed otherwise there could be panic and people may be motivated to migrate back. On previous occasions, drastic curbs have triggered reverse migration leading to unchecked gatherings at interstate bus terminals.DDMA also discussed at length whether it should make some amendments to the minimum criteria fixed under Grap for imposing the curbs, including whether the words “or” between the three factors be replaced by “and”. If such a change is to be made, all three tests must be met for the next level of curbs, the amber alert: a positivity rate above 1% for two days, at least 3,500 new cases a week, and at least 700 oxygen beds in hospitals being occupied over a seven-day period.“It was discussed whether positivity rate or new cases or hospitalisation should be given higher weightage in arriving at a decision to impose further curbs. No final decision was taken on changing the criteria even after discussion. It was decided that the DDMA should closely monitor the emerging situation and authorities should be asked to strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and strictly impose the curbs imposed under the first phase of restrictions,” a government official said not wanting to be identified.“After detailed discussion with experts the need to strictly follow and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour was emphasised upon especially in wake of rising cases of the Omicron variant. It was also reiterated to continue with the test, track and treat strategy with special focus on surveillance, delineation of containment zones, isolation of positive cases and close monitoring of home isolation cases so as to break the chain of transmission,” the LG tweeted after the DDMA meeting.DDMA called upon all stakeholders for collective and concerted efforts to deal with the pandemic without lowering guard.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said that Covid positivity over 1% does not indicate as dangerous sign as it did with Delta variant. “Due to high transmissibility of the Omicron variant, more infection would be there in the community but this will not result in hospital admission and case fatality. Therefore, stringent restriction would be of no use. According to recent pre-print research from South Africa, it is found that infection due to Omicron develops more neutralizing antibodies to the variant and also to Delta variant. Omicron is acting as vaccine to replace previous severe variants with milder form which could limit the pandemic in coming time,” he said.Confederation of All India Traders general secretary Praveen Khandelwal welcomed DDMA’s move not to go immediately go ahead with fresh economic and travel curbs. “The Covid situation appears to be under control, so the government should do away with odd-even restrictions on the markets and focus on strictly enforcing Covid appropriate behaviour. The night curfew should also be withdrawn because while protecting people from Omicron is important, protecting people from hunger is equally important,” said Khandelwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-fresh-restrictions-immediately-ddma-to-continue-with-existing-curbs-101640802146790.html
30-12-2021||Lucknow||Focus on Ayodhya and Kashi during poll campaigns, Amit Shah tells partymen||VARANASI Ahead of the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Union home minister Amit Shah directed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office bearers in Kashi and Gorakhpur regions to keep their election campaign centred around Ayodhya and Kashi, party functionaries familiar with the matter said.The directions were given when Shah, who arrived for a day’s visit in Varanasi on Tuesday, held a two-hour meeting with party office bearers of the two regions. During the meeting, the Union minister directed the leaders to prepare a list of projections of the party’s performance on each seat in both the regions. He asked them to classify all the seats as A (seats on which BJP’s win is sure), B (seats on which there is a fight) and C (seats on which the party is not in a strong position, and thus, need more attention), a functionary said on condition of anonymity.“Kashi and Ayodhya should be kept in the centre during campaigning,” the functionary quoted Shah as saying. The state government has undertaken various development projects in the two religious sites. While the construction of the Ram Temple is underway in Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 13 inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath corridor to transform the pilgrims’ experience of the temple town. Shah also told the office bearers to ensure that a meeting of party workers was held in every mandal (area comprising several mohallas) in each Vidhan Sabha, as per schedule, and participation of booth-level workers in those meetings. “People from every section of the society should be connected to the party. Rallies must be held in the assembly constituencies and a good atmosphere should be created in favour of the party,” the functionary quoted Shah as saying.The home minister also said that booth level workers should hold regular talks with people in their areas and apprise them of the various schemes and developmental works carried out by the party in the state and at the Centre. Among those present in the meeting were BJP Kashi region president Mahesh Chandra Srivastava, in-charge Subrata Pathak, state co-in-charge Sunil Ojha, election co-in-charge Saroj Pandey, state vice president Laxman Acharya and Goraksh region president Dharmendra Singh. Prior to meeting office bearers, Shah held a meeting with Uttar Pradesh deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya at the Circuit House, where he stressed on synergy between the government and the organisation (party). Samajwadi Party state spokesperson Manoj Rai Dhoopchandi said: “The double engine government of the BJP failed to carry out any development in Uttar Pradesh. That is why, the BJP have started talking about temples just before the election.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/poll-campaigns-should-revolve-around-ayodhya-and-kashi-amit-shah-tells-partymen-101640782284739.html
30-12-2021||Chandigarh||Innovation index: Panjab University first among govt, aided universities||Panjab University (PU) has been ranked first for innovation among government and aided (state-run and deemed) universities under technical category in India, in the third edition of the Atal Rankings of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA). Union minister of state for education, Subhas Sarkar announced the ARIIA-2021 results on Wednesday. The ranking has classified the participating institutions under two major categories - technical and non-technical. PU is followed by Delhi Technological University and Netaji Subhas University of Technology in the second and third places in the same category. Last year, the university had secured the second position among government and aided universities of the country. In the first ARIIA rankings released in 2019, PU was ranked ninth among the government-funded institutions and third among all Indian varsities.ParametersTaking the Indian innovation and start-up ecosystem in higher education institutions into account, various parameters comprising input, process, output, and outcome parameters are included in the framework. The major parameters include activities to promote and support innovation and start-up in the campus, pre-incubation and incubation infrastructures and facilities available in campus and research outputs; publications and intellectual properties generated.“Punjab University has a well-established Institution’s Innovation Council at University Institute of Engineering and Technology and University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, cluster innovation centre, entrepreneurship development centre, design innovation centre, technology enabling centres, centre for skill development among other facilities,” a statement by the varsity read. PU’s director of Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), Ashish Jain, said, “It is not an overnight process but the result of cumulative efforts of the last three years when concentrated actions were taken for improving the innovation culture in the university. PU’s focus on incubation and promoting start-ups has increased in recent years.”PU vice-chancellor Professor Raj Kumar said, “Despite the record number of entries for Atal rankings this year, PU has topped the list among the state universities. This is the result of efforts put in by the faculty and staff of the university towards the campaign of innovation which we had started three years back.”Among the centrally funded technical institutions (CFTIs) and institutions of national importance, under the technical category, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, has been ranked the best institute for innovation for the third year in a row. Among the self-financed/private universities, under technical category, Chitkara University was ranked second and Chandigarh University (CU) was ranked seventh. ARIIA-2021 saw unprecedented participation as compared to the earlier two editions. Of the 3,551 institutions registered, 1,438 institutions, including all IITs, NITs and IISc, participated, which is more than double as compared to the last edition and four times as compared to the first edition.

People are just too content with their lives to drastically change,” the Vice reported one user writing.Some other users also blamed the Chinese government's one-child policy that saw the authorities heavily penalising families violating the rule.Meanwhile, gender ratio remains a massive problem in the country with data released by the Chinese government this year showing that the country has 35 million more single men than women. Furthermore, the number of singles in China is likely to cross 90 million in few years, according to the Vice report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-chinese-city-is-creating-database-of-its-singles-holding-dating-parties-101640860281827.html
30-12-2021||World||Ghislaine Maxwell faces legal bar in bid to topple sex abuse conviction: experts||British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is going to appeal her conviction for setting up teenage girls to have sexual encounters with financier Jeffrey Epstein, but experts said she will struggle to clear the high legal bar needed to overturn the verdict.U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan dealt several blows to the defense during the month-long trial that ended on Wednesday, including denying a request to have some witnesses testify anonymously and another to block lawyers for two of the accusers from taking the stand.Legal experts said Maxwell's lawyers are likely to cite such rulings in any appeal of her conviction on five of six counts, including sex trafficking, by a jury in federal court in Manhattan.But to succeed, her lawyers would have to show that Nathan violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion."We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated," Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim told reporters on Wednesday, without going into specific legal grounds.Even if an appellate court agreed that Nathan made a mistake, Maxwell's lawyers would need to show that it mattered to the outcome of the case. A "harmless error" is not enough to overturn a conviction, according to Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School."It's a very heavy burden," Gershman said, adding that federal appellate courts tend to defer to trial judges.An avenue of appeal for the defense might be to argue that the testimony of Kate, one of the accusers, was improperly admitted.While described in the indictment as a victim, Nathan instructed the jury that Kate was actually over the age of consent at the time of her alleged encounters with Epstein. However, Nathan said the jury could still consider her testimony if they found it useful."While the court limited that testimony, and gave the jury an appropriate limiting instruction, the defense may continue to argue that Kate's testimony should have been excluded," said Sarah Krissoff, a partner at the Day Pitney law firm and a former federal prosecutor.The defense also objected to Nathan's instruction to the jury that they could find Maxwell guilty if she deliberately ignored evidence of Epstein's wrongdoing, a legal concept known as "conscious avoidance."Maxwell's lawyers argued that prosecutors' theory of the case was that Maxwell was an active participant, not a mere bystander, and accused prosecutors of trying to "have it both ways."Nathan ultimately allowed the instruction after noting that the defense itself had sought to show during opening statements and cross-examination of witnesses that Maxwell was unaware of Epstein's behavior."Maxwell will have an uphill battle challenging the conscious avoidance charge, as the government presented a factual basis for such a charge," Krissoff said.Maxwell's lawyers may also raise on appeal Nathan's ruling preventing three defense witnesses from testifying anonymously.Three of Maxwell's four accusers testified under pseudonyms or used only their first names to protect their privacy as victims of sexual abuse.But Nathan said privacy concerns did not apply to the defense witnesses because none of them intended to testify about sensitive personal topics or sexual conduct.Gershman said that any appeal would be hampered by the fact that Maxwell's lawyers waited until near the end of the trial to ask for anonymity."If they felt this was a serious concern, they should have raised this before the trial," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-faces-legal-bar-in-bid-to-topple-sex-abuse-conviction-experts-101640866111623.html
30-12-2021||World||Saudi boosts pandemic measures at Mecca's Grand Mosque||Saudi Arabia on Thursday reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, after recording the highest number of infections in months.Workers have returned floor markings removed on October 17 to guide people to social distance in and around the Grand Mosque -- which is built around the Kaaba, the black cubic structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.Saudi authorities said they will reimpose "social distancing requirements between worshippers and pilgrims" at the Grand Mosque, without specifying whether a capacity has been set.Earlier, the kingdom had said social distancing and masks were again required in both indoor and outdoor venues.The kingdom of approximately 34 million people has so far recorded more than 554,000 coronavirus cases, including 8,874 deaths, the highest number of fatalities among the Gulf Arab countries.On Wednesday, Saudi recorded 744 cases, the highest number since mid-August.The Covid-19 pandemic hugely disrupted Muslim pilgrimages, which are usually key revenue earners for the kingdom, bringing in some $12 billion annually.The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- have been recording their highest numbers of new cases in months.Despite having the world's highest vaccination rate, the UAE has recorded the largest number of infections among Gulf countries at more than 757,000.On Wednesday, it recorded 2,234 infections, the highest number since June.The Emirates' Abu Dhabi crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, sought to reassure the people that "the UAE health sector is fully geared and prepared to address any challenges", according to the official WAM news agency.The UAE is gearing up to host New Year's Eve celebrations, including at Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, in the emirate of Dubai.Dubai, which is heavily dependent on tourism, was one of the world's first destinations to welcome back visitors July 2020.It is also counting on the six-month Expo 2020 trade fair to boost its economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-boosts-pandemic-measures-at-mecca-s-grand-mosque-101640865837813.html
30-12-2021||World||As lockdown drags on, Xi'an residents complain of food shortages||Residents in the locked-down Chinese city of Xi'an said they were struggling to find enough food, despite Beijing insisting Thursday that there were now adequate supplies.China has followed a strict "zero Covid" approach involving tight border restrictions and swift, targeted lockdowns since the virus first surfaced in a central city in late 2019.The country's commerce ministry told reporters on Thursday that Xi'an's 13 million residents -- who were placed under lockdown eight days ago -- had "sufficient" access to essential supplies.State TV showed footage of workers in hazmat suits sorting eggs, meat and vegetables into plastic bags, before delivering them to residents door-to-door.Local officials said at a later press conference that they had handed out hundreds of tonnes of free food and supplies in recent days.But they also asked residents to exercise "understanding and tolerance" as they smooth out oversupply "discrepancies"."At present, Xi'an is speeding up its preparations and coordination [for delivering supplies]," said local official Zhao Li."There will be some discrepancies in the timing of supplies during this process, which also varies in practical terms from place to place."Locked-down people inside Xi'an contacted by AFP, however, said they were struggling to secure enough food.Resident Ada Zhao said she knew of some individual housing compounds that had received deliveries, but said it was "still a very small number.""In our community, we've not received any notices on deliveries of life essentials and how to collect them."She said soaring demand for online grocery services was meant there wasn't enough stock or drivers, with people "struggling to get the food they need on time".Another woman who spoke to AFP said she hadn't had received any food, but had managed to receive a delivery from the local convenience store two days ago."I have rice at home... I have several eggs left -- one per meal, one meal per day," she said.While low compared to outbreaks around the world, daily infections remained high in Xi'an by China standards, with another 155 infections reported on Thursday.There have been more than a thousand cases in the city since December 9.Other tough curbs to control the city cluster have included ordering all cars off the road, telling students to remain in their dormitories, and multiple rounds of mass testing.One resident who didn't want to be named told AFP she only had enough food because she had persuaded the community manager at the gate to let her slip out to the supermarket for half an hour to get supplies.Supplies were low and the vegetables were not fresh, she said, adding that by Thursday police had been stationed outside the block.When the lockdown was announced last week, the rules allowed one resident out every two days to stock up on supplies. This was then reduced to every three days, before residents were no longer allowed out at all.Online some residents reported having received food parcels, but many more complained they were still struggling."I heard friends in other districts got their food delivered, but not here in Weiyang district," a resident surnamed Wang told AFP, saying she was working through all her supplies."I live on.... a bowl of porridge everyday -- just a little bit to keep alive."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-lockdown-drags-on-xi-an-residents-complain-of-food-shortages-101640863928703.html

The payments were duplicated in bank accounts due to a “technical issue”, a bank spokeswoman said.Around 75,000 individuals and companies received the money for a second time from around 2,000 accounts with Santander on December 25. These individuals and businesses had already received a one-off payment.The second payment was made directly from the bank’s own reserves.The accounts where the money has been sent are from various other banks like HSBC, NatWest etc which has made the recovery extremely difficult.These banks told the Daily Mail that they fear some of the recipients have already spent the money.Pay UK, which runs the main payment systems in the UK, is discussing the issue with Santander. The bank, meanwhile, is desperately trying to recover the amount and is communicating with other banks or directly with recipients of the cash.“We're sorry that due to a technical issue some payments from our corporate clients were incorrectly duplicated on the recipients' accounts,” the bank's spokeswoman said.“The duplicated payments were the result of a scheduling issue, which we quickly identified and rectified. The recipients and purpose of payment will have varied among clients but could have included wages or supplier payments,” she added.This is not the first time that Santander is in the middle of a controversy. In May this year, the bank was forced to issue an apology after a technical glitch prevented its customers from making payments for almost an entire day.In August, thousands of customers were unable to access their online accounts due to another issue.Santander has 14 million customers and 400 physical branches in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-sorry-santander-sends-130-million-to-customers-in-christmas-day-error-101640863211100.html
30-12-2021||World||Studies estimate 70-80% T Cells responses fight against Omicron||An unsung arm of the immune system appears to protect against severe disease with the omicron variant even when antibodies wane, helping to explain why a record wave of infections hasn’t engulfed hospitals so far.T cells, the body’s weapon against virus-infected cells, were primed enough by vaccination that they defended against omicron in separate studies from Erasmus University in the Netherlands and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. The findings could help explain why the wave of omicron cases hasn’t so far caused a surge in mortality from South Africa to the U.S. and the U.K. Unlike antibodies, T cells can target the whole of the virus’s spike protein, which remains largely similar even in the highly mutated omicron. The Dutch researchers looked at 60 vaccinated health-care workers and found that while their antibody responses to omicron were lower or nonexistent compared with the beta and delta variants, T cell responses were largely unaltered, “potentially balancing the lack of neutralizing antibodies in preventing or limiting severe Covid-19.”The study from the University of Cape Town’s Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine looked at patients who had recovered from Covid or been vaccinated with shots from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or Johnson & Johnson. They found that 70% to 80% of the T cell responses they assessed held up against omicron.Recent weeks have brought evidence that the new strain can erode vaccine protection, prompting governments to push for booster shots to raise the level of antibodies that can fight off the variant. But immune protection has several layers. While antibodies block infection, T cells kill infected cells, preventing the virus from spreading and causing worse disease, Wendy Burgens, one of the University of Cape Town study authors, wrote on her Twitter account Virus Monologues. “They can’t prevent you from getting infected, but they can minimize the damage that comes afterwards,” she said. T cells are white blood cells that can remember past diseases, kill virus-infected cells and rouse antibodies to marshal defenses. People infected with another coronavirus that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003, for example, were found to still have a T-cell response to the disease 17 years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/studies-show-t-cells-fight-omicron-101640860844805.html

This comes a day after the office of Stand News was raided and seven current and former staff members were arrested.The outlet had said after that raid that it would cease operations.According to local media reports, the two staff members charged with sedition are Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam, who were editors at Stand News. They were taken to West Kowloon court on Thursday.Police also said they would prosecute the company for sedition.Apart from Chung and Lam, four other former Stand News board members, including singer Denise Ho and former lawmaker Margaret Ng, were arrested on Wednesday. Ho was released from police custody on Thursday afternoon.The raids were carried out under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in Hong Kong last year. The ordinance dates from Hong Kong’s days as a British colony before 1997, when it was returned to China. Many pro-democracy groups have been dissolved, journalists arrested and some media outlets (Apple Daily) shut down since the imposition of the law.Those convicted after the latest raid on Wednesday could face up to two years in prison and a fine of up to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars ($640).Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at a news conference Thursday that the arrests were not targeted at the media.“Journalism is not sedition, but seditious acts and activities and inciting other people through other acts and activities could not be condoned under the guise of news reporting,” she said.“It should be very clear what is reporting of news, and what is seditious acts or activities to undermine national security.”The police have accused Stand News of publishing articles that incited hatred towards the Hong Kong government between July 2020 and November 2021, which included news reports and blog posts."They described Hong Kong protesters as 'being disappeared' and 'violated'... These are malicious allegations without any factual basis," Steve Li, senior superintendent of the national security police, told a press conference on Wednesday.Meanwhile, announcing its closure, Stand News thanked its readers, saying it was established as a non-profit in December 2014 to "take a stand in Hong Kong".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stand-news-raid-hong-kong-police-charge-2-from-news-outlet-with-sedition-101640861065049.html
30-12-2021||World||Brexit: Britain asks — was it worth it?||Food shortages, foreign workers leaving and gas stations running empty. Britain certainly had its fair share of setbacks since the Brexit transition period — meant to smooth the UK's departure from the EU — came to an end a year ago.A supply chain crisis, exacerbated by a shortage of truck drivers and other workers from EU countries, caused empty supermarket shelves, long lines for fuel for several weeks in September and even the slaughter and disposal of thousands of pigs.New rules governing EU-UK trade took effect in January 2021, requiring 4-page customs forms for all goods, and health certificates for meat and dairy produce. As a result, British exports to the EU fell nearly 15% in the first 10 months of the year, according to the EU's statistics agency Eurostat, while UK agri-food exports dropped by more than a quarter.Brexit or COVID to blame?All this happened as the country battled the then-new Delta variant of the coronavirus that sent the UK into its third national lockdown. While the government insisted it was impossible to disentangle Brexit from the COVID effect, many economists disagreed."What we can say is that the notable loss of UK trade with continental Europe … was not mirrored in UK trade with the rest of the world," Iain Begg, Professorial Research Fellow at the European Institute, London School of Economics (LSE), told DW.Brexit was supposed to bring an end to EU bureaucracy, but instead of allowing a bonfire of red tape, the additional paperwork hiked export costs that hit many UK and EU-based businesses hard.Small British firms, in particular, said their sales to the EU dropped off a cliff. Simon Spurrell, the co-founder of the Cheshire Cheese Company, told the Guardian newspaper recently that the post-Brexit trade deal was the "biggest disaster any government has ever negotiated." Some EU retailers have stopped taking orders from the UK."It's the small businesses that suffer from the excessive paperwork, not the giants like Nissan," said Begg, referring to the Japanese automaker that has renewed its commitment to UK production, despite Brexit uncertainty.Yes, more bureaucracy!Red tape is set to get much worse from January, as the UK introduces new paperwork for imports from the EU, which must be lodged with authorities before goods are loaded on trains or trucks to Britain. The plans have been delayed three times over the past year to avoid further pain for businesses.Adding insult to injury for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the resignation this month of his chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost. Some analysts speculated that the departure was hastened by pressure on Johnson to adopt a softer approach to negotiations with Brussels, as an all-out trade war loomed over several thorny issues.Much 'unfinished business'The post-Brexit trade deal left much "unfinished business," according to Begg, including over Northern Ireland, fisheries and financial services. The City of London financial hub is a major contributor to the British economy, and was "almost neglected" in the Brexit negotiations, he told DW.The City is trying to obtain what's known as equivalence with the EU — where both sides accept each other's regulations. But the Institute of Government think tank believes a permanent deal is currently unlikely.Jake Green, from London law firm Ashurst, told the Financial News weekly that Brexit was "going to get real" for banks and other financial firms in 2022, adding that the past 12 months have "been a bit of a hall pass for everyone."The row between Britain and France over fishing rights in UK-EU waters is set to persist, while the Northern Ireland protocol — a measure to avoid a hard border between the British territory of Northern Ireland and EU member, the Republic of Ireland — will only be settled when London concedes that the European Court of Justice should rule on trade disputes."The optimal outcome for Northern Ireland would be if the border became almost invisible," Begg told DW. "There is a move towards that, but it will never be 100% because logic says you must have a border somewhere."UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has taken charge of the UK's Brexit negotiations. Truss is charged with keeping Euroskeptics within the ruling UK Conservative Party onside about the direction of Brexit, while not antagonizing Brussels further.Describing how Johnson and Frost "managed to rub people up the wrong way," Begg said the British had "misunderstood Germany's position on Brexit," thinking that Berlin would intervene during the Brexit standoff with the EU to avoid compromising a key export market for German automakers."Angela Merkel never rode to their [the British government's] rescue and I very much doubt that new Chancellor Olaf Scholz will do anything different."'Global Britain' concept underwhelmsFew positives have emerged about Global Britain — the promise that Brexit would allow the UK to boost its trade with the rest of the world A free trade deal with the United States remains elusive, especially since Donald Trump's election defeat, and closer trade ties with China are off the table for now due to political tensions over Hong Kong.While Britain has concluded new deals with Japan, Australia and New Zealand, "It's more a question of: 'Who cares?'" said Begg, as the three countries represent a tiny share of UK exports. "Even if we double that share, they're still tiny."The post-Brexit trade deal hasn't, however, led to some of the worst doomsday predictions. Rather than half a million job losses, Britain still has a major shortage of workers — after the UK ended freedom of movement for EU nationals. Rather than a forecast 18% fall in real estate prices, British property values hit an all-time high this year, climbing more than 20% since the 2016 referendum.UK residents will have to wait another eight years to see if they are each £4,300 (€5,117, $5,780) poorer by 2030, as predicted, but Britain's Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) thinks gross domestic product (GDP) has taken a 1.4% hit since the 2016 referendum, and in the longer term, UK GDP will be 4% lower than if there had been no divorce.Many believe Brexit can be undoneDespite the gloomy headlines, political campaigning and a recent poll showing that 60% of Britons now think Brexit has gone "badly" or "worse than expected," the chances of Britain rejoining the EU remain as unlikely as ever, said Begg."The whole Brexit saga has been so painful in UK domestic politics that I cannot see any wish to rejoin anytime soon." From the EU side, "I can't see it happening in a generation, let alone in the near future."The LSE economist said Brexit has "caused enormous difficulty and wasted an incredible amount of time [for EU states] when there were other pressing problems."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-britain-asks-was-it-worth-it-101640860826765.html
30-12-2021||World||Iran state TV says Tehran launched rocket into space||Iran on Thursday announced it launched a satellite carrier rocket bearing three devices into space, though it's unclear whether any of the objects entered orbit around the Earth.The state TV report, as well as others by Iran's semiofficial news agencies, did not say when the launch was conducted nor what devices the carrier brought with it. However, the launch comes amid difficult negotiations in Vienna over Iran's tattered nuclear deal.Previous launches have drawn rebukes from the United States. The U.S. State Department, Space Force and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Ahmad Hosseini, a Defense Ministry spokesman, identified the rocket as a Simorgh, or “Phoenix,” rocket. He said the three devices were sent up 470 kilometers (290 miles).Hosseini was quoted as saying the “performance of the space center and the performance of the satellite carrier was done properly.” He described the launch as “initial," suggesting more are on the way.Iran's TV aired footage of the white rocket emblazoned with the words, “Simorgh satellite carrier” and the slogan “We can” shooting into the morning sky from Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport. A state TV reporter at a nearby desert site hailed the launch as “another achievement by Iranian scientists.”However, officials were silent on whether the launched objects had actually reached orbit. Iran's civilian space program has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years, including fatal fires and a launchpad rocket explosion that drew the attention of former President Donald Trump.Iranian state media recently offered a list of upcoming planned satellite launches for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard runs its own parallel program that successfully put a satellite into orbit last year.The blast-offs have raised concerns in Washington about whether the technology used to launch satellites could advance Iran's ballistic missile development. The United States says that such satellite launches defy a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Iran to steer clear of any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component.Announcing a launch as nuclear negotiators meet in Vienna aligns with Tehran's hard-line posture under President Ebrahim Raisi, a recently elected conservative cleric.New Iranian demands in the nuclear talks have exasperated Western nations and heightened regional tensions as Tehran presses ahead with atomic advancements. Diplomats have repeatedly raised the alarm that time is running out to restore the accord, which collapsed three years ago when America unilaterally withdrew under then-President Trump.Iran has now abandoned all limitations under the agreement, and has ramped up uranium enrichment from under 4% purity to 60% — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels. International inspectors face challenges in monitoring Tehran's advances.Satellite images seen by The Associated Press suggested a launch was imminent earlier this month. The images showed preparations at the spaceport in the desert plains of Iran’s rural Semnan province, some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Tehran.Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space.

That he chose to personally come to India, particularly at a time when the coronavirus pandemic was raging in Russia, speaks of his commitment to the bilateral relationship. He could, after all, have done a virtual summit with PM Modi, like he has done twice this year with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
30-12-2021||World||Africa targets for vaccine self-reliance after being left behind in pandemic||After the Ebola crisis ended in West Africa in 2016, Amadou Sall received a painting as a gift from his wife and children. On one side is a family shrouded in darkness, threatened by a looming virus. The other is filled with bright light, a symbol of the science that will save them.The work by a Senegalese artist hangs on the wall of Sall’s office at the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, the biomedical research center he leads in the nation’s capital.“It’s a reminder of why I do this job,” said Sall, a veteran infectious disease expert.The institute is a partner in a $200 million vaccine manufacturing project, part of a broader effort to strengthen Africa’s defenses against Covid-19, malaria and a range of deadly pathogens that could strike in the coming years. The continent imports about 99% of all the shots it needs. The goal is to slash that to 40% over the next two decades. “This isn’t a project only about making a vaccine,” said Sall, whose facility has made yellow fever inoculations for many years. “It’s a great opportunity to build a future.”After the coronavirus emerged, many developing nations turned to Covax, the global distribution program. But the initiative has struggled to access doses, hobbled by production delays and export bans. While Covax was counting on India’s manufacturing muscle, the government prioritized its own citizens when a lethal wave of infections hit earlier this year.A new plant, under construction on the edge of Dakar and expected to begin production in 2022, could help Africa avert a replay of the past year’s lopsided vaccine rollout. Manufacturing has been concentrated in just a handful of countries, and wealthy governments have secured most doses, leaving Africa and other regions far behind. Of the more than 8 billion doses given around the world, just 3% have gone to people in Africa, the World Health Organization estimates.The fast-spreading omicron variant underscores the need to distribute supplies and technologies more widely. As the virus continues to rampage, the risk additional variants of concern will emerge and evade protection from vaccines increases, posing a threat to both rich countries and poor.“We see very clearly today that whenever you have a variant, it becomes a problem for everybody,” Sall said.The project, backed by European countries, the U.S., the World Bank and others, aims to produce 300 million doses a year targeting Covid and other diseases, helping to ensure Africa is better equipped when the next contagion comes. Institut Pasteur has teamed with Germany’s BioNTech SE and is talking with other potential partners, Sall said.Yet even reaching those ambitious goals would leave Africa far short of the vaccine supplies needed to give two doses to each of its more than 700 million adults. And Africa’s wider plan will depend on raising additional funds, strengthening regulation and expanding distribution efforts and training, potentially taking years to deliver.“We cannot afford to fail,” said Cheikh Oumar Seydi, who leads the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s work on the continent.The plan in Dakar is to produce shots using different technologies, in case one is less successful, said Sall, who is working with other companies including Belgium’s Univercells. The project could also pay dividends in other ways, spurring more investment, building trust in health systems and leaving the next generations in a better spot, he said.Under pressure to help narrow the vaccine divide, a number of companies are stepping up two years into the pandemic. BioNTech, working with the governments of Senegal and Rwanda, sees a network that could eventually supply hundreds of millions of doses to the continent. The company will produce messenger RNA vaccines, harnessing the novel technology BioNTech and its U.S. partner Pfizer Inc. used successfully to make a Covid shot. BioNTech and Pfizer also plan to produce their Covid vaccine at the Biovac Institute in Cape Town. That’s expected to start in the third quarter of 2022, manufacturing at a rate of 100 million doses annually, according to Biovac Chief Executive Officer Morena Makhoana. The facility will focus on filling vials and packaging.In another development, Moderna Inc., whose Covid shot has yet to reach vast parts of the world, plans to spend as much as $500 million to build a factory in Africa that could make half a billion mRNA vaccine doses a year. (Health advocates have said that sharing knowledge and technologies such as mRNA is crucial to expand production, and have urged Moderna to support a WHO initiative already underway rather than pursue its own project.)“All of us realize that we need to do something about building capacity in Africa,” Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, the industry group, said on a recent panel.But as more vaccine makers jump in, there are worries about whether they will follow through on their promises, according to Petro Terblanche, managing director of Cape Town-based biotech company Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines.“That’s one of the biggest risks to the strategy,” said Terblanche, whose company is working with the WHO and others on an mRNA hub to produce new shots and train people from other countries to make them.Afrigen and its partners are pressing ahead with plans to reproduce the Moderna vaccine, even as the company seeks a license and answers to technical questions, she said.“We’re not sitting and waiting,” she said.Research highlighted by Human Rights Watch this month showed production of mRNA vaccines is possible outside the U.S. and Europe, with more than 100 companies globally – eight in Africa – potentially able to make them.“The biggest lesson for us is that we cannot rely on the rest of the world to provide us with health security when the rest of the world is in a pandemic,” Terblanche said. “There’s a rude awakening that this cannot be repeated, ever.”The wide gap in access between rich and poor has motivated scientists, health officials and companies to try build up the region’s autonomy.At least five African countries are involved in vaccine manufacturing, some just focused on filling vials and finishing the process. Building on the expertise of the main players, like the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, will be vital.“There is so much goodwill, so much commitment to ensure we turn this around that I think we are going to get it right,” Terblanche said. “Despite the disruption of Covid, Africa will in the long term come out of this in a better position.”During the height of the pandemic, Sall’s family gave him another painting of two wrestlers sparring, a message that he needs to be strategic in the fight against new adversaries.“We may have other Covids -- they may not be necessarily Covid, but they may be influenza or another new disease, and the world should be prepared for that,” Sall said. “Epidemics may be our way of life. We have to deal with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-targets-for-vaccine-self-reliance-after-being-left-behind-in-pandemic-101640855211208.html
30-12-2021||World||Harry Reid: US senate powerhouse who rescued the Indian nuclear deal||Many people played varying degrees of crucial roles in the signing and legislating of the landmark civil nuclear deal that changed the trajectory of the India-US relationship. US senator Harry Reid, the once powerful Democrat who passed away on Tuesday, played an incomparable part in it.“There would have been no civil nuclear deal without senator Reid’s early support and his shepherding of the deal through the Senate,” said Richard Verma, the former American ambassador to India who worked as a congressional foreign affairs aide to senator Reid at the time.Reid first played a critical role in December 2006 when he rescued from near death a legislation allowing then President George W Bush to negotiate a nuclear deal with India, which, in turn, would facilitate the resumption of nuclear trade with India after more than three decades.As the incoming majority leader of the chamber - Democrats had won control of the chamber in the November mid-term elections - Reid had prioritised the passage of the legislation. If not passed before the new Congress took over in January, the bill would have had to restart the long and tortuous passage rites.“That would have killed the bill,” said Ramesh Kapur, a leading Democratic strategist recalling Reid’s role in the passage of the bill. He had a ring-side view of the passage of the bill, which was aided and facilitated by the combined clout of Indian-Americans like him.Harry Reid had promised to put the bill on “automatic pilot” so that it may be taken up as “the first order of business” after the break, when it met during the lame-duck session, which is typically a session that take place between an election and formal start of the next congress.Verma said, recalling those heady days, “He even convened a rare classified session of the Senate so senators could debate the arrangements under consideration. He told me several times how important the deal was and how it would transform US-India ties. He was absolutely right.” The deal did, in fact, change India-US ties. First announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Bush in July 2005, the deal went into effect in 2008 and those it has not led to any real trade in nuclear supplies between the two countries yet, it put ties on an upward trajectory, and rising.Two years later, in December 2008, the deal got the final approval from US Congress with Reid at the head of the Senate.Harry Reid died on Tuesday at age 82. He had struggled for years with pancreatic cancer. Once a boxer, he was known for his pugnacious politics during his five terms in the Senate ending in 2016, when he retired. He was a quintessential Washington DC powerhouse and power-player who may even have set Barack Obama for the presidency asking a “stunned” first-time senator from Illinois in 2006 to seriously consider a run.After the senate vote on November 17, 2006, Reid spoke of his fondness for India and Indian-Americans to a group of Indian-Americans who had been lobbying him, his office and other senators, especially those who had seemed wobbly about their vote.Kapur was among them and remembers - “being a Punjabi” - giving Reid a celebratory hug.Reid spoke to the group about a group of Indian students he had befriended years ago as he gave them a ride on their way to their college. Some of them, Kapur remembers Reid noting, wore “slippers”.As a parting gift - along with “five” Indian meals - the Indian students gave Reid a snow globe with an image of Mahatma Gandhi inside it. The senator kept it on his desk for years after and Kapur remembers noticing it.“100% true,” said Verma. It was “there on his bookcase in the leader’s office till his very last day in the Senate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-reid-us-senate-powerhouse-who-rescued-the-indian-nuclear-deal-101640848591447.html

The World Health Organization (WHO) has already warned that Omicron along with the Delta variant will push health systems on the brink of collapse.According to news agency Reuters, from December 22 and December 28, almost 900,000 cases of Covid-19 were being recorded on an average daily.Even though initial studies have suggested that the Omicron variant of Covid-19, first detected in South Africa in November, is milder and less deadly than the previous ones, its high spreading rate could overwhelm hospitals in many countries in near future.Here are the latest updates on Covid-19 across the world:1. France on Wednesday saw a record spike in its daily cases after 208,099 people were found to be infected with Covid-19. In Paris, people will be required to wear masks when outdoors from Friday to slow the spread of the virus fuelled by the Omicron variant. The order applies to everyone above the age of 11.2. Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, recorded 12,226 new cases in the last 24 hours. Among these, Sydney reported 746 hospitalised patients. On Thursday, the country’s state and territory leaders will meet Prime Minister Scott Morrison to discuss issues such as long queues for Covid testing, the definition of a close contact and isolation requirements.3. The United Kingdom also set a new record in its daily Covid-19 tally with 183,037 infections on Wednesday. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have been placed under tougher restrictions since December 26. However, no restrictions are currently in place for England and the region is under Plan B measures.4. The Italian government will soon ease quarantine rules in a bid to keep essential services running. The government is also planning to cut the isolation period for vaccinated Covid-19 patients from seven to five days.5. In the United States, even though there is a drop in fatalities due to Covid-19, infections are still rising because of Omicron’s spread. Presidential medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday that Omicron cases will likely peak in the US by the end of January.(With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-global-covid-cases-above-1mn-for-3rd-day-who-warns-on-omicron-delta-101640840224808.html

Now, a researcher in the United Kingdom, one of the worst affected countries, has identified two new symptoms which are usually not associated with coronavirus.Also Read | UK, US see record surge in daily Covid cases as Omicron spreads at alarming rateThese are nausea and loss of appetite, according to Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London.He said that some symptoms are present in those who have received Covid-19 vaccines, or even the booster shot.“Quite a few of them had nausea, slight temperature, sore throats and headaches" he told express.co.uk.According to Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States, some of the common symptoms associated with Omicron are cough, fatigue, congestion and runny nose.Also Read | New research claims Omicron has cold-like symptomsLast week, Dr Bruce Patterson, who works for single cell diagnostic company IncellDx, claimed that he has not seen as much of a loss of taste and smell compared to the previous variants. Dr Patterson said that Omicron looked similar to a virus called parainfluenza.Another doctor later revealed a “telltale sign” caused by the Omicron variants – really bad night sweats. “The sweats which are kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes,” The Sun reported Dr Amir Khan, a physician with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) as saying.The Omicron variant emerged in South Africa on November 24, and has since then spread to more than 100 countries. It has led to surge in Covid-19 infection in many regions and countries of the world, especially the United States and the UK.In both the countries, Omicron is now the dominant variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, replacing Delta. In the UK, daily Covid-19 cases climbed to 183,037 on Wednesday, setting a new record in the daily tally.In most of the Europe, the situation is deteriorating due to the spread of Omicron, with healthcare systems “on the verge of collapse”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctor-identifies-2-new-omicron-symptoms-says-even-vaccinated-have-some-101640839936592.html

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is still too early to be reassured by initial data suggesting that Omicron leads to milder disease.Detected in South Africa last month, the fast-spreading variant caused thousands of infections in more than 100 countries.UKIn the United Kingdom, daily Covid-19 cases climbed to 183,037 on Wednesday, setting a new record in the daily tally. On the other hand, 57 more patients succumbed to the viral disease on Wednesday. The total number of cases and deaths in the UK stands at 12,559,926 and 148,089 respectively, according to government data.From Sunday, tougher restrictions for gathering at indoor and outdoor events have been in force in parts of the UK including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, England remains without any such restrictions.England is currently under Plan B measures, which call for working from home, compulsory face masks and Covid-19 vaccination certificates for entry to large venues.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has advised that people should celebrate New Year’s Eve cautiously and urged them to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “I’m sorry to say this, but the overwhelming majority of people who are currently ending up in intensive care in our hospitals are people who are not boosted,” Johnson said on Wednesday.USThe United States, which is the worst-hit country from the Covid-19 crisis, has recorded more than 54 million cases till now. On Tuesday, the country recorded over 512,000 cases in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.According to data shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Omicron is estimated to be 58.6% of Covid-19 variants circulating in the United States. The new variant has already overwhelmed the country’s healthcare system. Nearly 9,000 patients are being hospitalised daily.Presidential medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday that Omicron cases will likely peak in the US by the end of January.“I would imagine, given the size of our country and the diversity of vaccination versus no vaccination, that it likely will be more than a couple of weeks, probably by the end of January, I would think,” he told CNBC when asked about when cases will peak in the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-us-see-record-surge-in-daily-covid-cases-as-omicron-spreads-at-alarming-rate-101640831060322.html

They also underscored the need for "safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need, and for the full protection, safety and security of humanitarian and medical personnel", according to UN News.The Ambassadors reaffirmed their support for the people of Myanmar and the country's democratic transition along with their strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Myanmar.Credible reports suggested that four children were killed, including two 17-year-old boys, a teenage girl and a child approximately age five, whose gender was not mentioned, the UNSC said in a statement.The two humanitarians worked for the non-Governmental organization (NGO) Save the Children, which confirmed their deaths. They were killed while returning to NGO's Loikaw office after responding to humanitarian needs in a nearby community, it added.Earlier in the week, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) condemned the killings, saying it was "shocked and saddened" by the reported killing and burning of victims during a time when many prepared to celebrate Christmas.In a statement, the UNICEF Regional Director for East Asia and the Pacific, Debora Comini, condemned the attack.She reminded that the protection of civilians - particularly children and humanitarian workers - must be treated as a priority during times of conflict, in accordance with international humanitarian law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Myanmar is a signatory."UNICEF calls for urgent action to investigate this deplorable incident and to hold those responsible to account," she said."We offer our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and to our colleagues at Save the Children".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-condemns-dec-25-killings-in-myanmar-101640826338529.html

It has said it will not give in to threats.While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of "strategic ambiguity" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who established the People's Republic of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-drastic-measures-if-taiwan-provokes-on-independence-101640828093874.html

30-12-2021||World||Covid-19: Some nations rethink isolation, testing rules as Omicron sweeps globe||Global Covid-19 infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, Reuters data showed on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant raced out of control and governments wrestled with how to contain its spread without paralysing fragile economies.Almost 900,000 cases were detected on average each day around the world between Dec. 22 and 28, with myriad countries posting new all-time highs in the previous 24 hours, including the United States, Australia, many in Europe and Argentina and Bolivia.Although studies have suggested Omicron is less deadly than some previous variants, the huge numbers of people testing positive mean that hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed, while businesses might struggle to carry on because of workers having to quarantine.Fearful of the economic impact of keeping so many people at home, some governments are looking at shortening the period that people have to isolate if they are Covid positive or have been exposed to someone who is positive.Spain said on Wednesday it was reducing the quarantine period for people who have tested positive for Covid-19 to seven days from 10, while Italy said it was planning to relax isolation rules for those who came into close contact with sufferers of the virus.Earlier this week US health authorities released new guidance shortening the isolation period for people with a confirmed infection to five days from 10, so long as they are asymptomatic."I am highly concerned that Omicron, being highly transmissible and spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing.French Health Minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers France was seeing a "dizzying" rise in cases, with 208,000 reported in the space of 24 hours - a national and European record.Economic impact on US unclearBritain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Malta all registered record numbers of new cases on Tuesday, while the seven-day average number of new daily cases in the United States hit a record 258,312, according to a Reuters tally on Wednesday. The previous peak was 250,141, registered last January.Despite the surge in coronavirus infections, deaths and hospitalizations are comparatively low, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Wednesday.While the current seven-day daily average of cases is about 240,400 per day, up 60% over the previous week, the hospitalization rate for the same period is up just 14% to about 9,000 per day over the same period. Deaths were down about 7% to 1,100 per day, Walensky added.Disease experts, however, are questioning the new CDC rules that halve the isolation period for asymptomatic coronavirus infections, saying they could result in even more infections. They are concerned the new directive does not require testing to confirm that a person is no longer infectious before they go back to work or socialize.Britain reported 183,037 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, a new record and over 50,000 more than the previous highest figure registered just a day earlier, government statistics showed. Ireland, too, reported record cases on Wednesday, with more than 16,000 new infections.Despite the growing number of cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not bring in new restrictions this year in England to limit the spread of Omicron, which now accounts for 90% of all community infections, according to health officials.Australia registered almost 18,300 new cases, eclipsing Tuesday's previous pandemic high of around 11,300.In Spain, demand for free testing kits from the Madrid regional government far outstripped supply, with long queues forming outside pharmacies.Early data from Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggests the risk of hospitalisation from Omicron is lower than from Delta, the WHO said in its latest epidemiological report.However, the WHO's top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, said it was too soon to draw definitive conclusions because Omicron was so far circulating largely among younger, less vulnerable age groups.A number of governments are increasingly worried by the economic impact of huge numbers being forced into self-isolation because they had been in contact with a coronavirus sufferer."We just can't have everybody just being taken out of circulation because they just happen to be at a particular place at a particular time," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters.Morrison wants to make urgent changes to Covid-19 testing rules to ease pressure on testing sites. He said Australia needed "a gear change" to manage overburdened laboratories and get people out of isolation.While Spain and Italy moved to relax some isolation rules, China stuck to its policy of zero tolerance, keeping 13 million people in Xian, capital of central Shaanxi province, under rigid lockdown for a seventh day as 151 new cases were reported on Tuesday, albeit none with Omicron so far."I just want to go home," said a 32-year-old mechanic who was in the city on business last week when it was effectively shut off from the outside world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-some-nations-rethink-isolation-testing-rules-as-omicron-sweeps-globe-101640821955227.html
30-12-2021||World||Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case: Ghislaine Maxwell convicted of recruiting teenage girls||Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty by a US jury on Wednesday of helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls, sealing a remarkable fall from grace for the British socialite.Maxwell, 60, was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers between 1994 and 2004 for Epstein, her former boyfriend who killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges of his own.She was convicted on five of six counts. After the verdict was read, Maxwell pulled down her face mask and poured herself a glass of water.As members of the jury affirmed one-by-one that their verdict was unanimous, defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca patted Maxwell on her upper back. An expressionless Maxwell looked briefly at two siblings seated in the front row of the audience as she left the courtroom.Along with the trials of movie producer Harvey Weinstein and singer R. Kelly, Maxwell's case is among the highest-profile trials to take place in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse by famous and powerful people.During the trial's closing arguments in federal court in Manhattan a prosecutor said Maxwell was Epstein's "partner in crime.""Ghislaine Maxwell made her own choices. She committed crimes hand in hand with Jeffrey Epstein. She was a grown woman who knew exactly what she was doing," Assistant US Attorney Alison Moe said.Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, applauded the verdict in a statement that said Maxwell was convicted of "one of the worst crimes imaginable.""The road to justice has been far too long," his statement said. "But, today, justice has been done. I want to commend the bravery of the girls – now grown women – who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom."Maxwell's attorneys had argued she was being used as a scapegoat for Epstein and sought to portray the accounts of her four accusers as not credible, saying their memories had been corrupted over the decades and that they were motivated by money."Epstein's death left a gaping hole in the pursuit of justice for many of these women," Maxwell's defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim said. "She's filling that hole, and filling that empty chair."Maxwell dated Epstein for several years in the 1990s, when the pair attended high society parties and traveled on luxurious private jets.A few months after Epstein's death, Maxwell purchased a home for $1 million in cash in Bradford, New Hampshire where she remained out of the limelight until her July 2020 arrest. An FBI official said Maxwell had "slithered away."Maxwell, a daughter of British press baron Robert Maxwell, had been accustomed to opulence all her life.Her father founded a publishing house and owned tabloids including the Daily Mirror. He was found dead off his yacht near the Canary Islands in 1991.Graphic testimonyUS District Judge Alison Nathan did not say when Maxwell would be sentenced. The jury deliberated for five full days before reaching the verdict.During the trial, jurors heard emotional and graphic testimony from four women, two of whom said they were 14 when Epstein began abusing them. Three of the women said Maxwell herself had inappropriately touched them.Prosecutors displayed for the jury a green massage table that was seized from Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, estate in 2005. Three of the four accusers said they gave Epstein massages that escalated into sexual activity.Epstein's arrest and suicide drew attention to Maxwell's role in his abuses, and to the financier's relationships with prominent figures like former US Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, Britain's Prince Andrew and billionaire investor Leon Black. None has been charged with crimes related to Epstein.The prince, a former friend of Epstein, is defending against a civil lawsuit in Manhattan claiming he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein's accusers. Andrew has denied her claims.The one charge Maxwell was acquitted on - enticing an underage girl to travel for the purpose of illegal sexual activity - carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison.That charge pertained only to a woman known by the pseudonym Jane, who testified that she was 14 when Epstein first abused her in 1994.Jane said she often traveled to Epstein's homes in New Mexico and New York, where some of the abuse took place, and that Maxwell sometimes helped coordinate her travel.Maxwell sometimes took part in her sexual encounters with Epstein and acted as if it was normal, Jane testified."It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me," Jane said. "I'd never seen anything like this or felt anything like this."Despite the not guilty verdict on that count, the jury appeared to find other aspects of Jane's story credible. They convicted Maxwell of transporting a minor to travel for illegal sex acts, another count that pertained solely to Jane.Moe said during her closing argument that Maxwell's presence made young girls feel comfortable with Epstein. Otherwise, receiving an invitation to spend time with a middle-aged man would have seemed "creepy" and "set off alarm bells," Moe said."Epstein could not have done this alone," she said.Moe reminded jurors of bank records they saw at trial showing that Epstein paid Maxwell millions of dollars over the years. She said Maxwell was motivated to do whatever it took to keep Epstein happy in order to maintain her luxurious lifestyle.Defense attorney Laura Menninger countered during closing arguments that Maxwell was an innocent woman and that prosecutors had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Maxwell was aware of or involved in any crimes Epstein committed.Maxwell's lawyers aggressively pushed back on the accusers' accounts during the trial, arguing that their stories had shifted over the years.Maxwell's defense said the women were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell since all four had received million-dollar awards from a compensation fund for Epstein's victims.But the women disputed those characterizations, saying they decided to testify out of a desire for justice, not money."Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me," testified one woman, known by her first name Carolyn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeffrey-epstein-sex-abuse-case-ghislaine-maxwell-convicted-of-recruiting-teenage-girls-101640821190939.html
30-12-2021||World||Covid: Daily cases in US, France hit record||The US has reached its highest-ever average of new Covid cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as the Omicron variant spread at a blistering pace.The moving seven-day average of new cases was 265,427 as of Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak of 251,989 set in mid-January 2021, a tracker maintained by the university showed.France is seeing a “tsunami” of Covid-19 infections, with 208,000 cases reported over the past 24 hours, a new national and European record, health minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers on Wednesday.France has been breaking infection records repeatedly over the past few days, with Tuesday’s 180,000 cases already the highest for a country in Europe, according to data on Covidtracker.fr.“This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive,” Veran said. “We have never experienced such a situation.”The situation in French hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant, Veran said, with Omicron yet to have an impact, something he said would eventually happen.“We have two enemies,” he said, referring to the two main variants. “As for Omicron, I would no longer talk about a wave. This is a groundswell, where several waves combine to form one massive wave,” he said.Meanwhile, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Malta all registered record number of new cases on Tuesday.The United Kingdom reported 183,037 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, a new record and over 50,000 more than the previous highest figure, government statistics showed.WHO worried for health systems over rise in casesA “tsunami” of Omicron and Delta Covid-19 cases will pile pressure on health systems already being stretched to their limits, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Wednesday.Also Read | 'Tsunami' of Covid cases may lead to collapse of health systems, says WHO chief“I am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference. “This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers, and health systems on the brink of collapse.”China’s Xian in Covid lockdown for 7th dayA lockdown of 13mn people in the city of Xian entered its seventh day on Wednesday, with many unable to leave their residences and relying on deliveries of necessities as new Covid-19 infections persisted.‘Infected health workers can continue working’Canada’s worst-hit province of Quebec, with 12,833 new cases, is trying to deal with the problem by taking the radical step of allowing some infected healthcare workers to remain at their stations. “If we had the staff we needed, we wouldn’t have to implement this measure,” Quebec’s health minister Christian Dubé said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-daily-cases-in-us-france-hit-record-101640818436399.html
30-12-2021||India||Rajya Sabha adviser to devise road map for reform of House processes||A month after he was unceremoniously shifted from the Rajya Sabha secretary general’s chair, PPK Ramacharyulu, now adviser in the Upper House secretariat, will prepare a road map for reforms in the functioning of its officials. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu has commissioned this study for “improvement of functional systems in the Secretariat based on imaginative approach that enables evidence-based interpretation of the functioning of the House in the evolving situations”, an official order stated. Ramacharyulu’s study would take into account “integration of various initiatives taken during the last four years for better monitoring of output and service delivery further to detailed examination of process inadequacies in the functioning of the Secretariat”. Among other things, Ramacharyulu will also look into “promotion by equipping Secretariat officials for higher positions through a holistic understanding of various aspects and nuances of the functioning of the House.” This, however, has not amused at least two Opposition lawmakers, who quickly pointed out that Ramacharyalu was the first insider of the RS secretariat to rise through the ranks to become the secretary general — the top bureaucrat — in past 70 years. Naidu, who is set to complete his current term next August, has sought to examine and redesign processes and revamp the leadership promotion system. In an order issued this week, Naidu noted that “in the light of the experience and initiatives taken during the last four years, there is an imperative need for systems improvement in the Secretariat”. The study, involving ten aspects of the functioning of the Secretariat, would touch upon process re-engineering and quantification of deliverable output by each of the 12 divisions of the Rajya Sabha. It would also include measures to improve functioning of House panels, leadership promotion, promotion of team spirit and a sense of involvement and “coordinated effort for better communication outreach through media on various aspects of the functioning of the House”.What triggered the preparation of such a road map was Naidu’s assessment that various divisions of the secretariat need to function in an integrated manner and plug inadequacies. Ramacharyalu was elevated from the secretary general’s position just 10 weeks after his appointment. He was preplaced by former CBDT chief PC Mody in an unusual move. Naidu made Ramacharyalu adviser in the secretariat. 
30-12-2021||India||How Covid cases are spreading in India’s cities again||Nearly eight months have passed since India’s brutal second wave of infections peaked in the country. But the emergence of Omicron, a new and highly transmissible variant of Sars-CoV-2, has led to a massive rise in infections the world over, overpowering all other variants at a blistering pace. Though the variant appears far less virulent than Delta, its ability to evade vaccines and its higher transmissibility have sparked concerns that it could drag the fight against the pandemic back several months.In the past few days, a minor change in trajectory of new infections has been visible across several major cities in India. This, coupled with the fast-rising Omicron infections, has led some experts to speculate that this may become a steady stream of cases. But are cases rising everywhere, or is this spike limited to only a handful of regions? A look at four charts that try to answer this question.After months of decline, cases are rising again On December 20, India saw 5,161 new cases of Covid-19 reported across the country, making it the lowest daily case count seen in the country since May 18, 2020, or more than 580 days ago, according to HT’s Covid dashboard. But since then, a slow (but steady) bottoming out has started appearing. A week later, there were 6,139 cases across the country, and while this Tuesday, there were 9,155 new infections. The national daily case count touched 12,987 on Wednesday – the highest in a single day in nearly 50 days, data shows.Pushed by these numbers, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases across India (a number which denotes a region’s case curve) has risen by more than 20% in just three days (from 6,641 on Sunday to 7,972 on Wednesday). This is something that has happened only once since the peak of India’s second wave – in early August, pushed by a mammoth rise in cases in Kerala, the national trajectory started rising for eight days.[Chart 1: New Covid-19 cases across India]Biggest spike, by far, visible in major citiesWhile the rise in infections at the national level (and even on state-levels) may appear minor, the bump in trajectories becomes far more apparent when India’s major metropolitan areas are narrowed down upon.Delhi has seen its seven-day average of daily cases go up the most among the major cities – more than 1,000% from the start of December. At the start of the month, the Capital was reporting 31 cases a day on average. Since then, however, cases started rising slowly particularly through the second and third weeks of December. On Wednesday, for instance, the city saw 923 new cases, the most in a single day in nearly seven months, and the seven day average hit 370.Mumbai has seen the second highest resurgence of cases. The city’s seven-day average has witnessed a rise of 552% from the start of this month – from 163 average daily infections to 1,063. In absolute numbers, the numbers from India’s financial capital are dwarfing every other city in the country. In the past week, 13% of all infections in India can be traced to just Mumbai alone.These two cities are followed (at a fair distance) by Bengaluru, which has seen a 47% increase in average daily infections since the start of the month – from 166 daily cases on average for the week ended December 1, to 244 for the week ended Wednesday. In Chennai, average infections have gone from 135 a day to 184 a day so far in December (a rise of 36%). The case rate in Pune and Kolkata has grown by 15% and 8% respectively just this month. To be sure, despite the rise, hospitalisation rates and reports of severe infections remain low across the cities mentioned above.[Chart 2a to 2f: New Covid-19 cases in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata]Urban centres are the main fuel in national tallyAt the start of December, the six cities together were contributing to around one in every 10 cases reported across the country – of the 9,004 (on average) daily cases reported across India in the week ended December 1, only 975 could be traced to these six cities. However, as the month has progressed, their share has nearly tripled to the national tally. In the past week, these six cities together have been responsible for three out of every 10 new Covid infections across India – of the 7,972 new infections of Covid-19 reported across India for the week ended Wednesday, these cities have reported 2,394.[Chart 3: Share of six cities in the national Covid-19 tally]Outbreak numbers also rising outside these cities, albeit slowly While the six cities mentioned above remain the main cause of the rise in national numbers, it would not be fair assume that cases are rising only there. Even if their numbers are excluded from the national tally, the overall wave of India still shows a reversal in the past few days. While national numbers excluding these cities have dropped from the start of December (from a daily average of 8,029 cases to 5,578), the reversal in trajectory is there to see. For the week ended December 27, the seven-day average of daily infections in rest of India had dropped to 5,151, data shows.[Chart 4: Seven-day average of new cases in six cities, and rest of India]The rise in case rate in urban centres, however, is particularly worrying because if previous waves have been any indication, then a rapid rise in infections (as being witnessed in cities right now) cannot remain isolated for long. In both the first and second waves, cases were initially confined to metros, with cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai becoming the early areas of concentration of infections. The trend of a handful of high-population density hot spot regions emerging as first centres of infection, then a heavy and steady stream of cases from medium-population regions, has been identical in nearly every major country that has seen outbreaks.
30-12-2021||India||Bengaluru continues to report rise in Covid cases||Witnessing a spike for the second consecutive day, Karnataka on Thursday reported 707 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths, taking the total number of infections to 3,006,505 and the toll to 38,327, said the state health department.Bengaluru Urban district reported the highest number of cases as the city witnessed another sharp spike with 562 new infections. On Wednesday, the city had reported 400 new cases, which is a jump from 269 cases on Tuesday and 172 cases on Monday, according to government data. Compared to the first week of November, Bengaluru has reported an 85% increase in the new Covid-19 cases in the last week of December (between December 23 to 29). While the city reported 1,108 new cases between November 4 to November 10, this week, the city recorded 2,060 cases in the time frame, said a document released by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). In the eight weeks from November 4 to December 29, Bengaluru reported a consistent increase in the number of cases. Similarly, the city’s positivity rate has increased from 0.39% to 0.74% between November 4 to December 30. The positivity rate between December 2 to December 8 was 0.49%, followed by 0.42% during December 9-15. It increased to 0.45% between December 16-22, eventually shooting up to 0.74% in the last week of the month. The increase in the Covid positive cases has been reported despite a drop in testing from 289,685 between December 16-22 to 277,209 between December 23-29. Talking to the media, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the increase in positivity rate is a sign of concern. “We have effective containment management so that clusters are managed and contained. We have even been checking on the hospitalisations, and the Covid numbers have been low. Currently, the Covid status in the city is well in control. We are maintaining a high number of testing,” he said. Hospitals in the city have not reported a spike in the number of cases, which is a positive sign, he added. On Thursday, there were 252 discharges reported in Karnataka, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 2,959,926, a health department bulletin said. All the three deaths reported on Thursday were from Bengaluru Urban. The total number of active cases in the state is now 8,223.Among the districts where the new cases were reported, Bengaluru Urban accounted for 565, Udupi 19, Mysuru 53, Hassan 17, Mysuru 16, Kodagu 12, Dakshina Kannada 11, followed by others, the bulletin said.Bengaluru Urban district topped the list of positive cases, with a total of 1,262,962, followed by Mysuru 180,266 and Tumakuru 121,338. Among discharges too, Bengaluru Urban was on top with 1,239,720, followed by Mysuru 177,741 and Tumakuru 120,127.Cumulatively, a total of 56,350,280 samples have been tested in the state so far, out of which 114,686 were done on Thursday alone.The state reported five new cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus on Wednesday, taking the total to 43. In a tweet, health and medical education minister K. Sudhakar said four have a history of international travel from the US, Dubai and Ghana. The fifth person travelled from Mumbai to Bengaluru by flight. “All positive persons have been isolated and primary and secondary contacts have been identified and tested,” the minister’s tweet said. Among the five are a 22-year-old female, resident of Davanagere (travelled from the U.S.), a 24-year-old male from Bengaluru (returned from the U.S. via Qatar), a 53-year-old male from Tamil Nadu (who arrived at KIA from Dubai) and a 61-year-old male from Bengaluru (travelled from Ghana via Doha), according to the tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-continues-to-report-rise-in-covid-cases-101640888621043.html
30-12-2021||India||A year that was: An orange seller who went on to build a school for underprivileged kids||This year’s Padma Shri Awards have introduced people to a 64-year-old orange seller from Karnataka. Harekala Hajabba, who never received any formal education, won the award for building a primary school for underprivileged children in his village. Although circumstances led him to remain illiterate, a total of 175 underprivileged students from his village are now getting education till Class 10 in the school that materialised due to his efforts. A meeting that triggered a thought Sometime in the late 1970s, a tourist walked up to Harekala Hajabba and asked him the price of his oranges. He sat and gaped, not understanding a word. The foreigner tried again, but that didn’t help. A passerby explained what was being asked. Hajabba never forgot the feeling. On his way home, he told himself this shouldn’t happen to his children or any children. More than four decades after he decided to act on this thought, on November 8, 2021, orange seller Hajabba received the Padma Shri Award from President Ram Nath Kovind for building a government school in his village. Making a school with ₹80 per day earning It was a dream many would have considered too ambitious since in the late 1970s Hajabba made a little over ₹80 every day selling oranges. Years later, even his wife would tell him the same. “She used to ask me how many years it will take to build a school with the little money I used to save. But, however long it took, I wanted to build that school,” he told HT in an interview. But he began to save up. The dream comes true It took Hejabba more than two decades to fulfil this dream. The school began in Harekala-Newpadpu village on June 17, 2000. Later, it became a government school and the high school section was opened in 2007. The school started with 28 students and now accommodates 175 students till Class 10. Perseverance not saving that helped build the school Hajabba feels that more than his savings it was his perseverance that helped him realise his dream. “I knew that it would be difficult to build the school with just my savings. So, I went to a lot of people asking for help. In most of the cases, they came forward to help when I told them I was keeping all my savings for this school,” Hajabba remembered. Not just my award, says the orange seller Even though praises have been pouring in from across the country after the Padma award, Hajabba says that he merely received the award on behalf of his village and all those who helped build the school. “I’m just an orange seller. I can’t say that I built that school because it is not possible to build a school with the savings I had. The school was built because so many people donated money,” he said. When pointed out he was underplaying his role as a changemaker, Hajabba changed the topic quickly. “Now my dream is to build a pre-university college in our village,” he said with a smile. 
30-12-2021||India||Karnataka government drafts bill to ensure facilities for pedestrians, cyclists||The Karnataka government has prepared a draft to propose a bill that ensures facilities for pedestrians and cyclists across cities, but past projects raise concerns about the implementation of the project, Bengaluru residents said on Thursday.The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) on Wednesday prepared a draft Active Mobility Bill, Karnataka 2021, mandating Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to ensure the implementation of facilities for road users and proposes a fine if the bodies fail to do so. “It is aimed at protecting the rights of pedestrians and cyclists to safe, accessible and connected pedestrian and cycling networks in urban areas in the State, with a view to promote sustainable urban mobility and build healthy communities,” the draft stated. The draft has been proposed as the current legal framework does not have specific provisions to determine and protect the rights of pedestrians and cyclists, and give them equitable space on roads, read the draft. “An exponential increase in the number of vehicles on urban streets has caused congestion and deteriorated air quality. It has also led to a rise in road fatalities with pedestrians and cyclists more at risk,” the draft bill stated. “The legislation is aimed at giving the right of way to pedestrians and cyclists,” it added. Satya Shankran, Bengaluru’s first ‘Bicycle Mayor’, and founding member of Praja-Raag, a city-based citizens’ group, said it is on the lines of the Singapore model. If the government accepts and makes the bill official, it will help solve traffic issues to a large extent in the state, he added. However, the current state of cycle lanes in Bengaluru raises concerns about the ambitious project. Even as the newly developed cycle lanes in the Central Business District (CBD) appear to be a hit, riders feel the overall number of tracks available remain insufficient to enable them to pedal without running into traffic or pedestrians. Shankran said that as per the comprehensive mobility plan of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Pallike (BBMP), the idea was to develop 174km of cycle tracks in the city. “We took up the matter with the authorities and got it changed to developing 600 km in the next 10 years. But this is still not enough,” he said. He said the city has 14,000 km of roads, of which only around 2,000 km are 15 m wide or more and ideal for cycling. “Going by this, the current plan provides only 30% of the roads for cycle tracks. Even if we agree on these plans, the pace of development is slow,” he said. Rajesh Jain, a software developer from Marathahalli, said one of the biggest problems with cycling tracks in the city is the lack of continuity. “I understand that cycle lanes are present in the city but there needs to be a plan for a seamless track in the city. As of now, they are constructing tracks wherever smart city projects are coming up. But I’ve noticed that they are in patches. There should be a vision to connect the city using cycle lanes.”

Of the 1,184 wards that were up for election, the opposition party raked in 498 seats, while the ruling party won 437 seats. The JD(S), however, had to settle for just 45 seats, with “others” clinching the rest of the 204 seats. In terms of vote share, data from the state election commission showed that Congress received 42.06% of the vote, while the BJP and JD(S) received 36.90% and 3.8%, respectively. The polls were held for city municipal council wards, town municipal wards and pattana panchayats. In City Municipal Council wards, out of the 116 seats, Congress won 61 seats, while BJP got 67 seats. The JD(S) managed only 12 seats, with 26 seats going to other candidates. Among the 441 town municipal council wards, the Congress got 201 seats, BJP got 176 seats and JD(S) took 21 seats. In the 588 wards of the pattana panchayats, the Congress won 236 seats, the BJP got 194 seats and the JD(S) 12 seats, with ‘others’ winning in 135 wards. According to a PTI report, the Congress retained the Bankapur town municipal council and Guttal town panchayat, in Shiggaon constituency – the home turf of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai.BJP has also lost urban local bodies in the home turf of ministers like B Sriramulu’s Nayakanahatti town panchayat.Karnataka pradesh congress committee president DK Shivakumar said that people have expressed their opinion on the government through this election. “The results are the opinion of the people of Karnataka, and they are supporting the Congress. These votes are a witness to the mood of the people in the state. Even though the BJP is power in the state, and their senior leaders and ministers come from these wards, we have won. Take Dharwad, which is the chief minister’s district. In all these places, people have made their voices heard. People have put their faith in us and in the coming days, we will live up to it,” said Shivakumar. Senior Congress leader and leader of the opposition, Siddaramaiah, said that the results will help the party in the Assembly elections scheduled for 2023. “The results are as per our expectations. People have expressed displeasure with the BJP and their misgovernance. The government is not responding to the people and their problems. Corruption and price hike are increasing. The results show that people are against this government now and the winds are in favour of Congress. We are certain that this helps us in upcoming Assembly elections,” said Siddaramaiah. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai played down the Congress victory claiming the minority votes in these regions were high. “If you look at the numbers, our performance has improved in this election compared to last time, though it should have been higher. We have not won these areas in the past, minorities are around 65% in these areas,” Bommai told reporters.Meanwhile, Randeep Singh Surjewala, who is in-charge of Congress affairs in Karnataka, congratulated K Shivakumar, the MLAs and all senior leaders of the party. “Their continued hard work and unity in action will bring the Congress back to power in the state and usher in a new era of putting Karnataka as the number one state in development,” he said in a statement, according to PTI. The local body polls were held amid reports of Bommai’s removal as CM early next year and high inflation.

Leaders of several Kannada outfits under the leadership of Vatal Nagaraj met chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on the Thursday evening, following which the bandh was called off. Heeding the request of the chief minister and several of pro-Kannada leaders conceded. “There will be no bandh tomorrow, we have withdrawn the bandh, but we may hold some protests,” Nagaraj told reporters after meeting with the CM. “The CM has assured that his government will do everything possible honestly in accordance with the law to ban MES and requested us to withdraw the bandh. Also, earlier in the day leaders of several organisations put pressure on me to postpone the bandh citing the inconvenience it may cause to the people and business ahead of New Year,” he added. The organisations will however be staging a protest rally demanding a ban on MES at Bengaluru’s Town Hall at 10.30 am on December 31. A similar protest was held by the Karnataka Rakshna Vedike on December 30. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that he had requested the Kannada organisations with an assurance that legal action against MES will be taken. “They have now decided to withdraw the bandh. I have told that we are together in protecting our Kannada pride,” said the CM. However, another prominent leader of Kannada Okkuta, Sa Ra Govindu clarified that only tomorrow’s bandh has been called off and that they will call for a meeting and decide further action, in case their demand for banning MES is not met in the days to come. “We have not set any deadline to the CM, he has sought time to talk to experts, so we have postponed the bandh to another day, we will decide our future course, by calling a meeting of all Kannada organisations,” he added. Kannada organisations had last week called for a day-long state-wide bandh on December 31, demanding a complete ban on the activities of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samithi in the state over its repeated involvement in “anti-Karnataka and anti-Kannada activities.” (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prokannada-groups-call-off-bandh-after-meeting-with-cm-bommai-101640888440719.html

30-12-2021||India||India dismisses China’s move to rename 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh||New Delhi: India on Thursday dismissed China’s move to rename 15 locations in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which is claimed by Beijing, and said such actions will not alter the region’s status as an integral part of the country. China’s ministry of civil affairs issued a statement on Thursday saying it had “standardised” the names of 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh for use in Chinese maps. The statement referred to the Indian state as ‘Zangnan’, the southern part of China’s Xizang region. China claims 90,000 sq km in Arunachal Pradesh as southern Tibet, but such claims have always been rejected by the Indian side. The latest development came against the backdrop of a standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which began in May last year and has taken relations to an all-time low. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi referred to China’s move of renaming the places in Arunachal Pradesh in its own language and said: “We have seen such reports. This is not the first time China has attempted such a renaming of places in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. China had also sought to assign such names in April 2017.” Bagchi added: “Arunachal Pradesh has always been, and will always be an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact.” China had issued its own names for six places in Arunachal Pradesh in 2017. The latest list of names was issued ahead of a new border security law coming into effect from January 1. Among the 15 locations renamed by China are eight residential areas, four mountains, two rivers and a mountain pass. Zhang Yongpan, a research fellow at the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told state-run Global Times daily that the renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh and the adoption of China’s first national law for protection and exploitation of land border areas are “important moves made by the country to safeguard national sovereignty, better maintain national security and manage border-related matters at the legal level amid regional tensions, including frictions with India”.

30-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 31, 1949 - India accords recognition to Peking government||India today accorded recognition to the People’s Republic of China, thus becoming the first Commonwealth country to express willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the Communist regime. Almost simultaneously, with characteristic Confucian calm and naivete, came an announcement on behalf of the Foreign Minister of the Kuomintang Government, now torn from Chinese mainland and functioning from Formosa, that the Nationalist Chinese Government were recalling its diplomatic mission from India. While India has yet taken no decision on the choice of the person to be sent to Peking as Ambassador, mutual exchange of diplomatic representatives will take place before long. By recognizing Mao Tse-tung’s regime in China, India has kept in view the realities of the situation. The Communist Government had completely replaced the Kuomintang on the Chinese mainland. India by recognizing this historic fact is maintaining the continuity of friendly relations and good neighbourliness with the great Chinese people with whom the people of this country have had centuries-old ties. A communique issued by the External Affairs Ministry announcing the decision says: “In October last, the Government of India received a communication from the Foreign Minister to the Government of the People’s Republic of China, expressing their desire to enter into diplomatic relations with India on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual interests and mutual respect for sovereign and territorial rights. “Having considered this communication and taken note of subsequent developments, the Government of India have intimated to the new Government of China their willingness to establish diplomatic relations with them.The 55-year-old philosopher-historian diplomat from Chiang Kai-shek’s China, Dr Lo, Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps in the capital, in a statement declared that “the unfortunate consequences of the recognition by India of the Chinese Communist regime will be borne out by history.” “What my Government and people are fighting for is the common case of freedom and democracy,” the Chinese Ambassador emphasized. He added: “About two years and eight months ago I came to India with the fervent hope of my Government and my people to witness, to hasten and to symbolize the early realization of the Indian independence. In this respect my mission is fulfilled. I am happy that India is now free and independent. On the eve of my departure I wish to leave my best wishes and kindest regards to the people of India.” This week Dr Lo has had a number of social parties, with friends as well as with Government representatives. He lunched with the Prime Minister I yesterday and with the Governor General on Wednesday.P.T.I. adds: When the new Chinese Government approached the Government of India, nearly three months ago, for their recognition as the legal Government of China and for the establishment of diplomatic relations, the basis suggested by them was “principles of equality, mutual interests and mutual respect of sovereign and territorial rights.” India, it is understood, considered this basis broad enough and did not, therefore, ask for any undertakings or assurances from the new r6gime before according recognition to it. The Chinese Ambassador in New Delhi was, it is understood, given ample notice of India’s decision to enable him to have consultations with his Government. The future plans of Dr Lo are not yet known. Meanwhile, no authoritative indication is available regarding India’s probable attitude towards the Soviet Union’s move at Lake Success challenging the representative character of Dr T. S. Tsiang, Kuomintang’s nominee on the Security Council. Dr Tsiang is due to occupy the chair in the Council for a month from January 1 when the Kashmir issue may come up before the Council. According to informed quarters here India is not likely to take any positive stand at present in relation to the Soviet move. The question, however, is understood to be engaging the attention of India’s representatives at Lake Success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-31-1949-india-accords-recognition-to-peking-government-101640887600933.html

India's overall R-value is 1.22, the health ministry said on Thursday. Any value greater than 1 is concerning as it suggests that more people are getting infected from the existing number of infected people.The data study by researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai revealed that Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru and Kolkata too have an R-value of over 1.The R-value of Delhi stood at 2.54 between December 23-29, while for Mumbai it was 2.01 between December 23-28. Pune and Bengaluru recorded an R-value of 1.11. The R-value of Kolkata and Chennai was 1.13 and 1.26, respectively."Since mid-October, the R-value of all these cities was over 1. What is new was the sudden rise. The fact that Delhi and Mumbai crossed the R-value 2 is quite surprising,” Sitabhra Sinha, who led the study, told PTI.Talking about R-value, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said, "We believe on the scientific basis R0 is 1.22 as per the available data... so the cases are now increasing, not shrinking. As the scenario emerges, we believe what we are witnessing could be part of the global rise in cases pushed by the Omicron variant... we are already aware that this variant is highly transmissible and that perhaps explains the speed with which it is rising in the world."Delhi on Thursday reported 1,313 fresh Covid cases, a 42% increase from Wednesday's Covid cases. The positivity rate in the capital has reached 1.73%. On May 26, when Delhi witnessed 1,491 Covid cases, the positivity rate was 1.93%.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said Delhi is witnessing community transmission of Omicron as people with no international travel history are contracting the variant. The same is being reported from Mumbai as, according to BMC data, as many as 141 Mumbai residents who had not travelled abroad tested positive for Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-mumbai-s-r-value-exceeds-2-amid-omicron-spike-what-it-means-101640883879997.html

According to reports, two days ago, a tigress died in the state's Dindori area allegedly due to poisoning.An official from the NTCA said the number of tiger deaths has increased in 2021, and investigations are ongoing.The official, who did not wish to be named, said several measures are being taken to protect tigers which include patrolling and arresting people for poaching.He said there can be many causes for the death as the population of tigers is huge, and a standard operating procedure (SoP) is followed to ascertain the reasons.The official said the tiger death is under scrutiny of the state as well as the NTCA.The official also rejected reports that claimed the tigress in Madhya Pradesh died due to poisoning in Dindora, saying they are “mere assumptions” as scrutiny takes time."Ongoing process to protect tigers like patrolling is going on, and a lot of people have been arrested for poaching too. We are doing everything to protect the tigers, but we should also understand that nearly 30 per cent of them are outside tiger reserves," the official said.As per the NTCA, the maximum tiger deaths this year took place in Madhya Pradesh (44), followed by 26 in Maharashtra and 14 in Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/126-tiger-deaths-recorded-in-india-in-2021-ntca-101640879674768.html

Piyush Jain was arrested on December 26, 2021 for offences under Section 132 of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act and was produced before the court on December 27. The court has remanded Piyush Jain in judicial custody for 14 days. His lawyer has said a plea for granting bail to him will be filed on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/piyush-jain-s-tax-liabilities-not-settled-probe-is-still-on-finance-ministry-101640880279872.html

A similar protest was held by the Karnataka Rakshna Vedike today. "Heeding the request of the Chief Minister and several of our pro-Kannada leaders, I have conceded. There will be no bandh tomorrow, we have withdrawn the bandh, but we may hold some protests," Nagaraj told reporters after meeting with the CM. "The CM has assured that his government will do everything possible honestly in accordance with the law to ban MES and requested us to withdraw the bandh.Also earlier in the day leaders of several organisations put pressure on me to postpone the bandh citing the inconvenience it may cause to the people and business ahead of New Year," he said. Chief Minister Bommai said he has discussed all issues with Nagaraj and others and everyone is on one page to protect the interest of Kannada, Kannadigas and Karnataka and thanked the organisations for withdrawing the bandh callTo a question on their demand for banning MES, he said, "all those things have been discussed, I have already stated publicly that the government is examining it legally. I have brought the same to their notice." However, another prominent leader of Kannada Okkuta, Sa Ra Govindu clarified that only tomorrow's bandh has been called off and that they will call for a meeting and decide further action, in case their demand for banning MES is not met in the days to come."We have not set any deadline to the CM, he has sought time to talk to experts, so we have postponed the bandh to another day, we will decide our future course, by calling a meeting of all Kannada organisations," he added. Another leader hinted that they may wait and call for bandh on January 22, if their demands are not met by then. Pro-Kannada organisations had last week called for a day-long state-wide bandh on December 31, demanding a complete ban on the activities of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samithi in the state over its repeated involvement in "anti-Karnataka and anti-Kannada activities". The demand follows the recent incidents of burning of the Kannada flag in Maharashtra's Kolhapur and defacement of the statue of historical icon Sangolli Rayanna in Belagavi, allegedly by MES activists. The MES, a Marathi outfit, has been campaigning for a long to merge Marathi speaking regions in Belagavi with Maharashtra. However, several organisations like the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC), Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV), Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association, Auto, schools and college associations, shopping malls association and several other commercial establishments had offered only moral support and said they will not participate in the bandh and will function as usual. Business establishments had cited New Year brisk business for not physically supporting the bandh call. At the last moment today, even those who were supporting Nagaraj in his call for bandh, like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike Praveen Shetty faction among others, made a u-turn and requested him to call off the bandh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karntaka-bandh-tomorrow-who-called-the-strike-who-are-supporting-all-you-need-to-know-101640874010363.html
30-12-2021||India||Omicron pushes Covid tally: 4-digit Covid cases in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata||The Covid-19 situation of India worsened overnight with states recording a huge jump in the number of Covid-19 cases. On Thursday, India's Covid tally was 13,154 in a sharp jump from Wednesday's tally. On Friday, the number will see another jump as cities are reporting around 40% jump in the number of Covid cases. On Thursday, the Centre said the rise of Covid-19 cases in India could be a part of the global surge being driven by Omicron, the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2. India's surge is also believed to be driven by Omicron, but this variant can be detected only through genome sequencing and that's why experts said it will take time to confirm Omicron's role. But the cases are increasing, almost doubling, which is a sign of Omicron, which is more transmissible than DeltaHere are updates of India's Covid-19 situation:1. Mumbai on Thursday reported 3,671 infections. On Wednesday, the number was 2,510. Maharashtra reported 198 Omicron cases, taking the tally of the new variant in the state to 450. Out of these 198 Omicron cases, 190 have been reported from Mumbai alone. 2. Delhi on Thursday reported 1,313 Covid infections, in a massive jump. This is the highest single-day rise since May 26. The positivity rate on Thursday mounted to 1.73%. On May 26, the positivity rate was 1.93%. During May, the country was witnessing the peak of the second wave.3. West Bengal on Thursday reported 2,128 fresh Covid infections. Kolkata has emerged as a district of concern with 1,090 Covid-19 cases recorded on Thursday. On Wednesday, the tally in Kolkata was 540. The test positivity rate in West Bengal is 5.47%.4. The present R-value of Covid in India is 1.22 which means every 100 infected people can spread the infection to 122 people. Delhi, Maharashtra have R-Value over 2 for the first time since the pandemic began.5.  India's present surge could be part of the global rise in cases pushed by Omicron, the Centre observed. However, Delta is still the predominant variant in India and not Omicron, the ministry said. 6. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said Omicron is seeing community transmission in Delhi as people with no foreign travel are testing positive of Omicron variant. 7. Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Bengaluru, Chennai, Gurugram, Ahmedabad, Nashik are reporting an increasing trajectory of overall Covid cases, the Centre said. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat are emerging as states and UTs of concern on the basis of weekly cases and positivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-pushes-india-s-covid-tally-mumbai-3-671-cases-kolkata-at-1090-101640872332614.html

The process for the acquisition of the medium-range supersonic cruise missile by the Philippines armed forces suffered a setback because of the Covid-19 pandemic but is now back on track, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. According to the website of the Philippines’ department of budget management, two “special allotment release orders” worth 1.3 billion pesos and 1.535 billion pesos were issued on December 27 to cover the initial funding requirements for the “Shore-Based Anti-Ship Missile System Acquisition Project” of the Philippine Navy. The people cited above confirmed this allocation was for the BrahMos missile system. They added that a team from the Philippine Navy visited the production unit of BrahMos Aerospace in Hyderabad earlier this month as part of the acquisition process. The BrahMos Integration Complex in Hyderabad is responsible for integration of mechanical systems and assembling electronic systems. Various sub-systems fabricated in other centres in India and Russia are integrated and checked at this complex.“It is a done deal and there will be further developments early next year,” one of the people cited above said.The Philippines armed forces are implementing a revised modernisation programme and a contract for two corvettes was signed by the navy with South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries on December 28. The Philippines also plans to sign contracts for 36 Black Hawk helicopters and six offshore patrol vessels in 2022. The department of budget management also made substantial allocation this month to cover the initial funding requirements for the acquisition of utility helicopters by the Philippine Air Force and fast boats for the navy. On March 2, India and the Philippines signed an “implementing arrangement” to facilitate government-to-government deals on military hardware and equipment, including the BrahMos missile, which has a range of 290 km and can carry a 200-kg warhead.Filipino defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who witnessed the signing ceremony, was quoted by the media as saying at the time that Philippines is buying the BrahMos missile. Lorenzana said the agreement would serve as a guide for the two sides on policies and procedures in defence procurement. Hindustan Times had first reported in December 2019 that the Philippines was set to become the first country to buy the BrahMos missile system. Both sides were keen on signing a deal during a proposed visit by President Rodrigo Duterte early in 2021, but the plan fell through because of the widespread disruptions caused by the pandemic. The Philippine Army’s first Land Based Missile System Battery also has plans to acquire the BrahMos. Russian officials have said India and Russia are working to gradually increase the range of the BrahMos and begin exporting the missile to third countries. The Philippines zeroed in on the BrahMos after extensive trials and much of the negotiations have revolved around the cost of the system. India had offered a $100-million line of credit to the Philippines for defence purchases. India has been in talks with several Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, in recent years to sell them land and sea-based versions of the BrahMos. New Delhi has set an ambitious target of achieving defence exports worth $5 billion by 2025.

What we know about this||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is gradually spreading in the community. Delhi has witnessed a sudden surge in the number of Covid cases, driven by Omicron. As on Thursday morning, the national capital has the highest number of Omicron cases in India."Indeed, the variant is gradually spreading in the community and its proportion will increase in the coming days," the health minister said when asked if Omicron will be the dominant variant in a possible third wave of the pandemic.Commenting on Omicron's community spread, Dr Naresh Gupta, director professor of Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi, said, about 70% of Omicron patients are asymptomatic and with the variant's high transmissibility, it is going to spread like fire once it gets into the community because you won't know if the next person is infected.What is the community spread?SARS-CoV-2 generally spreads from person to person through droplets, aerosols or through touch. Contact tracing is a process to track this chain of transmission and also to stop the chain from proceeding further by quarantining people who might have come in the chain. When the chain can not be established because the virus is widespread, it is called community spread. This means that the virus is circulating in the community and anyone can get the infection.Community spread of OmicronOmicron is a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, more contagious than Delta which caused the second wave of the pandemic in India. Within a month after the first Omicron cases were detected in India, the total number of Omicron cases reached 961 on Thursday.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the latest genome sequencing report of samples in Delhi showed 46% of the samples have Omicron and these people include those who do not have any travel history. This indicates community transmission, the health minister said.The World Health Organization had confirmed the community transmission of Omicron in South Africa and the UK.The first cases of Omicron in India were foreign travellers who contracted the variant, first detected in South Africa, from abroad. All first cases of Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka were international travellers. However, the situation changed within a month as now the Omicron cases are mostly those with no international travel history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-spread-of-omiron-in-delhi-what-does-it-mean-what-we-know-about-this-101640857117342.html

He urged police to initiate action against Sarma.A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they have received the letter and a preliminary inquiry was being done. He added that no FIR has been lodged against Sarma.Sarma’s political secretary, Jayanta Malla Baruah, called Khaleque’s request “politically motivated”. He added they will go ahead with its agenda of removing illegal settlers from encroached lands irrespective of what other parties say or do. “People who are aware of the background of the Assam Agitation know the circumstances that led to over 850 persons becoming martyrs. As a political party we stand by our commitment to protect the interest of indigenous persons of Assam,” said Baruah.

30-12-2021||India||Out on harassment charges, Cong leader back in key position||When the Congress party appointed a secretary to oversee key northeastern states of Tripura, Nagaland and Sikkim last week, they reopened a sexual harassment case that they thought was dealt with last year.Ranajit Mukherjee, 41, resigned in 2020 after an internal inquiry was conducted by former Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Gowda, head of the party’s research department of which Mukherjee was a member.The inquiry took place after a member of the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the party’s student arm, complained about him in writing, and another colleague in the research department reported “inappropriate behaviour’’ during the 2018 Rajasthan assembly elections.After Mukherjee’s recent appointment, the women have raised questions about the propriety of assigning a key leadership role to him. While the Congress party hasn’t responded, Mukherjee told HT that he has been punished long enough, and the party was recognising the hard work that he has done since.“I have had a consensual relationship after I was estranged from my wife. This matter blew up in 2019-20. I voluntarily resigned and opened up to my family, and it led to my divorce this year. The party has acknowledged that I made an error in judgement,” he said. “I have been kept away from a party position for more than a year. I have been working diligently and party has recognised my work and given me responsibility. I cannot be punished forever.’’The two women, however, told HT that the party has erred in giving a supervisory role to Mukherjee when his behaviour showed a pattern.“There are others besides me who have fallen prey and can vouch for the same,” the main complainant wrote in an email on Friday to party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. “I have been quiet because I do not want our political opponents to hurt the Congress party using this as a tool. The appointment of a proven sexual predator would only harm the Congress party.... Please follow the official procedure and remove him from the post.’’While there has been no response to the Friday letter, Gowda did send an email on July 24 last year, acknowledging that he was accepting Mukherjee’s resignation after her allegations. “An internal inquiry was conducted,” the email had said. “His resignation has been accepted and he is no longer secretary, AICC department with effect from today.”When contacted Gowda said: “If such matters arise, they are dealt with in an appropriate and fair manner to the satisfaction of the complainant."The second woman, who was working in the research department, told HT that Mukherjee travelled with her on party work to Rajasthan. “He always made me feel uncomfortable, but there, he got drunk and banged on my door late at night,” she said.While she did not file an official complaint, she did bring it to Gowda’s attention. She described Mukherjee as “predatory.”Mukherjee’s boss Ajoy Kumar told HT that he was holding off assigning work to him. “I have been informed of this, and so no work will be assigned till the issue is resolved,” Kumar said.An accused in a sexual harassment case could be reinstated, but it depended on the particular case and the findings of the inquiry committee, according to Vrinda Grover, lawyer and expert in sexual harassment cases.“After inquiry, what was the punishment? Did they say it was only for a year? It depends on the nature of the case and the punishment should be commensurate to that,” she said. “Due diligence requires that they don’t give them a supervisory position, but you may give them a position after a review.”In this particular case, the details of how long the inquiry committee removed him from the post have not been disclosed even to the complainants.Mukherjee was also the Lok Sabha candidate for the party from West Bengal’s Bardhaman-Durgapur constituency in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/out-on-harassment-charges-cong-leader-back-in-key-position-101640833268106.html

In total, 12,987 new cases were detected across India on Wednesday – the most in a day since November 10, when the country saw 13,148 new cases, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.There were 9,155 new cases in India on Tuesday, while this number was 6,139 on Monday.The surge is likely to be driven by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The number of Omicron cases reached 946 on Wednesday, with 161 of these confirmed in the last 24 hours, according to data shared by states with HT. Of the total, at least 241 infected by the new “variant of concern” have recovered.In Maharashtra, infections increased 79% over the previous day, when the state had 2,172 new cases, according to the state’s daily health bulletin.Mumbai, meanwhile, logged 2,445 Covid cases on the day as infections surged 83% from 1,333 on Tuesday. The state, meanwhile, reported 85 Omicron cases on Wednesday, taking its tally to 252.Maharashtra’s positivity rate climbed to 3.16% while Mumbai recorded the positivity rate of 4.71 %. Both these numbers were less than 1% last week.Earlier in the day, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope expressed concern over the rise in the number of fresh as well as active cases in the state, terming it an “alarming” situation.“Mumbai has a positivity rate of more than 4% is not a good sign and is a matter of concern. The surge of cases is really alarming and we will shortly meet Chief Minister where we may be forced to tighten curbs,” said Tope. He said he was likely to meet tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray to discuss further restrictions in two days.Thackeray, meanwhile, urged people not to panic, but exercise extreme caution in the wake sharp rise in coronavirus cases in Mumbai and stressed on vaccination and widespread use of face masks. He said all public places in the city will remain shut on December 31.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force in Maharashtra said that third wave has already hit the city of Mumbai. “The cases jumped from 600 to 2300 in just five days and the rapid growth rate clearly states that omicron outbreak has happened in the city of Mumbai and that it is here to replace the delta variant. However even if the medical infrastructure is not overwhelmed yet we will have to stay vigilant and alert,” said Joshi.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health in the BMC, said: “The city is functioning like pre-covid times with local trains operating normally. While there is a surge, there is no heavy demand for hospital admission and oxygen in the city... Besides this the pattern of cases is also inconsistent and it is too early to say now whether the third wave has already started.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-single-day-covid-tally-nears-13k-highest-in-7-weeks-101640812071921.html

Zakir Hussain, additional director of DGGI said, “We have concluded our ‘panchnama’. We have recovered gold, handed it over to DRI, but the probe is on. The gold which was recovered in Kanpur is separate... here, we recovered about ₹19 crore cash,” he told reporters.DGGI also said the accused has admitted that cash recovered was related to the sale of goods without payment of GST.“The statement of Piyush Jain has been recorded wherein he has accepted that the cash recovered from the residential premises is related to the sale of goods without payment of GST,” DGGI said in a statement.The accused has been sent to 14 days’ judicial custody by a Kanpur court. Jain’s lawyer Subodh Malviya said he would file for his bail application on January 1.Malviya further said that DGGI has assessed on the basis of recovery that Piyush Jain has a liability of ₹32.20 crore as penalty. “We have offered in writing that total ₹52 crore shall be deducted from the recovery money... The sum includes, penalty, the interest and other expenses...” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raid-on-kanpur-businessman-money-recovered-from-2-bunkers-says-witness-101640811355000.html
30-12-2021||India||Congress, BJP are on same page against BJD’s Odisha panchayat election plan||Bhubaneswar: Odisha’s opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have asked the government to only go ahead with the panchayat election process if it can implement reservation of 27% seats for other backward classes.On Wednesday, a delegation of BJP MLAs led by Lalitendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra met governor Prof Ganeshi Lal and submitted a memorandum protesting the publication of draft reservation list for zilla parishad, panchayat samitis and gram panchayats without any reservation for OBCs.As per the new reservation list, 12 of the 30 zilla parishad chairpersons’ post has been reserved for candidates of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The post of chairpersons in 7 tribal-dominated districts has been reserved for the scheduled tribe while in the rest 23 districts, 54 posts of chairpersons have been reserved for scheduled caste candidates. The posts of sarpanch in 7 tribal-dominated districts have been reserved for scheduled tribes while out of the 4697 panchayats in the rest 23 districts, the sarpanch post in 1161 panchayats reserved for the SC category.The state government’s new list came a week after the Orissa High Court directed the state government to withdraw its earlier notification for panchayat polls that earmarked seats for OBC candidates and publish a new list.The high court cited the December 6, 2021 order of the Supreme Court which quashed the Maharashtra government’s ordinance for 27% quota for OBCs in all zilla parishads and panchayat samitis without collecting data on OBCs in every municipal body seat. The SC had asked Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to comply with the “triple test” before notifying the reservation of seats for OBCs the local bodies under their jurisdiction. The triple test includes setting up a dedicated commission to conduct an empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness as regards local bodies in the state, specifying the proportion of reservation required according to the commission’s recommendations.Mohapatra who met the Governor said the move of the Odisha government to proceed with the panchayat polls without reservation to OBCs is strictly contrary to the object, intent and purpose of the constitutional scheme of advancement and adequate representation of OBCs.“Persons belonging to OBC category are deprived of an opportunity to be elected to the elected positions through the democratic process and fulfil the aspirations of OBC communities. It is quite unfortunate that the state government is actively pursuing to conduct the panchayat elections without reservations to OBCs. Such an election would deprive the persons belonging to OBC community for five long years which by no stretch of logic can be said to be a short period causing grave prejudices to the backward classes,” the BJP delegation said requesting the Governor to take up the issue with the State Election Commission.Senior BJP leader and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan also criticised the publication of the new notification saying Odisha government could have approached the top court against the high court order, especially when its own SLP for reservation beyond 50% is pending with the apex court.The BJP’s demand comes in the backdrop of BJD’s decision to nominate 40% candidates in the forthcoming panchayat elections from OBCs. Though the BJD earlier announced that it will give 27% tickets to OBC candidates, BJD organisational secretary Pranab Prakash Das on Saturday moved a resolution in the state executive meeting to give 40% tickets to OBCs.“As the SC has passed an order on scrapping reservation for OBCs, reservation for OBCs is not possible in panchayat polls. So the state executive moved the proposal to give 40% tickets to OBCs,” said BJD leader Debi Mishra.The BJD, however, did not clarify whether the party would reserve 40 per cent of the seats from the total number of zilla parishad, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats or 40 per cent of the seats after deducting the seats for SC/ST from the total number of seats.Congress leader Ganeswar Behera demanded that the state goes to polls only after implementing the OBC quota provision.“A special session of the assembly should be convened to make required legal provision to give social justice to the OBCs in the state. Once the legislation is made, OBCs can get the reservation in politics, education and jobs like other states,” he said.Former union minister Srikant Jena, also an OBC leader, demanded that Odisha, like Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra which have put the panchayat polls on hold till seats are reserved for OBCs, should also stay the election till it reserves seats for OBCs. “The state government should call a special session in the Assembly to discuss the issue. The Centre should move a review petition in SC seeking withdrawal of the December 6 order of the apex court,” said Jena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-bjp-are-on-same-page-against-bjd-s-odisha-panchayat-election-plan-101640806166665.html
30-12-2021||India||Kerala’s K Rail project: Govt, oppn prepare for high-voltage debate||With the state government and Congress-led opposition sharpening their position on proposed high speed rail project ‘K Rail’, Kerala is set to witness campaigns for and against the project in coming days. After the ruling Left Democratic Front announced a door-to-door campaign to spread awareness on the project, opposition United Democratic Front has decided to mount a similar drive against the project in coming days. The government’s ambitious project is facing rough weather in the face of protests from opposition parties. The ₹63,940 crore project seeks to develop a high-speed rail corridor connecting Kasaragod in the state’s north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south. The state needs 1,383 hectares of land for the proposed project, of which 1,383 hectares are private land. The central government is yet to approve the project. Opposition leaders draw a parallel between Kerala’s project and the land acquisition drive in West Bengal’s Nandigram region which culminated in violent clashes between farmers and security personnel in 2011. The state government on the other hand is putting its weight behind the project. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has launched a social media campaign for the project. According to officials who are familiar with development, he will meet people in all 14 districts of the state to dispel their fears surrounding the corridor. The CM will also interact with business, social, cultural and religious leaders across the state, said the party. “All are teamed up against the government and some of them even threatened that it will be another Nandigram. They can’t browbeat us and we are least bothered. The project was there in the LDF manifesto and people gave us a resounding verdict in April assembly elections,” said CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. He reiterated his charge that Congress, BJP, Jamat-e-Islami and other outfits have ganged up against the government. “We have information that some of these forces are also planning unrest in the name of the project. But we will go ahead with this,” he said in Pathanamthitta on Wednesday. Opposition leader V D Satheesan ridiculed the CPI(M) saying it opposed the bullet train project (Ahmedabad-Mumbai) and passed a resolution saying it was meant for the high-income groups and now the party bats for high speed rail “which will displace thousands of families and damage fragile ecology of the state”.“The party’s double standard is exposed. No serious environment or social impact study was done. Is this dialectical materialism?” he asked. He said the opposition will strengthen its protest in the coming days. The proposed rail line will bring down the travel time between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, covering 529.45 km, from 12 hours to four hours. It will be completed by 2025, said Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), the nodal agency for the project. “Initial work for the project is progressing. We have started land marking and acquisition. Our target is March 2025 and there can be some cost escalation but it is manageable,” said Ajith Kumar, MD of the KRDCL. Besides opposition parties, environmental activists are also opposing the project saying it will displace more than 20,000 families and destroy wetlands. “The project will be a disaster for the state. The government conceived the idea when weather experts warned the state will face recurring calamities due to climate change,” said environmental activist C R Neelakandan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-k-rail-project-govt-oppn-prepare-for-high-voltage-debate-101640805393263.html
30-12-2021||India||Year that was: DMK’s sun rises; NEET row erupts: Year of churn in Tamil Nadu||This year on April 6, Tamil Nadu voted for a new government and the DMK came to office after a decade. The courtrooms have also been in the limelight with ex-chief justice Sanjib Banerjee’s remark against the election commission to be booked for murder being dragged to the Supreme Court while his colleague justice Anand Venkatesan passed a landmark order to uphold the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community. The crime scene primarily unfolded in schools with several teachers being arrested on charges of sexually abusing children. Though Tamil Nadu has attracted multi-crore investments this year, Ford’s exit is chief minister MK Stalin’s first challenge in the industries sector. On the health front, the state managed its oxygen resources to ride over the second Covid wave. But reasoning that the future of healthcare would be in peril if NEET continues, the government has passed a Bill to abolish the medical entrance exam. DMK’s return to power after a decade This was the first assembly election that saw no stalwarts like late J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi but it was a battle that would decide the succession and future of both the Dravidian parties - the AIADMK and DMK. In the contest between an accidental chief minister Edappadi Palanswami and MK Stalin, who had been waiting for this post under the shadow of his father Karunanidhi for four decades, it was the Stalin-led DMK’s coalition that swept to power forming the government in May after a decade. But there was no time for celebrations as the new government had to immediately hit the ground to contain the raging second of Covid wave intensified by the Delta variant. Sasikala’s release from prison Even without having either contested or campaigned, VK Sasikala has been a powerful behind-the-scenes player who manoeuvred affairs in the AIADMK as well as in governance while she lived with Jayalalithaa for three decades. So, it was only natural that her release this January after being imprisoned in a Bengaluru jail for four years in the disproportionate assets case pushed the AIADMK into panic mode as the very people she propped up – Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam had turned against her to control the party in a dual leadership set up. As expected Sasikala announced that she would pick up from where she left off before being jailed as AIADMK’s interim general secretary. The BJP hoped her inclusion will strengthen the NDA alliance but even union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention couldn’t convince Palaniswami. Sasikala then made a surprise announcement that she would “step away” from politics before the election only for her to renew her ambition to take over the AIADMK following their defeat. For now, the AIADMK has managed to thwart her advances. ‘Me Too’ movement hits Chennai schools It started in June, when students and alumni from a popular Chennai school began sharing bitter experiences of their teachers sexually abusing them in physical and online classes. Soon, it snowballed into an avalanche of sexual abuse stories of children from across the city. Police received hundreds of complaints in a week. Women police officers convinced some of them to register an FIR and a dozen teachers have been arrested including God Man Siva Sankar Baba, who founded of Sushil Hari International School who was accused by his former students. Since November, at least three girl students have died by suicide in Tamil Nadu citing sexual harassment. HC bans ‘curing’ sexual orientation In a landmark judgement in June, the Madras high court banned any attempts to cure the gender identity and sexual orientation of people as part of a slew of orders passed to sensitise the state and central governments and the society on the LGBTQIA+ community and prevent them from being harassed. The order was passed after a lesbian couple who had fled from Madurai to Chennai had moved court seeking protection from their parents and the police as they were in a consensual relationship. Justice N Anand Venkatesh is continuing to hear the case where various state and central bodies are submitting compliance reports to further the rights of the community. Ford exits India On September 9, Ford Motor Company announced that it will stop producing cars in India for sale immediately and export will wind down by shutting down its manufacturing facilities in Sanand and the vehicle and engine manufacturing in Chennai by June 2022. Ford’s workers union in Chennai stalled work and went on strike protesting the sudden decision that would leave the future of the 2,650 permanent employees and another 2000-odd employees on contract uncertain. Ford was the first global car maker to invest near Chennai in the 1990s which led to a boom in automobile companies; auto-ancillary manufacturing and it uplifted the poor economic status of its workers. Tamil Nadu government is in talks with a few auto companies to take over the Ford plant. NEET isn’t abolished yet The DMK couldn’t keep its promise that in the first assembly session after they returned to power they would abolish the National Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test (NEET) which is legally not plausible. A dozen students have died in the state since NEET was made compulsory in 2017 because they couldn’t either pass or they feared failing this entrance exam that’s required for undergraduate medical admissions. The struggle against NEET is also a larger fight for the rights of the state to follow its own educational system and against the BJP-led union government centralising power. The DMK government formed a committee under retired Justice AK Rajan to study the impact of NEET on medical aspirants who are socially and economically backward. This was challenged by the BJP in the Madras high court but the court favoured the state. Based on the report, which concluded that NEET should be scrapped, the DMK-led government passed the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Act, 2021 with a voice vote supported by all parties except the BJP. This is the second such Bill from the state with the President rejecting the earlier Bill passed under the AIADMK regime. The new Bill is now pending before the Tamil Nadu Governor.
30-12-2021||India||Oppn slams Andhra BJP president’s poll promise of liquor bottle at ₹50||Opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh slammed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit president Somu Veerraju on Wednesday after he promised that the party would supply quality liquor to the people at a nominal rate of ₹50 a bottle if voted to power in the 2024 assembly elections.Veerraju made this promise while addressing the Praja Agraha Sabha (meeting to express people’s anger) rally at Vijayawada on Tuesday evening, also attended by former Union minister Prakash Javadekar among others.He alleged that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra had abnormally increased liquor prices and was thriving on the money earned through liquor sales. “More than one crore people are consuming alcohol in the state, and the government is fleecing their money by enhancing liquor prices. If all these one crore people vote for BJP in the next elections, we shall offer you good quality liquor at ₹75 (a full bottle). If the revenues are good, we can even supply it at just ₹50,” he said.The BJP leader went on to allege that the state government itself was encouraging the brewing of cheap liquor by the YSR Congress party leaders and selling them with unknown local brands, while popular brands have disappeared. “The Jagan government promised to implement total prohibition in phases, but it is manufacturing and selling cheaper brands of liquor,” he alleged.Senior YSR Congress party leader and state excise minister K Narayana Swamy on Wednesday wondered whether Veerraju was a president of the state BJP or that of liquor shop owners’ association. “Unfortunately, the BJP has stooped down to the level of seeking votes by promising to supply liquor at cheaper rates,” he said.Communist Party of India state secretary K Ramakrishna said the state BJP president seemed to have lost his mental balance. “It is the height of madness to say that one crore people are addicted to alcohol, and they should all vote for the BJP to get the liquor for ₹50 a bottle,” he said.Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and state IT minister KT Rama Rao also reacted to the BJP leader’s promise. “Wah, what a scheme! What a shame! AP BJP stoops to a new low. The national policy of BJP to supply cheap liquor at ₹50 or is this bumper offer only for states where desperation is ‘high?’” he tweeted.However, Veerraju on Wednesday defended his comments, saying: “I made the promise only for the benefit of womenfolk in the state as the present YSRC government is selling liquor at a very high price and cashing in on their weakness for liquor,” he said.He reiterated that the BJP if voted to power, would reduce the liquor prices substantially so that the poor man would spend less money on liquor and give the remaining amount to his family. “I made the promise only keeping in mind the families of the poor. BJP is a pro-poor party,” he said.

30-12-2021||India||T’gana high court admits PIL against liquor order||The Telangana high court on Wednesday admitted a public interest litigation petition questioning the state government’s decision to extend timings for supply of liquor by retail wine shops, bars, pubs and event-license holders on the eve of New Year. At present, retail shops, bars and pubs in the state are allowed to supply liquor till 10 pm, except in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, where they are allowed to run till 11 pm. However, state chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Tuesday night issued orders according permission to the prohibition and excise department authorities to allow bars, pubs, event-permit holders and resorts being run by the Telangana tourism development corporation to serve liquor up to 1 am on the intervening night of December 31 and January 1. Similarly, retail wine shops would be allowed to remain open up to midnight of December 31 for New Year celebrations, subject to observance of standard operating procedures (SOP) for Covid-19, the chief secretary said in the orders. The government’s decision comes at a time when several states across the country are imposing night curfews on the directions of the Central government in the wake of rising cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Last week, the Telangana high court directed the government to impose stringent restrictions on celebrations for Christmas, New Year and Sankranti. On Wednesday, while admitting the PIL filed by advocate Ch Prabhakar, the high court sought to know the reasons for the state extending timings. It posted the case to Thursday for hearing the arguments of the state government. The petitioner argued that the state government, instead of complying with the orders of the high court issued last week, was not following the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Prevention Act, 1897 and the Provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, by extending the timings. This will lead to a huge congregation of the people on New Year Day eve, he pointed out. An official of the state excise department said on condition of anonymity that the state government had earned ₹2,886 crore through liquor sales till December 28 and was expected to earn another ₹700 crore in the next three days by relaxing the timings. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president A Revanth Reddy criticised the state government saying it was prioritising revenue over lives. “Other states are imposing night curfews to control Covid cases.. But @TelanganaCMO permits bars to serve liquor till 1 am and wine shops to be open till 12 midnight. Revenue is priority over lives…??” he tweeted.
30-12-2021||India||Three months on, Guv office still considering TN’s NEET Bill||Three months after Tamil Nadu passed a bill seeking exemption from the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate medical admissions and forwarded it to the Governor, the state government is still awaiting response from the Raj Bhavan on the bill. “The file is under consideration,” said S Venkateshwaran, the undersecretary to Governor RN Ravi in response to a Right to Information (RTI) query. The RTI was filed by the general secretary of the State Platform for Common School System, Prince Gajendra Babu, seeking information on what action has been taken by the governor on the Bill and its current status. Babu said his organisation will send a letter to the Governor to immediately forward the bill to the President. “The Bill has been passed under List 3 (concurrent list) entry number 25, a subject in which the Governor has no role to accept or reject it and he only has to reserve it for the President. So what is there to consider?” says Babu. “The Constitution says such issues should be addressed as soon as possible and the Supreme Court has said that there is no time frame for constitutional authorities to examine this. But NEET is an issue where hundreds of seats and lakhs of applications are involved. It affects higher secondary students who are still below the age of 18 so imagine the amount of stress they are in waiting to know about the results of the Bill.” A state minister, on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear if the delay was due to the change in the office of the Governor at a time when the Bill was passed. “It should have been done by now but we do not know what the reason is. By now, the Governor should have understood the pulse of the people. But we were informed that a legal opinion is being considered,” he said. “Our MPs in Delhi are also in touch with central government officials on this issue. We hope it is sent soon for the President’s assent.” The Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 was passed by the DMK-led state government in the state assembly in September to restore Tamil Nadu’s process of medical admissions by considering only class 12 marks before the Supreme Court made NEET compulsory in 2017. All parties, except the BJP, supported the Bill through a voice vote on September 13. It was then forwarded to the Governor’s office. Ravi took over as governor on September 18 after then Governor Banwarilal Purohit was transferred to Punjab. In November, chief minister MK Stalin met Ravi and urged him to immediately send the bill to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent. The bill can be implemented only if the President of India gives his assent. The AIADMK in 2017 passed a similar Bill seeking exemption from NEET but it was rejected by the President. Tamil Nadu’s stance under both the DMK and AIADMK governments has been that NEET puts poor and rural students at a disadvantage compared to their peers who belong to affluent and urban backgrounds who can afford better resources and coaching. After NEET was made the sole criteria for medical admissions, more than a dozen students have died by suicide either due to fear of failing or failing the entrance exam. NEET was conducted this current academic year across the country including Tamil Nadu in September. And hours before taking the NEET, a 19-year-old from Salem district died by suicide. 
30-12-2021||India||Officer suspended for assaulting tribal men in Udupi||Karnataka police on Wednesday suspended a police sub-inspector for allegedly attacking people of the Koraga Adivasi community at a wedding celebration in Udupi district, officials said. The community is categorised under scheduled tribe (ST). According to the complaint registered by members of the community with the police chief in Udupi, the incident occurred on Monday night when the Santhosh-led police team arrived at the groom’s house after neighbours complained of loud music. After an initial altercation with the locals, the team began assaulting those present at the wedding and later took five people, including the groom Rajesh to the police station and assaulted them, the complaint said. The detention led to a protest outside the police station by the community members. A video of the incident has also been circulating on social media, showing the policemen using lathis against the wedding party. HT has verified this video. A day after the incident, the Koraga community insisted on suspending the SI when inspector Ananthapadmanabha visited the colony in Kotathatthul. Kundapur MLA Halady Srinivas Shetty also visited the colony on Tuesday and condemned the lathi-charge incident. Soon after minister for backward classes Kota Srinivas Poojary, who hails from Kota, promised to visit the colony and sought a report into the lathi-charge incident from the Udupi superintendent of police and deputy commissioner. An inquiry has now been ordered into the case. “We have suspended the sub-inspector and other staff have been transferred out of the station. Further action will be taken after the investigation. The Crime PSI was entrusted with the charge of the Kota police station,” said Udupi superintendent of police Vishnuvardhan told reporters. Poojary has condemned the incident. “I strongly condemn the brutal assault on innocent Koragas, including the groom, by the police at a function in a Koraga colony last night in the Kotathattu Gram Panchayat of Brahmavar taluk in Udupi district,” Poojary said. He said that he will visit the family of the bridegroom on Thursday. The Koraga community is an Adivasi community mainly residing in the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts of Karnataka and Kasargod district of Kerala. The population of the Koraga community has seen an alarming decline over the last few decades. The population is currently around 16,000 people of which 9,000 people reside in Udupi, according to government figures. This is the third incident where a police officer has faced action for assault against minorities. In September, the criminal investigation department (CID) arrested a police sub-inspector for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to drink urine, while the latter was in custody in May, police said. Arjun Horakeri, a sub-inspector of police posted with Gonibeedu police station, was produced before a court in Chikkamagaluru on Wednesday, and an additional district and sessions judge remanded him to 14 days judicial custody. On December 8, a police sub-inspector was suspended after he had allegedly manhandled a young man and forced him to drink urine in Bengaluru. Sub-inspector Harish KN was suspended after a departmental inquiry. He was charged with “dereliction of duty and not registering a complaint”. 
30-12-2021||India||Year that was: Left’s hold continues; nature’s fury returns in Kerala||This year saw the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) making history in the April assembly election by retaining power in Kerala that usually boots out the incumbent. Also, at least 40 people had been killed in Kottayam and Idukki districts in October following heavy rains and landslides. Left front retains power It was an unexpected win for chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan as Kerala took a left turn again bucking the four-decade-old electoral trend that usually boots out the incumbent. With a brute majority, winning 98 out of 140 seats, the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) made a history of sorts in the April assembly polls. For Vijayan, who led the coalition, it was a personal victory and it catapulted his position nationally. When the CPI(M) was licking its wounds in West Bengal, left liberal forces were happy that only communist government in the country bounced back and retained power in Kerala. Though the government was in the midst of many scandals and corruption charges, including the sensational gold smuggling, arrest of party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son in money laundering case and alleged backdoor entry in government services, the CM steered the coalition with his “brand” and “trust quotient,” sweeping results show. He gave a tough challenge when five central agencies pitched their tents in the state and questioned some of his confidants in the gold smuggling case. Vijayan remained main “trouble shooter” and “captain” for all - when a section of the party called him a “captain” - the party defended it saying “people will address him with many names due to love and affection”. That was his hold over the party. During the first term, the state had faced two consecutive floods (2018 and 2019) and pandemic outbreak and the CM was always there to assure that the state government was with the suffering lot and it clicked well. Nature’s fury For last three years, the state has been facing natural calamities one after the other. At least 40 people killed in Kottayam and Idukki districts in October after heavy downpour and landslides. According to met office, the state received highest rainfall in October since 1961. Weather experts cited recurring cyclonic circulation as the main reason for the unseasonal heavy downpour. The frequency of cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea, usually considered mild sea, also increased manifold in recent years, they pointed out. While a 52% increase in cyclonic movement has been observed over Arabian Sea between 2001 and 2019, there was a decrease of 8% during the same period over the Bay of Bengal. The IMD statistics also showed formation of nine cyclone or major depressions in 2020-21, four of which were over the Arabian Sea. Experts also cited rising temperature in Arabian Sea for unusual downpour and warned more such occurrences. Mother’s struggle for her baby After six-month-long struggle, mother Anupama Chandran, who fought a valiant battle to establish her motherhood, got her baby back. Her struggle national attention and even BBC profiled her. The 23-year-old woman activist (former leader of SFI) Chandran gave birth to a baby on Oct 19 in 2020 but three days after the birth parents allegedly taken away the baby and admitted to a government-run orphanage fearing stigma. She said her parents opposed her relation with her husband Ajith Kumar as he belonged to a Dalit family. But parents insisted that she gave up her child voluntarily for adoption which she denied outright. She even alleged a C-section (caesarean operation) was forced on her as her parents were in tearing hurry to dispose the child. Later, the baby was given for adoption to couple in Andhra Pradesh. The sensational issue came to light after the mother gave an interview to a news channel in October second week alleging that her new-born baby was forcibly taken by her parents and gave for adoption ignoring her protests. Belonging to a Communist family, she initially took it up with party leadership but later turned to the media after all attempts failed. After the news channel beamed her heart-rending story on October 20, police filed a complaint against six people, including her parents. She finally got her baby in November. Governor-CM spat The state witnessed an unusual spat between the Governor and the state government after the former sent a strongly-worded letter to the chief minister on Dec 8 in which he said he was really pained over “dipping standard” of higher education sector and blamed “brazen political interference” as reason in varsities for this. He asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if political interference continued and he can’t bend further. Though the CM asked the Governor not to take any precipitation action but the latter refused to budge. CPI(M) and its junior partner CPI said the governor’s sudden outbursts remain a “mystery” for them. Both said he was forced to come out against the left government due to pressure from some quarters. Later the Governor hit back saying they can call him a “Sanghi” or any other name but he will stick to what he said and no plan to take up the chancellor’s position, if varsities were not given complete autonomy. The stalemate continues and the Governor asked his office not to accept any files regarding universities. According to political observers, the real trigger (between governor and government) was the reappointment of the vice-chancellor of Kannur University, Prof Gopinath Raveendran. He was re-appointed for a period of four years in November last year after the government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee to select the new V-C. Double political murder The twin political murder of two state-level leaders - Social Democratic Party of India secretary KS Shan and BJP OBC Morch leader Renjith Sreenivasan - in a span of 12 hours in a radius of 10 km in Alappuzha sent shockwaves across the state. Kannur-model eye for an eye and tooth for tooth politics was re-enacted in relatively peaceful Alapzuha. Police have arrested 20 persons in connection with the twin murders and blame game is still going on. 
30-12-2021||India||Bommai urges Kannada groups to call off statewide bandh on Dec 31||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday asked Kannada organisations to withdraw state-wide ‘bandh’ call on December 31 since the government has already taken action against “anti-Kannada forces” and was examining their demand for the ban legally. A group of pro-Kannada organisations have called for a statewide bandh on December 31 demanding a ban on the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES). The members of the outfit are suspected to have defaced the statue of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna in Belagavi district on December 18 amid the ongoing dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka over the Belagavi region. “I appeal to organisations… as per their wishes, we have already taken several decisions. We have taken strict action as per law against anti-Kannada forces. On the demand for banning MES, we are examining it legally. So I appeal to them through the media not to go ahead with the bandh. Bandh is not an answer for everything,” Bommai said. He further said that the government would welcome if organisations want to put pressure in any other peaceful way, other than bandh. “So we earnestly appeal to the organisations to drop the bandh call,” he added. The MES has been campaigning for a long to merge Marathi speaking regions in Belagavi with Maharashtra. Asked whether MES can be banned as per law, Bommai said, “We are examining it. I’m not saying it will be banned, I had said the same thing in the assembly as well. We will have to look into it.” The organisers of the Bandh are yet to state their decision on the Bandh call The act of burning Karnataka’s flag in Maharastra on December 14 led to unidentified persons pouring ink on a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji in Bengaluru. In response, Suspected MES supporters then allegedly damaged a statue of Rayanna and indulged in stone-pelting on Karnataka government vehicles in Belagavi. Following this prohibitory orders were passed by the police in certain areas of the district. Karnataka police also arrested seven people in connection with the vandalism. Following this, as many as 35 organisations have extended support for the dawn-to-dusk bandh, however, several organisations like the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC), Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV), Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association, Auto, schools and colleges associations, shopping malls association and several other commercial establishments have offered only moral support and said they will not participate in the bandh and will continue to function normally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-urges-kannada-groups-to-call-off-statewide-bandh-on-dec-31-101640805210393.html
30-12-2021||India||Some creative ways to celebrate the New Year’s||Here they come again, the questions: what are you doing for New Year’s? Any plans? Any resolutions? As for resolutions, just say, “I don’t make them, I keep them.” Here are some suggestions from interesting Bangaloreans about celebrations.Julie Kagti, textile artist: My suggestion would be a quiet sit-down 7-course dinner at Grasshopper, located in a family-run farm on Bannerghatta road. A few good friends and family, where the wine and conversation flows easy. End with a nightcap by a bonfire recapping the highlights of the year late into the night.Ravichander, honorary director, Bangalore International Centre: This New Year, I would recommend that you discover our erstwhile city centre on foot. A civilised society cares for its most vulnerable and that would be the pedestrian on our streets. With our newly built footpaths, you could for instance, explore getting from Ulsoor Lake to Freedom Park and back. And there are a myriad of alternative routes on foot where you can cover places, community spaces and food joints. You will discover Bengaluru that you missed experiencing all these years.Praveen Kumar, bharatanatyam dancer and guru, Chithkala.com: Being a classical dancer, my life mostly revolves around art, travel, meeting people. I have been associated with the Swananda Ashram, which is off Kanakapura road, wherein we help kids studying in and around that place. We help them in getting funds to pay their school fee, uniforms etc. So I like to spend the day in that area just to keep a tab on their activities. Also, the Ashram has beautiful greenery, which reminds me of old beautiful Bengaluru.Ruma Singh, wine writer and columnist: If the pandemic has taught us anything it is that we have got a second chance at life. So, it will be a quiet getaway with my family to one of the many beautiful, green places we have around Bengaluru -- like Flameback, surrounded by paddy fields and bird sounds, or Primrose Villas, atop the mist-wrapped mountains of the Western Ghats, both in Chikmagalur. I would sit and watch the trees, listen to the birds and immerse myself in the beauty of nature and the present: that joy never gets old. Oh, and a glass of wine to aid the meditation- perhaps an Alvaro Palacios Ermita 2013 from Priorat.Abhishek Poddar, founder, Museum of Art and Photography: I realise the true extent of how much I enjoy Bengaluru, each time I land back in the city. From the smoothest airport in the country-- ten minutes from landing to being in the car, the steaming hot cup of filter coffee at Hatti Kaapi in hand, driving back home with the windows down and enjoying the amazing weather. The next morning is always a refreshing walk in the park amongst the flowering trees (and each season has its own colours), followed by the finest South Indian breakfast at Umesh Point! There is no other place that offers so many of life’s simple pleasures so amply.Madhu Natraj, Award winning Choreographer, Mentor, Artpreneur: If I were to imagine a New Year’s Eve that is special, I would choose to nominate the majestic stairs and patio of the Vidhana Soudha as a concert venue on 31st night. A unique amalgam of folk, classical, and contemporary performers of Karnataka along with an international troupe. The area around Vidhana Soudha to be cordoned off for a kilometre radius to feature bespoke cuisine and beverages (with local breweries and wineries). This should be a ticketed event with security. If the Government-- in liaison with event companies and artistes-- hosts such an event every year, we don’t need to hear of revellers roaming the streets like headless chickens with no idea as to how to spend this special evening. Madhav Sehgal, General Manager, The Leela Palace Bengaluru: My New Year plan is to take a ride on my Harley and visit a few temples in and around Bengaluru and find some authentic temple food in their vicinity.As you see from the responses, muted, simple celebrations are in. We are emerging from the chrysalis of the pandemic and taking tentative steps into a new year and a new dawn. What would I do? Staycations are in. Watching the moonrise and the sunrise from a penthouse suite at The Conrad hotel overlooking Ulsoor Lake will be cool.To celebrate may seem unseemly given the turmoil and crises that many of our family and friends have gone through. But it is also a way to leave behind our guilt and pave the way forward. It is a life-giving affirmation.Happy New Year everyone!Shoba Narayan is Bengaluru-based award-winning author. She is also a freelance contributor who writes about art, food, fashion and travel for a number of publications.

30-12-2021||India||Soon, bill to free state temples from govt’s control, says Karnataka CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that the government plans to introduce a new bill to free temples and Hindus religious institutions in the state from government control. He announced this at the BJP state executive meeting in Hubli. “Hindu temples are under different types of control bylaws and rules. Before the budget session, a law would be given shape to make our temples free from such restrictions. Temples will be allowed to function freely, and there will be only regulations,” he said. He pointed out that prayer halls of other communities are safe under different laws and are free to perform without government regulations. According to Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment Department website, there are 34,558 temples in the state under comes under government regulation. Those generating more revenue will be under ‘A’, those generating little less revenue will be under ‘B’, and temples not generating any revenue would be under ‘C’. The idea is to make use of a portion of the revenue generated in ‘A’ and ‘B’ categories for rejuvenation of ‘C’ category temples. Among the famous temples coming under the department are Kollur Sri Mookambika temple, Chamundreshwari temple in Mysore and Ranganathaswamy temple in Mandya. The temples are regulated through Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment ACT 1997. He further said that a task force would be set up to implement the anti-conversion law, and proper implementation will be undertaken. The Bill is yet to be cleared in the upper house. “Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah says this (anti-conversion) law will be scrapped within a week if the Congress comes to power. His dream will not come true, they won’t come to power. The law ensuring freedom for all to practice their religion will remain permanently,” Bommai said. Responding to the allegations, a Congress spokesperson said that people are watching how the BJP is targeting the minorities in the state. “First of all, the BJP came to power in the state with immoral methods since they couldn’t win a majority on their own. Drunk on this power, they passed legislation that are targeting minorities. People of the state will respond to this in the next elections,” said the spokesperson. Meanwhile, BJP’s senior Karnataka leader Anwar Manippady said that he won’t be attending the party’s two-day executive committee meeting being held in Hubli, because of the attitude of other leaders. “I’m an invitee also. I am the Executive Committee member of the party. I just returned from Mangaluru and at the last moment, I thought I will not go (to the meeting) because the attitude of them is not welcoming for us to go there. So, I won’t go there,” he told reporters. Asked about the present BJP government in the state, he stated it has failed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s concepts. “The concept of ‘Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas’ is been neglected and not happening at all... such a good concept has gone. They are going against it by totally neglecting minorities, especially Muslims.” “I have umpteen examples of how they are harassing the Muslim minority by denying their rights for a decent burial. The burials, which have been functioning for 10 to 12 years in Goonadka, Sullia in Dakshina Kannada district and Parappana Agrahara in Bengaluru and other places, hooligans with the help of police goondas in Sahakarnagar stopped and locked up a functioning mosque,” he said. Manipaddy also accused the state government of taking no action against encroachments of Wakf properties, despite the Supreme Court order to look into the report submitted to the government, and alleged the culprits have indulged in heavy bribery. CM Bommai did not respond to the questions on Manippady’s statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-bill-to-free-state-temples-from-govt-s-control-says-karnataka-cm-bommai-101640805146601.html
30-12-2021||India||Average time for environmental clearance down to less than 90 days: Govt||The average time to grant environmental clearances in all sectors has reduced significantly from over 150 days in 2019 to less than 90 days in 2021 said the Union environment ministry in a statement on Wednesday.The clearance time is as low as 60 days in some sectors, it added. The ministry has granted environmental clearances to 7,787 projects through environment impact assessment (EIA) notifications in 2021, the statement added. “In pursuant to the spirit of ‘digital India’... a Single-Window Integrated Environmental Management System named PARIVESH has been developed…over the years, the existing system of ‘PARIVESH’ has undergone numerous modifications and customization in alignment with statutory provisions and requirements,” the statement said.The ministry has automated various processes through Parivesh such as development of online modules for dispensing requirements for environmental clearance for expansion / modernisation of industries provided there no increase in pollution load; aligning the EIA notification with Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 2021; Online generation of environmental clearance with unique ID number and several others.HT had reported in April that the environment ministry has allowed companies operating in several industries, including some polluting ones, to expand capacities on the basis of a self-certification that this will not “increase the pollution load”, creating the room for potential misdeclaration (and misuse).Further, the ministry has decided to upgrade the Parivesh portal to provide a “single window” solution for administration of environmental regulations. “Upgraded Parivesh will not only strengthen the clearance processes but also encourage ease of doing business in the country. Know Your Approval module with inbuilt decision rules in the envisaged system will guide the Users about the applicability of clearances to the proposed project activity. In addition, it will minimize repetitive efforts of the Users and the same time will ensure single version of the truth across all applicable clearances,” the ministry said.The ministry also listed the biological diversity amendment bill; India’s stance at Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) and implementation of national clean air programme among its major achievements in 2021.One of the major changes in the new biological diversity amendment bill is that registered Ayush practitioners who have been practising indigenous medicine can access any biological resource and its associated knowledge for commercial utilisation, without giving prior intimation to the concerned State Biodiversity Board which has been widely criticised by experts.However, researchers said the reduction in clearance times was not benefiting conservation. “Has the time taken to grant environmental clearance reduced due to increased vigilance and better enforcement? They don’t say whether the level of scrutiny has improved. The mandate of the environment ministry is environmental protection. How is it an achievement if they have reduced time to grant EC by not improving monitoring and infrastructure? Its also laughable that the ministry counts proposed amendments to the biological diversity act and forest conservation acts to be achievements,” said Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer.“The environment regulation is being assessed through a perverse logic that considers rates and dates of approvals as measure of success. It is no longer about how much area has been protected from degradation or how much environmental damage has been remedied. Faster rates of clearance do not ensure financial viability or a project and neither does it ensure that proposals are ecologically wise and socially legitimate,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/average-time-for-environmental-clearance-down-to-less-than-90-days-govt-101640804729495.html

Nihar Nalini Swain was known as the foster mother of tigress Khairi who came to the couple as a frail and bony seven-week-old cub, and lived with them in their forest bungalow.She passed away in Ashirvad old age ashram at Siddheswar Sahi in Cuttack at the age of 88. “She passed away peacefully,” said Shreeja, a family member of Swain.Swain had been staying at the old-age home following the death of her husband, Saroj Rai Choudhury, who is considered by many forest officers as the father of wildlife education in India.When Choudhury was director of Similipal Tiger Reserve in 1974, a group of Khadia tribals returning from an expedition found a tigress with 3 cubs. The tribals shouted and banged their drums to scare away the tigress. The tigress ran off with 2 of her cubs but one was left behind. The tribals took the frail cub and brought it to the official quarters of Choudhury who named it Khairi. Since then, Khairi lived with the childless couple as their adopted daughter at home.Within a few days of getting the cub into their household, it became an inseparable part of the family. The cub ate from Nihar’s hands. Though Choudhury and Swain reared some other wild animals at their residence including a crocodile, a bear cub, a blind hyena and a mongoose, it was Khairi that caught everyone’s notice. Khairi stayed with the couple in their bungalow till it was bitten by a rabid dog in 1981. As her condition deteriorated, Choudhury decided to euthanise the tigress to spare her the torture. Khairi was buried in the lawns of the same bungalow. Choudhury died soon after. After her husband’s death, Swain moved to an ashram and later to an old-age home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nihar-nalini-swain-foster-mother-of-tigress-khairi-in-odisha-dies-at-88-101640804306297.html
30-12-2021||India||Media’s duty to protect judiciary from motivated attacks, says CJI||New Delhi: Delving upon the dangers of mixing information with ideological stance, chief justice of India NV Ramana on Wednesday called on the media to protect the judiciary from motivated attacks. Speaking during the virtual presentation ceremony of the Redink Awards by the Mumbai Press Club, the chief justice said the media and judiciary need to sail together. “The recent trend to sermonise about judgments, and villainise judges, needs to be checked. The media must have belief and trust in the judiciary. As a key stakeholder in democracy, media has the duty to defend and protect the judiciary from motivated attacks by evil forces. We are together in ‘Mission Democracy’ and in promoting national interest. We have to sail together,” he said. He also acknowledged the challenges faced by journalists. “Speaking truth to power and holding up a mirror to society is an immense responsibility that is extremely difficult to fulfil,” Ramana said. The freedom of the press is a sacrosanct constitutional right, he said, pointing out how the Supreme Court of India has upheld this freedom through the years.Having started his professional career as a journalist, justice Ramana noted two trends in contemporary reporting of news. “Nowadays, everything is subject to reporting. Every moment is available to the scrutiny of millions as things get reported 24x7….In the race for ratings, the important journalistic tenet of verification before publishing is not being followed. This leads to incorrect reporting,” he said. Once published, he added, social media amplifies the incorrect news and it is difficult to take it back. He advised media professionals to follow the “principles of natural justice” before making any adverse comments against someone.Another trend, justice Ramana pointed out was “the seeping of ideological stances and biases into the news story.” In his view, “News mixed with views is a dangerous cocktail. Connected to this is the problem of partial reporting, of cherry-picking facts to give it a particular colour… Allowing yourself to be co-opted by an ideology or the State is a recipe for disaster.”Veteran journalist Prem Shankar Jha was awarded the lifetime achievement award, while RedInk journalist of 2020 was given posthumously to Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui who died while covering the Afghanistan takeover by the Taliban in July.CJI Ramana compared journalists to judges and said, “Journalists are like judges in one sense. Regardless of the ideology you profess and the beliefs you hold dear, you must do your duty without being influenced by them.” He said, “Nothing can be more lethal to democracy than the deadly combination of confrontational polity and competitive journalism. Tragically, they feed on each other. History is witness to this hard truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-and-judiciary-must-sail-together-cji-101640804254882.html
30-12-2021||India||ED files supplementary chargesheet against Anil Deshmukh||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday filed a supplementary charge sheet against former Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh in connection with an alleged money laundering case, an official confirmed.The 7,000 page charge sheet, which was filed by the agency before a special court here assigned to hear matters related to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), also named Deshmukh’s two sons, Salil Deshmukh and Hrishikesh Deshmukh.The probe agency earlier filed a charge sheet against 14 accused, including Deshmukh’s private secretary (an additional collector-rank officer) Sanjeev Palande, and personal assistant Kundan Shinde, who were arrested on June 25.The central agency registered the money-laundering case against Deshmukh on May 11 on the basis of a First Information Report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21 following allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. In a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that Deshmukh instructed dismissed Mumbai police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from restaurants and bars in the state capital. According to ED, it was on Deshmukh’s instructions that Vaze held a meeting of bar owners from Mumbai and demanded a monthly amount of ₹3 lakh from each of them.Vaze was dismissed from service after his arrest in the ‘Antilia’ bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran killing cases.CBI’s FIR was filed under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. In its first charge sheet on August 23, ED claimed that Vaze collected ₹4.7 crore from various bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021.The probe agency claimed that the money was sent to Delhi-based Jain brothers who reportedly operated bogus companies using hawala channels. The Jain brothers reportedly diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukh family. The minister was arrested on November 2 after more than 12 hours of questioning at the ED office in south Mumbai, and is currently in judicial custody. He stepped down from his post on April 5.ED suspects that the Jain brothers were acting on the instructions of Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh. Both Palande and Shinde played an important role in collecting and laundering the unaccounted money, the ED claimed.The supplementary charge sheet was submitted to the Session’s Court for verification. Once the verification process is completed, the court will take cognisance of the charge sheet and summon the accused accordingly.Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Inderpal Singh said they were yet to see the supplementary charge sheet as it would be made available to them only after the court took cognizance of it. .

A jawan died in retaliation by locals, and a day later, another civilian was killed when security personnel opened fire at a mob that vandalised an army camp.

According to a Portuguese publication, Expresso, the Indian embassy shared a letter by Central Authority on Extradition (MEA), with the Portuguese court, saying that Singh would not receive a prison sentence of more than 25 years and will not be re-extradited to a third country. The Indian letter assured it would comply with the “principle of reciprocity” with Portugal, the report said. The court, however, observed that the letter does not fully bind the Indian government since it was not issued by any of its representatives but by the Central Authority on Extradition. NIA, ministry of external affairs and ministry of home affairs did not respond to HT’s query on Portugal’s refusal to extradite Singh. According to the probe agency, Singh is the mastermind behind the collection, distribution and sale of heroin smuggled from Pakistan in Kashmir, as also in collection and channelisation of proceeds to further activities of the Hizbul Mujahideen. The matter came to light after one of the naro traffickers was arrested and ₹29 lakh was recovered from him last year.The official cited above said that the 26-year-old was absconding ever since the NIA began its probe into the case in May last year. A global arrest warrant was also issued against him through Interpol in October 2020. Singh was arrested by Portugal’s Immigration and Border Service in Loures in July, following which he was sent to preventive detention at a prison in Lisbon. Subsequently, India made a request with Portugal authorities to extradite the accused in order to unearth the entire Pakistan-Punjab-Kashmir narco terrorism network.NIA officials said that Singh, along with Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen, sent six large consignments of heroin to India between 2018 and 2020. The consignments included a shipment of 532 kg of heroin, which was intercepted by the customs in June 2019 at Attari in Amritsar. The heroin consignments were sent in the garb of importing rock salt granules from Pakistan and proceeds of the same were partly sent back to Pakistan through hawala operators. A substantial portion of the proceeds was channelised to the terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir through a network of overground workers and other associates, officials said. Chief of Kashmir-based terror group Riyaz Ahmad Naikoo, who was killed by security forces in May 2020, was supervising the entire operation for the Hizbul in India, they added. The agency has already filed a charge sheet against 12 people, including Singh and Naikoo, in connection with the case. On Wednesday, a fresh charge sheet was filed against two more narco traffickers – Gurjant Singh and Nasir Khan.Portugal had earlier accused India of violating the extradition treaty by slapping charges attracting death penalty against gangster Abu Salem, after he was extradited in 2005 for his role in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case. Salem was awarded a life sentence in 2017. He continues to plead before Indian courts that India violated the extradition terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-setback-to-nia-portugal-refuses-to-extradite-narco-terror-case-mastermind-101640803647003.html

India and the UAE will commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year.No official announcement was made regarding the visit by both countries, though it was expected that Modi would have been in the UAE on January 5-6. An unnamed official of the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi was quoted by Khaleej Times as saying that the visit has been put off.“The visit has been postponed. But it has not been cancelled. It will happen soon,” the official said. He added that the visit will “happen sooner than later”.The people cited above said the trip could be pushed back to February.The UAE has rolled out new measures to control the possible spread of Covid-19, including mandatory RT-PCR tests on passengers arriving from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil and Russia, and random tests on travellers from other countries.Covid-19 cases in the UAE have risen to the highest levels in the past six months, with 1,803 infections and two deaths recorded on Sunday. This marked a steep increase from the start of December, when daily cases had fallen to below 50.The Prime Minister’s visit had been expected to focus on both deepening cooperation and looking for new areas for collaboration. Several agreements in different areas were likely to be signed during the visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-uae-visit-pushed-amid-omicron-variant-prep-101640803645587.html
30-12-2021||India||BJP ready for virtual rallies: Union minister||New Delhi: Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Punjab election incharge, said on Wednesday his party was ready to hold virtual rallies if the situation so demanded -- a remark that came amid concerns of a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases fuelled by the Omicron variant.Shekhawat said the BJP also held virtual rallies in West Bengal, where polls were held in March-April.“The BJP is fully prepared. The BJP did virtual rallies during the West Bengal assembly polls also. And when the political parties across the world were in hibernation, during the first and the second wave of Covid-19, even at that time, BJP workers were reaching out to people through virtual platforms,” Shekhawat said, when asked if his party was ready to hold virtual rallies.The Election Commission, which is on a three-day visit to poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, recently held a Covid-19 review meeting with Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. While experts say that large political gatherings may cause localised spikes in infections, the Allahabad high court last week urged the commission and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider delaying elections or banning large political rallies.Elections are scheduled to be held in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur early next year. Shekhawat was talking to the reporters at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi after several local leaders from Punjab joined the party.A New Delhi-based spokesperson of the BJP was not available for a comment on a query about whether Shekawat’s remark was the party’s position in all poll-bound states.Omicron, a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus, has led to fresh curbs across the country, including the national capital. The Centre on December 21 asked states and Union territories to step up surveillance and consider steps such as night lockdowns and bans on large gatherings if more than 10% of all tests in a week turn up positive or if the occupancy of hospital beds breaches 40% of the capacity.Samajwadi spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said: “The Samajwadi Party campaign is going well, including the party president’s rath yatras. SP is getting overwhelming public support. If any decision regarding virtual rallies comes from the Election Commission, then the party will look into it. It will be hypothetical to say anything now.”Naveen Pirshali, spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party’s Uttarakhand unit, said: “The AAP has always been a responsible party. Unlike the BJP, it has always valued human life above all. Having said that, the party will follow the government guidelines in case of a Covid-19 outbreak and accordingly find appropriate ways to campaign for the assembly elections in Uttarakhand.”The Union health secretary on Monday reviewed Covid-19 containment measures with officials of the five election-bound states, hours after his meeting with the Election Commission over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and the required arrangements to safely conduct the polls.Bhushan briefed the election watchdog over the health care system’s preparedness ahead of the polls, saying there was no need for concern as the government was monitoring the situation, people aware of the matter said.The health ministry said that Bhushan reviewed the vaccination status in the five states and advised them to ramp up the inoculation of all eligible people.The meeting between Bhushan and the election watchdog was part of the commission’s agenda to keep a close watch on the spread of the pandemic. “This is a preliminary meeting, the commission will continue to do more such meetings to keep a check on the situation,” a person aware of the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-ready-for-virtualrallies-union-minister-101640803587285.html
30-12-2021||India||Amid surge in cases, fresh curbs in Goa and Rajasthan||New Delhi: As states across India step up Covid-19 containment measures against the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Goa and Rajasthan on Wednesday imposed a fresh set of restrictions, including a night curfew and limiting access to public places.The Centre on December 21 asked states and Union territories to step up scrutiny of Covid-19 infection trends and consider steps such as night lockdowns and bans on large gatherings if more than 10% of all tests in a week turn positive or if the occupancy of hospital beds breaches 40% of capacity.In all, India has detected at least 946 cases of Omicron as on Wednesday, with 161 of these confirmed in the last 24 hours, according to data shared by states with HT. Of the total, at least 241 people who were infected by the new “variant of concern” have recovered.The Goa government on Wednesday limited the capacity of casinos, cinema halls/auditoria and other such arenas to 50%, and mandated full vaccination for entry into public places. Rajasthan, too, revised its containment guidelines by imposing a self-regulatory night curfew from 11pm to 5am and imposing a 200-person cap on public gatherings.In wake of the rising cases, several states have also made vaccination mandatory for visiting public places, including restaurants, bars and parks. In Karnataka and Maharashtra, restaurants have been asked to operate till 10 pm. Full vaccination has been mandated for entry into public places in Haryana from January 1, and in Punjab and Rajasthan from January 15 and February 1, respectively.However, the Telangana government on Wednesday eased some curbs in view of the New Year’s celebrations by allowing the state excise department to permit bars and licensees of event permit managements to serve liquor till 1 am on December 31 and January 1.The state reported 235 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, pushing the tally to 681,307, while the toll stood at 4,024.The Telangana high court has agreed to listen to a petition challenging the decision. The petitioner, advocate Ch Prabhakar, has alleged that the state government’s order violates the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Prevention Act, 1897 and the Provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.An official of the state excise department, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Telangana government had earned ₹2,886 crore through liquor sales till December 28 and it was expected to raise another ₹700 crore in the next three days by relaxing the timings of the liquor supply on December 31 night.Several other states such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, which receive a large number of tourists for New Year’s celebrations, have not imposed any restrictions.On Wednesday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, too, ruled out any restrictions for New Year’s, but asked officials to identify containment zones in Kolkata, where cases have been on the rise.“Covid-19 cases are on the rise... there are a few Omicron cases also. So, review the situation in the state. We may consider closing down schools and colleges for some time,” Banerjee told officials at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-surge-in-cases-fresh-curbs-in-goa-and-rajasthan-101640803410626.html
30-12-2021||India||Dec 29: What we know about the Omicron variant so far||The Omicron variant may have reached community transmission in Delhi. Officials shared data showing one of the main genome sequencing hospitals – a genome analysis determines the variant of a Sars-CoV-2 sample – in the Capital found 53% of the samples to be of the Omicron variant. People aware of the matter said these samples were taken as part of “sentinel surveillance”, which means they are from labs in different parts of the city where people have tested positive.The findings explain what case numbers say. From reporting around 100 cases a day a week ago, the Capital logged 923 cases in a single day on Wednesday. The proportion of tests turning positive – 1.29% -- rose to its highest in 212 days.This was expected. And so far, Delhi’s experience appears to be consistent with the mild but rapid spread seen in the early phases in South Africa and the UK, the first hot spots of the Omicron variant. According to the Delhi government’s daily bulletin, of the 2,191 active cases in the city, only 55 are on oxygen support with the remaining being asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.Preparing testing for the surgeThe Omicron surge will soon begin to pose a problem for the city’s testing infrastructure if the current protocols on when to get a test continue. Even if Omicron cases are largely mild, the testing system needs to be protected to allow for people who need it -- those with moderate or severe symptoms -- to be able to take one.Two countries illustrate why the threat that the variant will exhaust testing capacity is significant: Denamrk and the UK. In Denmark, the third country where Omicron took hold after South Africa and the UK, testing hit a ceiling after a peak positivity rate of 47%. In UK, too, there are shortages of RT-PCR test appointments as well as antigen test kits.
30-12-2021||India||How a pan masala shipment led to mega seizure, political row||Kanpur: One morning in early December, tax inspectors stopped a truck carrying a consignment of pan masala outside Ahmedabad. While checking papers, they found several questionable invoices with the driver, who couldn’t prove their authenticity. Suspicious, officials from the directorate general of GST (DGGI), a law enforcement agency under the Union finance ministry fighting tax evasion, started looking into the owner of the truck – Praveen Jain, who ran Ganapati Transport. On December 21, the investigators landed in Kanpur to raid the offices of the pan masala company, Shikhar, and Praveen Jain. During the raid, the DGGI team intercepted four more trucks – all owned by Ganpati Transport, all loaded with the same pan masala brand, and all with the same fake invoices, issued to fictitious firms. In all, 200 such fake invoices were found, said tax officials on condition of anonymity. Officials then tallied the stock available in the factory with the stock recorded in the books, and found a massive mismatch. “This corroborated the suspicion that there was clandestine removal of goods with the transporter,” said the official quoted above. With suspicions now turning towards the supplier of raw materials, investigators started looking at Piyush Jain, a relative of Praveen Jain who supplied a key raw material – the chemical compound that gives a distinct scent to each brand of pan masala – and showed up at his house the next day. “We were just following the investigation. We hadn’t even thought we would recover any cash,” said a second official, requesting anonymity.They were in for a surprise. Over the next two days, they recovered ₹196.45 crores in cash – all allegedly unaccounted-for wealth. “Everyone was surprised with the quantity we had before us; we got in touch with the SBI (State Bank of India) officials through our local office to help with manpower and machines,” said the second official quoted above.Pictures of officials sifting through mounds of cash on the floor and notes piled up high have gone viral since, making Piyush Jain one of India’s most-notorious businessman who allegedly evaded taxes worth several crores. The haul of cash is one of the largest by an enforcement agency, the Union finance ministry has said, and details about how the money was recovered from underground bunkers, walls and furniture has riveted local residents. Piyush Jain is in jail but has sparked a bitter verbal war between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – because his name matches an SP lawmaker, Pushpraj Jain, who launched a Samajwadi perfume and who is his neighbour in Kannauj. The SP alleges that the government was targeting Pushpraj Jain and erroneously raided Piyush Jain. Investigators say that the raid was the result of investigation and recovery of fake invoices. At an event on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi even referred to “fragrance of corruption” while taking a dig at the SP. Talking to law enforcement and tax officials, Piyush Jain’s neighbours and other residents in Kannauj and Kanpur, HT pieces together the high-profile incident. Unassuming familyIn Kannauj’s cramped Sarai Meera neighbourhood, everyone remembers the Jains as an unassuming family. In this area -- located next to the railway station in the old town of Kannauj where cheek-by-jowl houses line narrow lanes – Piyush Jain grew up in a three-room house. In a town famous for its scents, their father Mahesh Chandra Jain was a chemist who was an expert at mixing chemicals for different compounds. He passed on his trade secrets to his two sons, who launched a company, Odochem, in 2010. Their fortunes rapidly changed, remember friends and neighbours. Over the next decade, they bought two adjoining houses, hired masons from Rajasthan and rebuilt the area with a 2,500 yard housing complex. His fragrance compound sold for up to ₹2 lakh per kg.“Piyush Jain is one of the finest compound makers but he was not social and kept to himself,” said Nishank Jain,a friend. Another neighbour said he was never seen without his rickety Bajaj Super scooter or his rubber slippers. In Kannauj, he owned an old Santro and in Kanpur, the family had two cars. This was why shockwaves went through the neighbourhood when investigators landed in Kannauj on December 24. The house was found locked and when the family was called, they said the keys were missing, said officials. In all, there were eight front doors and each had four locks; the DGGI team brought in gas cutters to finally get in. “Inside, we found cash hidden in the bed, basement and the walls. The house was freshly built by the masons from Rajasthan with certain walls wider than the normal ones, which made us suspicious,” said the first official quoted above. In all, ₹19 crore was recovered from the house with 23kg of gold, and 600kg of sandalwood, said Zakir Hussain, additional director of DGGI. Start contrastPiyush Jain’s home in Kanpur is in stark contrast to his ancestral house in Kannauj,. Located inside the high-income neighbourhood of Anandpuri, the swanky house stands on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in the city, Uttar Pradesh’s largest.But inside, officials said they found money in ₹500 and ₹200 notes stashed in wardrobes, neatly packed. Thirty currency bundles were wrapped in paper and plastic, and secured with coloured tape, said officials. The 177.45 crore found hidden in the house was counted by 14 machines for 36 hours. The notes were finally taken away in 81 tin boxes to the SBI’s main branch in Kanpur. “On December 22, around 3.30pm, two vehicles screeched to a halt outside the house, and people stormed in, taking everyone by surprise. That’s how the raid began,” said Jung Bahadur, the guard.The case has now taken a political colour, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav sparred over the raid on Tuesday. At an event in Kanpur, PM Modi took a veiled dig at SP and said that the “itar” (fragrance) of corruption that was spread before 2017 – the year the SP was voted out of power -- had now been exposed.“They take credit for every development works done in the state. I was thinking if they will also take credit of the suitcases full of cash which are recovered in the last few days,” Modi said. Hours later, Yadav hit back. “By mistake, the BJP got its own businessman raided. Instead of SP leader Pushpraj Jain, it got Piyush Jain raided,” Yadav told reporters.The other Jain at the heart of this row –SP MLC Pushpraj ‘Pampi’ Jain –denies any relations with Kanpur-based businessman. The confusion began, he claims, because the two men are neighbours in Kannauj and their houses are roughly 20 paces from each other. “I am a Jain, he is a Jain. Coincidentally, we have houses in the same locality (Chipatta) in Kannauj. This doesn’t mean we are related. I have no relations with him whatsoever,” he said. Last month, Pushpraj Jain had launched the Samajwadi perfume. Bail applicationPiyush Jain is now behind bars, after the court of the metropolitan magistrate (corporation), Kanpur, remanded him in 14 days judicial custody after rejecting the investigators’ plea for his remand. He has been arrested on charges of tax evasion under section 69 of the Central GST Act and has allegedly confessed to his crime, said officials. His lawyer, Subodh Malviya, said he will file a bail application on January 1. “DGGI has alleged that they have found this much amount from residential premises, it has not made clear whose money this is and where it has come from,” he said. “DGGI has assessed that my client has the liability to pay penalty of ₹32.50 crore and that could increase. We have informed the DGGI through a letter that it should deduct ₹52 crore from money recovered and that has been put in a fixed deposit as penalty and other expenses. We have not heard from the DGGI or Central GST on our offer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-pan-masala-shipment-led-to-mega-seizure-political-row-101640803165638.html
