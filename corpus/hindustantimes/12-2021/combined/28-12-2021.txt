Further, to avoid change of status and fresh encroachment, petitioners are directed to file the list of existing occupants along with the site plan of the cluster within two weeks,” the court said in an eight-page order.Fourteen petitioners moved court against the demolition carried out by the authorities at the camps, contending that they have been residing in the area for several decades.They claimed that no exercise has been carried out under the Delhi Slum and Jhuggi Jhopri Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015 to identify jhuggi dwellers eligible for relocation and rehabilitation. The counsel for the petitioners said that the nodal agency for carrying out the exercise is DUSIB and no such exercise has been carried out by them to relocate the residents.Appearing for the DUSIB, its counsel said that in so far as the particular piece of land is concerned, they have not carried out any such exercise under the relocation policy of 2015. He submitted that the exercise of identifying eligible jhuggi dwellers is carried out by DUSIB only on receipt of a request from the agency concerned for relocation.He also submitted that in so far as the central government land is concerned, the nodal agency to carry out the exercise under the relocation policy is DDA.The court then issued a notice to DDA and sought its stand on the issue.The counsel for New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) told the court that an exercise was carried out by their officials and only seven jhuggi dwellers were identified. However, he conceded that no such request was made to either DDA or DUSIB to carry out the exercise.Taking note of the submissions, the court said that no proposal has been brought before DUSIB, nor an exercise carried out by the agency.“In view of the errors pointed out in the conduct of survey and the alleged non compliance of the requisite steps, it is expedient to call for an affidavit from the authorities to show the steps followed and compliance with the procedure laid down in the Delhi Slum and Jhuggi Jhopri Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015,” the court said.The matter will next be heard on January 21, 2022.
28-12-2021||Delhi||2021: The year when vision of a 24-hr ‘future-ready’ Delhi took root||2021 was the year when Delhi planned to become the “future-ready” capital. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the nodal urban planning agency in Delhi, came out with a series of policies and a new master plan, the blueprint for the sustainable development of the city in the next two decades.To place the capital in the same league as other global megacities, the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 proposes a 24-hour city with thriving nightlife, high-rise studio apartments near mass transit facilities, co-working spaces, rental housing, pedestrian-friendly streets, etc. The Master Plan, which was put up for public scrutiny in June, is likely to be finalised by February next year. The DDA recently completed the public consultation process, which was for the first time held virtually due to the pandemic. According to senior DDA officials, the agency received close to 33,000 suggestions/objections regarding the new vision document.The plan also proposes a major change in DDA’s role in the city’s development from that of a developer to regulator and facilitator by allowing private developers to provide for the housing needs in the future. Since 1957, the DDA has been the sole developer providing for the city’s growing housing demand.The new provisions in the plan encourages mixed use development, proposed in the MPD-2021. But resident welfare associations in the city are opposing it saying that it has “destroyed the residential character of neighbourhoods”.For the first time, the Master Plan takes into account the housing needs of the migrant workers. The plan has provision for affordable rental housing, especially near industrial areas and commercial hubs.It also proposes that local bodies and the tourism department identify nightlife circuits (NCs) and permit extended timings for socio-cultural activities. The plan proposes a shift from manufacturing to clean industries such as knowledge and cyber, and a push to foster a “Night-Time Economy”.Apart from the plan, the DDA came out with policies to regulate parking in new buildings, development in the city’s green belts and redevelopment of unauthorised colonies.But its implementation, urban planning experts say, are fraught with challenges.Shamsher Singh, former chief town planner of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi, said, “The biggest hurdle in the implementation of the Master Plan has been multiplicity of authority in the capital. A lot of schemes or policies such as special area redevelopment plans could be implemented due to this reason. There is a need for a good monitoring mechanism.”Housing schemeFor the first time in 2021, the DDA came up with two housing schemes in the same year. In January, the land-owning agency came out with a housing scheme with 1,354 flats, mainly for high and middle income groups. The HIG flats were priced at ₹2.14 crore. With a large number of flats returned by allottees of past housing schemes, the DDA recently announced a new housing scheme to dispose of 18,000-plus flats in several areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2021-the-year-when-vision-of-a-24-hr-future-ready-delhi-took-root-101640716021578.html
28-12-2021||Lucknow||UP’s actual budget size may shrink to less than ₹5 lakh crore||LUCKNOW The Uttar Pradesh government may have claimed that the estimated size of its annual budget may reach ₹6 lakh crore in 2021-2022, but its own revised estimates for the year speak otherwise.It presented an annual budget of ₹5.50 lakh crore and subsequent first and second supplementary budgets ₹7,301.52 crore and ₹8,479.53 crore, respectively in 2021-2022. The revised estimates of receipts and expenditure for the year portray a different picture with indications that the actual budget size may shrink to less than ₹5 lakh crore following adverse impact of Covid-19 on the state’s economy.Though a consistent increase has been witnessed in the state government’s receipts in recent months, targets for revenue collection in the first six months of 2021-2022 have not been met. The total receipts have remained 73.9% of the target for the first six months and 35.5% of the annual target for the year. A close scrutiny of the state government’s own analysis indicated estimated receipts of ₹5,06,181.84 crore in the annual budget for 2021-2022. This included revenue receipts of ₹418340.44 crore and capital receipts of ₹87841.40 crore. Revised estimates indicate the state government’s total receipts to be about ₹469232.86 crore, including revenue receipts of about ₹377946.46 crore and capital receipts of ₹91286.40 crore. A shortfall of ₹40,393.98 crore in revenue receipts and an increase of ₹3445.00 crore in capital receipts in revised estimates pose a serious challenge. The shortfall includes a deficiency of ₹4501.11 crore in state’s share in central taxes and ₹25995.22 crore in the state’s own taxes. “The actual estimates of expenditure have, in general, fallen short of budget estimates. But in recent years, the shortfall appears to have widened. For example, in 2020-21 the actual expenditure of ₹378710.67crore was about 26% less than its budget estimate of ₹512860.72 crore. The more worrisome is the fact that total actual expenditure has contracted between 2018-19 and 2020-21.The total actual expenditure was ₹391210.61 crore in 2018-19 that declined to ₹383351.69 in 2019-20 and further to ₹378710.67 crore in 2020-21. This decline in public expenditure is not a good thing as public expenditure, including capital expenditure, has a high multiplier effect in boosting aggregate demand besides augmenting productive capacity,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of department, economics, Lucknow University. “The current financial year (2021-22), being an election year, may turn out to be slightly better in terms of meeting the expenditure target but would substantially miss the budgeted amount. There is a need to prepare budget estimates on a more realistic and rational basis. Further, the procedures for sanction and release of grants to various departments should be streamlined and improved upon for timely execution of expenditure programmes as outlined in the budget,” said Tyagi. In its recent reports, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India too has pointed towards gaps in budgetary estimates and actual receipts and expenditure and suggested that the state government revisits its budgetary methods. “The finance department should revisit their budgeting methods to make the budget estimates more realistic,” observed the CAG in its recommendation in the report on revenue sector for the year ending March 31, 2019 and tabled in the state assembly on August 18, 2021. The CAG, in its report on State Finances (for the year ended on March 31, 2020) tabled in the state assembly on December 17, 2021, further observed “Supplementary provisions and re-appropriations should be based on careful assessment and fund requirements. The finance department may advise line departments to improve accuracy in cost estimation of schemes/projects at the time of submitting revised estimates in order to optimize utilization of funds.” As per estimates presented in the interim budget for 2022-2023, the state government’s estimated receipts will be ₹544836.56 crore. This includes estimated receipts of ₹453097.56 crore in revenue account and ₹91739.00 in capital account. This shows an estimated increase of ₹74818.76 crore in revenue receipts. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, speaking on the second supplementary budget for 2021-2022, presented in the state assembly on December 16, 2021, had said: “When we came here (state assembly) to present our first budget, Uttar Pradesh had a population of 220 million. It’s a state with 250 million population now. We said for a state with 250 million population a budget of ₹2.5 lakh crore or ₹3 lakh crore will not do. The size of our budget should go up and we should mobilise resources of income.” “Our revenue should be matching. We increased our revenue and the size of state budget. When our government is presenting its last supplementary budget it (size) is about 6 lakh crore. This is ₹6 lakh crore despite adverse impact of Covid-19 on the state’s economy. The state’s economy, which was the 6th largest in the country, is now number 2. We have been successful in doubling UP’s per capita income. Had previous governments worked at the same pace, UP would have been playing a lead role, not as number 2, but as number 1 economy,” he said. 
28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s restaurant, movie hall owners say Covid curbs may be a body blow||Restaurants and cinema halls are staring at massive losses on account of the fresh restrictions issued by the Delhi government to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the city, with owners of these establishments saying that they were still picking up the pieces after the closure of their businesses during the fourth wave earlier this year.Also Read | Capital sounds ‘yellow alert’, adds more curbsUnder the ‘Yellow Alert’ of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to tackle Covid-19, the Delhi government has directed restaurants to function at 50% seating capacity, and restricted their operation time from 8am to 10pm. Bars too are allowed to operate at 50% seating capacity, but from 12 noon to 10pm. Cinema halls and multiplexes have been directed to shut down under the fresh crubs.Noting that the theatre business had restarted only last month, with the release of Sooryavanshi, and now with Spider-Man: No Way Home, which are among the few big-ticket films to release since the start of the pandemic, cinema hall owners said that the closure of theatres dashed their hopes of a long-awaited revival and recovery.“A number of big-ticket films were lined up for release in the coming months. Due to the sudden closure, there will be a huge loss of business for cinemas. We had resumed services in August but business started only in November after the release of Sooryavanshi,” said Janmayjai Verma, manager, Delite Cinema.Also Read | Delhi’s daily tally climbs to 496, positivity rate heads towards 1%In a written statement on Tuesday, Kamal Gainchandani, president of the Multiplex Association of India, said that the Delhi government’s decision has caused massive uncertainty and can lead to irreparable damage for the film industry. “While we fully understand the need on the government’s part to take necessary preventive measures, we would request that cinemas should get equal treatment with comparable industries and institutions. Instead of closing cinemas, we would urge the Delhi government to consider introducing ‘double vaccination requirement’ to enter cinemas, as is the case in some of the other states (including Maharashtra). Alternatively, the seating capacity restriction of 50% can be reintroduced at cinemas,” said Gainchandani.Meanwhile, restaurant owners said curtailment of timings will cause a huge dent in earnings.SN Kaushal, senior manager of Kwality restaurant, Regal Building in Connaught Place, said the restrictions would require outlets to wrap up services by 9pm — a crucial period for sales.Also Read | Delhi under strict Covid curbs as yellow alert kicks in: Full list“Around 40% of the business usually takes place after 9pm, this will be lost. We will have to close early so that the staff can reach home before the night curfew kicks in,” said Kaushal. He said that while the restaurant had recovered around 80% of the business, fresh curbs could set back recovery once again.“We will have to wait and see how the situation pans out after January. If the situation continues to be abysmal, we will be compelled to take tough decisions. The morale of the staff is down because losses will have a direct impact on employment,” said Kaushal.A staff member at restaurant-cum-bar Pebble Street, at New Friends Colony (NFC), said the fresh curbs had come during the holiday season. “The impact on business will be huge. Since more people usually tend to visit our outlet in the evening, we will lose out on crucial earnings during peak business hours,” said the staff member, who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-restaurant-movie-hall-owners-say-covid-curbs-may-be-a-body-blow-101640715781800.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||As fresh curbs set in, expect long queues outside Delhi Metro stations||New Delhi: Long queues are likely to return outside Metro stations with the Delhi government directing Delhi Metro to restrict passengers to 50% of seating capacity and not allow standing commuters in its trains, said officials.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) started restricting passenger movement at stations on Tuesday evening itself, a few hours after the government sounded the ‘Yellow Alert’ under the first phase of Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the Capital.Also Read | Capital sounds ‘yellow alert’, adds more curbsAnuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “To ensure compliance with the guidelines, entry to Metro stations will be regulated by restricting the number of open gates.”Officials said that there will be no change in the schedule of trains. “Around 50% of the gates will remain open at Metro stations. Of 712 gates across all Metro stations, 444 will be kept open as of now. We have our teams to check strict enforcement of the order,” said a DMRC official.Also Read | Delhi Covid-19 curbs: New Metro guidelines commuters must knowDMRC also urged people to restrict travel only for essential activities. “In view of the restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, entry through some of the gates will be regulated. Passengers are therefore requested to travel only if absolutely essential and keep some additional time for their travel,” it tweeted on Tuesday.Transport expert Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at School of Planning and Architecture, agreed with entry restrictions, but said that the authorities should increase the frequency of trains and buses. “We have seen the public transport users suffer the most due to these unavoidable restrictions. To ensure that people continue to use public transport and don’t switch to personal vehicles, the DMRC should also increase the capacity of trains by adding more coaches and the Delhi government should increase the number of buses.”Meanwhile, residents fear their daily commute will become even more difficult.Also Read | Delhi’s daily tally climbs to 496, positivity rate heads towards 1%Sudhin, a resident of Delhi who travels to Gurugram for work regularly, said, “We will be back to standing in long queues and waiting for hours outside the stations. I might either opt for work from home or start using my personal vehicle for daily commute.”Delhi Metro operations were shut in March last year during the lockdown, and was resumed at 50% capacity in September. In July this year, 100% seating for passengers was allowed and in November, standing passengers too were permitted in trains.Delhi Metro has incurred huge operational losses due to the restrictions, and the DMRC has already written to the state government and the Centre for financial assistance to make up for the losses incurred due to the restriction on travel.Restrictions to affect tradersMeanwhile, traders in the city feel the new restrictions on travel and markets (shops have been directed to open on an odd-even basis) will impact their businesses. “It will become difficult for our staff to report at work on time. The odd-even rule for shops in markets will have a huge impact on the footfall in the market and our business, which had picked up recently,” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association in Connaught Place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-fresh-curbs-set-in-expect-long-queues-outside-delhi-metro-stations-101640715721604.html

28-12-2021||Delhi||Expect colder, foggier days from Wednesday, says IMD||Parts of Delhi witnessed light showers on Tuesday with overcast conditions prevailing throughout the day, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials saying it was the last rain spell of the year and predicted colder and foggy days from Wednesday. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 18 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal, at Safdarjung station that is considered the representative data for the city. The minimum temperature stayed at 9.4 degrees Celsius -- two degrees above normal. At Lodhi Road and Ayanagar weather stations, the maximum temperature was recorded at 16.4 degrees, IMD data showed. Safdarjung received 3.6mm of rainfall between 8:30am and 5:30pm on Tuesday, and 4.4mm rain was recorded at Lodhi Road. Palam, Ayanagar and Ridge stations also received light very rain on Tuesday, recording 1, 0.6, 1 and 0.5mm rainfall respectively during the same period. On Sunday, Delhi recorded 3.4mm rainfall.IMD scientist RK Jenamani said following the latest spell of rain, the intensity of fog is expected to go up in the region. Delhi is yet to record a dense fog spell this winter. “Shallow to moderate fog is now expected for the next few days with a slight chance of dense fog near New Year’s day. Temperatures will also start to dip, but it is not expected to be a sharp drop,” he said. The IMD has forecast a minimum temperature of around 8 degrees on Wednesday, and 7 degrees Thursday onwards.As a haze hung over the city, visibility dropped to 1,000 metres at both Palam and Safdarjung during the day, the IMD said. On a normal, clear day the visibility is 3,000 metres. The lowest maximum temperature recorded this season for so far was 17.8 degrees Celsius, recorded on December 18. This was also Delhi’s only ‘cold day’, with the maximum 5 dropping degrees below normal.

Despite rain, Delhi’s air quality dropped to being ‘very poor’, with the city recording an air quality index (AQI) of 305, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin. The city recorded an AQI of 283 (poor) on Monday. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a forecasting body under the Centre, said an improvement in AQI is likely in the next 48 hours before wind speed is expected to drop again from December 30. “On December 30, 31 and January 1, wind speed will be low and ventilation poor. This will lead to a deterioration in air quality once again,” said Gufran Beig, project director and founder at Safar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/expect-colder-foggier-days-from-wednesday-says-imd-101640715541604.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Pandemic, air pollution kept Delhi schools on edge, students at bay in 2021||With the Delhi government announcing the closure of schools as part of curbs on account of rising Covid cases, schools in the Capital have been thrust into uncertainty once again. Schools have been shut four times since April this year – twice owing to concerns over Covid-19, and twice because of hazardous pollution levels.Educators and experts say the prolonged and repeated closures have affected teaching and learning for another year in a row, and adversely impacted the mental development of children, who need peer-to-peer interaction for all-round development.Also Read | Delhi schools to be closed after ‘Yellow Alert’ curbs imposedAlthough online classes continued when schools were shut, many students were deprived of learning due to issues ranging from affordability to accessibility, bringing to fore the digital divide in city schools.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said though schools were able to leverage technology for better outreach among parents and students, the need for regular in-person classes was still evident. “There was a lot of uncertainty throughout the year. We couldn’t plan anything properly due to frequent closures. However, on days when children were back in school, the school was lively as before. But the happiness was short-lived every time since we were asked to close soon after we reopened,” said Acharya.She said that frequent closures and the on-off nature of in-person classes played havoc on the mental health of children who were anxious and uncertain about the future. “The physical and mental well-being of children has been affected since the pandemic began. While we provide counselling, one cannot dispute the fact that online classes can never be a replacement for in-person interactions,” said Acharya, who is also the principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.Also Read | Delhi govt readying jabs plan for children aged 15-18 in the citySchools were first shut in March last year when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. It reopened for classes 10 and 12 for practical work and board preparation in January 2021 and classes 9 and 11 in February. However, barely two months later, schools were once again asked to shut down on April 9 amid another Covid spike. On September 1, schools reopened for students in classes 9-12 and in-person classes were resumed for students of all grades on November 1.Subsequently, in a series of closures on account of hazardous pollution levels, schools closed on November 13, reopened on November 29, and against shut down on December 2. The Directorate of Education (DoE) allowed schools to restart in-person classes for classes 6 and above from December 18 after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) allowed schools to reopen. The Directorate of Education (DoE) issued an order on Tuesday shutting down schools “till further orders”.Administrators pointed out that while Covid concerns were valid, closing schools is not the solution to Delhi’s pollution problem. They urged the government to hold dialogues with stakeholders to come up with a sustainable solution.“For the last 4-5 years, we have seen the prevalence of peak pollution levels between November and January. It’s a recurring problem but there is no solution in sight. It’s not sustainable to close schools on and off in line with the AQI levels,” said Acharya.Noting that people continued to venture out for other chores even as schools were closed on account of various reasons throughout the year, Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said the uncertainty around closure and resumption of schools was adversely impacting children, especially younger ones, who needed social and emotional interactions with peers. “Parents keep asking us about the way forward every time schools are asked to shut down. We can’t do much except wait and watch. The uncertainty affects everyone from children to teachers. Children are not interacting the way they did earlier. Students who used to be interactive earlier are now unsure and not confident in online classes. They would have responded differently had they got the chance to study in school along with their peers in the school environment,” said Joshi.Experts also raised concerns over the lack of peer-to-peer interaction among children and advocate for innovative ways of tackling the challenges that the pandemic has brought forth.Anubha Rajesh, chair professor at Jamia Millia Islamia’s Centre for Early Childhood Development and Research, said that since the pandemic was likely to go on for a few years, it was necessary to strike a balance between online and offline teaching.“Online teaching is not the solution but only an alternative in the prevailing situation. We have to focus on online capacity building of teachers as well as sustain peer interaction among students. We need to build small groups between students for the improvement of their psychological and social well-being through sustained engagement so that they have support. However, once the situation improves, the offline mode of learning is the best,” said Rajesh.Most students said they were eagerly waiting for schools to reopen even as parents said that the concerns surrounding pollution and Covid-19 are hard to ignore.Mohammad Adil (16), a Class 11 student at School of Specialised Excellence in Kalkaji, said, “Online classes cannot replace the classroom experience. Even though we have online doubt clearing sessions, it’s much easier to understand the concepts when we are in school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pandemic-air-pollution-kept-delhi-schools-on-edge-students-at-bay-in-2021-101640715363693.html
28-12-2021||Mumbai||Winter session ends with 54 Covid positives||Mumbai Covid marred the Maharashtra legislature’s winter session with at least 54 people, including two ministers, legislature staffers, police personnel, and journalists covering the proceedings testing positive since last Saturday. The five-day session ended on Monday with school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, tribal development minister KC Padavi and Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Sameer Meghe, among 51 others testing positive. “I learned today (Tuesday) that I tested positive for Covid-19 after getting symptoms yesterday (Monday) evening. My symptoms are relatively mild. I am fine and have isolated myself. Request those who met me over the past few days to take precautions,” Gaikwad tweeted. This is the second time Varsha Gaikwad tested positive, with the first time being on September 2020.Significantly, the legislature secretariate made it mandatory for all participating in the session to get tested for Covid twice during the five-day-long session--first before the beginning of the session and second after three days. The results rattled the people taking part in the proceedings as thousands tend to come to the legislature for various work.Over 2,300 people were tested at a camp set up for those attending or covering the session over the weekend. The winter session is due to end on Tuesday. It was curtailed to five days in view of a surge in the Covid cases. The number of active cases crossed the 10,000-mark on Monday after dropping to 6,200 three weeks earlier. The government has also imposed a night curfew across Maharashtra to control the surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/winter-session-ends-with-54-covid-positives-101640715244231.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Protest in Delhi: Doctors demand apology, fixed date for counselling||The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) on Tuesday proposed three demands to end their strike -- a confirmed date for NEET PG counselling after the Supreme Court hearing on January 6, an apology from authorities and withdrawal of FIRs against protesting doctors.Also Read | NEET PG protest: Kejriwal writes to PM, condemns police action on doctorsThe doctors who are protesting the delay in NEET PG counselling announced a complete shutdown of health care facilities on Monday after hundreds of doctors taking out a protest march near central Delhi’s ITO were allegedly thrashed and dragged on the road by police personnel. The police, however, maintained that only minimal force was used to prevent protesters from moving towards the Supreme Court, and added that all those detained were released the same day. “Firstly, we want the concerned authorities to ensure that we should get a date for counselling right after the Supreme Court’s hearing on January 6 concludes. Secondly, we want an apology from the authorities as the police manhandled the doctors. Thirdly, we want the withdrawal of FIRs registered against protestors,” said Dr Manish, president, FORDA, at a press conference.Also Read | Resident doctors' stir: Delhi Police says no force used, protesters seek apologyThe NEET PG counselling has repeatedly been delayed due to a bunch of cases in the Supreme Court looking at the economic reservation. The resident doctors associated with medical colleges have been protesting against the delay for over a month now, and have withdrawn from even emergency services since the past 11 days.Resident doctors of several hospitals staged a march near Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Monday evening in protest against the delay, and then staged a sit-in at the Sarojini Nagar police station where hundreds of others joined them.The doctors also protested within the hospital premises on Tuesday evening even as police personnel were deployed there to ensure law and order.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, met a delegation of the striking resident doctors on Tuesday.Also Read | Mandaviya says NEET-PG counselling sub judice, urges resident doctors to lift protest“I held a meeting with all resident doctors.

Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Congress and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) demanded removal of state government officers who were allegedly working on the directions of the ruling of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The opposition parties also sought strict imposition of model code of conduct after the announcement of the poll schedule, check on misuse of government machinery by the BJP and adequate deployment of central paramilitary forces during polling.

After the meeting with the poll panel, SP state unit president Naresh Uttam Patel said: “The SP urged the ECI to hold assembly polls as per schedule with strict implementation of Covid appropriate behaviour to check surge of Covid cases. The ECI should clear doubts over the assembly election with the announcement of the poll schedule.” BJP state unit vice-president JPS Rathore said the assembly election should be held as per schedule, but the final decision rests with the ECI. “The BJP told the poll panel that in view of the possible third wave adequate arrangements should be made at the polling stations,” he said. BSP national general secretary Mewa Lal Gautam said in view of the Covid pandemic, the ECI should restrict rallies and road shows organised by the parties across the state.

28-12-2021||Mumbai||Bike stealing YouTube hacks land four in jail||Mumbai Four 20-year-olds landed behind the bars after they used YouTube to learn tricks on how to unlock and steal two-wheelers.Dindoshi police received numerous complaints of motorcycles being stolen in and around the western suburbs. The ploy of the young men was unearthed after a friend tipped off the police saying that the men were seen riding different motorcycles to college almost every day to impress girls. The four accused have been identified as Sandeep Gaikwad (20), Ganesh Chavan (20), Yogesh Sakare (19) and Mahesh Swami (22), all students pursuing a commerce course in a suburban college. The Dindoshi police officers said that the boys learnt how to start two-wheelers without a key from YouTube videos and practiced on the bikes of their parents and neighbours before stealing their first one. In April 2021, Swami and the others robbed the first two-wheeler which was parked outside a restaurant in Malad west. Since then, they would tell their parents that they are meeting to study together at night but then would steal bikes parked in non-crowded areas. They would take the bikes to their college to impress girls. “Whenever they would come near a check post, they would get down the bikes and pretend to push it, as if taking it to a garage. The boys used to then change the number plate of the vehicle and abandon it as soon as the fuel tanks got empty,” said PSI Dr Chandrakant Gharge, investigating officer of the case.“This kind of activities by youth may be an outcome of youth subculture engaging in acts of rebellion against the mainstream norms and values or is an attempt to attain economic success in the absence of institutional means like access to a decent education. By coming together and engaging in such acts, they are able to gain legitimacy and status within the in-group members and in the process assert their youthhood, vis a vis their peers in the community,” said Dr Vijay Raghavan, criminology expert from Tata Institute of Social Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bike-stealing-youtube-hacks-land-four-in-jail-101640715003755.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi East civic body alleges govt still owes dues worth ₹500 crore||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday said the Delhi government still owes the civic body around ₹500 crore in funds. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, said that in the financial year 2020-21, the corporation had a balance of ₹300 crore till April 2021. “Till December 27, the corporation has got ₹1286.28 crore as revenue. In total, ₹1586.28 crore was with the corporation, out of which we spent ₹1494.76 crore on salary and other items. Out of total ₹1286.28 crore, the Delhi government has so far given only ₹780.43 crore under the salary and plan scheme. Due to non-payment of other dues of the EDMC by the Delhi government, the EDMC is facing acute financial crisis,” he said. Reacting sharply to recent allegations made by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders that Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) councillors are illegally collecting money from their respective wards, which should be deposited in the form of tax, he said that BJP councillors are collecting more revenue in form of property taxes, trade license fees, conversion charges and parking fees, compared to their AAP counterparts. “If we are the better performers, how can they accuse us of these things? The fact is that BJP councillors are very active in their wards,” he said. When contacted, AAP councillor and leader of opposition in the EDMC, Manoj Tyagi, said that BJP councillors have no other job than to use “unparliamentary” words against women councillors and accuse the AAP for all their failures. “It’s a joke to say that generating more revenue means no corruption is going on. If their councillors are generating more revenue, how can then they prove that they are honest? If they accuse Delhi government for not clearing their dues, the BJP-ruled EDMC should give the details of those dues, not of their income and expenditure. To best of my knowledge, the Delhi government doesn’t owe any dues to EDMC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-east-civic-body-alleges-govt-still-owes-dues-worth-500-crore-101640714523538.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt plans to phase out single-use plastic in 2022||New Delhi: The Delhi government plans to phase out single-use plastic such as bags, cutlery , films, banners, wrappers in three phases next year, beginning with thermocol and plastic sticks used with balloons, flags and candy, according to its draft alternatives to single-use plastic policy.According to the policy, the first phase was to be implemented in January 1. However, that seems unlikely since the policy is yet to be approved by the Cabinet. The second phase, planned from July, 2022, is aimed at phasing out plastic cutlery (cups, plates, knives, forks and glasses), plastic wrapping and packing films, invitation cards, cigarette packets, plastic stirrers and banners that are less than 100 microns in thickness, the plan shows.In phase three, according to the policy, non-woven bags below 240 microns in thickness will be banned from September 30, 2022 onwards.Senior environment department officials involved in framing the policy said the document will be shared with all government departments “within the next fortnight” for suggestions and comments before being tabled in the cabinet meeting.“Suggestions and feedback will be collected from each department, and after updating the plan, we will table it before the cabinet. The financial outlay for the plan to phase out plastic items will be calculated once the policy is finalised,” said an environment official who asked not to be named. He added that the policy focuses on creating awareness on the harmful impact of single-use plastic on the environment, and not penalise offenders straight away.The official said the draft policy is also open for public feedback and suggestions, both for alternatives available and the mechanism through which these single-use plastic items could be recycled or utilised. Residents can e-mail their suggestions to the environment department on senv@nic.in, the department says. However, the policy draft has not been shared in the public domain.The policy has suggested paper bags, cloth bags, jute bags and reusable cotton bags to replace plastic bags, bamboo sticks in place of plastic stirrers, recycled cardboard and paper boxes for cigarette packs, cellulose nanofibre as wrapping sheets and cutlery made of bagasse, cardboard, paper or bamboo.The draft plan also suggests promoting local initiatives while looking at measures such as plogging (jogging and picking up litter).According to experts, most single-use plastic items cannot be recycled, and they find their way to landfill sites, or end up clogging up drains. They pollute the air if incinerated and can break down into millions of tiny pieces over time known as microplastics which contaminate soil and water.“A group of individuals stopped the use of plastic bags in certain weekly vegetable markets in Delhi NCR. The group worked with more than 800 vendors and created a model of India’s first plastic-free weekly vegetable market. Another instance is of a private university in Odisha where Saal leaves are used in official meetings/ workshops/seminars to reduce single use plastic footprint. Such initiatives have to be bolstered and promoted to encourage citizens to adopt alternatives to SUP. Plogging is a similar example wherein citizens pick up litter while jogging. It was kick-started as a citizen-led initiative and is adopted by various local groups in India,” says the plan.The Centre notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, on August 12 this year, which made it mandatory for the thickness of plastic bags of 50 microns to be increased to 75 microns from September 30, 2021 onwards, and later to 120 microns from December 31, 2022. In addition, the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of 20 single-use plastic items will all be banned from July 1, 2022, according to the rules.Siddharth Ghanshyam Singh, deputy programme manager, solid waste management unit at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says prior to the notification of the plastic waste management rules, some sort of a partial or complete ban on plastic existed in 32 out of the 35 states and union territories, but enforcement remained a major challenge.“We have had policies earlier too, but we need to ensure strict enforcement of the ban. Urban local bodies and people on the ground such as street vendors need to be made key stakeholders in the process and alternatives need to not only be identified, but also provided to these stakeholders as a viable option,” Singh said.According to a review meeting by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on December 1, 2021, 3,766 show-cause notices have been issued to plastic recyclers, manufacturers and producers in Delhi for not adhering to the plastic waste management rules, 2021.Manoj Pundir, who manufactures thermocol under the brand name of Nirvayan Polymers Pvt Ltd in Shahzada Bagh, says thermocol that is used in decorations has been banned, but it is still allowed in packaging. “Most manufacturers are not likely to be affected at the moment as the thermocol being manufactured for decoration purposes only forms a 10-20% chunk of the industry. Most manufacturers are making it for packaging goods,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-plans-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-in-2022-101640714401920.html

DUSIB officials said that this time, 250 tents will be put up across the city to house homeless people.Also Read | Delhi’s daily tally climbs to 496, positivity rate heads towards 1%DUSIB member Bipin Rai said, “Earlier, we used to put 70-100 tents during winter. But this time, we have decided to put up 250 tents, of which over 190 are already operational. Due to the pandemic, we have to ensure social distancing inside the temporary shelters. We are also providing cots in all the shelters.”Last month, the state-level monitoring committee, which was constituted following a Supreme Court order, held a meeting with DUSIB officials in which the agency was asked to prepare a winter action plan.Indu Prakash, a member of the committee, said, “While there are permanent shelter homes being run by the government, we asked them to set up more tents this time. We will review the status in the meeting on January 12.”Rai said that apart from places to stay, people are being provided meals at the shelters, as per the Delhi government’s plan. “If need be, we will increase the number of temporary shelters,” said Rai.The DUSIB has 211 shelter homes in various parts of the city. During the winter season, the board sets up temporary shelters depending on the requirement. According to DUSIB officials, the board puts up 50-60 additional tents on an average annually during the winter season.Last year, the board set up close to 130 tents during the winter.According to DUSIB’s website, as of December 27, arrangements have been made at 295 locations across the city. This includes buildings, portacabins, temporary buildings and tents. A senior DUSIB official said that at 89 locations, close to 200 tents have been set up. He added approximately 8,000 people used the facility on December 27.Sunil Kumar Aledia, executive director of the Centre for Holistic Development, an advocacy group that works with homeless and migrant workers in the city, said, “The number of tents put up so far is inadequate. We have asked DUSIB to increase the number and also improve the facilities at the shelters.”According to DUSIB officials, nearly 18,000 people can be accommodated in the existing night shelters. “But on average, only 11,000-12,000 people use our facilities. Due to social distancing, we are making arrangements for just 10 beds in a tent,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiamid-spike-in-covid-cases-dusib-to-set-up-250-tents-for-homeless-101640714109329.html

As per the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) there has been an increase in registrations of CNG, electric vehicles this year. Compared to CNG vehicles registered in this year, still the electric vehicles are half of the registrations. While there has been a steady increase over the months since January 2021.As per the data statistics given by the Pune RTO, in this year a total of 10,301 CNG cars were registered between January to December 26, 2021. While between the same period a total of 360 electric cars were registered. Interestingly 5,304 electric bikes were registered in the same period, as there is growing demand for it.“There is a steady increase in the electric cars and bike sale this year, due to which registration has also gone up. Still there was more demand to CNG cars than the electric cars, as there are few electric options in the market and affordability is a major hurdle for EV ownership in India. But in near future there will be more electric vehicle registrations done in the Pune region,” said Sanjay Sasane, deputy regional transport officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/costlier-fuel-drives-buyers-towards-cng-electric-vehicles-101640713862125.html

At the same time, small investors who purchased properties, which couldn’t be constructed, have expressed hope for completing the project. Minoo Wadia, president Apex Association of Lavasa Property Owners, said,“We are happy that some development has taken place after ten years. During the past several years, there was neither any progress nor development wherein the essential services like roads, water, lights have been hit hard . There was a shortage of funds and it was through courts we brought pressure on the management to deliver. We have given our suggestions to the new company and they are prepared to follow our recommendations. Currently they have to get environmental clearances for carrying out further work.” The DPIL won the ₹1,864 crore bid to acquire Lavasa Corporation through the insolvency process which was approved by the debt-ridden firm’s lenders.  Ajay Harinath Singh, group chairman, Darwin Platform Group of Companies (DPGC) said, “We have an ambitious and long term plan for Lavasa Smart City. DPIL has capabilities and resources to meet the expectations of the COC. DPIL is committed to executing the plan as per the schedule proposed to COC.”Hill station resident Suresh Goswami welcomed the decision saying, “Resolution was much needed as the previous management had messed up the project. The bankers lost their money in the project and citizens did not get the possession of their booked properties as construction was incomplete.There are 1,400 such properties of citizens who are awaiting possession.” According to Vineet Tulsyan of R3 Corporate Advisors who advised and guided Darwin Group in the bid, homebuyers have been the biggest sufferers here besides the secured financial creditors. “We will understand their concerns and involve them in the process of revival.

28-12-2021||Pune||Fifth case in recruitment exam malpractice nexus by Pune police; two agents arrested||PUNE A new, fifth case has been registered in the series of paper leak and exam result manipulation incidents investigated by the Pune police cyber crime cell. Two men who are suspected to be agents who got the Group C question paper from employees Nyasa communications company have been arrested by the Pune police. Now, the number of arrests in the series of cases has reached 28 and recovery of valuables worth around ₹6 crore has been made from the accused. The duo has been identified as Nishid Gaikwad, 43, a resident of Ambazari road in Nashik and a native of Shegaon-Rahatgaon road area of Amaravati and Rahul Dhanraj Linghate, 35, a resident of Shegaon-Rahatgaon road in Amravati. While Gaikwad is a farmer by profession, Linghate is a trader. “We are going after the agents in this case. During investigation of Group D exam (held on October 24) paper leak, we found new information that the Group C (October 31) paper was also leaked. So, we have registered a new offence in the case. Nyasa Communication employees leaked the paper and gave it to agents. The department officials are already in custody,” said Amitabh Gupta, Pune police commissioner. “The group C case was registered yesterday (Monday). It has a lot of exams in it. The agents got the paper from where it was printed,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, Pune. “The modus operandi maybe different but wrong method of accessing the paper was used. For each paper per candidate, the charge was ₹5-8 lakh and some 500-600 such candidates of Group C are there,” said Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, cyber crime and economic offences wing (EOW) of Pune police. The police are tracking at least three groups of agents - Harkal brothers at the helm, Sanap at the helm, and Gaikwad and Linghate. Whether these chains are interlinked or operate separately is part of investigation. In the first case, all the 18 people arrested were remanded to judicial custody and at least seven of them have applied for bail. In the MHADA case, three people are under arrest including the president of GA Software which is another company related to the nexus. In the case of manipulation of Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) 2019-2020, two people including the former commissioner of Maharashtra state council of examination (MSCE) has been arrested. In the fourth case, the former MSCE commissioner and a former employee of GA Software has been arrested. Nysa Communication, which is the company that has now landed on the police radar, has had operations in multiple states and also faced action for malpractices. Nysa Communications was served with a showcause notice threatening debarment by the Punjab government from participating in a tender process in 2015-2016 by allegedly furnishing false documents. The secretary, Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Service Selection Commission, Lucknow had also blacklisted Nysa Communication in 2019. In case of debarment in Punjab, the High Court of Punjab-Haryana had given time to the company to furnish required documents and asked the government to consider the documents, if submitted on time. In case of blacklisting in Lucknow, the secretary who issued the order of blacklisting had allegedly tendered an apology for doing so and the company was granted another chance of participating in hearing for why they should not be blacklisted. While no arrests have been made from Nysa communication company, the police have named them as participants in the wrongdoing. Health department exam case The nexus was exposed when some students started raising their voice against malpractices in the health department group C and group D examination. The cyber crime cell took up their complaints and started investigating into their allegations and found a chain of information leakage. The first case was registered and a total of 18 people were arrested in it. The police custody of first 17 has ended. However, the 18th arrest of Sanjay Sanap from Beed was made on Monday and remanded to police custody till December 23. The case was registered on November 26. Of the 17 people who have now been remanded to judicial custody, Mahesh Botle, joint director (non-technical) of national health mission, Mumbai. MHADA paper leak case The arrested agents in the health department case led the police to documents which showed similar leak in the examination of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) to be conducted on December 12, Sunday. The exam was cancelled and police found GA Software director Pritish Deshmukh with the Harkal brothers in a car with various computer devices. A state cabinet minister, Jitendra Awhad, took to Twitter one night before the exam was to be conducted to announce the cancellation. Documents like optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets seized from their mobile phone, pen drive, and laptops led the police to believe that there were malpractices in the TET examination. Based on the information provided by the accused during the interrogation, police registered a third case in which the current commissioner of MSCE was arrested. During his interrogation, the police learned that the practice of manipulating OMR sheets was not novel for Supe-led MSCE. This led the police to register a fourth case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fifth-case-in-recruitment-exam-malpractice-nexus-by-pune-police-two-agents-arrested-101640713321146.html

From there it was smuggled to other countries, including China, Malaysia and Hong Kong via Bangladesh and Myanmar.The official said there is a huge demand for calipee in Bangladesh and in some other countries as both flesh, calipee is used for different purposes. He said the calipee is used to make aphrodisiac medicines.He explained that as many as 29 species of turtles are found in India and out of which 15 species are found in Uttar Pradesh. He said both types of turtles —hard shell and soft shell— are found in wetlands along different rivers, including Ganga, Gomti, Ghagra, Gandak and its tributaries as well as canals and ponds in districts like Etawah, Etah, Mainpuri, Auraiya, Farrukhabad etc.The official said the smugglers’ local links capture turtles and later sell them to their local associates, who further hands the turtle calipee over to their associates in West Bengal. From there it is smuggled abroad through Bangladesh and Myanmar.He said in such a long chain of the racket, it’s very difficult to reach the kingpin behind the entire operation.

28-12-2021||Lucknow||MNNIT to start inter-disciplinary BTech course from 2022-23||State’s lone NIT—Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad—is gearing up start a new course in BTech (engineering and computational mechanics) from next academic session. This course will be started under the new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 under which a student would be able to earn a BTech degree in three years and drop out or complete the full course and earn a “BTech with Research” degree in four years, say MNNIT officials. MNNIT Senate—the top decision-making body of the institute for all academic affairs—has in principle approved the course and a dedicated committee of senior faculty members has been set up to look into all its aspects, they add. “The syllabus has already been designed. The course would start at the applied mechanics department from academic session 2022-23 with a total of 30 seats. Our applied mechanics department presently offers just PG courses,” said MNNIT director prof Rajeev Tripathi. After the Senate’s in-principle approval to the course, the proposal would soon also be put before the Board of Governors, the apex decision-making body of the institute, after the panel set up for it submits its report and then the Union ministry of education would be duly apprised. After their go ahead, admissions would be taken, he added. MNNIT director said the institute will be the first among all 31 nation institutes of technology (NITs) of India to have UG course in engineering and computational mechanics. He said over the years, most of the undergraduate engineering programmes had become broad-based and had not been able to address the emerging inter-disciplinary areas. “The emphasis will be on providing a strong grounding in fundamentals of engineering mechanics along with tools needed to address the needs of emerging areas such as biomechanics, nano-mechanics, constitutive modelling at multiple length and time scales, parallel processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence in mechanics etc,” said prof Tripathi. “The primary goal will be to cultivate in the young minds the art and science of engineering mechanics to analyse complex interdisciplinary phenomena relevant to problems in industry and cutting-edge research through experimentation, analysis and computation. A strong grounding in engineering fundamentals will enable students to appreciate emerging trends and equip them with the tools to spearhead new areas of research,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mnnit-to-start-inter-disciplinary-btech-course-from-202223-101640712421459.html

28-12-2021||Lucknow||Security of district courts: Biometric smart card system to be introduced in Lucknow, Azamgarh||The state government will soon introduce biometric based smart card system for entry of lawyers in district courts. The move is aimed at ensuring security of district courts across Uttar Pradesh (UP). The pilot project will be introduced in district courts of Lucknow and Azamgarh. Thereafter, it will be implemented in other district courts in a phased manner. “The state government has decided to introduce biometric based smart card system for entry of lawyers in district courts. Initially, the project will be implemented in Lucknow and Azamgarh district courts,” said Prashant Singh ‘Atal’, chief standing counsel, state government. Singh is also secretary of Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, an umbrella organisation that represents all lawyers of UP. The smart card system would also help in scrutiny of unwarranted elements, who are disguised as lawyers. The smart cards will be issued to genuine lawyers who are into legal profession and are regular visitors to courts. This would help in keeping out unwarranted elements from courts. “The Central Bar Council will help the government in identifying genuine lawyers for issuing smart cards. This system will help in keeping unwarranted elements out of court,” said Sunil Dwivedi, president, Central Bar Association, district court, Lucknow. According to officials of the law ministry, multiple entry points in district courts would be curtailed as part of the security plan of district courts. Only select few entry points would be open for entry of lawyers. For entry of litigants in courts pass system would be introduced like the one in high court. “Without restricting entry of litigants in district courts security of court campuses cannot be ensured,” said Gyan Singh Chauhan, senior advocate, Lucknow high court. The Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force (UPSSF), a dedicated unit for security of district courts across the state, is yet to be constituted. This proposal passed after the sensational killing of a double murder accused in a courtroom in Bijnor district before the chief judicial magistrate on December 17, 2019, remains on paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/security-of-district-courts-biometric-smart-card-system-to-be-introduced-in-lucknow-azamgarh-101640712180985.html

28-12-2021||Pune||Boarding vehicles on highway put passengers to risk||PUNE Commuters risk their lives daily to board buses and private vehicles from the Navale bridge chowk and other parts of the bypass highway. Everyday, illegal hawkers put food and drinks stalls where citizens stop to buy refreshments.The incident that took place on the accident-prone stretch of the highway, has once again brought to light the daily struggles of these travellers. The persons killed in Tuesday’s accident were standing on the highway near the service road exit going towards Narhe, when the speeding truck hit them. Despite repeated actions taken by the Pune traffic police department and Regional Transport Office (RTO) officials on the illegal halting of vehicles on the highway, they still continue to do so across the city. “I travel daily for work to Shirwal and our company bus picks us up near the Navale bridge. As there is no proper waiting spot, we have to stand on the highway. If a proper shed or bus stand for the company buses and private vehicles is made then this will certainly help thousands of passengers who travel from the highway,” said Keshav Bhandare a citizen.Throughout the day many company buses and private vehicles wait at different spots on the Katraj to Dehu road bypass highway. As people want to travel to their destinations and this common highway goes through various parts of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, it has become a daily risk for passengers. While talking about this issue Vijay Chaudhary, assistant commissioner of police (traffic) said, “We have taken action on illegal vehicles halting and fined them for carrying passengers from the highway. People should first think of their safety and realise the risk of standing on the highway can cost to their life after today’s accident,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/boarding-vehicles-on-highway-put-passengers-to-risk-101640711947137.html

28-12-2021||Mumbai||Covid admissions increase at hospitals||Mumbai With the increase in Covid cases in the past one week, Mumbai has also seen a 14.7% increase in the overall admission rate of Covid patients at public and private hospitals in the city during the week between December 21 to 28. According to the data available with Brihanmumbai municipal corporation (BMC), 551 patients were admitted to Covid hospitals, jumbo centres, and isolation centres for asymptomatic patients (CCC2) in the week ahead of December 21, contrary to only 35 admissions in the week following December 14.Meanwhile, admissions in the intensive care units have seen an increase of a whopping 49% between these two weeks, pointing at more severity of symptoms among patients detected with Covid. While ICU bed occupancy increased by 41 beds in the week following December 21, it increased by only one bed in the week following December 14.However, doctors tending to Covid patients across prominent hospitals in the city have a contrary opinion and have experienced that even though the number of admissions of Covid patients has gone up in the past one week, the severity of symptoms among those admitted to hospitals remains mild to very mild. Doctors said that they have not seen a significant increase in the number of critical patients or those with severe symptoms.Dr Harish Chafle, senior consultant, Pulmonology and Critical Care at Global Hospitals, said, “The number of admissions has gone up at our hospital, but patients who come in have mild to very mild symptoms. There is a minor increase in the number of patients we have referred to ICU admission, at two on an average, at present.”Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a part of the Maharashtra government’s Covid task force, also said, “The cases that we are receiving now show mild symptoms. Future projects are likely to be similar to what we are seeing now, as long as the infection is from the Delta variant of Covid. If the infections from the Omicron variant begins to spread, the growth in the number of Covid cases is likely to be faster per day, in my opinion.”Between December 21 and 28, Mumbai added 4,145 Covid cases to its total caseload. However, during the previous week, between December 14 and 21, Mumbai had added 1,894 Covid patients to its total caseload.Comprehensive data for the week of December 21 shows a 14.7% increase in overall bed occupancy, a 49% increase in ICU occupancy, a 5.3% increase in ventilator bed occupancy, an 8.6% increase in oxygen bed occupancy, and a 9.25% increase in CCC2 bed occupancy which are used to isolate Covid positive but asymptomatic patients.In the week from December 14, a total of 35 beds overall got occupied, versus 551 beds in the week from December 21; in the week from December 14, one ICU bed got occupied, versus 59 ICU beds in the week from December 21; In the week from December 14, a total of 3 ventilator beds got occupied, versus 19 ventilator beds in the week from December 21; In the week from December 14, 12 oxygen beds got occupied, versus 116 oxygen beds in the week from December 21. Moreover, in the CCC2 facilities, in the week from December 14, 4 beds got occupied, versus 41 beds in the week from December 21.Dr Smita Chavan from Seven Hills Hospital, said, “Our admission of Covid positive patients has increased, but that is mainly due to isolation of all Omicron suspects, who are international passengers positive for Covid upon arrival at the Mumbai airport. The results for Omicron are awaited, so even if they are asymptomatic, it is mandatory according to rules that they get quarantined in a hospital, and cannot opt for home quarantine even if they are asymptomatic.”The occupancy at the 3,500-bed jumbo facility in NESCO at Goregaon went up to 55 on Tuesday. Of these, 48 Covid patients were admitted to the ward, while seven were in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). “The daily admissions have been in the range of 11 to 13 in the past two to three days,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the NESCO facility. “Before this, our occupancy was about 15. None of the 48 patients in the ward has required oxygen support. They have mild symptoms like scratchy throat and runny nose,” she said. Doctors said that many patients are coming to facilities as they are scared, and some of them are living in large families or smaller houses.Private hospitals have also started seeing a slight increase in admissions. For instance, the Bombay Hospital in Marine Lines had an occupancy of three to four patients in the first three weeks of December. On Tuesday, the hospital’s occupancy had jumped to 26. “We have started seeing 8-10 admissions daily, a majority of them are international travellers testing positive,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital. “As of now, there is no rise in ICU admissions,” he said. According to data from the civic body, a total of 146 international travellers have tested positive since November 1, of which 74 were detected at the Mumbai airport. 22 others, who are high-risk contacts of these internal travellers, have also tested positive. All of them are being treated at the Seven Hills Hospital.At present, 90% of the 15,278 Covid beds available at all hospitals across the city for Covid patients are vacant, according to BMC’s dashboard. 84.5% of the 1,986 ICU beds are vacant, 83% of the 1,157 ventilator beds are vacant, and 92% of the 6,790 oxygen beds are vacant.As per figures from the state government’s public health department, there are 4,765 active Covid cases in the city as of December 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-admissions-increase-at-hospitals-101640710921185.html

28-12-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh panchayat polls cancelled, says state election commission||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh state election commission on Tuesday cancelled panchayat elections scheduled from January 6 to February 16, days after governor Mangu Bhai Patel signed off on the Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet to withdraw the ordinance to hold the elections on Sunday.“With the cancellation of the election, model code of conduct, which was imposed on December 4, also ended. The commission will return the deposit amount of representatives of the first phase of the election,” state election commission secretary BS Jamod said in a letter to all district collectors.In MP, panchayat elections have been due since December 2019.The government’s decision to withdraw the ordinance follows the Supreme Court verdicts earlier this month, staying the election process on seats reserved for other backward classes (OBCs) in the local body polls and told the state to renotify OBC category seats as general due to a lack of empirical data.The Supreme Court has also stayed ordinances issued by Maharashtra to grant OBC reservation in local body elections and directed the SEC to hold elections to seats reserved for OBCs by notifying them as general category seats. On Monday, the Maharashtra assembly also passed a resolution recommending that the (SEC) should not conduct local body elections until reservation for OBCs was restored. In Madhya Pradesh, the chief minister told the assembly on December 21 that the state government will not allow panchayat elections without OBC reservation and will approach the top court. A resolution was also passed by the assembly on Friday last.The cabinet decision withdrawing the Madhya Pradesh Panchayat Raj Evam Gram Swaraj (Amendment) Ordinance 2021 cited the rise in Covid 19 cases and the assembly’s resolution.Congress leaders in Madhya Pradesh objected to the MP ordinance on grounds that it annulled the process of delimitation and reservation rotation set by the previous Congress-led government in 2019. On the basis of this ordinance, the panchayat election process was started as per the delimitation and reservation rotation of 2014.The top court, however, faulted the ordinance for OBC reservation provided for in the law without any empirical evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-panchayat-polls-cancelled-says-state-election-commission-101640710021080.html

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Caught in the world wide web over game of Bridge||Our fingers just fly on the computer keys involuntarily, as we search for information or entertainment on search engines. The process has become a huge part of our lives, something as natural as breathing. But if we pause to think, just what image does the phrase ‘www’ conjure in the mind’s eye? The web as we know it is capable of myriad, exciting possibilities. To many, it may be akin to a vast, curtained bay window, hinting at a kaleidoscope of options, cheerful, informative, exciting, intriguing, all showcasing prospective views with the potential to amuse, entertain and keep us happily occupied. For someone like me, with a fanciful mind and overactive imagination, the web has recently been invoking images of an ominously spiralling black hole, beckoning wickedly or a gargantuan spider with nasty appendages, all eight of which are capable of encompassing, suffocating and controlling us. This latter is the image that has been my constant companion, my bête noire, for quite some time now. Let me explain. Besides awareness of sanitation, hygiene, mindfulness and frugality, the Covid pandemic has made us conscious of learning to be on our own and finding ways to pass time fruitfully without resorting to actual physical contact with other people. That’s where the story of my nightmare with online Bridge began. I had joined a group of wonderful ladies in my city who taught me the game but being declared one of the most difficult card games in the world, it was a huge challenge and I was apprehensive about actually picking up the cards dealt, the intricate bidding process and then playing multiple hands with the stalwarts. As luck would have it, Covid ripped apart life as we knew it and rendered us all recluses. It also seemed the perfect time for me to join some online Bridge platform where I could, in the haven of anonymity, better my skills, make mistakes and blunders with faceless strangers and not have to worry about embarrassing myself. So much for my innocence and unworldliness because I was soon to discover the dark side of the web, a side much maligned and rightly so. Moron, imbecile, fool, cretin are a few colourful adjectives my screen is bombarded with during play, many times in capital letters, to add insult to injury. Some players rudely remove you from their table and you are left licking your wounds. Many people sitting in remote corners of the world, hurl abuses in foreign languages. I know because curiosity takes over and I often Google the meaning! A few continue to hound and stalk you even if you exit their group and leave behind expletives like, ‘You still playing Bridge, you clown! Get out!’ Things came to such a head that I started fearing going online to play until one day my husband noticed me hurriedly shutting the laptop and couldn’t believe I was letting myself be bullied by some malicious and spiteful netizens. “What happened to all the sagely advice you keep doling out to the children? When you come to a fork in the road, try not to take the easy path, because many a time the tortuous route is there to make you stronger,” he reminded me with a grin. So, I have decided to dig in my heels, play the game and make a determined effort to learn and improve. To all the unkind and hurtful folk out there, “I am here to stay.” pallavisingh358@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/caught-in-the-world-wide-web-over-game-of-bridge-101640708400984.html

28-12-2021||Patna||83.46 lakh children in Bihar eligible for Covid jabs from Jan 3||Around 83.46 lakh children in Bihar in the age group of 15-18 years, out of the 7.40 crore in India, will be eligible for vaccination against Covid-19, beginning January 3 at dedicated session sites different from those for adults, Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society (SHS), said on Tuesday. Bharat Biotech’s indigenous Covaxin is the only option available for vaccination of children and so vaccination session sites for them have been kept separate from adults to reduce the risk of mixing of vaccines. Children will be eligible for the second jab of the vaccine after 28 days of their first shot. Those aged 15 years or more or whose birth year is 2007 or before will be able to register on Co-WIN portal for vaccination from January 1. They can even avail of walk-in registration facility to take the jab from January 3, Singh said. “We are yet to firm up our vaccination plan for children in the 15-18 years age group, but will most likely have separate session sites for them in districts. The Centre shared with states today some guidelines on vaccination of children and will share more in days to come. We are waiting for the Centre’s blueprint before we firm up our plans,” said Singh. As a relief to senior citizens with comorbidities, the Centre has dispensed away the need of having to produce medical certificate as proof of their co-morbidity at the time of administration of the precautionary dose of Covid-19 vaccine, which will be available to them, along with healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), from January 10, said Singh. All such HCWs, FLWs and senior citizens with comorbidity will, however, be eligible for the precautionary dose on the completion of nine months (39 weeks) from the date of administration of the second dose, he said. All persons aged 60 years and above with comorbidities, who have received two doses of Covid-19 vaccine, will be expected to obtain the advice of their doctor before deciding to avail of the precautionary dose. “We will administer precautionary dose of the vaccine to any senior citizen who says s/he has taken doctor’s advice and is suffering from comorbidity,” said Singh. The projected number of comorbid population in 60-plus age group in Bihar is 18,92,800, out of the 2.75 crore in India, as per the figures provided by the Registrar General of India to the Union health ministry. Bihar’s additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit and Sanjay Kumar Singh were among the state health officials who attended a national-level virtual meeting, addressed by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan earlier in the day on Tuesday.

28-12-2021||Mumbai||State assembly amends Act, ensures capital value of property will not be revised in FY2021-22||MUMBAI: In a relief for Mumbaikars on the eve of the civic body polls due early next year, the state legislative assembly has approved a bill that will freeze the capital value of properties in the city, resulting in lower property tax bills in this financial year. The assembly on Tuesday approved an amendment to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, which will ensure that the capital value of buildings and land in Mumbai, based on which property tax is charged, will not be revised in the ongoing financial year.According to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, property tax is determined according to the capital value of a building or land. The act also provides that the capital value of these landed properties be revised every five years and as such, a revision is due in 2020-21. However, the Covid-19 pandemic, the resultant lockdown and economic distress prompted the state government to decide last year that the capital value of land and buildings will not be revised in 2020-21 and that the property tax will be the same as in the year 2019-20. Since the economic stress caused by the pandemic is ongoing, it was decided to continue with this sop and accordingly, the amendment to the act will ensure that property tax bills will be the same as in 2019-20, and they will be revised only in 2022-23.Leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which has fixed deposits to the tune of Rs78,000 crore, should waive off the property tax of residential units up to 500 square feet. He pointed to how the Shiv Sena had promised this in its manifesto for the 2017 BMC elections. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said that the proposal is under consideration. He added that the cap on property tax for two years would cost the BMC Rs1,000 crore each year, and also lead to a commensurate benefit for citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-assembly-amends-act-ensures-capital-value-of-property-will-not-be-revised-in-fy202122-101640706000088.html

Till now, the prosecution has examined around 220 witnesses in the blast case. “I was threatened by ATS officers Param Bir Singh and DCP Shrirao who were then posted with Maharashtra ATS. They told me their story was ready and that I had to only take the names of certain people. They even threatened me that if I didn’t take the said names, I would have to face the consequences. They detained me for several days,” the witness told the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court while he was cross-examined by Purohit’s counsel.The witness told the court that five names were given to him and he was asked to mention them in his statements. Special NIA judge Prashant R Sitre told the witness, “You can lodge a complaint against the officers if you were tortured. Do you need police protection?”Special NIA public prosecutor Avinash Rasal who examined the witness pointed out to the court that the witness never lodged a complaint, if at all he was tortured by the agency. The witness was associated with Abhinav Bharat, a right-wing group that is allegedly part of the blast conspiracy. The witness had earlier told the Maharashtra ATS that he was associated with Abhinav Bharat since its formation. He had arranged several programmes with Purohit to attract the youth towards the organisation. They had even taken an oath to form a Hindu nation and nobody could rest till such a nation was formed.The trial in the 2008 blast is being conducted before special NIA judge, P R Sitre. Six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque at Malegaon, Nashik, on September 29, 2008. Sayyed Nisar Ahmed, who lost his son Sayyed Azhar Nisar Ahmed, 20, in the blast and is represented by advocate Shahid Nadeem, has already written to the judge and the NIA to take help from the Maharashtra ATS which was at one point investigating the case.The trial in the 2008 blast case began on November 2, 2018. The prosecution agency submitted a list of around 286 witnesses including doctors, police officials, forensic experts and panch witnesses. The court on October 30, 2018, framed charges in the case against all seven accused for terror activities, criminal conspiracy and murder. The accused even face trial under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

On December 13, there were 758 active cases; this number has now increased to 1,069 on December 28. Though active cases have increased, most patients prefer to be isolated at home, said, officials.“We will see how the situation evolves. Most people are isolated at home. In the second wave as well, we haven’t received a response for CCCs as home isolation was preferred. If necessary, facilities can be arranged,” said Rajendra Muthe, PMC deputy commissioner.With active cases rising in Pune, the civic administration has started preparing to restart the jumbo facility if the need arises.As a precautionary measure, the PMC has put the jumbo Covid-19 facility on the grounds of College Of Engineering Pune (COEP) on standby to admit patients if numbers start to increase exponentially.“Medical equipment is already at the facility. We also have a database of the staffers ready with us. Whenever the civic body tells us to activate the beds we can start hiring. In second wave COEP jumbo facility was functional with 700 beds,” said Shreyansh Kapale, one of the operators of the COEP jumbo Covid-19 facility.In the last fortnight, the trend of Covid-19 cases is moving upward. On Tuesday, 171 positive cases were reported in PMC. The number of patients who are on oxygen support has also increased. On December 13, there were 44 patients who were on oxygen support which have gone up to 57 by Tuesday.According to the report by the district health officer, in Pune city among the active patients, 707 are in home isolation. During the second wave, the demand for oxygen and ventilator beds had reached a record high but Covid-19 care centres had remained empty with mild or asymptomatic patients preferring home isolation.“We have to keep in mind that though the new variant Omicron has emerged, the delta variant which had proved disastrous is still there. In the state as well day by day cases are increasing. The only reason is, people are behaving carelessly and not following norms. Many are without masks at crowded places,” said Avinash Bhondwe, past president, IMA, Maharashtra state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-adopt-wait-and-watch-policy-on-reactivation-of-covid-care-centres-101640704501276.html

His statement was in reference to a Dharma Sansad event held in Uttarakhand wherein speeches inciting violence against Muslims were allegedly made by participants.Stating that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi began the debate on “Hindu versus Hindutva”, Gehlot said there is a need for the country to understand the crux of the matter.“The crux was that on one hand, there is a Hindu whose great values have been there for centuries, whose expressions are of love and brotherhood, and the forces that are indulging in politics in the name of Hindutva, their becoming Hindu is pseudo, they are fake Hindus,” the Rajasthan chief minister was quoted as saying by PTI.Terming the language used during the Dharma Sansad as “shameful”, Gehlot said while he respects saints and that their “saffron clothes” give the message of Indian culture and sacrifice, the words spoken by some of them were “condemnable.”Also Read | Pakistan foreign ministry summons Indian diplomat over Dharma Sansad speechesGehlot further said the Congress rules the heart of every Indian and people who talk of “Congress-mukt (free) Bharat” will themselves become “mukt”. He said India is going through a difficult phase and during such a time, the nation needs the ideology, policy and programmes of the grand old party.Meanwhile, three people have been named as accused in the ongoing probe into the Dharma Sansad case.

28-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to re-evaluate decision on curbs in January||Mumbai With Mumbai recording a steady rise in Covid cases for the past one week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said that during the first week of January, it will re-evaluate the restrictions that it has implemented ahead of the Christmas weekend. Meanwhile, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said on Tuesday that the BMC will take a call immediately after January 1 on whether the restrictions would be extended or will be relaxed. Kakani said that the final call about the curbs will be taken after studying a few factors.“For the next one week, we will be recording the overall growth rate in the city, the bed availability in all the hospitals, oxygen requirement and the percentage of patients that are getting hospitalised. We are not anticipating any stringent rules as of now, but we will only get clarity after studying the figures,” said Kakani.He further added that from the last week of December to the first week of January, a lot of people come and go out of India. “The influx of more international patients during this period will also give us a fair idea about the trend of the virus because right now, the figures are only fluctuating,” he said.Earlier this week, state minister of health Rajesh Tope had said that another lockdown will be imposed if the oxygen requirement in Maharashtra touches 800 Metric Tonnes (MT) per day. Kakani mentioned that the BMC is keeping a record of the day-to-day requirement of oxygen in BMC hospitals. He said that when the second wave was at its peak, the maximum oxygen requirement in Mumbai was around 210 MT per day.“At present, the daily requirement is below 100 MT. As per the present infrastructure that we have, BMC is now equipped to fulfil a maximum requirement of 690 MT of oxygen per day and this could be extended up to 1,100 MT per day in case there is any adverse situation,” he said.In the wake of the recent spike in cases in Mumbai and with the increasing number of patients infected with the Omicron variant, the BMC had announced new curbs on December 24. In a circular issued by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, the BMC had banned new year celebrations and parties across the city and have also restricted gathering of more than five people between 9 pm and 6 am at public places. Besides this, the BMC also mandated only 50 per cent occupancy in all the restaurants, pubs and eateries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-re-evaluate-decision-on-curbs-in-january-101640702580665.html

28-12-2021||Mumbai||Magistrate court directs MHA to handover Rashmi Shukla pen drive to state in 10 days||MUMBAI: The additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) court in Mumbai on Tuesday, while allowing the plea filed by Mumbai police’s cyber cell unit, has asked the home secretary, ministry of home affairs, to handover IPS officer Rashmi Shukla’s report and pen-drive within 10 days. The report and pen-drive contain details of private individuals who acted as brokers for facilitating transfers and securing desired postings for senior police officers in exchange for money and by using their political connections. The plea was heard by ACMM Sudhir Bhajipale who was informed that the documents and pen drive are crucial to ascertain who leaked the data and how the data leak occurred. The case is currently registered against unknown persons.At a press conference on March 23, 2021, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged rampant corruption in transfers and postings of police officers in Maharashtra. He also pointed out certain documents and reports prepared by the then Maharashtra State Intelligence Department (SID) commissioner Rashmi Shukla to support his allegations. He claimed that the state did not act on the report and therefore, he was going to hand over the entire material, including a pen drive, to the ministry of home affairs.The Mumbai cyber cell registered an FIR on March 26 based on the complaint lodged by an assistant commissioner, SID, against unknown persons for leaking a classified report that IPS Rashmi Shukla had prepared and which contained crucial details of some private individuals who acted as brokers for facilitating transfers and securing desired postings for senior police officers in exchange for money and by using their political connections.The August 2020 report also contained the names of six IPS officers and 23 state service officers who were in touch with the brokers. The report mentioned how some transfers took place due to political influence. Police officials claimed that Shukla, the then SID commissioner and presently posted at Hyderabad as additional director general of the Central Reserve Police Force, south zone, copied the report on three pen drives and while two of the three were recovered by the cyber cell, the third one was sent by Fadnavis to the union home secretary. The state government wants the pen drive to ascertain that it is the same third pen drive and verify the leakage. It has already written to the centre several times to handover the pen drive however hasn’t got any response.The cyber cell had told the court through special public prosecutor, Ajay Misar, that the said report was leaked from the SID office. They had also written to opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis to give his statement on the issue and that he was their ‘star witness’ who could give them a lot of information. Rashmi Shukla’s statement in the matter has already been recorded by the SID. Meanwhile advocate Shreeram Shirsath, who appeared for the union home secretary, told the court that the application of the state government is ‘vague and untenable’ and should be dismissed. The state government has failed to maintain which exact documents they want and have mentioned all documents in the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/magistrate-court-directs-mha-to-handover-rashmi-shukla-pen-drive-to-state-in-10-days-101640702040631.html

28-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to replicate Delhi model to fight air pollution||Mumbai: Mechanical road sweepers, water cannons and anti-smog guns —equipment that is commonly used in India’s capital city to stave off air pollution during winters may soon become regular fixtures in Maharashtra’s non-attainment cities to fight hazardous air quality.Nearly all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have proposed the use of these measures as part of their respective action plans to curb air pollution, officials with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) confirmed.These measures will be funded via the Centre’s National Clean Air Program (NCAP), and using funds allocated to Maharashtra at the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission to tackle air pollution in non-attainment cities, where pollution levels exceed permissible limits as set out in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).“Some ULBs, like Navi Mumbai, are already in the tendering process to procure mechanical road sweeping machines using already received NCAP funds. All 25 non-attainment cities and 5 cantonment boards in the state have proposed to use these measures, and the protocol for the same is given in Maharashtra’s Graded Response Action Plan, which ULBs will need to start implementing at the earliest. Water sprinkling, mechanised road sweeping and anti-smog guns will be a routine action when air quality dips,” said a sub-regional officer with the MPCB stationed in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.While ULBs like the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation are already carrying out mechanised road sweeping to a degree, the machines being used are outdated, officials said. “We are now in the process of procuring two better machines which can have an impact on air quality. Other measures that will be implemented at a ULB level include creating green corridors along roads with heavy traffic volume, and formation of mobile response teams to patrol the city and pick out any GRAP violations,” said Abhijit Bangar, Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner.We had reported, on December 20, the Maharashtra government’s plans to implement an emergency response system, along the lines of Delhi’s graded action plan to combat air pollution. The GRAP is a set of measures that are triggered in phases as air quality deteriorates. For example, when the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR hits the ‘severe’ category, concerning municipal corporations in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh impose bans on polluting activities such as construction, operation of cement mix plants and running diesel generators, and step-up patrolling for open burning.For the state, MPCB has categorised air quality in four stages (from ‘moderate’ to ‘emergency’) based on the daily concentration of particulate matter pollutants PM2.5 and PM10. Activities like water sprinkling, dust sweeping and deployment of anti-smog guns will be put into action when air quality touches the ‘severe’ category for a period of 48 hours, i.e. when PM2.5 levels exceed 215ug/m3 and PM10 exceeds 431ug/m3.“These measures fall entirely under the ‘dust mitigation’ component of city-level action plans. The other components are electrifying public transport, regulating industries and expanding on the state’s air quality monitoring network,” said the MPCB official cited above.Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert certified by the Quality Council of India, said, “GRAP has had little efficacy in north Indian states, and dust control measures in particular have shown little to no measurable improvement. The focus must be on controlling pollutants at source.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-replicate-delhi-model-to-fight-air-pollution-101640700240276.html

28-12-2021||Pune||3 pedestrians crushed to death by truck on Pune-Bangalore Highway||PUNE Three pedestrians were killed on Tuesday after a truck hit them and further rammed into other vehicles on the Pune-Bangalore Highway at Narhe area in Pune. The incident took place near the Navale Bridge chowk, which is an accident-prone stretch of the highway.According to officials, the brakes of the truck carrying industrial machinery failed, causing the truck to hurtle in reverse for about one kilometre, due to a steep slope, killing the pedestrians. The speeding truck also hit five other vehicles; however, no injuries were reported. After the incident, the truck driver and his aide fled the spot and police have lodged an FIR against unknown persons in the case.The deceased have been identified as Nitin Chandrakant Dhavale (29), a resident of Shivne; Hemant Yashwant Talale (27) and Chetan Ramesh Solanki (31) both residents of Narhe area. All three of them were standing on the highway to catch their company bus in the morning to go towards Shirval and Satara.As per the information shared by the Sinhgad road police, the heavy vehicle truck (MH 14 GU 9521) carrying industrial material going towards Satara suffered a breakdown on the bypass highway near Swaminarayan Temple at around 5 am.

The cleaner of the truck later brought fuel from a nearby petrol pump and at around 9 am the driver tried to restart the vehicle. But as the truck started, its breaks did not work and suddenly the truck started moving in reverse on the highway.“The truck was speeding in reverse, it first hit two persons who were waiting for their company bus near Bhumkar chowk. Then the truck hit another person near the service road exit towards Narhe. The hit was intense, and all three persons died on the spot. The truck also hit five other vehicles,” said assistant police inspector (API) Prashant Kanse of Sinhgad road police station.The truck driver and his aide fled the accident spot, leaving the truck, which inturn caused traffic jam. Local residents and police officials along with NHAI workers rushed to the spot. The mortal remains of the three persons were taken to Sassoon General Hospital.

28-12-2021||Lucknow||Promotion of ‘mafiawaad’ by previous govts destroyed businesses in UP, says PM||KANPUR Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the opposition, saying that the previous governments promoted ‘mafiawaad’ to such an extent that it led to the destruction of businesses and industries in the state. “The earlier governments in UP promoted the growth of the tree of mafiawaad so much that all the industries and businesses were destroyed in its shade. Now, Yogiji’s government has brought back the rule of law and order. That’s why investment is also increasing in UP and criminals are going to jail after getting their bail canceled,” he said at a public rally after inaugurating a stretch of Kanpur Metro rail project and the 356-km Bina-Panki multi-product pipeline project at Railway ground in Nirala Nagar here.He said the “double engine government” at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh was working with double speed, without wasting any time for the development of the state. The PM also took a swipe at the SP over the seizure of ₹196 crore cash from a Kanpur-based businessman and said it was the “achievement and reality” of the opposition party.“Boxes filled with currency notes have tumbled out; I was thinking they (Samajwadi Party) will say that this was also done by us,” he said. “Before 2017, the perfume of corruption that they had sprinkled all over UP is there for everyone to see,” he said without taking any names. Modi said now the opposition was sitting with its mouth shut. “They are not coming forward to take credit for the mountain of currency notes seen by the entire country. This is their achievement and their reality,” he said. “The people of Uttar Pradesh are seeing and understanding everything and hence, they are with those who are working to take the state forward,” emphasised the PM.The PM said that the previous governments in UP used to think they had “won a lottery to loot the state for five years, but the double-engine government today is working with honesty and accountability.”Taking pot shots at the SP without naming the party, he said: “They have a problem with anything we do; be it abolition of triple talaq or women empowerment… they just oppose and claim credit for the work we do.” The PM said before 2014, UP had only 9 km of Metro rail tracks, which had gone up to 90 km in the past seven years. “Before 2014, only five cities in the country had Metro services. Today, it is functional in five cities of Uttar Pradesh and 27 cities have functional Metros across the nation. This has helped the confidence of youth in Tier-II and III cities,” said the PM.Modi added, “For decades, this situation prevailed in our country that one part was developed and the other was left behind. At the level of the states, it is equally important to remove this inequality at the level of society. That is why our government is working on the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/promotion-of-mafiawaad-by-previous-govts-destroyed-businesses-in-up-says-pm-101640697540025.html
28-12-2021||Patna||RJD fires at Nitish Kumar over Bihar prohibition; CJI Ramana’s remarks is ammo||PATNA: Bihar’s lead opposition party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Tuesday renewed its attacks on the Nitish Kumar government over the state’s prohibition law after Chief Justice of India NV Ramana recently held up the law as an example of legislation drafted with “lack of foresight”. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in alliance with Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), also asked the chief minister to take a relook at the law’s implementation “to make it more effective”.“The chief minister has been shown the mirror by the CJI. His unilateral decision has piled up cases in court. Prohibition has been thrust upon people of Bihar and it has helped the rise of a parallel economy in the state,” said RJD leader Shakti Yadav.“His decision has spelt doom for Bihar,” Yadav said about the law enacted byBihar in 2016 to deliver on the JD(U)’s poll promise in the 2015 state elections.CJI Ramana, delivering the Fifth Late Shri Lavu Venkateswarlu Endowment Lecture on “Indian Judiciary: Challenges of Future” in Andhra Pradesh’s Vijaywada, made a fleeting reference to the prohibition law in Bihar. Referring to Bihar’s prohibition law, the country’s top judge said such laws lead to courts being flooded with cases making dispensation of speedy justice difficult. It appears, he said, that the Bihar legislature has “not been able to make optimum use” of the parliamentary standing committee system to “enhance scrutiny of Bills”.According to Patna high court statistics, the percentage of excise cases among total civil and criminal cases pending before the high court was 19% for the last few years, and rose to 21.75% in 2020 when courts could hold hearings for a limited number of cases due to the Covid pandemic.The impact on subordinate courts is sharper. According to official figures, every fourth case before the lower courts is related to the prohibition law. The highest number of cases, 26,270 were filed in 2019, up from 20,548 in 2018, though it dropped to 12,763 in 2020 and 8,070 in the first five months of 2021, largely due to the impact of the pandemic. In the subordinate courts, 217,000 excise cases have piled up in the last three years, besides, the 230,000 bail cases related to prohibition. The top judge’s observation came just as chief minister Nitish Kumar was halfway through his samaj sudhar yatra (social reforms campaign) designed to mobilise support for his prohibition law and against other social ills such as child marriage and dowry.Kumar has made it clear that the law wasn’t up for a review. On Monday, he called for public shaming of those flouting liquor ban in the state and rejected calls for relaxing the stringent prohibition law for those coming to the state from elsewhere.RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwary who was excise and prohibition minister of Bihar in 2000-2005 in the Rabri Devi-led RJD government, said that he is worried for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.Tiwary said the chief minister’s approach to prohibition “is not a sign of a healthy mindset. As per the government data, 2.5 to 3 lakh cases related to liquor are pending in courts. The CJI’s comments are in the light of this.”The BJP, which has been asking for a policy review, also waded into the back-and-forth between the opposition and Nitish Kumar’s party.“The very fact that liquor is being seized every day shows that it is still being sold, and points to loopholes in the system. This means that the administration is not implementing it properly and some want the whole exercise to fail. The entire thing needs to be reviewed by taking all people concerned in confidence,” said BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel. HAM-S, another alliance partner of the JD (U) has also been advocating for changes in prohibition law.

28-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah flags income tax raids to target SP; Akhilesh responds||LUCKNOW Income tax raids, first on leaders of opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) and later on the premises of Kannauj-based businessman from where substantial amount of cash was unearthed, have now become a full-blown election issue in Uttar Pradesh (UP) with Union home minister Amit Shah and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav both raising the issue to target each other. Attending the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ in Hardoi, Shah, in the presence of former Congress leader Jitin Prasada and former Samajwadi Party heavyweight Naresh Agarwal, hit out at the Congress and BSP, and claimed the SP had got its ‘ABCD’ all wrong before flagging the I-T raids, which he claimed had caused ‘pait mein machlan (stomach ache)’ to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. “The SP’s ABCD went thus: A meant ‘apraadh aur aatank’ (crime and terror), B meant ‘bhai-bhatijawad’ (nepotism), C meant corruption and D meant ‘danga’ (riots). But the BJP has now changed all that,” Shah said, adding that just as an expert batsman puts a full toss away, the BJP too will win the 2022 UP polls handsomely. Shah also spoke of how Ayodhya temple became a reality under the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how ‘Advaniji (party veteran and former deputy Prime Minister LK Advani) had set out on a rath yatra for the temple cause. He also spoke of how “SP, BSP and Congress tried to stall temple construction.” But, his repeated mention of I-T raids indicated the BJP’s plan to corner the SP on the issue. “I-T raids had started giving stomach ache to bhai (brother) Akhilesh who questioned the exercise and described them as a result of ‘rajnitik dwesh’ (political bitterness). But today, he is lost for words as ₹250 crore cash has been recovered from the person who made ‘Samajwadi itra’ (Samajwadi perfume). Has anyone seen as much cash in their lifetime? Tell me, whose money was it? It’s the money of UP’s poor that has been unearthed from this perfumer,” said Shah. “Akhileshji don’t try to scare us. Before coming to power, Modiji (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) had made it clear that the BJP would end corruption and wipe out black money. Today, when I-T raids are being carried out, Akhileshji is getting stomach ache. But I have come here to tell you that under the BJP government there is no place for the corrupt,” added Shah. Shah’s prolonged reference to the cash recovery from the Kannauj perfumer came shortly after Akhilesh denied his party’s relationship with the Kannauj perfumer Piyush Jain (who has now been arrested for recovery of substantial cash and massive tax evasion). Yadav’s comments came during his party’s ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’ in Unnao. “They are now wrongly claiming the businessman’s link with us. If the tax agency reveals details, his connection with several BJP people will surface. I am thankful to the media that even those who were earlier linking the businessman to us, had by afternoon, (of the raids) corrected themselves. The raids weren’t intended at Piyush Jain, but at Pushpraj Jain. Due to some confusion, the BJP perhaps ended up getting their own businessman raided,” said Akhilesh. Pushpraj (Pampi Jain), whom Akhilesh referred to, is the SP MLC who had launched the Samajwadi itra (perfume) in Lucknow in November and who lives in the same Chipatta locality of Kannauj as Piyush Jain. Pampi denied reports that he had launched the perfume with the help of Piyush, but the BJP was claiming a connection. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath too had been raising the issue of I-T raids to target the SP, whose chief Akhilesh, accused the BJP and its leaders of being experts at lying. In 80 hours of searches at four houses of businessman Piyush Jain, a team of officials found 23 kg of gold, ₹17 crore cash and 600 kg illegally procured sandalwood stored in one of the houses in Kannauj, the directorate of GST intelligence (DGGI) had said in a statement on Monday. The sandalwood was worth ₹6 crore. Jain had been sent to 14 days of judicial custody. These recoveries were apart from ₹177.45 crore in cash recovered from Piyush Jain’s premises during another raid. Before Jain was raided, I-T teams had carried out raids on some leaders of the Samajwadi Party, including party’s national spokesman Rajiv Rai. The BJP and the SP had earlier used cartoons to spar at each other over I-T raids.

28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 curbs: New Metro guidelines commuters must know||The Delhi government on Tuesday announced a series of curbs in the national capital in the wake of rising coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The caseload has risen due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 virus.The restrictions announced by the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government includes closure of gym, yoga studios, spa and other places where gatherings can take place and reducing the number of employees going to the office.The restrictions will also impact those who use Delhi Metro to travel to their offices or other places. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has also been asked to reduce the number of passengers in a coach.According to the new guidelines that have been issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), Metro trains have to run at 50 per cent seating capacity. No standing passengers will be allowed in the trains, the order further said."At the same time, buses going from one state to another will run with 50 per cent seating capacity, while only two passengers will be allowed to travel in auto, e-rickshaw, taxi and cycle rickshaws," the order further said.After the new guidelines were announced, the DMRC said in a statement that out of 712 metro gates, only 444 will be kept open.The restrictions that have been put in place by the Delhi government from today are under the first level of the graded response force (GRAP) - yellow alert. If the Covid-19 situation deteriorates further, the second level (amber alert) will come into effect, which will reduce the seating capacity further to 33 per cent, as per GRAP framework decided in July.The DDMA had in November allowed standing passengers in each Metro coach, along with 100 per cent seating capacity, as a measure to boost the use of public transport in light of the hazardous air pollution levels in the national capital.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic had majorly affected operations of the Delhi Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-curbs-new-metro-guidelines-commuters-must-know-101640692454900.html

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC elections: AAP alleges horse-trading by BJP||A day after the Chandigarh municipal corporation election results were announced, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is indulging in horse trading. Also read: Personnel deployed in poll-bound states to be eligible for precaution dose: GovtNo party got a clear majority of 19 seats in the 35-member House, the AAP emerged as the single largest party with 14 seats, the BJP a close second with 12 seats, the Congress with eight seats and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) with one seat. With the Chandigarh MP also having one vote in the House, the incumbent MP being Kirron Kher from the BJP, technically, the party has 13 votes. Addressing a press conference at the AAP office in Sector 39 on Tuesday, AAP Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha said, “The BJP leaders called up and visited three of our 14 councillors. They offered one of them ₹75 lakh, and two others ₹50 lakh each to join their party. The BJP leaders told the councillors that they will fix their meeting with BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah.” “We have decided to install CCTV cameras at each councillor’s house, and have also told them to put all calls on record. So that if the BJP again tries to contact them then we will have evidence,” said Chadha. When asked why the AAP didn’t contact the police, Chadha said, “We first decided to inform the public. We will go to the police and the Election Commission on this issue.” On the choice of its mayoral candidate, Chadha said, “Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal will come to Chandigarh before this month-end and meet the newly elected councillors, and decide on the mayor candidate. The AAP will make the new mayor of the Chandigarh MC.” AAP allegations baseless: BJP Terming the AAP’s allegations as “lies and baseless”, Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood said, “The AAP is making these fraudulent claims because it is itself actively trying to buy councillors from other parties. Where is the proof for such frivolous allegations; nowadays, everybody has recording in phones, why doesn’t the AAP release those recordings? An AAP leader said they will have an AAP mayor. How are they so sure when they don’t have the requisite numbers? Is it because they are indulging in horse trading with money they have brought from foreign countries?” Sood on Monday had said that the BJP would put up its candidate for the mayoral post and appeal to the people to elect its candidate. “We will not align with anybody or pursue other parties’ councillors. We will only appeal to councillors if they want stable and development-oriented governance, they should opt for the BJP candidate.” Chadha said that the AAP was not in negotiations with any councillor of other parties for the mayoral election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-aap-alleges-horse-trading-by-bjp-101640691119554.html

28-12-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Looking back, looking forward to best things that happened in Pune for sustainability||I asked a few people what they thought were the best things that happened in Pune for sustainability, looking back at the year gone by. On the mobility front, Sujit Patwardhan, founder, Parisar, said that “street designs favouring walking and cycling are emerging in different neighbourhoods. But the good work happening is about 10%, while unsustainable works continue. Yet, there are nudges for change in thinking, which will hopefully become visible in the years to come. For example, the need for a structured approach to air quality improvement under the National Clean Air Programme, and recognition of pedestrian rights. But until a breakthrough happens, it can end in all talk and no action”. Transport planner Pranjali Deshpande too appreciated the Pedestrians’ Day and Laxmi Road Pedestrian Plaza organised on December 11 by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the collaboration with civil society groups to make it a success. Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, PMC, noted that despite the challenges for environmental improvement, Pune recently achieved the landmark of 1.5 crore kilometres of electric bus operations. This is indeed a good beginning. In the coming years, the proportion of renewable energy used for public transport (and all energy use) should go up. For Shailaja Deshpande, director, Jeevit Nadi, “the awareness and willingness towards protecting natural resources that have arisen among citizens is the most sustainable outcome as it is not driven by narrow political agenda. People are more concerned about health, hygiene and sustainable development, and not just development. People have voiced their opposition to amenity spaces privatisation, tree-felling, hill cutting, against straightening stream courses, lack of services and refusing to pay PMC taxes as a mark of protest. They have shown vigilance against illegal sand mining even at the risk of their lives.” On the other hand, Vaishali Patkar of Aundh Vikas Mandal feels that “the members of the public who engage with issues are heroes. But only a handful of people speaking doesn’t show results at the scale and urgency needed. If municipal administrators could be more inclusive of citizens, NGOs, and experts, things could change”. It was amazing that Pune Municipal Corporation showed an increase in tax collection as the financial year closed in March. Healthcare infrastructure, including municipal health facilities, became stronger. Yet, though businesses and work are slowly looking up (with the threat of Omicron hanging over us), the structural weaknesses, especially in social protection measures for informal workers and the urban poor, showed up starkly. Through the most difficult months of illness and lockdowns, we realised that the wellbeing of society is dependent on the wellbeing of all segments. Will such learning stay with us? Will the aspirants in the upcoming local body elections make inclusive development their core promise? Let’s see. On a crucial front, Avinash Madhale, programme coordinator of Community-Led Action Learning and Partnership (CLAP) says, “while there has been such a setback to school education, some teachers and institutions have made an extra effort to run bridge classes and bring children back to school.” Over the last several months, a few organisations involved in schooling for vulnerable groups have been running bridge classes and trying to maintain the connection to the school. Let’s hope that the reduction in enrolment, disruption in learning, and the support children need can be addressed in the coming months, though it is likely to need a large societal effort. For Gurudas Nulkar, from Ecological Society, the most interesting to observe is that “for at least a very small population, there has been the shocking revelation that a microscopic predator can conquer us; that organic food matters, immunity matters, biodiversity matters.” With that humbling thought and the hope for much great collaboration for sustainability between citizens and the government, best wishes to you dear readers, for the last week of 2021, and for a brighter new year.

28-12-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal calls meeting to review Covid-19 situation||NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal called a meeting with top officials on Tuesday to review the Covid-19 situation and discuss if the Capital needs more travel curbs and other restrictions to check the rising number of cases, people aware of the matter said. It comes a day after 331 cases with a 0.68% positivity rate were reported. The administration is deliberating on whether to impose additional restrictions planned under its Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as the number of active cases has surpassed 1,300 and the test positivity rate has been over 0.5% for two days. As on Monday, 266 Covid-19 patients were admitted to hospitals.The positivity rate breached one of the thresholds meant to activate stricter curbs such as shutting schools and cinema halls, imposing tighter restrictions on how many people can go to a private office, ride a taxi or take a Metro, and which shops can remain open.Officials aware of the discussions within the government said these restrictions -- part of the first level of curbs classified as Yellow Alert -- have not been taken yet due to economic considerations, but they remain on the table. “The government has already imposed night curfew and restrictions on celebrations have been imposed. A balance needs to be maintained between curbs for Covid management and the employment and economic interests of people,” an official said, asking not to be named.A second official pointed out that most of the Covid-19 beds were unoccupied and the active caseload was 1,300 – below the 1,500 active cases for the Yellow Alert threshold – and the positivity rate was under 1%.Experts said since night curfew and restrictions on celebrations have been imposed, Delhi does not need drastic curbs at this stage.Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said that with a 0.5% positivity rate, it is too early to implement drastic measures like shutting down schools, cinema halls, etc. “The occupancy of Covid beds is currently negligible. The government should monitor the situation and impose Covid appropriate behaviour among general public strictly which is necessary to check the coronavirus including Omicron spread.”Suneela Garg, a member of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission India Task Force, said since it is not a panic situation yet, no immediate implementation of GRAP is not a cause of worry. “Delhi’s current Covid situation appears to be under control as of now. The government has already imposed a night curfew and banned New Year celebrations to check the spread of coronavirus. Omicron cases are mild and recovery rate is very high, which is why not enforcing GRAP provisions immediately will not lead to long-term harm.”Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said the restrictions under Yellow Alert should not be immediately implemented because the cases for the last seven days are below 1,500 and beds occupancy is very low. “Forty Omicron patients have been cured without oxygen, ICU, steroids, and remdesivir and only five patients have shown minor symptoms. It seems that the situation has not worsened yet,” Goyal said. The CTI appealed to different trade associations to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.Delhi Gym Association vice president Chirag Sethi said they have approached Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Kejriwal. “The gyms should not be closed under GRAP on the basis of the current Covid positivity rate situation because the industry has already suffered a lot during the past few months. DDMA must also consider the total number of cases and the occupancy of oxygen beds in Delhi before imposing further curbs,” Sethi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-calls-meeting-to-review-covid-19-situation-101640670778311.html

28-12-2021||Delhi||Curfew is back! Delhiites cancel dinner reservations, curb New Year celebrations||New Year countdowns are almost always the highlight of all parties on December 31. But that won’t be the case this year because the night curfew (11pm to 5am) imposed by Delhi government, starting December 27, has led to change in plans of many party revellers who were wanting to go out to ring in 2022 with friends and family at the stroke of the midnight hour. Although large gatherings have been already prohibited in Delhi-NCR, dinners with intimate family members at eateries will also have to be wound up much before 11pm now. Some Delhiites who were planning to go out have now decided to party at home, with close family members, and have made dinner reservations for a later day in the New Year. Dimple Kumar, a homemaker and blogger from Delhi, says, “We were planning to go out for dinner but have now decided to host a small potluck party at home. There will be just us and our neighbours. It’s time to celebrate but we need to be careful as well. And due to the curfew, no one can travel much so this sounded ideal for the time being.”For the restaurants, such change in plans is going to make another dent in their businesses. Arjun Dawar, owner of Uncultured and One Oak, says: “All our bookings have been cancelled as most people had made reservations from 9pm to 1am. On the New Year, the countdown is the most important. And since that’s not happening, people are now not interested in coming. So we will be allowing walk-ins if any, and will close entry when we reach 50% capacity.” A similar stance is that of Umang Tiwari, owner of Local, Junkyard and Liv Bar. He shares the disappointment since the New Year’s eve plans for his patrons will have to be altered now, and says, “We have cancelled everything as of now. Already we were functioning at 50% capacity, and now there is a timing issue as well. If curfew stars at 11pm, we will have to shut by 10.30pm. So we have no bookings as of now.” And Vidushi Sharma, owner, Mensho Tokyo, adds how they had been inundated with bookings earlier and even came up with two-time slots to ensure social distancing. But now, everything has changed. She informs, “Previously, we were planning to take our last order at 11pm. But owing to an increase in cases and a government imposed night curfew, we will now have to take the last order at around 10 or 10pm, so that people can finish in time and reach home back in time before the curfew begins.” But some Delhiites are not letting this change in plan dampen their spirits as they agree that safety comes first. “New Year is very special for us, and we as a family have planned to get high on music,” says Sonam Upadhyaya, a teacher from Safdarjung Enclave, adding, “This year, we will dedicate the evening to singing and dancing with each other. The women in the house will rest and get pampered as the men will take charge of cooking. And be it the children or the grandparents, everyone will play some musical instrument, and sing along as we enter the New Year. Though we won’t be calling anyone home due to the curfew, but won’t miss the fun of brining in the New Year countdown at home!”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/curfew-is-back-delhiites-cancel-dinner-reservations-curb-new-year-celebrations-101640668559018.html

The passage and the main door of regional transport office (RTO), which led to the district court complex has been locked, while the door which was primarily used to present persons facing trial under Sections 107 (which pertains to the powers vested with an executive magistrate who may order detaining a person, he thinks, could commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity), and 151 (prevention of commission of cognizable offences) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was bricked up.

A local, Gaurav Sharma of Haibowal, who was visiting the transport office, said, “I always use the passage, which has been locked.

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: Congress office wears deserted look||While the counting centres were abuzz on Monday as the results of the MC elections were declared, the office of the Chandigarh Congress in Sector 35 wore a deserted look almost all day.The party which was expecting to make a big ground in the MC polls this time could only manage to win eight seats from the 35 seats of the Chandigarh MC. The election to the Chandigarh MC was held on December 24 and results were declared on Monday. While the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 14 seats in its poll debut, the BJP won 12 seats.In the morning, the party office had not many visitors after the counting of votes began. As the trends showed AAP and the BJP ahead of the Congress, the party office wore a deserted look throughout the day.According to a party associate, the Congress was expecting to win more seats this time.

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: Anti-incumbency worked, but not the way Congress saw it||It is an opportunity lost for the Congress as it faced the second successive defeat in the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) elections. The party was banking heavily on the anti-incumbency factor to regain power, but it was the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that could exploit it to its advantage and push the grand old party to the third spot in the MC poll race. The defeat follows the party’s loss in the 2019 Lok Sabha election to the BJP. The Congress won on eight seats and was runner-up on 12 seats. In a close race, which in many wards went to the wire, the party lost by narrow margins, for instance in ward number 2, it lost by 11 votes and in ward number 3, by 90 votes. It’s voting percentage at 29.79% was highest, though it, was spread out across the wards, while AAP’s votes were more concentrated in particular wards. AAP’s eight candidate poll deposit got forfeited, only 2 faced such dismal performance. Congress was runner up on 12 seats, against AAP’s five. UNDERESTIMATING RIVALS The party underestimated the AAP’s prospects in the elections and focussed its attack primarily on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Former MP and national treasurer, Congress, Pawan Kumar Bansal said, “Our campaign was mainly addressed at the BJP. The AAP model in Delhi has failed. We didn’t highlight it enough and only addressed it in the passing reference. There is a vast gap between their promises and actual deeds.” CAMPAIGN LAGGED BEHIND AAP, BJP The party’s campaign started slow and gained momentum only near the end of the campaign period. All through the campaign, it didn’t have the answer to the AAP’s guarantees, which comprised freebies, though the party did promise not to impose any new taxes and to reduce the existing ones. “We thought that these freebies being offered by AAP would never work with Chandigarh voters. There was some pressure on us too to respond with our set of freebies, but we didn’t think it was a responsible thing to do,” said Bansal. While AAP and the BJP went on an advertisement blitzkrieg, including outdoor hoardings, radio jingles, newspaper and social media advertisements, the Congress didn’t put up an outdoor advertisement at all and only on the last day of the campaign brought newspaper advertisements. Unlike AAP, which came out with catchy slogans focussing on party supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s public appeal, the Congress lagged far behind on this front too. CLOSE CONTESTS, REBEL FACTORIn some seats, the party’s rebel candidates, who joined AAP, made a major difference to its losing the seat. For instance, Prem Lata, who was denied a ticket by the party, won against its official candidate Ravinder Kaur Gujral. Lata left the Congress and fought on an AAP ticket. On another seat, ward number 3, BJP candidate Dalip Sharma defeated Congress’s Ravi Kumar by a margin of 90 votes only. Sharma polled 3,220 votes, while Kumar got 3,130 votes. Here a rebel Congress candidate, Kamal Kumar (Yanki) standing on an AAP ticket, came third and polled 2,660 votes. Both Congress candidate and rebel candidate combined polled more votes than the BJP candidate. “While there were strong candidates in all parties, some seats could have gone anywhere as the margins were close. We lost some of these but on any other day, these could have gone our way. That’s the first past the post system,” said Bansal. BAD START Notably, even before the election process got started, the party got a major setback when a major section of the party joined the AAP. The main trigger came when the party’s former city chief, Pardeep Chhabra, left it and became co-incharge in AAP. This while bolstering AAP’s grassroots network and giving it many of its candidates for the election, put the Congress on the back foot. The party’s leadership also didn’t make major efforts to bring back the dissidents. Ultimately, these not only split the party’s votes but also won in many wards. Even after the announcement of tickets, around half a dozen party workers went on the side of AAP. 
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: BJP’s plan for sweet celebrations ends on a sour note||While campaigning, city BJP president Arun Sood on various occasions had said the BJP will get a clean sweep in the upcoming municipal corporation (MC) elections, but when counting started on Monday morning, there was a sombre mood outside Kamalam in Sector 33. As per sources, sweets had been brought to the venue and it had been decorated to celebrate the victory of the party, but nobody was seen celebrating outside the office.While the counting was going on around 11.45, an argument also broke out outside the office. Some of the supporters present there thrashed two people who were sitting in a Skoda car with a Chandigarh number which remained parked outside the office in the middle of the road. The police had to be called to resolve the matter. The police said it was only a routine incident and no case was registered.After winning his constituency, former senior deputy mayor of the MC, Maheshinder Singh Sidhu was one of the few councillors here who turned up to celebrate his victory around noon. “I’m thankful to Kirron Kher who came to vote despite her health issues. Due to the small margin of my victory, every single vote mattered,” he said while he greeted the party workers here and clicked pictures with them. Residents of Sector 33 also said they had expected a racket on the counting day but were surprised at the situation here. General secretary of the Sector 33-B Resident Welfare Association (RWA) Kuljinder Sra said, “When Kher had won the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the roads here were filled with party workers who were celebrating, dhols were being played and many residents also faced problems because of their celebrations. Crackers were also burst at the office after her victory, but we were struck by the silence here on Monday.”Later in the evening, the BJP held a meeting at Kamalam. It was held by national vice president of BJP Saudan Singh and he congratulated all newly elected BJP councillors and told them to thank the people of their respective wards and serve them well. BJP city president Arun Sood, former president Sanjay Tandon and city unit general secretary Rambir Bhatti were also present for this meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-poll-bjp-s-plan-for-sweet-celebrations-ends-on-a-sour-note-101640647375140.html

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC poll: BJP loses plot to AAP’s dream debut||In ascendancy for the last three municipal corporation (MC) elections and winning two successive Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got a major reversal of fortune losing its thumping majority in the Chandigarh MC poll. Reduced to the second position after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the BJP lost 40% of seats from the last election. In the results declared on Monday, its tally stands at 12 in a house of 35. It had won 20 seats in the 2016 elections when the total seats were 26. While in 2011, it secured 10 seats, and in the previous 2006 civic polls, it won on six seats. A strong anti-incumbency factor played a key role in the saffron party’s defeat. In 14 wards where existing councillors or their relatives were given the ticket by the party, only four won, this included, one outgoing – Ravi Kant Sharma and two former mayors – Rajesh Kalia and Davesh Moudgil. In victories too, the winning margin was low. For instance, senior deputy mayor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu won by only 11 votes in ward number 2 and Sarabjit Kaur won in ward number 6 by 502 votes. The garbage mess With the onset of campaigning, the party was on the defensive as opposition parties cornered it on the city’s poor show in the Swachh Survekshan 2021. The City Beautiful fell sharply in the sanitation rankings. The party’s failure to upgrade the solid waste management plant, Sector 25, and slow progress of legacy mining work at the Dadumajra dumping site was aggressively used by both AAP and the Congress against it. The party could seldom defend its record on the issue, blaming the Congress also didn’t cut much ice with the general public. The party’s choice of candidates in these locations, like the “unpopular” former mayor Rajesh Kalia from Dadumajra, also didn’t go well with an already angry populace. It lost all seats located around the Dadumajra dumping site. AAP won in ward numbers 25 and 26; and the Congress in ward numbers 27 and 28, which are located near the dumping site. Freebies trick At a time when the BJP increased the water tariff, sewage cess and garbage collection charges, the AAP’s promise to make all these free attracted a sizable vote share towards it. This was particularly the case in colonies, where the BJP could win only three of the 12 seats dominated by the colony votes. The party roping in a number of star campaigners from Purvanchal like MP Manoj Tiwari also didn’t succeed in the face of the AAP’s freebies in these locations. Colonies’ voters overwhelmingly backed the AAP. Split wide open The senior party leadership though made a concerted effort in keeping the different disjointed party factions together but it came a little too late. For the last five years, the party’s internal disputes were being put up for public display repeatedly tarnishing the image of the cadre-based party. From fights over the choice of mayoral candidates to the distribution of tickets for elections, the party could not manage its factionalism, which in the end sprouted as more than 12 rebel candidates. Though it could manage to withdraw the candidature of three rebels, the other nine proved to be major vote splitters against the party. For instance, rebel candidate Kripanand Thakur, though himself lost to Congress candidate, but pushed the BJP official candidate Devi Kumar to the third place, with combined votes of both more than winning candidate. Party leadership under scanner With the party’s poor show, questions are being raised over the leadership of state president Arun Sood and senior party leader Sanjay Tandon, both played a key role in the management of the party’s campaign. “Local leadership wasn’t able to manage properly the resources available at hand. Even the coordination between different departments was not proper. The election committee didn’t include balanced party voices. Not much effort was put into the formation of the manifesto when the Congress and AAP were making attractive promises. Star campaigners were not even properly briefed about city-specific issues,” said a senior BJP leader requesting anonymity. Sood said, “We managed the campaign well. But with even the Delhi government putting in funds in its city unit’s campaign publicising the unworkable freebies, we didn’t perform on expected lines.” Former MP Satya Pal Jain said, “The party’s performance is shocking and disgusting. It is time for the party to introspect and find what are the reasons behind it.”

He was inducted into the party in the presence of AAP’s Punjab president and Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha. Mann said Kulwant Singh’s familiarity with Mohali’s issues and voters will help AAP a great deal. In a press conference, Mann said, “Chandigarh proved that people are the real power in a democracy. And the people of Punjab have already decided to depart from traditional parties to elect an honest government that prefers development.” Mann thanked the voters of Chandigarh for choosing AAP that was contesting Chandigarh MC elections for the first time.

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: NOTA spoils party for six winners, victory margin less than its votes||The none-of-the-above (NOTA) option played a spoilsport in all 35 wards of the city but hit six winning candidates the hardest as their victory margin was far less than votes in NOTA’s kitty. A total of 5,165 residents of different wards of Chandigarh rejected the candidates of various parties in the municipal corporation elections and opted for NOTA. Out of the total 3,85,830 votes that were counted on December 27, NOTA got 5,165 votes, constituting 1.33% of the total votes counted. It may be mentioned that in the 2016 MC elections, when NOTA was first introduced in Chandigarh civic body’s elections, 4,726 residents had exercised this option. NOTA gets highest in ward 28 and least in ward 8 At 441, ward number 28, comprising of Maloya village, EWS Colony, Sector 39 West, Gursagar Bhattal Colony, Gwala and Kumhar Colony, Sukhrana and Bansal Farm, had the highest number of votes in favour of NOTA while ward 8 had the lowest at 70. 103 candidates’ security deposit forfeited A total of 103 candidates who unsuccessfully contested the municipal corporation elections ended up losing their security deposit that was forfeited as they failed to get the required number of votes.

28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A cold night’s home||The floor is of plywood. The roof appears to be of white tarpaulin. The walls, too, are of the same white material. There are no windows.This is a home to many men, including Sanjay, Danish, Jawed, Hasim, Asif, Satish and Ameeruddin. These are actually some of the names that were jotted down last evening by the caretaker in the entry register of this night shelter for the homeless.It is 2pm and the place is empty, here in central Delhi. It permits free admissions only for the night. Although one person seems to be fast asleep on a bed. “He works here and is resting,” explains Ankit Sharma, the caretaker attending to his afternoon shift (see photo). Managed by an NGO, the shelter props up annually on this site every winter. Named Pagoda Tent, it does look like a tent with a conical top. Similar looking shelters for the homeless can be seen across the Delhi region these days — one in Ghaziabad is outside a shopping mall.Each bed here is furnished with a mattress, a green sheet and a blanket. Pointing to a plastic bag lying under a bed, Mr Sharma says that ”sometimes a regular (boarder) might leave behind his belongings for the day, but we are not responsible for those.” He clarifies that “most of the people who sleep here own virtually nothing… some may have a small job in labour (sic) or in catering, but they earn just enough to survive from one day to another.” Almost all tend to be from “pardes”, he says. In his 30s, Mr Sharma has been intermittently associated with Delhi’s homeless shelters for about a decade. This caretaker’s assignment is winter season’s “part-time job” opportunity to him. Nevertheless, “the experience I have gained in these shelters have been my real schooling… I’ve learned so much about the ‘duniya’ by talking to the men here, and knowing about their lives.”This particular shelter starts to fill up at around five every evening, and becomes a full house in three hours. “Most men fall asleep quickly… because nobody has mobile [phones], so there are no songs to listen to, no news to watch, no distractions to stay awake.”The men are woken up early in the morning with chai and buttered toast, after which they are expected to stay out of the shelter, until the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-cold-night-s-home-101640641845631.html
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||‘Delhi Model’, tapping into sentiment against rivals did the trick for AAP in Chandigarh||The “Delhi Model” worked wonders for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Chandigarh as it became the leading party in the House in its maiden attempt itself. Securing twice the absolute majority in Delhi Assembly, the party could only come second in the last Punjab assembly elections. But this time around, the party is in the pole position in Chandigarh municipal corporation, and set to elect its first Chandigarh mayor.Remarkably, it made substantial gains in terms of vote share since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it could secure only 3% of votes as its candidate Harmohan Dhawan even lost his poll deposit.AAP heavily banked on its “Delhi Model”, aggressively committing to deliver on its promises. A set of 23 “guarantees” were offered to the electorate, which mainly comprise a number of freebies.It packaged its “Delhi Model” and guarantees, focusing on Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal, into catchy jingles like, “Chandigarh mei bhi Kejriwal”.It promised free drinking water supply up to 20,000 litres per family per month. The promise resonated with many residents in the backdrop of the recent controversy over the water tariff hike and increase in sewage cess.The party smartly tapped into the resentment among the residents on the issue, which had earlier spilled onto the streets with residents’ welfare associations staging a protest for rollback of the hike.Parking was another controversial issue, which the party fully exploited to its advantage by offering free parking. The residents have been regularly expressing unhappiness over the increase in parking charges, and mismanagement in the parking lots. The party also promised free primary education, health care and free Wi-Fi. ‘Will deliver where Cong-BJP failed’The party leaders repeatedly drummed it throughout their campaign that unlike the Congress and BJP which “failed” the city in the past, AAP will make a fresh start.The MC has changed hands between the Congress and BJP in the last 25 years. Other parties like the now defunct Chandigarh Vikas Manch and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) could barely make a dent in the MC elections leaving Congress and BJP to dominate.Addressing his maiden rally in the MC elections, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal made party’s lack of political baggage in the city as his core of appeal to voters for the party.“The Congress and BJP have ruled the city for the last 25 years, since the MC was created. See what they have done to the city, they totally messed it up. You have seen their working now, give AAP a chance now. Let’s us show what can be done in the city, we will make Chandigarh no.1 city in Asia,” said Kejriwal.Both BJP and Congress found it hard to counter AAP on the lack of baggage it carried, though they attempted to pin down AAP on its “failures” in Delhi.The party successfully turned the anti-incumbency factor against the BJP of the last six years into a joint one against the 25-year rule of Congress and BJP. For instance, it took up the issue of Dadumajra garbage dumping site and blamed both BJP and Congress for it.Major inroads in coloniesThe AAP was able to make its message across successfully in the rehabilitation colonies and semi-rural areas of the city.Out of the 12 wards where the colony vote was predominant, the party won in eight. In villages too, the party had reasonable success securing three out of the six rural and semi-urban dominated wards.“The freebies clicked in these relatively poor locations. Also, in the villages the remnants of the anti-farm laws movements helped the party. In the villages, poor development track-record of BJP came in handy as people looked for options beyond the BJP, and opted for AAP over Congress.Congress’s loss AAP’s gainThe joining of the disgruntled party workers and leaders from Congress, helped AAP in bolstering its grassroots’ network. The party’s ground-level workforce had melted away after its 2019 drubbing. The fresh joinees before the elections and during the elections, many of got party tickets helped the party win a number of seats. It also helped it to edge out Congress and replace the BJP as the single largest party.

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||2022 polls: BJP, Punjab Lok Congress, SAD (Sanyukt) announce alliance||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Captain Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) on Monday formally announced their alliance for the Punjab assembly elections.Also, the alliance decided to form a six-member panel to discuss the seat-sharing arrangement. The announcement was made after Amarinder, SAD (Sanyukt) chief Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and BJP’s Punjab election incharge Gajendra Singh Shekhawat met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda in New Delhi. “The six-member committee, having two members each from all parties, will meet soon to finalise seat sharing as well as the alliance manifesto for a new Punjab,” said Shekhawat after the meeting that lasted nearly an hour. This was also the first meeting by Amarinder with Shah after announcing to form his own party. Amarinder’s aide Lt General TS Shergill (retd) was also part of the meeting. “Met with Union HM @AmitShah, @BJP4India President @JPNadda, Punjab Incharge @gssjodhpur & Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) President Sukhdev Dhindsa to discuss details of the alliance for the upcoming assembly elections. Look forward to working together to give Punjab a stable govt (sic),” tweeted Amarinder after the meeting. Senior BJP leaders privy with the development said both Amarinder and Dhindsa had a detailed discussion about the emerging political scenario in Punjab, especially after 22 farmer unions announced to contest the polls. Though there were no talks on the exact number of seats to be contested by any individual party, it is nearly certain that the BJP will be the major alliance partner and has conveyed to its allies that it will be contesting from no less than 70 seats. The saffron party wants to contest from most of the urban and semi-urban segments where at least 45% of the voters are either from the Hindu community or are scheduled castes (SCs) or other backward classes (OBCs). With Dhindsa-led SAD (Sanyukt) getting a jolt a few days back when its another senior leader Ranjeet Singh Brahmpura returned to the Badals-led Akali Dal, the BJP is no mood of giving more than 8-10 seats to the party, it is learnt. Hours after the meeting, the BJP’s Punjab unit received a confirmation about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab on January 5. Party’s state general secretary Subhash Sharma said the Prime Minister will visit Ferozepur to lay the foundation stone of PGIMER’s satellite centre. He is also likely address a public rally in the district the same day.

The farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) have been staging sit-ins on rail tracks in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Tanda, Tarn Taran and Ferozepur for over a week over their demand for a complete waiver of loans and outstanding electricity bills besides allotment of plots by the state government. An average 70 trains were cancelled daily from December 20 to 26, leaving the passengers in the lurch, it is learnt.At the Ludhiana city railway station alone, the authorities refunded ₹12.45 lakh to the passengers till Sunday. “This is just a fragment of the huge losses incurred by the railways due to the blockade of tracks by farmers across Punjab as most of the passengers book their tickets online these days,” said a senior official.This has become a big headache for the railways as trains have become a soft target for the farmers, he added.Even as the railways has requested the passengers to check the status of trains before leaving home, people continue to throng the railway stations, only to return disappointed.Passengers can check the status of their trains on the ‘Rail Madad’ portal’s helpline number 139, national train inquiry system application or on indianrail.gov.in, another official said. 
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||FSSAI registration number must on food bills from Jan 1: Mohali DHO||From January 1, 2022, it is mandatory for all food business operators (FBOs) to mention license/registration numbers on cash receipts, invoices and bills. District health officer (DHO) Dr Subhash Kumar said this rule is being implemented across the country from January 1, 2022, by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for the convenience of people. He said through this registration number, which is issued by the FSSAI or the health department, the customer would be able to ensure that shopkeeper from whom they are buying any food item has a license/registration number or not. “Sometimes when customer complaints against a shopkeeper or a food business operator, the health department may find it difficult to trace the shopkeeper’s complete address or details due to which the grievances are not resolved. Now if a customer complaints against a food business operator, then they can complain by quoting the license/registration number,” said the DHO. “Under the Food Safety Act, every FBO is required to obtain a food safety license or registration certificate but many people do business without license or registration,” he said. Dr Subhash added that every shopkeeper or even hawker or rehriwala dealing in food and beverages must get a registration certificate or license, for which there is no need to visit the health department’s office. The registration certificate or license can be obtained by applying online at www.foscos.fssai.gov.in for which a government fee is charged. He said several people visit the health department office to get a food safety license, but this process is fully online.

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||BKU Dakaunda decides against joining poll wagon in Punjab, won’t support SSM||Citing the organisation’s constitution, the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Dakaunda) on Monday said that it will neither participate in the Punjab assembly elections scheduled early next year nor support any political party, including the newly formed Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM). The decision was taken after a state-level meeting of leaders of the farmer union in Barnala town. The outfit decided to hold a “large rally” in the town on January 10 against the state government over its demands.Buta Singh Burjgill, state president of the BKU faction, said, “Though we will not participate in elections, we have decided not to oppose the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha. We have left the decision to the electorate to cast their vote. But we will continue to oppose the Shiromani Akali Dal, BJP, Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress because they have not fulfilled the promises they made in the past.”They will give an ultimatum to the Congress government in the state over their pending demands by holding a massive rally in Barnala next month, he added.Union’s state general secretary Jagmohan Singh said they followed their organisation’s constitution not to support any party. “Those part of the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha fought against the corporate sector along with us during the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws. Therefore, we will not oppose them like other parties,” he added. The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), Punjab’s biggest farmer outfit, has already said that farmer unions should focus on resolving issues of farmers through struggle, rather than hoping to gain anything from electoral politics. The union claimed that it will not support any party, but also has not given any call of poll boycott either.
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC elections: AAPsurge, a hung house and setbacks||Debutant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerged the leading outfit in the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) elections, winning 14 of 35 seats, but fell short of five seats for a simple majority, thus throwing up a hung House.The incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, was reduced to 12 councillors while the Congress won eight seats and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) managed one. The AAP, which had its first major electoral win outside Delhi, will need 19 councillors to install a mayor while the BJP, which has the advantage of one vote of sitting MP Kirron Kher in the House, would need 18 councillors to do so. Major jolt to BJP For the BJP, it was a major jolt as seven of its sitting councillors, including incumbent mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and two former mayors Davesh Moudgil and Rajesh Kalia, lost their seats. Sharma lost to AAP’s Daman Preet Singh by 828 votes while Moudgil was trumped by Jasbir Singh of AAP by 939 votes. Kalia could secure only 3,139 votes and came third after Jatinder Kumar of Congress (4,384 votes) and seat was won by Kuldeep Kumar, who secured 5824 votes. The four other councillors who lost are Shakti Devshali, Sunita Dhawan, Heera Negi and Bharat Kumar. Big losses for Congress too Among Congress bigwigs, party’s chief spokesperson and former councillor HS Lucky and former mayor Kamlesh have lost the election; including two sitting councillors, Satish Kumar Kainth, a former deputy mayor and Ravinder Kaur Gujral. Local Congress chief Subhash Chawala’s son, Sumit Chawla stood third from Ward number 14 with only 2,532 votes. Here, BJP candidate Kuljeet Singh Sandhu won by a margin of 255 votes against AAP’s Kuldeep Singh. Lone upsetting result in AAP was of election campaign committee head, Chander Mukhi Sharma, who lost the election by 285 votes to former NSUI leader and first timer, Sachin Galav. The closest fight seen in the election was of Gurpreet Singh of Congress, who defeated Bhupinder Sharma of BJP by nine votes. The second closest contest was between Suman Devi of AAP and Savita Gupta of BJP, where the margin was only of 12 votes. Sitting BJP councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu also won by a narrow margin of 11 votes against Harmohinder Singh Lucky. A significant win for AAP All 14, who have won in AAP are first-timers and most among them are rebels from the Congress and BJP. The AAP’s win is significant, as this was its first MC election. The party had unsuccessfully contested Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and 2014. In 2019, Harmohan Dhawan, ended up losing his security deposit as he could manage to get only 13,781 votes, which was 3% of the total polled. In 2014, AAP’s Gul Panag had bagged 1,08,679 votes. Riding on “freebies” announced on different occasions, AAP ran a boisterous campaign having a head start with the announcements of “guarantees,” and taking a major share of outdoor advertisement spaces. Though Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal and MP Bhagwant Mann had put in brief appearances, it roped in many other senior leaders from Delhi, including nine MLAs, who oversaw overall campaign. The party cashed in on farmers’ protests, rising prices and “poor management” during Covid-19 outbreak. Star campaigners fail to work magic for BJP On the other hand, BJP had roped in chief ministers from Himachal Pradesh and Haryana and other leaders from Punjab, Uttarakhand, Delhi and even from eastern states to woo a huge voter base of migrants in colonies. BJP’s campaign remained centered around its “development” of past five years, Hindutva with slogans of Jai Shri Ram and references to Ayodhya temple was also often used in rallies. The party, also left no stone unturned to showcase Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “work” and “image”. But it failed to impress the voters. Rebels spoil it for Congress The Congress, which has won in the majority of elections of civic body since its inception, ran a fledgling campaign. It failed to rope in leaders from Punjab. PPCC chief, Navjot Sidhu and chief minister, Charanjit Singh Channi, did not attend even a single rally, even as the city has a huge voter base from the state. Some rallies though were held by leaders from Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Rebellion within the party, is also appears to have led to the drubbing. The party lost its former local unit chief Pardeep Chhabra to the AAP, who took along him over a dozen local faces and gave organisational strength to AAP. Counting peaceful The counting started at 9am and remained largely peaceful. Recounting of votes had to be done in Ward number-4 where AAP’s Suman Devi won by a margin of 12 votes against Savita Gupta of BJP. Voting took place on December 24 in which 60.78% of the total 6.33 lakh voters cast their votes. As many as 203 candidates were in the fray with the ruling BJP, the opposition Congress and debutant AAP putting up candidates on all 35 seats. In the outgoing MC House, of the total 26 seats, the BJP had 20 councillors, Congress five and the Shiromani Akali Dal one. The number of wards had been increased this time after delimitation and merger of rural areas in MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-aapsurge-a-hung-house-and-setbacks-101640640534530.html

Thus, they might look towards Mathura,” Tikait said in a veiled attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Mathura on Monday.Tikait warned that riots could be instigated in Mathura and said if that happens it will affect jobs and work in the peaceful city. Tikait who was in Mathura on to end a more than 400-day old agitation in the district offered juice to agitating farmer and then addressed farmers who had gathered to hear him. “Beware of them and do not allow Mathura to become another Muzaffarnagar. They might instigate riots here to generate votes in their favour but this would bring business, jobs and day to day life to a halt,” the BKU leader said without naming any party.“They are looking for votes these days but are not finding them elsewhere. As such they are eyeing Mathura whose residents love peace and prayers and want things to remain that way,” he said. Political equations had changed drastically after the infamous Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013.About 150 kilometers from Delhi, Mathura is home to birthplace of Lord Krishna and where various litigations in Mathura courts have been filed by different organisations and individuals who claim that the Shahi Eidgah adjoining Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb by demolishing a temple in the 17th century. BJP leader and Mathura MP Hema Malini was the latest to demand a grand temple in Mathura.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, during his frequent visits to Mathura has however not spoken on the subject yet though earlier in December, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had stirred a row saying preparations were underway for the construction of a grand temple in Mathura on the lines of Ayodhya and Varanasi. UP minister and Mathura MLA Chaudhary Laxmi Narain also justified the demand for a grand temple at Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi. “If Sri Krishna’s temple will not be built in Mathura, then would it be built in Lahore or Rawalpindi in Pakistan,” he had asked. The Mathura administration however did not allow various right-wing organisations including the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM), Narayani Sena and the Janmabhoomi Mukti Dal to proceed with their ‘jalabhishek’ programme at the Shahi Eidgah on December 6.

The key speakers said that “plastic waste can be treated and handled scientifically only after all stakeholders come forward for the purpose”.“We will have to restore the autonomy to our villages where plastic was not in use traditionally earlier. But now, we have realised that plastic is slowly making its way into villages, which is not a good sign. We need to work together so that the old village life, where plastic was not in use, can be encouraged. We need to use alternatives of plastic material such as clay made glass,” said Justice Agarwal, adding that such seminars should be organised in rural areas where awareness needs to be generated among masses.“A plastic product takes 1 million years to merge with the soil. Therefore, the time is to spread awareness in all sections of the society, particularly in rural areas,” Agarwal added. Key speakers deliberated on the need that state and central government bodies, and the private sector should work together to discourage the use of plastic. “The governments, both at the state level and the central level, are coming up with policies, which will help in handling of plastic waste properly. But the need is that everyone takes part in this campaign,” said Mathuria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/plastic-waste-management-a-challenge-say-key-speakers-at-noida-sec-18-seminar-101640635013170.html

The victim paid the owners of the website after registering himself on it and being introduced to a woman who promised to meet him after he completed the formalities.The website kept increasing the payment amount, which the man kept paying. When he refused to pay any more, the woman threatened to frame him in a rape case, following which he approached the police.Police said between November 19 and December 9, the victim transferred around ₹65 lakh in several transactions to several accounts in West Bengal. The first transaction was just ₹1,000 (the registration amount) and the biggest transaction was ₹9.5 lakh. After paying the huge sum, he realised that he had been duped, as neither did the woman meet him nor was the money, which he was told was the security deposit, was returned to him.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the victim, a resident of Old Delhi Road, was browsing the internet on November 24, when he came across the mobile phone number of a company called Dating Circle.“Out of curiosity, I called the number. A woman who introduced herself as Shweta, an employee of the dating company, explained to me the benefits of dating through their company and encouraged me to try it once,” he said.Police said the victim was asked to register with the company after paying ₹1,000. The money was transferred into a bank account in Kolkata in the name of Moyna Bibi. “Shweta talked to me in such a manner that I was lured into registering,” the victim said.On November 26, the victim was introduced to a girl who introduced herself as Shruti. The company shared the mobile phone number of the girl and asked him to pay a refundable amount of ₹18,000. “I had a conversation with Shruti from my mobile phone. During this time, I would also receive calls from Shweta who would tell me to deposit more money,” the victim said.Rao said that the suspects told him that the amount would be refunded after some deductions after he met Shruti. The next day, he again received a call from Shweta and was asked to pay another ₹28,000. After a few days, he was asked to pay ₹50,000 more.“Shweta continued to ask the victim to deposit huge sums of money, promising him that the money will be refunded after some deductions after each meeting with the girl. However, the victim got suspicious, told her to cancel his registration with the company and return his money,” Rao said.He was asked to make another payment for cancellation. “I was told that if I deposited more money in their accounts, then the process for cancellation will be started and money will be refunded in instalments,” the victim said, adding that he then transferred more money.Despite his repeated request, the account was not cancelled, nor was his money returned. He was then introduced to one Rohit, who claimed to be a senior executive of the dating company. Rohit also asked him to make further payments to get a refund.Shruti then allegedly threatened to implicate him in a false rape case if he refused to make further payments.On December 17, the victim approached Gurugram police and filed a complaint. After an initial investigation, police registered the case at Udyog Vihar police station on Sunday under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.“A case has been registered and police are trying to trace the persons behind the fraud,” said Rao.

The study revealed that the antibody levels drop with the passage of time after vaccination. “Inference from our study is that antibodies decrease continuously with time and a booster dose is needed,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head of the department (HoD) of KGMU’s transfusion medicine who led the study. “We took samples from 500 health workers in three categories where first batch was of 200 such persons who have had their last/second dose of vaccine within six months. In all of them the antibodies were positive but showed a 42% decrease in the level of their antibodies,” Professor Chandra said. “The next batch was also of 200 who took the jab seven months back and of them 175 (87.5%) were antibodies positive. But the remaining showed either very low level of antibodies or tested negative in antibodies test. The overall decrease in antibodies level were 68%,” said Professor Chandra. A third group was of 100 health workers who had got their last vaccine dose eight months before. “This group showed 75% positive for antibodies and 25% were negative or had very low levels of antibodies with average decrease of 84% in their antibodies level,” Professor Chandra said. This is first of its kind study that has been done in state to know long term status of antibodies among the vaccinated. KGMU, a premier government medical institute, has over 9000 staff working on the campus including doctors, nurses, ward boys, sweepers and clerical staff. The study included all of these segments. “The idea was to check the need and significance of a booster dose. As covid infection is yet to be eliminated hence a threat of re-infection remains and apart from covid protocol a booster dose becomes significant,” said Prof Chandra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kgmu-study-stresses-on-importance-of-booster-dose-of-covid-vaccine-101640634473202.html

Gehlot said in the one-time loan waiver scheme recently introduced by the State Bank of India (SBI), agricultural loans classified as non-performing assets have been waived. He said 90% of the loan has been waived by the bank while the remaining 10% was paid by the farmer, and asked other banks to provide relief to poor farmers on similar lines.“The state government is ready to give 10% share of the farmer in this scheme. The aim of the state government and banks is to provide relief to the farmers,” said the chief minister. Gehlot said many efforts have been made by the state government to provide relief to the common man and to maintain the pace of development. He said farm loans of ₹14,000 crore from cooperative banks have been waived so far. The farmers’ loans from nationalised banks declared NPA on November 20, 2018, are yet to be waived.

Police said after the night curfew was imposed, many people have shifted their New Year celebrations from clubs, bars and restaurants to their homes and farmhouses.

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Committed to increase farmers’ income, says Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the state government is committed to increase the income of farmers and many initiatives have been taken in this direction.He said the state government is also making efforts for expansion of mandis and the government is striving to expand the mandis by strengthening proper processing technology and infrastructure while maintaining diversification in the agriculture sector.Khattar urged the farmers to adopt crop diversification and shift to fruits, flowers and vegetables instead of paddy. “Groundwater is available in limited quantity and to save it, we should leave paddy cultivation, grow other crops and take advantage of the schemes launched for crop diversification,” he added.He said the agricultural sector has seen rapid progress in terms of fruits and vegetables, dairy production and fisheries.Earlier, the chief minister had inaugurated an integrated pack house-cum-crop cluster centre at Taraori in Karnal district set up at a cost of about ₹5.50 crore by a group of farmers and a subsidy of ₹4 crore was paid by the government.Khattar said this pack house will play an important role in promoting agricultural diversification and help in achieving the aim of the Haryana government of doubling the income of farmers.This is the seventh pack house of Haryana and 50 more pack houses and crop cluster centres will be established in state to increase income of farmers.Besides this, the pack houses will also serve as an employment opportunity for workers, Khattar added.The chief minister said the pack house has facilities for washing, sorting, cleaning, packing and cold storage of vegetables so that they can be kept safe for a long time. This will increase income of the farmers and labourers working in the fields.Accompanied by state agriculture minister JP Dalal, the chief minister launched the Haryana Pragatisheel Kisan Samman Yojana and the reclamation of waterlogged and saline soil portal. Farmers can register themselves on it and avail benefits, he said.On a question regarding the formation of a political outfit by the members of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), Khattar said the move has exposed their political ambitions.“We had already announced that they had political motives behind the agitation and now, their desires are out in the open. Farmers will never accept them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/committed-to-increase-farmers-income-says-khattar-101640633514791.html
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Drugs case: Majithia moves HC seeking anticipatory bail||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Monday moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking anticipatory bail. A Mohali court dismissed his plea on December 24 observing that though his claims are of political vendetta, he himself was a powerful person in the state politics till 2017 during the SAD regime. The plea is likely to be listed for hearing either on Tuesday or Wednesday.Majithia was booked by Punjab Police under cognizable sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, including Sections 25 (punishment for allowing premises, etc. to be used for commission of an offence), 27 (A) ( whoever is financing any activities indulging in production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, use or consumption, import and export or deal in any activities pertaining to narcotic drugs) and 29 (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). These sections have the provision of imprisonment up to 10 years along with a fine as decided by the court. Majithia’s whereabouts are not known. The plea alleges that targeting the petitioner (Majithia) is one of the major election planks of the current government. “To fulfil the election stunt, the Congress government has been day and night browbeating officers to register false cases against the senior leadership of the SAD, including the petitioner. Witch hunting of the political opponents has gone to its peak,” the plea claims, adding that for the purpose, the government has changed three DGPs over the span of three months. The Bureau of Investigation has also seen three departmental heads/directors change, the plea added. Police officers have been forced and coerced to falsely implicate him or face transfers punitive action, the plea claims, adding that some officers have also been induced with promotions and plum postings, if they toe the line of the government.Rejecting Majithia’s bail plea on December 24, the Mohali court observed that the delay in lodging the criminal case cannot be a ground to presume that whole case against the applicant was false. His name cropped up in 2014 and the SAD remained in power till February 2017.Special judge Sandeep Kumar Singla also said that the FIR has been registered on the basis of report, which prima facie shows the “involvement” of the applicant in the drug trade and harbouring of accused involved in drug mafia. “All these facts and financial transactions and extend of complicity of the applicant needs to be thoroughly investigated which can be done only under custodial interrogation of the applicant,” the court had said, adding that the question on legality of the criminal case, whether it is borne out of political vendetta or not, cannot be a ground for grant of anticipatory bail. The plea in the HC claims that Siddharth Chattopadhyaya was given the additional charge of the DGP only to act as a “tool to advance the political interests” of the present government. The plea also referred to the controversy involving ADGP SK Asthana, claiming that he refused to investigate the matter and raised questions whether the matter can be investigated, it being sealed before the court; superseded by other reports and whether investigation can be initiated without the permission of the court. He has also accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of indulging in “unwarranted propaganda” and deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa demonstrating “intense hatred” towards him.The plea further says the report of the special task force (STF), which is the basis of the FIR, was either superseded or merged with the subsequent report of a state government committee. But this fact was ignored and the FIR was registered. Moreover, in the entire lengthy FIR, no fresh evidence has been collected or statement recorded, it says, adding that in all the drugs cases registered, trials have been concluded with the acquittal of some accused and conviction of others. None of the accused made any reference of the petitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drugs-case-majithia-moves-hc-seeking-anticipatory-bail-101640633512674.html

28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sahibzada Day will inspire us to fight against tyranny: Yogi||LUCKNOW : Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath observed Sahibzada Day at his official residence on Monday and remembered the martyrdom of four sons (Sahibzadas) of Guru Gobind Singh – the 10th guru of the Sikhs. He said Maharaja Ranjit Singh (the first ruler of the Sikh empire in the early half of 19th century) brought two tonnes of gold and transformed the Kashi Vishwanath Temple into “Golden Kashi Vishwanath Temple”. “Aurangzeb destroyed the temple, but Maharaja Ranjit Singh made it golden. The new India must decide whether Aurangzeb deserves being respected or the great Maharaja Ranjit Singhji. The Sikhs are a great inspiration for the new India,” said the CM. “Who does not know that Aurangzeb wanted the Sahibzade of Guru Gobind Singh to renounce their faith and abandon the teachings of their Guru? But they chose getting buried alive to protect the country,” said the CM. He said it was the divine tradition of Sikh gurus that never allowed anti-Sanatan Dharma intentions of foreign terrorists to succeed. “From Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, Sikhism is a wonderful amalgamation of power with devotion. This divine tradition had come to save India. Sahibzada Day will always inspire us to fight against tyranny and unrighteousness,” said Adityanath, adding that the existence of those who came with the intention of converting India to Islam had been erased. “Sikh tradition should be adopted in every Hindu household and should not be limited to gurdwaras,” he added. Wearing a saffron turban, the CM followed the rituals to commemorate the day. Accompanied by other ministers and officials, he also performed a ‘parikrama’ carrying the Guru Granth Sahib. On the occasion, the CM cited many historical events – from Babur to Aurangzeb’s reign. “Terrorists tried to convert the whole country to Islam and enslave India when Babur attacked India, but his intention was not allowed to be fulfilled by the Sikh gurus,” he said. He further said that the Sikh community was known for its dedication towards the nation. “It is well known who drove the Kashmiri Hindus and Pandits away from the Valley. But Guru Teg Bahadur Ji Maharaj was the one who protected the Kashmiri Pandits in the country,” stated Adityanath. In the presence of several dignitaries of the Sikh society, the CM also talked about efforts for the restoration of historically important gurdwaras in the state and the establishment of a museum focused on the tradition of Sikh Gurus. Notably, UP is the first state to observe Sahibzada Diwas since 2020 when chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that the sacrifice of the Sikh Gurus should be part of the school curriculum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sahibzada-day-will-inspire-us-to-fight-against-tyranny-yogi-101640633332570.html

28-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to deploy more marshals||MUMBAI: Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to increase its deployment of marshals across all 24 administrative wards in the city from the current 700 to an unspecified number to control crowds as well as monitor mask violations in public places. A senior official said a majority of these marshals will be deployed at beaches and prominent promenades in Mumbai on December 31 and January 1. According to data, BMC booked 15,144 people on December 25 and 26 for not wearing masks at public places, and collected ₹30.28 lakh in fines. The most number of violators (2,429) were fined in the A ward that includes the Marine Drive promenade, followed by 670 violators at H/West ward that covers the Bandra area. Dr Sangeeta Hasnale, deputy municipal commissioner, solid waste management (SWM) department, said, “We studied the footfalls patterns in public places during the Christmas weekend, and we will deploy more marshals in such areas. These include city beaches and promenades where we see heavy human traffic during the festive holidays.” The SWM department is responsible for appointing marshals and penalising people for not covering their faces. A civic official said most of the people fined during the festive weekend were either revellers or tourists in Bandra, Marine Drive and Girgaon Chowpatty. The official said that marshals will be allotted shifts for this weekend so that they can work at night as well. He said, “On the night of December 31, a lot of people gather at beaches and promenades. Even though there are some restrictions and celebrations are banned, we don’t want to risk anything. Besides beaches and open spaces, we will also deploy marshals in areas with bars and restaurants. We have fined a significant number of people at pubs for not covering their faces.” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said “A ward is a business district where the floating population is more than the actual population. The high number of violators over there clearly shows that those who were fined on Christmas weekend were not regular visitors as all the offices and other commercial establishments remain closed during weekends.” He said ward officials have been instructed to remain vigilant and take necessary action whenever there is any breach of conduct. “We have instructed all the 24 ward officers to ensure micro-level planning,” he said, after a review meeting with the municipal commissioner on Monday. At the meeting, Iqbal Singh Chahal, municipal commissioner said, “We have only restricted mass gatherings at public places and gardens between 9pm and 6am. Besides this, everything is operating normally. Our only request is that all the local people including the restaurant associations should not flout rules and allow unnecessary crowd within their premises,” said Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-deploy-more-marshals-101640633153994.html
28-12-2021||Kolkata||4 municipal corporation elections in West Bengal on Jan 22, results on Jan 25||KOLKATA: The West Bengal State Election Commission on Monday announced polls in four civic bodies in the state including Asansol, Bidhannagar, Siliguri and Chandannagar on January 22. Counting will be held on January 25. The announcement triggered protests from opposition parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and CPIM, which also walked out of the all-party meeting held by the panel earlier in the day.“The model code of conduct will come into force from Monday evening. The nomination process will start from Tuesday, and the last date of nomination is January 3. There are around two million electors in the four civic bodies,” SK Das, commissioner of the state poll panel, said.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhakhar, said in a Twitter post that though the Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, which proposes to carve out Bally municipality from Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), is still pending, the poll panel can hold HMC polls with 66 wards as in 2015.The opposition too upped the ante against the poll panel questioning why elections were only being held in four civic bodies and Howrah was not included in the list when the state government recently told the Calcutta high court that elections to five civic bodies including Howrah will be held in January. “They (SEC) and state government… have decided not to allow the new electors (who turns 18 in January 2022) to cast their vote. The BJP boycotted the all-party meeting,” said Arjun Singh, BJP MP. “The SEC is doing everything to favour the ruling party. We are not a party to this decision. We have boycotted the all-party meeting,” said Rabin Deb, CPIM leader.The poll panel, however, said that the dates of the elections were fixed in consultation with the state government as per law.“Civic elections are announced in consultation with the state government. We are not holding the elections to the Howrah Municipal Corporation for now as we have not heard anything on this from the state government. We have adopted the electoral roll published by the Election Commission of Indi which was updated on November 1, 2021,” Das said.Elections in another 119 municipal bodies, which are pending for more than a year, are likely to be held in February 2022. Earlier this month West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls by winning 134 out of 144 wards. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) finished second with three seats. The Congress and the Left won two wards each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/4-municipal-corporation-elections-in-west-bengal-on-jan-22-results-on-jan-25-101640633152576.html
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana cabinet expansion today||The council of ministers in Haryana will be expanded on Tuesday with an MLA each from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) likely to be inducted as ministers.The swearing-in has been scheduled for Tuesday afternoon at Haryana Raj Bhawan, a tweet from the Haryana chief minister’s office said.Sources said two BJP MLAs Kamal Gupta and Gian Chand Gupta were in the reckoning for a ministerial berth while JJP MLA Devender Babli is also likely to be accommodated. The expansion will also necessitate shuffling of portfolios.The council of ministers already has 12 members including the chief minister. While there can be a maximum of 13 ministers, including the CM in the Haryana council of ministers, as per Article 164 (1A) of the Constitution, successive governments have been flouting the constitutional cap by rounding off the 13.5% figure and inducting 14 ministers, including the CM.The Constitution states that the total number of ministers, including the CM in the council of ministers in a state, shall not exceed 15% of the total number of MLAs, thus meaning that Haryana cannot have more than 13 ministers including the CM.Ten MLAs were inducted in the cabinet on November 14, 2019 after the CM and his deputy were sworn-in on October 27, 2019 thus, forming a BJP-JJP coalition government.In the present scheme of things, the BJP has nine ministers including CM Manohar Lal Khattar and its post poll alliance partner, the JJP has two ministers including deputy CM Dushyant Chautala. Rania MLA Ranjit Singh is the lone independent MLA inducted as a minister.Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, who holds at least seven top-of-the-line portfolios, will have to let go a few after Tuesday’s expansion. Portfolios of some BJP ministers could also be shuffled.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP could win only 40 of the 90 seats, thus falling six short of a simple majority. Subsequently, it formed the government with the support of 10 JJP MLAs and independents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cabinet-expansion-today-101640633092462.html
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Derogatory remarks: UT DSP demands apology from Sidhu||Chandigarh: A Chandigarh deputy superintendent of police (DSP) has sought a public apology from Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu for his alleged derogatory remarks against the force. DSP Dilsher Singh Chandel has sent a legal notice to Sidhu in which he has sought public apology from him for making derogatory remarks against the police on December 18 at a public rally in Sultanpur Lodhi. Earlier, reacting to Sidhu’s video in which he had purportedly made some insulting remarks against the police while praising a well-built youth, Chandel said the leader forgo his security cover. “It is shameful that senior leaders humiliate the force which is guarding them and their family. If this is so, return the force (security cover) and move without them in public. Without force, even a rickshaw-puller will not listen to them,” said Chandel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/derogatory-remarks-ut-dsp-demands-apology-from-sidhu-101640632973887.html
28-12-2021||Mumbai||Surge continues for 7th consecutive day; Mumbai reports 789 new cases, 11 new Omicron variant cases||MUMBAI: After six consecutive days of rise in Covid-19 cases, the city reported 789 new cases on Monday. This indicates that the surge has been continuous although the number of new cases on Monday was marginally lower than that on Sunday (896). A positivity rate of 1.68% was reported on Monday.On Monday, 788 cases were reported taking the tally to 771,698 and three deaths which took the death toll to 16,373. The city reported a 96% recovery rate with 747,997 recoveries, while the mortality rate was 2.12%. There are 4,765 active cases in the city. Additionally, 11 new Omicron variant Covid-19 cases have been reported in the city, taking the count to 84.According to BMC officials, there is possibility of a further increase to 4,000 to 5,000 cases being reported daily if the same growth pattern continues for the next few days. As per data, a major spike has been reported since December 21 when more than 300 cases were reported, followed by close to 500 cases on December 22, and more than 800 cases in the last two days breaking the records of the past six months.A senior BMC official said, “If the same trend of a similar spike continues, the daily caseload might soon touch the 4,000 to 5,000 mark. However, we will have to wait and watch.” Despite a spike in the number of cases, BMC officials said they could not call it the beginning of a third wave, yet.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “This is too early to say whether the rise in cases is a sign of the third wave because most of the cases that are reported are either asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. The number of daily cases is fluctuating and there is no consistent trend. We will wait and watch the situation for the next one week before coming to any conclusion.”The Maharashtra Covid-19 taskforce members said that they will monitor the situation on a weekly basis for the next few days.Dr Rahul Pandit, director of critical care at Fortis Hospital and member of the state Covid-19 taskforce said, “There cannot be any projections for the surge or spike at this moment. We will have to wait for another 10 to 14 days to understand the pattern. Hence, we cannot assume about the beginning of a third wave right away.”“But right now, if we assume this surge is due to the Omicron variant, we will have a further spike in the number of cases. If this is Delta, we have reason to worry as hospitalisation may increase. However, this is not the time to panic but monitor the growth pattern on a weekly basis for the next few days,” Dr Pandit said.Another member of the state Covid-19 taskforce, Dr Shashank Joshi said, “We cannot assume any mathematical models right now to make any projections or assumptions. However, we need to closely monitor, considering the surge might be even bigger if this is the Omicron variant.”Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal held a review meeting with BMC officials from the public health department owing to the increase in the number of cases in the city over the past few days. Chahal directed officials to stay vigilant and ensure the availability of beds and oxygen supply, in case of a sudden spike. According to BMC officials, during the second wave, the highest oxygen requirement was 210 MT per day. However, if the need arises at present, the BMC can arrange 650 MT of oxygen on a daily basis with its storage capacity being 1,100 MT per day.Chahal directed aggressive testing of citizens in case of symptoms; jumbo centres to ensure ready availability of medical equipment in case of a surge; and the purchase department to procure medicines that might be required in case of a surge. Chahal also directed officials to make appropriate manpower arrangements at ward war rooms, including an adequate number of ambulances and the staff required to operate them.Whereas the BMC on Monday said that from January 3 onwards, it is planning to start vaccination camps inside colleges and university campuses in the city for vaccinating students in the age group of 15 to 18 years. The BMC said that it has already written to Mumbai university and sought a list of eligible students. According to BMC officials, the camps will be arranged by local ward offices. These camps will be exclusively for students below 18 years of age, who will be inoculated on a priority basis. Initially, one or two camps will be arranged in the wards depending on the population density and colleges present there. If the footfalls are higher, the number of camps may be increased in future.With inputs from Pratip Acharya||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/surge-continues-for-7th-consecutive-day-mumbai-reports-789-new-cases-11-new-omicron-variant-cases-101640632972447.html
28-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to award ₹22 cr contract for the construction of Malabar Hill treetop walkway||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to award a ₹22 crores contract to a private contractor for the construction of a 700-metre-long treetop walkway at Malabar Hill in South Mumbai.According to the proposal, the walkway will provide an uninterrupted view to the citizens of the Arabian Sea over the green cover of the Malabar Hills. This walkway will be similar to the treetop skywalks present at Singapore. The walkway will be 705 metres long, 1.5 metre high and 2.5 metres wide. The BMC had invited tenders for this project back in August 2021, however the estimated cost of the project was pegged at ₹12.66 crs back then.In the proposal to be tabled at the standing committee, the BMC said that only one contractor responded to the bid and that the contractor demanded ₹18.99 crs for taking up the project which was almost 50% higher than the estimated price. The BMC said that on further negotiation the contractor was ready to work at ₹17.73 crs which is 40 percent higher than the estimated cost and the overall cost of this project including tax rates presently stand at ₹22.49 crs.“The project will take place at a silent zone which is why the works could be carried out only during limited hours of the day. Due to this more labourers will be required to complete the job during the estimated deadline. Besides this the slopes of Malabar Hills is an eco-sensitive zone and construction work over there will be risky and more advanced machineries will be used. These factors automatically escalated the cost,” said an official.The proposal will be tabled in the standing Committee on Wednesday and work orders will be issued after the committee clears the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-award-22-cr-contract-for-the-construction-of-malabar-hill-treetop-walkway-101640632852671.html
28-12-2021||Noida||Noida administration increases Covid testing and tracking amid increase in cases||The district health department has increased random and focused testing in Noida amid an increase in the daily count of Covid cases, said officials on Monday. Nearly 2,500 to 3,000 Covid tests are being conducted in the district daily, as compared to 1,500 tests conducted per day till a week ago, said the officials, adding that the increase in the number of cases could be due to the higher number of tests being conducted at present. “All travellers from ‘at-risk’ countries are being tested after eight days of their arrival to India, and other travellers from abroad and within the country are also being tested randomly. Surveillance teams are also testing more people at present. For every positive case, an average of 17 contacts are being traced in the district,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. He also said that with New Year celebrations around the corner, officials concerned have been asked to enforce night curfew and other Covid protocols strictly, to ensure people’s safety. “Though Covid cases being reported are still not very high, the pandemic is not yet over. I hope people remember this while they celebrate different occasions,” he added. Total 113 Covid cases have been reported in the district during December, which is nearly double the cases reported last month. All the patients are in home isolation, except for a few travellers who had to be isolated mandatorily.“Preparing for more Covid cases essentially involves tracing and testing, along with having sufficient oxygen beds for severe coronavirus cases. Since Covid cases have been increasing this month, all patients have been either asymptomatic or have had mild symptoms, which did not need institutional treatment... Even if we get severe Covid cases, our oxygen preparedness has been enhanced by now... From the type of infrastructure we had during the second wave of Covid, our capacity is nearly eight times now, within six months,” Suhas LY said, adding that nearly 3,000-odd oxygen beds were occupied at the peak of second Covid wave, around April and May.He also said that the Covid Hospital in Noida Sector 39 is kept reserved only for Covid patients and has a capacity of nearly 200 beds. The capacity can be increased to nearly 400 beds, depending on the demand. The administration has readied 4,461 beds at 31 hospitals for Covid care, which will be made available as the demand increases. Of these, 618 are ICU beds and 440 are paediatric beds. “We were among the first districts in Uttar Pradesh to prepare a contingency plan. We have had discussions with private hospitals and briefed them about the situation and have also asked them to get all their staff fully vaccinated,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO). He said that even if the number of Covid cases increases, the situation can be easily managed if the infections continue to be mild or asymptomatic.On Monday, the district reported five fresh Covid cases, taking the active caseload to 56. 113 cases have been reported in the district during December, and the positivity rate is still lower at 0.7% in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-administration-increases-covid-testing-and-tracking-amid-increase-in-cases-101640632733018.html

28-12-2021||Mumbai||‘Construction of school on Ulhas River floodplains worrisome’||Mumbai: City-based environment group Vanashakti on Monday wrote to authorities, including chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, raising alarm over continued constructions within the high flood line of the Ulhas River in Badlapur, Thane district. Encroachment in the form of a private school is the latest to crop up in the region, despite previous orders of the National Green Tribunal prohibiting any building activity on the floodplains, in addition to an amusement park and several real estate projects pointed out Vanashakti (a petitioner in Bombay High Court, seeking to revive the water body).“On June 20, 2020, we had intimated that a wall was made on the river banks and reclamation was underway, however, we find that no action was taken and instead a full-fledged school is coming up on the river banks inside the high flood line of Ulhas River. Similarly, it has been seen that in the last five years, more and more areas of Badlapur are being inundated in monsoon due to the overflowing of the river. Instead of keeping the flood line intact and inviolate, more constructions are being encouraged,” wrote Stalin D, director, Vanashakti on Monday.These developments are particularly concerning, environmentalists said, in light of the Maharashtra government’s recent move to reduce the Ulhas’ flood line. In a Right to Information (RIT) response last month, the state government confirmed to Navi Mumbai-based environment group NatConnect Foundation that there is a plan on the cards to redraw the river’s flood line in Badlapur, at the behest of the urban development department. A meeting had been held on October 5 and presided over by state UD minister Eknath Shinde, who asked the state irrigation department to rework the flood line in Badlapur. However, the minutes of this meeting were not shared with Nat Connect, on grounds that there has not been any official decision on the matter.“Such a move will be disastrous for lives and property. In 2019, Ulhasnagar and surrounding regions in Badlapur, Thane, Kalyan, Diva, Mumbra and Asangaon came under the spotlight due to unprecedented flooding, which can almost certainly be attributed to constructions within the river’s floodplains. These were made possible because in 2015 the Maharashtra government scrapped its River Regulatory Zone (RRZ) policy, which prevented constructions up to 2kms from the flood line of all rivers. We need to bring these regulations back before the situation grows worse,” said BN Kumar, director of Nat Connect Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/construction-of-school-on-ulhas-river-floodplains-worrisome-101640632495625.html
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jallianwala massacre: Scotland Yard probes video showing Sikh declaring to assassinate Queen||London: A video has surfaced on social media in which a fully masked man, identifying himself as an Indian Sikh, is seen declaring to “assassinate” Queen Elizabeth II to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, prompting Scotland Yard to launch a probe, days after an intruder was arrested at the monarch’s Windsor Castle.The video, shared on Snapshot, is that of a fully masked man who identifies himself as Indian Sikh Jaswant Singh Chail and declares that he wants to “assassinate” the monarch in revenge for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, according to The Sun newspaper which obtained the video.Meanwhile, the 19-year-old intruder, who has not yet been named by the Metropolitan Police, is now being held over mental health issues.Scotland Yard officers were investigating the video reportedly linked to the intruder armed with a crossbow arrested at Windsor Castle on Christmas Day.The Metropolitan Police said the arrested suspect has been sectioned under the UK’s Mental Health Act after a mental health assessment and remains “in the care of medical professionals”.“I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done and what I will do. I will attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, Queen of the Royal Family,” the masked man is seen saying in the video.“This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race. I’m an Indian Sikh, a Sikh. My name was Jaswant Singh Chail, my name is Darth Jones,” he says.The massacre took place at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar during Baisakhi in April 1919 when the British Indian Army under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer opened fire at a crowd staging a pro-Independence demonstration, leaving scores dead.In the video clip posted on The Sun website, the ‘Star Wars’ film-like masked figure holds a shiny black weapon and speaks in a distorted voice.It was reportedly sent to followers of the man’s Snapchat account 24 minutes before armed security officers arrested him near the 95-year-old Queen’s private apartments.In a message sent on Snapchat alongside the video, the teenager wrote: “I’m sorry to all of those who I have wronged or lied to. If you have received this then my death is near. Please share this with whoever and if possible, get it to the news if they’re interested.” Police are also carrying out searches at a housing estate in Southampton, where the suspect reportedly lived with his family.“A 19-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon,” Met Police said in a statement.“Following a search of the man, a crossbow was recovered. The man was taken into custody and has undergone a mental health assessment – he has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals.“Inquiries into the full circumstances of this incident are being progressed by Metropolitan Police Specialist Operations,” the statement added.Prince Charles and wife Camilla are spending Christmas with the monarch at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, south-east England, after she took the decision to call off her traditional Christmas at Sandringham estate in Norfolk amidst a surge in COVID-19 cases.Officers from Thames Valley and the Metropolitan Police said they responded to the breach on Saturday morning and arrested the man from Southampton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jallianwala-massacre-scotland-yard-probes-video-showing-sikh-declaring-to-assassinate-queen-101640632493721.html
28-12-2021||Lucknow||Kashi textile traders, weavers protest against GST hike||The Kashi readymade garments association, weavers and textile traders on Monday staged a demonstration in protest against the proposed GST hike on various textile products from 5 per cent to 12 per cent. The traders and weavers unanimously demanded that government should roll back the proposed GST hike on various textile products.Recently, in the GST counselling meeting chaired by union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, it has been decided to increase the GST to 12 per cent from 5 per cent on readymade garments and footwear worth up to ₹1000 with effect from January 1, 2022. This change will adversely affect the business of retailers and wholesalers that are already passing through a bad phase due to subsequent two waves of Covid-19, said Shailesh Jaiswal, president of Kashi readymade garments association.A very large section of the country’s population buys this category of apparel and footwear, whereas 2 years ago because of the inequalities and difficulties of GST in this business, the GST on these items were reduced from 12 and 18 to 5%. As a result of the above decision, a huge increase in tax collection and sales was seen and many companies were forced to offer products in the MRP range up to ₹ 1000. Consequently, the government, manufacturers, traders, and the public were greatly benefited, said Jaiswal.In the name of tax restructuring in the GST Council, the decision to increase the GST of apparel and footwear from January 1, 2022, is completely impractical and illogical, said Patron Mahanagar Udyog Vyapar Samiti, Srinarayan Khemka. The proposed GST hike on various textile products is very painful for all the manufacturers, traders and public of the country, added Khemka.Traders will have to pay GST on the remaining stock unsold by January 1, 2022, which is not justified. We strongly oppose such hikes, said the general secretary of the association, Kailash Yadav and added that they unanimously oppose the decision to hike GST on textile products.Babu Bhai, a master weaver said, “Two subsequent waves of Covid-19 created a sort of disappointment in the entire textile sector. The outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19 calmed down. However, disappointment prevailed in the market till August. Since September, the market slightly improved as the traders from states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra placed new orders for silk yarn sarees weaved here. As soon as a few cases of Omicron were confirmed in Karnataka, most of the traders cancelled their orders. There is a slowdown like situation in the textile market again. Weavers are struggling to make both ends meet.”As soon as the proposed GST rate will be implemented, the prices of clothes will increase or go costlier due to which demand will dip which have to eventually compel to reduce production. Thus, the GST hike will cost dear to the weavers and many weavers would lose their jobs, he said and demanded that the government should roll back the proposed hike in GST on different textile products.Zubair Adil, general secretary of Bunkar Udyog Madal an organisation that works for the cause of weavers, said that if the new GST rates are implemented, the weavers will suffer badly. Around 3 lakh weavers are associated with the Banarasi silk and Banarasi clothes industry in the entire Varanasi region. The government should think of them.Manish Choubey, Anjani Mishra, Shri Vyapar Mandal Pandeypur President Hriday Gupta, Satish Gupta, Kamal Rupani, Shiva Agrahari, Amrish Nigam, Vijay Jaiswal Bhojubir Business Board President Om Prakash Gupta, Kishan Seth etc were present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kashi-textile-traders-weavers-protest-against-gst-hike-101640632432697.html
28-12-2021||Lucknow||Leopard may have gone back to its habitat, but Lucknow residents told to remain alert||LUCKNOW The leopard spotted in Lucknow’s Adil Nagar and Kalyanpur might have left these residential areas via a safe passage and found its way back to the forest area, said forest department officials who had been making efforts to rescue the feline for the past two days. The big cat seen on Friday night and Saturday morning had reportedly injured three people. “The leopard has not been seen in Adilnagar and Kalyanpur areas for the past 36 hours, the patrol teams have confirmed,” said divisional forest officer Ravi Kumar Singh, in a press statement on Monday. Though forest officials could not trace the animal, five patrol teams were still deployed in the areas as a precaution. “Among wild animals, leopards travel long distances in a short time. On getting safe passage, they can return to their natural habitat soon, if not terrorised unwarrantedly,” said Singh. He said reports of more than one leopard in these areas were baseless. Rescue operation was conducted at Presidency Inter College and an attempt was made to facilitate the animal’s way into the forest area 500 metres away. The department also advised locals to remain alert. “We are alert and avoiding going out at night. The animal will probably come out at night and escape into the jungle,” said Nityanand Mall, a resident of Sector-H, Jankipuram. Forest officials said people should move out of their homes in groups and keep a stick in their hand. Children should be kept inside and domestic animals should also not be left in the open. If people come across a wild animal, they should not chase or try to catch/harm it. If they spot an animal, locals can report it to regional forest official, Kukrail on mobile number 7839434285.

The surge in daily cases in Mumbai since the past six days and circulation of the highly mutated Omicron variant has prompted reactivation of all jumbo facilities in a phased manner.For instance, the 3,500-bed NESCO jumbo facility at Goregaon on Monday appointed eight doctors, 10 nurses and 20 ward boys. The facility plans to take the total staff strength to 39 doctors in the ward and 38 doctors in the intensive care unit (ICU); 50 nurses; and 63 ward boys even as provision has been made to hire more staff over the next few days if the need arises. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the facility, said, “Our occupancy for the past several weeks was merely 10 to 15 but in the last two days, the occupancy has increased to 39. As of now, we have built the strength to cater to 150 patients, but we can promptly appoint more people if the need arises.” During the second wave, the overall staff strength of the NESCO facility was 1,800.The staff in jumbo facilities is hired on a contractual basis with a majority being hired on three-monthly contracts. In addition to NESCO, the other jumbo facilities are located at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Dahisar, Marol, Mulund, Byculla and Worli. Of these, NESCO, BKC, Marol, Byculla and Worli have been reactivated while the rest have been kept on alert.Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of the BKC facility, said, “We had nearly 233 doctors and 300 staff nurses and ward boys during the second wave. We will be going back to the same staff strength by the first week of January. We have already started reappointing manpower.” Dr Dere said that about 150 doctors and 100 ward boys have already been hired.The bigger hospitals in the city like KEM hospital at Parel, LTMG hospital at Sion, and BYL Nair at Mumbai Central have also been kept as backup for serious patients. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair hospital said, “At the moment, the patients will be sent to the five jumbo facilities that have been reactivated, and if need be, all the bigger hospitals will also take in patients, similar to the second wave. All jumbo facilities have taken stock of their medicines and oxygen.”The 24 war rooms corresponding to the city’s 24 wards which had played a crucial role during both waves of Covid-19 in coordinating between patients and hospitals for beds have also started rehiring staff on call. Each war room had a staff strength of 15 to 20 people but the strength was reduced to half. “We had many teachers and medical interns who were let go for their duties, but all ward war rooms will be back to their original strength by January 15,” said Mahesh Narvekar, chief of BMC’s disaster management unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jumbos-start-re-hiring-staff-hospitals-on-standby-as-daily-cases-rise-101640631772408.html

We have administered both the doses of the vaccines to 326,787 senior citizens so far, and they will also be eligible for the ‘precaution dose’ accordingly,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in the district. According to the figures, Ghaziabad has an overall target of administering 2,702,167 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to target beneficiaries like healthcare workers and frontline workers, besides beneficiaries under the 18+ and 45+ age group. The district, as of Monday (December 27), has administered the first dose of vaccines to 2,589,244 people, and both the doses to 1,714,583 beneficiaries under different age categories. Ghaziabad has administered both the doses to 28,591 healthcare workers and 29,247 frontline workers so far. The health department is waiting for the directions from the state government about the exact targets of vaccine doses to be administered to the children and people from other age categories, said the officials. “The directions will have exact targets for each category, and we will consider the vaccination coverage accordingly. As of now, we do not have any shortage of vaccines, and the district has the potential to vaccinate over 100,000 beneficiaries -- a target achieved during a mega vaccination drive on September 27 -- in a day. So, if the target for the 15-18 age group is around the estimation, we will be able to vaccinate maximum of them in two weeks,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad. The officials said that they will roll out a plan for the vaccination drive, which would start in January, and speed up the process to provide maximum coverage to protect beneficiaries against Covid infection. At present, Ghaziabad is witnessing a rise in the number of Covid cases, with two fresh cases reported on Monday. The total tally of active Covid cases now stands at 85 -- highest since June (324), with 57 cases reported in December alone.

The NHAI has finalised the toll rates at nearly ₹2.34 per kilometre travelled on the expressway, from Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan to Kashi toll plaza in Meerut. According to the toll structure set by the authority, the toll for the full expressway route of 59.77 kilometres from Delhi to Meerut is ₹140 for light vehicles like jeeps or cars among others.“The tolling process on the DME is yet to begin, and after we get a go ahead from the NHAI headquarters, we will start with the system. We do not want inconvenience for the commuters,” said Arvind Kumar, project director of NHAI. He, however, declined to cite the reason behind the delay. Since the NHAI has implemented the ANPR system for reading registration plates of the vehicles entering or exiting the expressway lanes, the ANPR system will help deducting fare from the FASTag of passengers on the basis of distance travelled from both the points. FASTag is a device that employs RFID technology for making toll payments directly while the vehicle is in motion. FASTag (RFID Tag) is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables a customer to make the toll payments directly from the account which is linked to FASTag.According to the NHAI, the annual toll collection potential on the expressway is estimated to be nearly ₹111.39 crore with cars or jeeps or light motor vehicles accounting for nearly 82% of the traffic and bus or trucks among others, accounting for 14%. The 14-lane DME has four phases -- Phase 1 links Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan and Ghaziabad’s UP Gate; Phase 2 connects UP Gate and Ghaziabad’s Dasna; and Phase 4 connects Dasna to Meerut through a six-lane access-controlled alignment of 32 kilometres. Phase 3, which connects Dasna to Hapur, is just the widening of the existing highway.According to official estimates, Phase 1 caters to nearly 120,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day, 60,000 PCUs per day at Phase 2, and 40,000 PCUs per day at Phase 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/issues-in-monitoring-system-of-vehicles-no-toll-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-yet-101640631112171.html

We want four times the existing circle rates as land compensation as well as other benefits for housing land. The administration gave us two times the existing circle rate as compensation in stage one--that is not acceptable at all. If the administration will not offer us four times the circle rate, then we will not give our consent for the acquisition of the land,” said KP Singh, a farmer from Ranhera village.Farmers said that they will register their protest at the camps on January 7 and also protest on other occasions in the future.According to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the government offers four times the existing circle rate in rural areas and two times the circle rate in urban areas. These six villages, where the land is to be acquired, and where 1,334 hectares of land was already acquired under stage one, were classified as urban areas from rural by the Uttar Pradesh government in 2017.“Our main protest is regarding why our villages were included in urban areas, when it is a rural belt. It was to decide low rates for our land and to harass the farmers. In stage one, farmers were fooled, but now we will not let it happen if they will not offer us four times the circle rate,” said Dinesh Kumar, a farmer from Nagla Hukum Singh village.Land from six villages -- Karauli Bangar, Dayanatpur, Kureb, Ranhera, Mundhera and Nagla Hukum Singh villages -- will be used for setting up the second phase of the Jewar airport -- the third runway, and a commercial maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of aircraft centre. MRO units ensure the service worthiness of an aircraft with facilities for inspection and maintenance. According to the agreement, the government has to provide 1,363 hectares to the subsidiary adjacent to the existing airport site for the third runway and further expansion.“The farmers have a right to demand higher compensation for their land. But the administration will evaluate the compensation rate as per the provisions of the Land Act 2013. We will seek consent from them January 7 onwards as per the rules,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Gautam Budh Nagar.Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Jewar airport on November 25. The greenfield project is billed to be the largest in India, and will be the National Capital Region’s third, after the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) and the civilian terminal at Ghaziabad’s Hindon airport.Two runway pavements are being developed in the first phase, which is to be completed soon, said the officials. The project, which will be fully implemented in four separate phases, is scheduled to be done by September 29, 2024.

The users will be able to access applications through the internet and intranet. SSO will now be one digital identity to be used for all online services applications,” the council stated in an official statement on Monday.A senior official from IT department said that under this project, 49 citizen services and 3 NDMC employee services have been placed for access to avail the services through single login for which users will have to first make registrations. People can visit their website to avail the service, the official added. NDMC has claimed to be the first municipality that has implemented SSO to impart services to citizens as well as their employees. “During the lockdown period, we have increased the number of online services to eliminate the need for them to physically come to NDMC offices,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/common-sign-in-system-for-new-delhi-s-civic-body-online-services-101640630752151.html

Nandi was addressing a press conference in Gorakhpur regarding “Agaz 2022”, a proposed party summit aimed at reaching out traders and businessmen of the state, scheduled for January 8 in Kanpur. “By ease of doing business in the state, the double engine government is working hard to achieve the target of five trillion economy envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The improved law and order coupled with better infrastructure has given new pace to business activities in the state,” he said enumerating various development projects and government schemes that have helped traders. Nandi slammed the erstwhile SP regime for providing patronage to goons and added that there was terror among traders in Akhilesh regime as goons and mafias would extort money from them. The people used to say, “Jis gaadi pe Sapa ka jhanda usme baitha gunda”. (The goon sitting in the car on which the SP flag is) Responding to queries of reporters, Nandi said that UP was on the path of becoming the first state to have 17 airports, of which nine are fully functional while remaining eight were under construction. “These airports have given boost to tourism sector in the state, pushing it on the path of growth and development,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-govt-ensured-ease-of-doing-biz-in-up-by-eliminating-goons-nandi-101640630091794.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Best of times, worst of times: Delhi’s air see-sawed in 2021||Delhi recorded 197 days this year when the AQI was 200 or lower – the highest count of such days from 2016 -- bettered only by last year (227 days), when air quality was at its cleanest due to long spells under a lockdown. However, Delhi also recorded 24 “severe” air days so far this year, same as 2019 and only one less than 2016 (25), which was the worst year in terms of winter pollution, Central Pollution Control Board data shows.The trend indicates that while the city may have got some measure of control on its air quality in the non-winter months, the Capital is still unable to control smog build-up that plunges it into a public health emergency between November and January.Till December 27 this year, Delhi witnessed a combined 164 days of poor, very poor and severe air, which, while being higher than 2020 (139), was lower -- and following a consistent trend -- when compared with 2019 (183 days), 2018 (205 days), 2017 (212 days) and 2016 (245 days).However, Delhi recorded five prominent spells of “severe” air pollution this year. The first was between January 14 and 16 when three consecutive days of severe air led to the AQI touching 460 on January 15. Three spells were then recorded in November, the first occurred from November 5 till November 7, with the AQI peaking at 461; then from November 11 to November 13 with the AQI peaking at 471; and a four-day long spell from November 25 till November 28. The fifth prominent spell, and also the longest occurred in December this week, with six consecutive days of severe air recorded between December 21 and December 26.While six severe days were recorded in January, 11 were recorded in November, and 7 have been recorded so far in December.An AQI between 0 and 50 is “good”, between 51 and 100 is “satisfactory”, between 101 and 200 is “moderate”, between 201 and 300 is “poor”, between 301 and 400 is “very poor” and over 400 is “severe”, according to the per CPCB index.Delhi recorded its cleanest air day – the only day of “good” air this year, on October 18, with rain bringing down the AQI to 46. The total number of good, satisfactory and moderate air days doubled since 2016 (108), with 197 such days recorded so far this year, the highest after last year, which was impacted by lockdowns due to Covid-19.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy says the long-term trend is good, with the total number of good, satisfactory and moderate air days increasing in Delhi. However, in winter, the smog build-up continues to remain prominent with prolonged spells being recorded in NCR. “What we are seeing is that air is becoming cleaner throughout the year, but we are still unable to control the smog build-up that happens from November onwards. While this is happening across all of northern India, it is lasting longer in NCR,” says Roychowdhury, attributing this year’s spell of 11 severe days in November to a late start in the stubble burning season, along with a delayed monsoon.“Stubble burning which generally picks up pace from October 15 was pushed to a narrow window in early November as the withdrawal of the monsoon was quite delayed. This has made November more severe. However, December’s intense spell shows background emissions are high even without Diwali and stubble burning,” she said.This year, October was the cleanest in the last seven years, with an average AQI of just 173. In comparison, November was the worst November in the last seven years, with an average AQI of 376 for the month.Santosh Harish, Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) says sustained efforts to switch to cleaner fuels and to eliminate or reduce certain sources of pollution are clearly showing up in the long-term trend, but even they are not enough to control winter’s pollution spikes. “While it is encouraging, data clearly shows we are unable to get rid of the winter smog. We have been unable to make any progress in terms of stubble burning in the region and it still feels we are reinventing the wheel in sectors such as vehicular pollution, construction and burning of waste,” says Harish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/best-of-times-worst-of-times-delhi-s-air-see-sawed-in-2021-101640629671676.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||‘Shutdown of health services’: Doctors after protesters detained||Resident doctors protesting against the delays in NEET postgraduate counselling near central Delhi’s ITO on Monday alleged that the police thrashed and detained them, and announced a “complete shutdown of health care institutions”. “A black day in the history of the medical fraternity of the nation. Resident doctors, the so called ‘Corona warriors’, protesting peacefully to expedite NEET-PG counselling 2021 in Delhi were brutally thrashed, dragged and detained by cops. There will be a complete shutdown of all healthcare institutions today onwards. The medical fraternity of the nation must condemn this act in strongest words and come forward in support. We urge all state RDAs of the nation to join the agitation. We all stand united in this fight against injustice,” the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association India (Forda) said in a statement on Monday.Later in the evening, hundreds of doctors from Safdarjung hospital who were marching towards the residence of Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya were allegedly detained at the Sarojini Nagar police station.Forda president Manish (who goes by a single name) said at least 3,000 doctors were detained by the police at Sarojini Nagar. “We had planned a peaceful march from Safdarjung Hospital till health ministry’s residence at Tughlaq Road, but we were not allowed. We started around 9pm but were detained almost immediately. There were around 3000 of us, and each one of us was detained,” he said.A senior police official said around “200-250 people” were protesting outside Sarojini Nagar police station. “We have not detained a single person till now and are trying to pacify them,” said a senior police official. The Delhi Police also denied the allegations of assaulting protesters at ITO, and said that 12 protesters were briefly detained from the agitation site and taken to the Rajendra Nagar police station, where they were released later.Manish confirmed that the detained doctors were released but added they would continue with their protest. “No solution has been found to the problem yet. Resident doctors have not been working for almost 10 days now. We were promised a solution within a week after having met the [Union] health minister but it has been four weeks and there is no solution in sight. We have had four rounds of meetings so far to no avail.”Union health ministry officials did not respond to requests for comment.Forda tweeted and retweeted various videos of hundreds of doctors inside the Sarojini Nagar police station on Monday evening. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also shared a video of the police personnel trying to remove protesters from ITO, adding that he supported the doctors. “I support the #covidwarriors against the cruelty of the Union government,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. Resident doctors have been protesting delays in counselling process, which is now pending the outcome of a batch of petitions being heard by the Supreme Court over economic reservations. Doctors have asked the government to expedite the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shutdown-of-health-services-doctors-after-protesters-detained-101640629431993.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||All ‘non-essential’ movement off limits in Delhi after 11pm||Night curfew will be enforced in the national capital between 11pm and 5am with immediate effect, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority directed on Monday, prohibiting all non-essential movement at night as it rushed to contain the spread of coronavirus.Delhi saw an uptick of 0.68% in infections on Monday. The curfew will dampen new year celebrations, and affect restaurants, bars and movie theatres, which are trying to recover after being hit hard due to pandemic restrictions.Restaurants, bars and other non-essential establishments will have to down shutters by 10.30pm to allow time to staff reach home before the curfew. No e-passes will be issued for any non-essential movement.Individuals transit is prohibited, except for emergency staff, media, essential goods delivery and people going to and from railways stations, bus terminuses and the airport. Those seeking medical care have to show documents justifying movement. Visits to neighbourhood stores are allowed.There is no restriction on transport of goods, and no separate permission or e-pass are required.“The status of COVID-19 in Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that numbers of COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly over the last few days and positivity rate has also increased, besides concomitant increase in new Omicron variant of COVID- 19,” the authority said in its order issued Monday morning. “Therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in the city with immediate effect as an emergency measure for wellbeing and safety of people.”District authorities will to deploy enforcement teams to enforce the curfew. “No exemptions will be allowed except those mentioned in the DDMA order,” a district magistrate said on condition of anonymity. “No e-passes will be allowed for any other activities because the night curfew window is only for six hours.”Public transport will ply for exempted persons during the curfew.DDMA has asked district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to deploy staff at places where crowds might gather. They have been asked to adequately inform and sensitize field functionaries about strict compliance.“In case any person is found violating the DDMA order, they will be proceeded against as per Section 188 of IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and other provisions of section 51 to 60 of Disaster Management Act, 2005,” an official said.There is not much scientific evidence about the efficacy of night curfews, an expert said.“At night, markets are not as crowded as in the daytime, except at night parties. Curfews are rarely used as a public health measure because this promotes negative behaviour of corruption, and deliberate violation,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. “Infected people transmit the Omicron variant. Therefore, avoiding unnecessary travel, party, celebration, shopping, etc., is useful.”“The metro cities have a night life and, due to less aggressive enforcement exercises at night to work as a deterrent, chances of Covid protocol violations by people increase,” a district official said, not wanting to be identified.Restaurateurs are badly hit due to night curfew. People who had booked tables for December 31 have already started cancelling. The night curfew will reduce the restaurants’ operational hours, resulting in loss of business in the peak season, said Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, a trade body.“The night curfew will not make much difference to shops, but it will hit cinemas, restaurants, hotels and bars industry,” said Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trader and Industry, an umbrella association of traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-non-essential-movement-off-limits-in-delhi-after-11pm-101640629251622.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||17-year-old found with throat slit in southeast Delhi, 1 detained||A 17-year-old boy was found with his throat slit in southeast Delhi and another 16-year-old boy was shot dead in Rohini in two separate incidents on Sunday, police said.In the first instance, police said that the 17-year-old was allegedly murdered by his minor friend after an argument while consuming drugs. Police said they have apprehended the latter.The 17-year-old’s body was found in a garbage yard near the JJ Colony in Madanpur Khadar on Sunday morning, hours after he left home the previous day.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey said that they received a call at 10.25am on Sunday. “His body is lying in a vacant building (used as a garbage yard by locals) in Madanpur Khadar area. Police reached the spot and identified the deceased... A kitchen knife was lying nearby,” said the DCP.Police said a case was registered immediately at the Kalindi Kunj police station, following which the crime scene was inspected and the body shifted to AIIMS hospital mortuary.According to police, the 17-year-old’s brother said that the victim had stepped out of the house on Saturday evening, saying that he will return in some time.Upon questioning the victim’s friends, investigators learned that he was last seen with one of his friends, who was found absconding when they reached his house. The boy was subsequently apprehended from Madanpur Khadar area during searches. Police said they recovered blood-stained shoes, sweater, shirt, face mask and other items from a jungle in Jasola Vihar.The juvenile told the cops that he had an argument with the victim while consuming intoxicants, and allegedly killed him in a fit of rage.Meanwhile, police are yet to find any leads in the second case where a 16-year-old boy, who had allegedly gone out with friends to consume hookah, was found dead with a gunshot injury in Rohini’s Budh Vihar area on Sunday.According to police, his family reportedly found him in a nearby room -- allegedly rented by the victim and his friends -- after one of the neighbours heard the sound of gunfire and alerted them. They rushed him to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Police have sent the body for post-mortem.Police said they are searching for other people who were present in the room when the incident happened. “Only after the accused is caught will it be clear why the boy was murdered,” said a police officer, adding that they are also scanning CCTV footage from the area for leads.Officers said it is not clear if the boy was gunned down or if it is a case of misfire.Police said the room, which is some distance away from the victim’s home, was frequented by the victim and his friends to hang out and smoke hookah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/17yearold-found-with-throat-slit-in-southeast-delhi-1-detained-101640629071442.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 concerns keep kids away from in-person classes in Delhi||Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in the national Capital, attendance in schools across Delhi is starting to dip even as schools take measures to sensitise students about vaccination with the hope that learning continues uninterrupted in the coming year. Schools said that attendance had started fluctuating and attributed it to the uncertainty surrounding the new Covid variant, Omicron, along with inclement weather conditions. Many schools that were earlier planning to hold physical classes during the upcoming winter break will also switch to online classes to complete the syllabus, keeping in mind the rise in Covid cases. Along with these precautionary measures, some schools are also supplementing classes with webinars and orientation sessions, emphasising the merits of vaccination.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that the school was treading carefully while planning future activities, considering the drop in attendance. While attendance hovered between 60-70% last week, there has been a nearly 10% drop this week with attendance dipping to 50% now. “There is a big question mark on the weeks ahead due to Omicron. There has been a drop in attendance by around 10% in the last week. With so much uncertainty, we are not very sure about the manner in which we should plan ahead. We don’t know how to plan the final exams and other activities since there is uncertainty pertaining to school closure. We are thinking of all possibilities including possible school closure while planning activities,” said Arora. In view of the Covid situation, the school has also reached out to a hospital to conduct awareness sessions regarding vaccination for children aged above 15 years and is exploring the possibility of setting up vaccination centres for students on campus. “We have tied up with a hospital for opening a vaccination centre for students within the school. We had opened a centre for staff and the public alike earlier as well. Since students in grades 10 to 12 are over the age of 15, we want to facilitate vaccination for them at the school itself,” said Arora. The school will be conducting a set of webinars for the awareness of students and parents before the actual vaccination process begins in January. “We are thinking of starting webinars in collaboration with a hospital starting from tomorrow so that parents and students gain confidence and are able to get their vaccination-related queries resolved,” said Arora. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that the school had been receiving queries from parents wondering what would happen to in-person classes in the face of rising Covid cases and wanted their children to get vaccinated before sending them to school. Joshi said that while students in certain classes were attending school in good numbers due to ongoing tests, very few students in other classes were coming to school. “We are getting queries from parents who are concerned about rising Covid cases. Many are waiting to vaccinate children before sending them to school. If the positivity cases rate rises, parents will stop sending their children,” said Joshi.Aprajita Gautam, president, Delhi Parents Association, said that while parents wanted children to get back to routine school life, they were worried about the rise in Omicron cases due to which they were fearful about sending children to school. “After a gap of six months, cases are on the rise again. The fear and uncertainty are back once again. Parents are once again unsure about sending children to school. The initiation of vaccination might ease concerns for students in Class 10 and above after January, but children in other grades will continue to be unvaccinated,” said Gautam. A spokesperson from Apeejay Education said that Apeejay educational institutes, which include schools, would continue to organise camps on campus to facilitate vaccination. Earlier this year, the chain of schools had organised vaccination camps for its staff, parents, and the general public. “We look forward to working with our health partners and the government to continue to organise camps at our institutions to achieve 100% vaccination of all eligible age groups,” said a spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-concerns-keep-kids-away-from-in-person-classes-in-delhi-101640628891960.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Civic bodies to suggest increasing fines for mosquito breeding spots||Senior officials of the municipal corporations in Delhi have said that they will recommend increasing fine imposed on owner of premises where mosquito breeding is found from the current ₹500 to ₹5,000, as well as amending the building bylaws to ensure “mosquito-proof” structures.The national capital recorded 23 fatalities and 9,545 cases of dengue this year, according to the latest municipal corporation data. This is the second highest death and case count since 2015, when 60 people died of dengue and 15,687 got infected.Noting that no corrective measures were taken by authorities to prevent the increase in dengue cases, the Delhi high court on Friday directed all civic bodies to constitute a task force headed by their commissioners to take steps to prevent the city from “being infested by mosquitoes”.Expressing its displeasure over the “inaction of the authorities”, the court said, “Every year, for the past 20 years, we are suffering the same thing. And nothing seems to happen. Why does the Commissioner not take the moral responsibility and tender his resignation? What prevents him?”A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said currently a fine of ₹500 is imposed if domestic breeding checkers and inspectors find mosquito larvae in stagnant water in a property. “The fines were fixed over two decades ago, and we are going to recommend that at least a 10 times hike should be implemented. We will send a proposal to the Delhi government’s health ministry,” an official from public health department said.According to the Delhi Prevention and Control of Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya or any Vector Borne Disease Regulations, 2021, that were notified on October 14, 2021, all hospitals and health institutions have to mandatorily report any case of these diseases to the government.The regulations also empower the domestic breeding checkers, officials appointed by the civic agencies to monitor various premises for mosquito breeding, who are often denied entry by owners of properties.“For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of these regulations, the inspecting officer may.. enquire and inspect any land or building within his jurisdiction and the occupier of such building shall give all facilities necessary for such entry and inspection, and supply all such information as may be required for the aforesaid purposes,” the notification states. Violation of the order is punishable under section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), the regulations said.The annual data from the vector-borne diseases report released on Monday showed that mosquito breeding was found at more than 196,000 houses and properties.A public health inspector who asked not to be named said a fine of ₹500 cannot be a deterrent. “Breeding checkers are often not allowed to enter houses. At construction sites and other large premises, we also add the cost of insecticides used to kill larvae to increase the quantum of fine,” the inspector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhicivic-bodies-to-suggest-increasing-fines-for-mosquito-breeding-spots-101640628771439.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: JNU session on sexual harassment draws flak from students, teachers||A public invitation for a counselling session on sexual harassment issued by the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has come in for heavy criticism from students and faculty who claimed that the language trivialised the issue.The invite, which is available on the university’s website, outlines the details of the event scheduled for January 17.“In addition to its usual course of action, ICC, JNU would like to introduce A COUNSELLING SESSION, on a monthly basis, for all aspiring students who wants to know DOS and DO NOT’S in regard of sexual harassment (sic),” the invite reads.Flagging objections with the notice, several students and teachers said that one of the lines under the subhead “Why is this counselling session required?” trivialised sexual harassment by reducing it to “banter”, and another line placed the onus of harassment on women.“Boys generally cross (sometimes advertently) the thin line between friendship’s bantering and sexual harassment (sic),” reads one of the pointers under the former subhead. Another pointer reads: “Girls suppose to know how to draw a tangible line (between them and their male friends) to avoid any such harassments (sic).”In a Facebook post, JNU professor Ayesha Kidwai said that the invitation showed why women did not want to approach the ICC, saying that they feared being punished themselves.“In its assessment, the line between sexual harassment and ‘boys being boys’ is so thin, that the benefit of the doubt whether it was ‘advertently’ crossed has to be given to them even in this short notice in advance,” she said.She said that one of the points listed in the notice implied that women were “asking for harassment”. “So, if a woman complains to the ICC, then the onus is on her to prove that she did draw that lakshman rekha dark enough,” wrote Kidwai.She said that the notice demonstrated how the loss of Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment -- the predecessor to ICC -- has effectively silenced all discussion of sexual harassment on the JNU campus. She added that the ICC and its supposed awareness programmes had created an atmosphere that was “virulently hostile to sexual harassment being seen as misconduct, a human rights violation, and a blatant exercise of patriarchal and hierarchical power in the workplace”.JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon too said that the language of the notice placed the onus of sexual harassment on women. Moon said that the ICC had not engaged with any gender sensitisation programmes in the past two years and had become more or less defunct.“Sexual harassment is being seen as bantering. The implication is that it’s not something serious and is something that has been done inadvertently. In the past also, we have seen how remarks have been made against complainants who have approached the ICC,” said Moon.In a written statement, student group AISA said that the notice “exposes the attitude of victim-blaming which the ICC has been practicing.” “This counselling session is a sham and will only lead to making JNU an unsafe space for women,” the statement said.JNU officials did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhijnu-session-on-sexual-harassment-draws-flak-from-students-teachers-101640628352802.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||47 Tihar Jail staff in Delhi under scanner after biometric mismatch||Forty-seven officials of Delhi’s three prisons were issued a “show cause notice” and their salaries put on hold after a biometric verification drive conducted inside the prison last month detected a mismatch with the records saved during their recruitment test, senior prison officers said.Officials now suspect that these 47 staffers may have got the jobs by sending other candidates to take the written exam. Under the recruitment procedures, the biometric data of applicants are recorded when they turn up for the written test.Sandeep Goel, director general of Tihar prisons, said, “A biometric verification drive was conducted by DSSSB in the prisons department in the last week of November. All the newly joined candidates of Delhi Prisons from 2019 onwards (warder and assistant superintendent ranks) recruited through the exams conducted by DSSSB (Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board) were screened by matching their biometrics with the data preserved at the time of recruitment. As a result of the exercise, 47 cases of preliminary mismatch have been detected. Further action will be taken after final report is received from DSSSB.”The officials are employed as warders (40), matrons (2), and assistant superintendents (5) at the three prison complexes in Tihar, Rohini, and Mandoli, where around 19,000 prisoners are lodged. All of them were posted in different sub jails within the three jail complexes for the last two years.Prison officers said the show cause notice and salary suspension is just the first step. The prison department, which comes under the Delhi government, will share their replies with the DSSSB -- the government body which conducted their recruitment. Based on the report by the DSSSB, the prison department is likely to approach police.A prison officer, who asked not to be named, said the biometric verification drive was conductedafter the DSSSB received an anonymous complaint that some officers in Delhi jails had cheated the system to get a job.Prison officers said the fraud is alarming because the three prisons in Delhi have many prisoners – some with threats to their life, according to intelligence bureau. Prisoners such as underworld don Chhota Rajan, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal Christian Michel, and many others involved in terror cases are lodged in these jails. “Of the 47 officials, those who were posted in sensitive corners of the jail were immediately pulled out of such duties,” said an officer, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/47-tihar-jail-staff-in-delhi-under-scanner-after-biometric-mismatch-101640628051434.html
28-12-2021||Delhi||Six more dengue deaths in Delhi take annual toll to 23, highest since 2015||Delhi added six more dengue deaths that took place between October and November, taking the toll due to the mosquito borne disease to 23 this year -- the most fatalities since 2015 when 60 people succumbed to the disease, according to the weekly report compiled by the three municipal corporations.According to the latest report released on Monday, all six fatalities were those under 15 years, including an 8-month-old from Kirari in northwest Delhi who died in early November. The latest report also added 131 new dengue cases to the tally during the last week. The annual dengue case count in the Capital now stands at 9,545.Officials said though no dengue death was reported last week, the latest fatalities were added to the weekly report after the municipal death audit committee confirmed dengue as the cause of death in the six cases.Delhi reported the maximum fatalities and cases of the disease in 2015, when 60 people died of dengue and 15,687 got infected. Last year, the city reported only one dengue death, two in 2019, four in 2018 and 10 each in 2017 and 2016, according to the municipal data.This was the last weekly dengue report of the year, that is released every Monday. According to the data compiled this year, of the 23 fatalities in 2021, 15 were minors. Of these, six were in the 11-15 age group and eight were under 10 years. “The youngest was an 8-month-old boy from Kirari who succumbed to dengue in Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya Hospital on November 3,” a municipal official said.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket, said the city witnessed erratic rain during 2021, which proved to be a major factor in the increased number of cases. “Moreover, type-2 of dengue was circulating in Delhi as well as Uttar Pradesh, which is more virulent,” he added.According to health experts, there are four dengue strains—type-1, type-2, type-3 and type-4. Type-2 and type-4 are more virulent strains while type-1 and type-3 are milder. Type-2 leads to haemorrhagic fever and shock.Civic officials said that all the cases brought before the death audit committee so far have been processed. Once a dengue or malaria-related death is reported by a hospital, a nine-member expert committee audits all documents to check whether it was indeed an infection-related death and whether the origin of the case was in Delhi.The committee also takes a look at other aspects such as co-morbidities, before attributing the death to a vector-borne disease. If a patient is severely ill due to other diseases and the main cause of death is not dengue, then the death is not attributed to the mosquito-borne disease, an official explained.The vector-borne disease data between 2010 and 2021 shows that this is only the fourth instance when the number of infections has crossed 5,000-mark. A bulk of this year’s unusually high number of dengue infections was reported in November, which logged 6,739 cases. Trends from previous years show that the number of dengue cases in the city usually peak in October; officials attributed the delayed peak of infection this year to the delayed monsoon and the slow arrival of winter. Civic bodies also attributed the high number of cases to the government making a dengue a notifiable disease in mid-October.“Before the notification, 36 hospitals would share weekly data with the malaria headquarters under the ‘sentinel surveillance system’. But now, corporations are getting data from 180 healthcare facilities,” an official overseeing the data compilations in the anti-malaria headquarters said.Reacting to the record high number of dengue cases this year, the Delhi high court on Friday directed local bodies, including the three municipal corporations, to constitute task forces to monitor and control the mosquito infestation in the city. The court also asked the government to increase the fine imposed on owners of premises where mosquitogenic conditions are found. “Currently, a fine of just ₹500 is imposed, which is not a deterrent. We will soon send a proposal to raise it to ₹5000 per offence,” an official added.Dr SP Byotra, senior consultant and chairman of the department of medicine at Sir Gangaram Hospital, said while the very high number of infections can be attributed to the delayed monsoon, there were lapses on the part of people as well as authorities. “Why do we wake up so late when the infection has already crossed a limit? The dengue control programme should be run all round the year. We should start the drives from March next year. Vector-borne diseases are bound to arise, and like other countries we should have institutional mechanisms that function all 365 days to deal with them,” he added.The weekly report released on Monday said that of the reported 9,545 dengue cases, 2,645 were logged in the jurisdiction of north MCD, 2,570 under SDMC and 1,129 under EDMC. During this year, domestic breeding checkers of the three civic bodies detected 196,000 cases of mosquito larvae in houses across Delhi and issued 150,000 legal notices for mosquitogenic conditions. The corresponding number of houses in which mosquito breeding was detected was 109,000 in 2020 and 179,000 in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/six-more-dengue-deaths-in-delhi-take-annual-toll-to-23-highest-since-2015-101640627811429.html

This comes days after a Dalit cook was removed after the upper caste students at the school refused to have the food she cooked for them.Prem Singh, the school principal, said 42 upper caste and 19 Dalit students ate together. RC Purohit, chief Champawat’s chief education officer, said the students from both communities sat together as they would do earlier.On Saturday, sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Kafaltia held a meeting of villagers of Sukhidhang and persuaded them to end the row for the betterment of the village and students. He constituted a committee under Purohit to investigate the matter.Upper caste students refused to eat the midday meals a day after 32-year-old Dalit woman Sunita Devi was appointed as the cook on December 13. On December 22, Devi was removed from her post after an inquiry found the school management did not “follow the norms” for the appointment.Dalit students boycotted the midday meal on Friday in protests and brought lunch boxes from their homes.Vimilesh Upreti, an upper-caste cook, cooked the midday meals on Monday and other woman teachers helped her in serving them.Before Devi’s appointment, two upper caste cooks belonging to the upper castes cooked the meals. One of them, retired and Devi was appointed in her place. After Devi’s removal, Upreti remains the school’s lone cook.On Friday, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami directed deputy Inspector general Nilesh Anand Bharne to investigate the matter and take appropriate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/upper-caste-dalit-students-eat-together-days-after-row-over-dalit-cook-101640603868838.html
28-12-2021||Chandigarh||Five killed in private bus collision on Ambala-Chandigarh highway||At least five people were killed and nine were injured in a collision of two private buses on Ambala-Chandigarh highway near Healing Touch Hospital early on Monday.Officials said a bus bearing Haryana number hit an Uttar Pradesh-registered tourist bus from behind at around 3am, killing five people, including a woman. The accident took place around 10km away from the district headquarters.Both the buses were plying between Jammu and New Delhi and most of the commuters included labourers and their families, said Baldev Nagar police station in-charge inspector Ajaib Singh.The deceased included Meena Devi and Rohit Kumar of Chhattisgarh, Rahul Kumar of Jharkhand, and Pradeep of Uttar Pradesh, who all died at the spot, and an unidentified man (presumed to be the conductor of the Haryana bus) who died during treatment at civil hospital, an official statement issued by the administration reads.“All the injured were taken to hospital from where two were referred to PGIMS, Chandigarh due to their critical condition. Most of the injured are from Uttar Pradesh or Chhattisgarh,” the statement added.An FIR was lodged at Baldev Nagar police station under Sections 279, 337 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the unknown driver on complaint of Androz Singh, of Gaya in Bihar.He told the police that he and his cousin Rahul were working at a sweets shop in Baramulla and had boarded the bus from Jammu at 3pm on Sunday. “At around 3am, a speeding bus hit our bus from behind killing four in our bus, including my cousin. The driver of the bus fled, leaving the vehicle behind,” the FIR copy read.Injured said the collision was so intense that they fell from the sleeper cabin. One of the commuters travelling to Delhi and further to Gorakhpur in UP said most of them were sleeping when the accident took place.MLA Aseem Goel said he has instructed doctors to take care of the food and other requirements of the injured. “We will take care of their return expenses when they are discharged and ensure that there is no problem in their treatment at the hospital,” the BJP legislator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-passengers-killed-in-bus-pile-up-near-ambala-101640582864501.html
28-12-2021||World||British Airways flight suffers freak accident, windscreen smashes at 35,000 feet||Around 200 passengers onboard a British Airways aircraft to London survived a mid-air accident at 35,000 feet after a block of ice from a jet flying about 1,000 feet above it smashed onto the windscreen of the plane and left it cracked, media reports stated.Flight BA2236 was in the skies with holiday travellers from London's Gatwick international airport to San Jose in Costa Rica on Christmas Day when the freak incident happened.The block of ice shattered the two-inch-thick windscreen, which is nearly bulletproof to withstand extreme force. However, the aircraft landed safely at San Jose.The incident has been described as ‘one-in-a-million’ that landed with all onboard safe but left the passengers stranded over Christmas as they could not make it back to London on the same flight.Two such passengers, Jo Mitchell and Geir Olafsson, were on honeymoon in Costa Rica. They had set off from their Pacific coast resort to return to Edinburgh via Gatwick to meet family for Christmas.“My husband is part-Icelandic and his family who live in Edinburgh celebrate Christmas on 24 December. We were desperately trying to find a connecting flight at this point that would get us there in time to not miss his family Christmas,” Mitchell told British newspaper The Independent.According to them, the BA app was saying showing a vague status about the flight being delayed to the next day. "The flight time, however, only showed a four-hour delay. We had received no information via email or message so we hoped it was just a glitch. We dropped our car and continued to the airport, desperately hoping it wasn’t true,” Mitchell said.The flight was rescheduled 50 hours after the original departure time.“At this point we were devastated – realising we would miss Christmas with both of our families,” Mitchell noted.British Airways later issued an apology to the passengers who had to cancel their Christmas Day plans because of the incident.“We will never fly an aircraft unless we feel it is completely safe to do so, and on this occasion, our engineers were unable to clear it to fly. Since then, our teams have been working behind the scenes to do all they can to ensure an aircraft is ready at the earliest opportunity to bring customers to London,” British Airways officials said as quoted by The Independent.“We appreciate the patience and the understanding of our customers and our engineers and crew colleagues who have also done all they can to assist,” the official was quoted as saying.British Airways offered a full refund to all the affected passengers, and an additional 520 pounds per person stipulated for long delays under air passengers’ rights rules, the report said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-airways-flight-suffers-freak-accident-windscreen-smashes-at-35-000-feet-101640711002418.html

We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves," Castañeda said.Pichai in 2019 was warned that describing the company's Incognito browsing mode as "private" was problematic, yet it stayed the course because he did not want the feature "under the spotlight," according to a court filing in September.In her order on Monday, US Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen in San Jose, California, said "a few documents establish that specific relevant information was communicated to, and possibly from, Pichai," and therefore supported a request from the plaintiffs' lawyers to question him.Google has earlier said it makes clear that Incognito only stops data from being saved to a user's device and is fighting the lawsuit.The Alphabet unit's privacy disclosures have generated regulatory and legal scrutiny in recent years amid growing public concerns about online surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alphabet-ceo-pichai-can-be-questioned-in-privacy-lawsuit-judge-rules-101640711683518.html
28-12-2021||World||China says its space station had ‘close encounters’ with Elon Musk’s satellites||China on Tuesday accused the US of ignoring its obligations under outer space treaties after the country’s under-construction space station was forced to avoid collisions with satellites owned by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s SpaceX aerospace company.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian confirmed satellites from Starlink Internet Services, a division of Tesla founder Musk’s SpaceX aerospace company, had two “close encounters” with China’s space station this year. The two encounters took place on July 1 and October 21, according to a document China submitted to the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs in early December, Chinese official media reported.Zhao said that China’s under-construction space station, which had three astronauts on board during that period, was “…forced to take evasive actions to avoid collision with the satellites”.Zhao said that the US keeps claiming the so-called concept of responsible conduct in outer space, but it ignores international treaty obligations on outer space and poses a serious threat to the lives of astronauts. “This is a typical double standard,” he said, adding that China urges the US to act responsibly.Citing “The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, Zhao said astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind, and all counties should respect and protect their safety and report any life-threatening situation for astronauts to the secretary-general of the UN and other contracting nations.The Chinese government gave details of the two “encounters” in the document submitted to the UN.The China Manned Space Programme completed five launch missions in 2021, with the successful launching into orbit of the Tianhe core module of the China Space Station, the Tianzhou-II and Tianzhou-III cargo spacecraft and the Shenzhou-XII and Shenzhou-XIII crewed spacecraft, the document said.During this period, Starlink satellites launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) of the United States of America have had two close encounters with the China Space Station. For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control on July 1and October 21, 2021, respectively,” the document said.Following the news of the near-collisions, Musk and his space programme faced a backlash on Chinese social media with netizens calling the satellites a new US weapon in space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-its-space-station-had-close-encounters-with-elon-musk-s-satellites-101640689439397.html

Footage showed masked residents queueing to be tested in streets and sports centres.'There's no food'But banned from driving and limited to sending out one household member every three days to buy groceries, many Xi'an residents have taken to social media to call for help in acquiring food and other essentials."I'm about to be starved to death," wrote one person on the Weibo site."There's no food, my housing compound won't let me out, and I'm about to run out of instant noodles ... please help!""I don't want to hear any more news about how everything is fine," said another."So what if supplies are so abundant -- they're useless if you don't actually give them to people."Authorities have insisted that supplies remain stable as they maintain strict controls on movement into and out of Xi'an.Students have also been banned from leaving university dormitories unless necessary, CCTV reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expands-lockdowns-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101640675645402.html

Many healthcare experts have advocated getting the third shot in the wake of these emerging and more dangerous strains of the virus. But there are some voices opposing this.Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency room doctor in New York, shared his observations on Twitter about what he has seen during Covid-19. He has also talked about vaccines and if there is a need for a booster shot.“Every patient I’ve seen with Covid that’s had a 3rd ‘booster’ dose has had mild symptoms. By mild I mean mostly sore throat. Lots of sore throat. Also some fatigue, maybe some muscle pain. No difficulty breathing. No shortness of breath. All a little uncomfortable, but fine,” Dr Spencer said.Every patient I’ve seen with Covid that’s had a 3rd ‘booster’ dose has had mild symptoms.By mild I mean mostly sore throat. Lots of sore throat. Also some fatigue, maybe some muscle pain.No difficulty breathing. No shortness of breath.

More fatigued. More fever. More coughing. A little more miserable overall. But no shortness of breath. No difficulty breathing. Mostly fine.”But those with one dose of Johnson & Johnson were “worse overall”, said Dr Spencer, adding that they had fever for a few days. Tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath and cough were also common Covid-19 symptoms for this group, according to his Twitter thread.The doctor also said that every patient that needed to be admitted for Covid has been unvaccinated. They had “profound shortness of breath” and their “oxygen levels dropped when they walked”. “Every one needing oxygen to breath regularly,” he added.Dr Spencer then appealed to the people to get their vaccine shots, saying the greatest burden falls on the unvaccinated.Those who got a single J&J similarly may have more symptoms, but have more protection than the unvaccinated (if you got a single dose of J&J, please get another vaccine dose—preferably Pfizer or Moderna—ASAP!)But as I’ve witnessed in the ER, the greatest burden still falls on…He continued: “Most patients I’ve seen that had 2 doses of Pfizer/Moderna still had ‘mild’ symptoms, but more than those who had received a third dose.

28-12-2021||World||World hits record daily Covid-19 cases as Omicron mars Christmas||Global Covid-19 cases hit a daily record on Monday, disrupting the holiday season a year after vaccines first started rolling out and two years after the emergence of the virus that many hoped would be fleeting. The more than 1.44 million worldwide infections smashed the prior record after factoring out a day in December 2020 when Turkey backdated a significant number of cases. A more conservative gauge -- the seven-day rolling average that smooths out one-time fluctuations and holiday reporting irregularities -- is also at a record level, thanks to a tidal wave of Omicron infections.The highly-mutated and most transmissible variant yet, Omicron is fast becoming the dominant strain globally as it evades immunity normally provided by vaccines and previous infections. The seven-day rolling average of cases on Monday stood at about 841,000, a jump of 49% from a month ago when micron was first identified in southern Africa. Studies suggest that although Omicron infects 70 times faster than previous strains, the illness it causes may not be as severe, especially for people who have been vaccinated and received a booster shot. The ease of transmission and soaring number of cases could still squeeze hospital capacity worldwide, leaving the unvaccinated and anyone who needs medical care for other conditions in the lurch. Governments already are warning that infections and hospitalization may soar following the holidays, setting a grim tone as the world heads into the third year of the pandemic.The silver lining is that daily Covid deaths haven’t significantly increased. The seven-day rolling average of deaths has hovered at about 7,000 since mid-October after falling from a delta-driven peak, despite the emergence of Omicron. The outlook heading into 2022 depends on whether the death toll follows cases and surges higher in the days to come, or if the Omicron wave proves mild as more real-world data emerges. While deaths tend to lag infection rates by a few weeks, early indications from southern Africa and other locations where Omicron has been circulating suggest some decoupling of the measures.Better pandemic tools may explain some of the rise in case counts. More infections are being found during this Omicron wave thanks to improved contact tracing and testing capabilities in the worldwide fight against the pathogen.The record case counts are increasing pressure on public health officials to reassess their Covid control policies. The U.S. cut the recommended isolation time for people who test positive for Covid-19, allowing them to return to work sooner and potentially helping reduce widespread disruptions that could close schools or snarl supply chains. The arrival of Omicron broadly halted the march toward normalization that characterized much of 2021. A reluctance to return to pre-vaccine lockdowns and other Covid curbs may be allowing the virus to spread more widely, though it’s also giving some people a more traditional holiday season with family and friends after a dismal 2020 before vaccines were widely available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-hits-record-daily-covid-19-cases-as-omicron-mars-christmas-101640671360250.html

For safety reasons, the China Space Station took the initiative to conduct an evasive manoeuvre in the evening of that day to avoid a potential collision between the two spacecraft,” China said in a document published on the website of the UN space agency.Also read | Elon Musk: I'm almost done with Tesla stock salesIt said the Starlink-2305 satellite had a subsequent close encounter with the China Space Station on October 21.“As the satellite was continuously manoeuvring, the manoeuvre strategy was unknown and orbital errors were hard to be assessed, there was thus a collision risk between the Starlink-2305 satellite and the China Space Station. To ensure the safety and lives of in-orbit astronauts, the China Space Station performed an evasive manoeuvre again on the same day to avoid a potential collision between the two spacecraft.”In 2021, Beijing completed five launch missions including the launch of the successful launch into orbit of the Tianhe core module of the China Space Station, said the document.Also read | Musk reflects on 'tough year' that 2008 was for Tesla in a reply to engineerThe space station is in a stable near-circular orbit at an altitude of around 390 kilometres on an orbital inclination of about 41.5 degrees, it added.Chinese citizens have taken to the social media platforms against SpaceX founder Elon Musk with regard to these allegations.According to Reuters, a user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo microblogging platform said Starlink’s satellites were “just a pile of space junk,” while another described them as “American space warfare weapons.”Also read | Elon Musk says he will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year“The risks of Starlink are being gradually exposed, the whole human race will pay for their business activities,” a user posting under the name Chen Haiying said on Weibo, Reuters reported.China has said that SpaceX is yet to respond to the incidents.

When Anvisa approved shots for 5 to 11-year-olds, Bolsonaro provoked controversy by saying he wanted to make public the names of the officials who had signed off on the approval.On Dec. 23, Queiroga, the health minister, provoked further controversy by saying that the number of Covid-19 deaths among children did not justify an emergency authorization. He later said that coronavirus vaccines for children would require a doctor's prescription, which state health secretaries immediately contradicted."I've talked with Queiroga about this. On the 5th, he should published a note about how vaccinating children should be carried out," Bolsonaro said. "I hope there's no judicial interference. I hope. Because my daughter isn't getting vaccinated, let me make that very clear."A government coronavirus advisory body released a note saying that 301 children between the ages of 5 and 11 have died of Covid-19 in Brazil.Bolsonaro himself has refused to get vaccinated and has repeatedly called into question the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-not-vaccinate-daughter-against-covid-19-brazilian-president-bolsonaro-101640660203730.html
28-12-2021||World||NATO says its jets scrambled 290 times due to Russian planes||NATO fighter jets were scrambled hundreds of times this year to intercept aircraft, most of them Russian warplanes in northwest Europe that were flying too close to the airspace of its member countries, the military organization said Tuesday.NATO said that 290 of around 370 total missions were flown in 2021 in response to the activities of Russian aircraft. Most of those took place in the Baltic region around Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where the organization has an air-policing operation.“Generally, intercepts occurred without incident as NATO planes take off to identify the approaching aircraft and escort it out of the area. Very few intercepted flights entered allied airspace,” a statement from the 30-country US-led alliance said.NATO intercept flights are a routine occurrence. But despite high tensions between NATO and Moscow over the activities of Russian armed forces near Ukraine’s borders in recent months, the number of Russia-linked intercepts decreased this year.In 2020, NATO jets scrambled around 350 times in response to Russian planes.More than 60 NATO jets are on round-the-clock alert across Europe to respond to things like unannounced military flights or civilian planes losing communication with air-traffic controllers for any reason, which could range from technical problems to hijacking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-says-its-jets-scrambled-290-times-due-to-russian-planes-101640659705747.html

28-12-2021||World||US officials recommend shorter 5-day quarantine for Covid patients||US health officials on Monday cut isolation restrictions for Americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days, and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said the guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.The decision also was driven by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases, propelled by the omicron variant.Early research suggests omicron may cause milder illnesses than earlier versions of the coronavirus. But the sheer number of people becoming infected — and therefore having to isolate or quarantine — threatens to crush the ability of hospitals, airlines and other businesses to stay open, experts say.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases."Not all of those cases are going to be severe. In fact many are going to be asymptomatic,” she told The Associated Press on Monday. “We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science."Last week, the agency loosened rules that previously called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive. The new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don’t have symptoms. And the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days, or even fewer, if there are severe staffing shortages.Now, the CDC is changing the isolation and quarantine guidance for the general public to be even less stringent.The change is aimed at people who are not experiencing symptoms. People with symptoms during isolation, or who develop symptoms during quarantine, are encouraged to stay home.The CDC’s isolation and quarantine guidance has confused the public, and the new recommendations are “happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance,” said Lindsay Wiley, an American University public health law expert.Nevertheless, the guidance continues to be complex.IsolationThe isolation rules are for people who are infected. They are the same for people who are unvaccinated, partly vaccinated, fully vaccinated or boosted.They say:—The clock starts the day you test positive.—An infected person should go into isolation for five days, instead of the previously recommended 10.—At the end of five days, if you have no symptoms, you can return to normal activities but must wear a mask everywhere — even at home around others — for at least five more days.—If you still have symptoms after isolating for five days, stay home until you feel better and then start your five days of wearing a mask at all times.QuarantineThe quarantine rules are for people who were in close contact with an infected person but not infected themselves.For quarantine, the clock starts the day someone is alerted they may have been exposed to the virus.Previously, the CDC said people who were not fully vaccinated and who came in close contact with an infected person should stay home for at least 10 days.Now the agency is saying only people who got booster shots can skip quarantine if they wear masks in all settings for at least 10 days.That’s a change. Previously, people who were fully vaccinated — which the CDC has defined as having two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — could be exempt from quarantine.Now, people who got their initial shots but not boosters are in the same situation as those who are partly vaccinated or are not vaccinated at all: They can stop quarantine after five days if they wear masks in all settings for five days afterward.Five daysSuspending both isolation and quarantine after five days is not without risk.A lot of people get tested when they first feel symptoms, but many Americans get tested for others reasons, like to see if they can visit family or for work. That means a positive test result may not reveal exactly when a person was infected or give a clear picture of when they are most contagious, experts say.When people get infected, the risk of spread drops substantially after five days, but it does not disappear for everyone, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, a New York physician who is a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.“If you decrease it to five days, you're still going to have a small but significant number of people who are contagious,” he said.That's why wearing masks is a critical part of the CDC guidance, Walensky said.Varying recommendationsThe new CDC guidance is not a mandate; it’s a recommendation to employers and state and local officials. Last week, New York state said it would expand on the CDC’s guidance for health care workers to include employees who have other critical jobs that are facing a severe staffing shortage.It’s possible other states will seek to shorten their isolation and quarantine policies, and CDC is trying to get out ahead of the shift. “It would be helpful to have uniform CDC guidance” that others could draw from, rather than a mishmash of policies, Walensky said.Given the timing with surging case counts, the update “is going to be perceived as coming in response to pressure from business interests,” Wiley said. But some experts have been calling for the change for months, because shorter isolation and quarantine periods appeared to be sufficient to slow the spread, she said.The move by CDC follows a decision last week by U.K. officials to reduce the self-isolation period for vaccinated people who test positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-recommend-shorter-5-day-quarantine-for-covid-patients-101640648972769.html
28-12-2021||World||Talks with US to start after holidays: Russia||Talks between Russia and the United States on Moscow’s demand for Western guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine will start immediately after New Year holidays, Russia’s top diplomat announced on Monday.“It is with the US that we will carry out the main work of negotiations, which will take place immediately after the New Year holidays end,” Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday. The holidays in Russia will last till January 9.Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe. Washington and its allies have refused to provide such pledges, but said they are ready for the talks.The demands, contained in a proposed Russia-US security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and Nato, were drafted amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has stoked fears of a possible invasion.Russia has denied it has plans to attack its neighbour but pressed for legal guarantees that would rule out Nato expansion and weapons deployment there.Lavrov said last week that, in addition to talks with the US, Moscow will start talks with Nato, as well as separate negotiations under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has decided to convene a meeting of the Nato-Russia Council on January 12, a Nato official said on Saturday, adding that the bloc was in touch with Russia about the meeting.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday confirmed the meeting will take place, calling talks with Nato “important”.Turkey urged Russia on Monday to drop “one-sided” demands and adopt a more constructive approach. The Nato member has irritated Moscow by supplying combat drones to Ukraine that Russia fears could be used by Kiev in its conflict with separatists in two regions.Situation at Afghan-Tajik border a concern: RussiaThe security situation at the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border is a concern, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, a risk Moscow has sought to mitigate by strengthening its military base in Tajikistan with weapons and other equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talks-with-us-to-start-after-holidays-russia-101640647103668.html

The 150 subjects are all medical staff.A health ministry expert panel last week recommended that Israel become the first country to offer a fourth vaccine dose - also known as a second booster - to those aged over 60, those suffering from compromised immune systems, and medical workers.But the fourth shot awaits final approval by the ministry’s director-general, Nachman Ash.AZ vaccine behind lower deaths in UK: ExpertBritain’s early deployment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to protect against Covid-19 may be responsible for the country’s lower death rates compared to other European countries, a UK vaccines expert has said.Dr Clive Dix, former chairman of the UK’s Vaccine Task Force, told the Daily Telegraph that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - manufactured and administered in India as Covidshield - may offer stronger long-term protection against severe Covid-19 and death.China: Xian imposes ‘strictest’ controls to halt Covid outbreakThe locked-down Chinese city of Xi’an on Monday tightened Covid-19 controls to the “strictest” level, banning residents from driving cars around town in an effort to control the country’s worst outbreak in 21 months.Authorities have not announced any infections with the Omicron variant among the 635 confirmed cases in Xian from December 9 to Sunday.Oz reports at least 10k daily cases for first timeAustralia reported more than 10,000 daily Covid-19 cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic amid the rapid spread of the Omicron strain.New South Wales on Monday recorded 6,324 cases, with 55 in intensive care among 520 people in hospital. The most populous state also reported its first known death from the Omicron variant - a man in his 80s with underlying health issues who had received two doses of vaccine and became infected in his nursing home.Britain’s government will not introduce new Covid-19 restrictions for England before the end of 2021, its health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday.‘It’s going to get worse before it gets better’The top US infectious-disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned on Monday that with the rise of the highly contagious Omicron, “it’s going to get worse before it gets better”.“We don’t expect things are going to turn around in a few days to a week. It likely will take much longer than that, but that’s unpredictable,” he said on ABC.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday it was investigating nearly 70 cruise ships after reports of Covid-19 cases on board, as the Omicron variant upended holiday travel over the Christmas weekend.President Joe Biden on Monday said some US hospitals could be “overrun” by Covid cases, but the country is generally well prepared to meet the latest surge and Americans need not panic.Travel affected during Christmas weekendAbout 8,300 flights were grounded and tens of thousands more delayed on the weekend - one of the year’s busiest travel periods - with multiple airlines saying that Omicron spikes caused staffing shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-starts-testing-for-4th-covid-vaccine-jab-101640646408951.html

28-12-2021||India||The year that was: Man who was driving force behind people’s movements||At the age of 103, he believed that doctors should not waste a bed on him. While Bengaluru was praying that the centenarian recovers from Covid-19 at the earliest, freedom fighter HS Doreswamy was telling hospital staff that he had lived his life and his bed should be given to someone younger. But the doctors, who were aware of what he had done in life especially his days as a freedom fighter and an activist, refused to listen to him. Who was HS Doreswamy?Harohalli Srinivasaiah Doreswamy was a freedom fighter, journalist and activist. Doreswamy has never held any political position and was the driving force behind several people’s movements in Karnataka, often leading from the front, even at 103. He spoke for the people, regardless of the party in power, and he was the face of most of the people’s movements in the state for decades. His days as a freedom fighter He was 23-year-old when he was arrested. He had just got a new job as a teacher in a high school then. “I started working in June (1942) but by then, the Quit India Movement has begun. I helped organise a 14-day strike at the mills across Mysore state and also blew up government record rooms and post-boxes with very small bombs. Our intention was to disrupt the British government’s daily functioning. By December, I was arrested, and I lost my job as well,” he had told HT in an interview. Arrested again during the Emergency After the Emergency was announced, Doreswamy wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi (then prime minister), saying she was a dictator. In the letter, he threatened to go to villages and mobilise people against her dictatorship. Soon after that, he held the first meeting in Gandhi Bazar (in Bengaluru). He was arrested, and he spent four months in jail. During the trial, the prosecution said that he had criticised the prime minister and that he was an enemy of the state. “But the judge who was hearing my case said that I had every right to criticise the government and there is no proof to say that I am an enemy of the state. The judge then told the prosecution to ask the government under what charge should I be booked, and released me,” recollected Doreswamy in the interview. Activism in later lifeDoreswamy was particularly active in the state’s public life over the last decade, starting with the satyagraha he held to stop dumping of Bengaluru’s garbage in Mandur in 2013. He later led the state government’s initiative to bring left-wing extremists to mainstream. He also took part in the India Against Corruption campaign. Years before his death he was a trenchant critique of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He took the lead in the recent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests and farmers’ agitation against the farm laws (now withdrawn). ControversyA controversy broke out in February 2020 after Doreswamy attended a protest event called ‘Save the Constitution’. An enraged BJP MLA had accused the freedom fighter of acting like a Pakistani agent. “There are many fake freedom fighters. There is one in Bengaluru. Now we have to say what Doreswamy is. Where is that old man? He behaves like a Pakistan agent,” Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, BJP MLA from Vijayapura, had said. Though the issue reached the Karnataka assembly and snowballed into a big controversy, Yatnal refused to apologise. Battle with Covid Doreswamy had contracted Covid on May 8 and was admitted to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research (SJICSR) in Bengaluru and discharged on May 13. However, he was re-admitted due to post-Covid complications after he complained of severe weakness and fatigue. He died on May 26. Though Doreswamy had wanted his body to be donated to a medical college and willed it too, due to Covid, the body could not be donated and was cremated with state honours. 
28-12-2021||India||Spike in Covid cases in Bengaluru||Compared to the first week of November, Bengaluru has reported an increase of 466 fresh Covid-19 cases reported in a week’s time, according to the data released by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). As per the data, between October 10 to November 6, Bengaluru reported 959 new cases, while between December 9 and December 15, the number of new cases reported in the city stood at 1,425. In the eight weeks from October 31 to December 25, Bengaluru reported showed an increase in the number of cases. Similarly, the city’s positivity rate has shown a slight increase from 0.47% in the first week of December to 0.54% on December 25. The positivity rate during November 28 - December 4 was 0.47%, followed by 0.45% during December 5-11, while a further drop was reported during December 12-18 with a 0.41% positivity rate. An increase in positivity rate was reported during December 19-25 with a 0.54% positivity rate. The test positivity rate is the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that turn out to be positive and detect the presence of the virus. The number of tests conducted remains consistent during this period recording over two lakh tests every day. Talking to the media, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the increase in positivity rate can definitely be a sign of concern. “We effective containment management so that clusters are managed and contained. We have even been checking on the hospitalisations and the Covid numbers have been low. Currently, the Covid status in the city is well in control. We are maintaining a high number of testings,” he said. Hospitals in the city have not reported a spike in the number of cases, which has been looked at as a positive sign, officials added. Meanwhile, 21 Covid-19 cases have been reported in an apartment in Rajajinagar, creating yet another cluster in Bengaluru. Some of the residents of Sobha Indraprastha, who tested positive, have a travel history. These 21 cases were reported over a period of a week, said BBMP officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-covid-cases-in-bengaluru-101640715968396.html

Puri on the spot. Among the injured are two more professors from Delhi -- Dr Sangeetha and Dr Sonia. Puri, an Emeritus Professor of Mathematics who had won several awards for his work on the subject, had gone to Bangalore to attend the conference. Dr Sonia has been rushed for treatment of an eye injury. “She’s in a complete state of shock and cannot speak about the incident,” a senior scientist from Indian Institute of Science (IISC) said. Prof Venkatesh, Prof Vijay Chandru, Prof Pankaj Gupta of the IISC were also injured. The police said around 7.30 p.m., a white Ambassador reached the JN Tata auditorium on the IISC campus, the venue for a conference on “Operations Research Applications in Infrastructure Development”. DGP B.S. Sial said two men jumped out of the car and lobbed grenades at the auditorium. While one hit the target, the other hit a tree. A minute later, the duo entered the conference hall and started firing from automatic rifles on the unsuspecting scientists. Bangalore Police Commissioner Ajai Kumar Singh said: “According to witnesses, one of the attackers came out of the car and started firing at random. The attackers escaped from soon after the incident.” “We have sounded a red alert in the city and sealed all the exit points to nab the culprits. It is too early to say whether this is a terror attack or targetted attack,” he said. That attack coincides with the arrival of gangster Abu Salem in the city for a series of tests. The police found three magazines (of automatic weapon) and a grenade at the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-29-2005-terror-in-bangalore-101640715901401.html

Rania MLA, Ranjit Singh is the only Independent MLA in the cabinet. The induction of Gupta, who represents the Hisar consituency, gives representation to the Vaish community as well as Hisar district in the cabinet. The JJP on the other hand has tried to contain dissent among its MLAs by inducting Babli, a prominent dissenting voice along with Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam. The induction of Babli, a Jat also holds political significance for the JJP since the party wants to strengthen its support base in Fatehabad, a district bordering Dushyant’s home district of Sirsa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-haryana-mlas-inducted-into-cabinet-101640715422393.html
28-12-2021||India||DRDO hands over technology of extreme cold clothing system to 5 Indian firms||Technology for indigenous extreme cold weather clothing system (ECWCS) was handed over to five Indian companies by Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Dr G Satheesh Reddy in the national capital on Monday, informed the Ministry of Defence on Tuesday.As per the ministry, the extreme ECWCS is required by the Indian Army for its sustained operations in glacier and Himalayan peaks. The Army, till recently has been importing extreme cold weather clothing and several Special Clothing and Mountaineering Equipment (SCME) items for the troops deployed in high altitude regions.The DRDO designed ECWCS is an ergonomically designed modular technical clothing with improved thermal insulation and physiological comfort based on the insulation required at various ambient climatic conditions in Himalayan regions during different levels of physical activity, said the ministry.According to the ministry, the ECWCS embodies physiological concepts related to the reduction in respiratory heat and water loss, unhindered range of motions and rapid absorption of sweat while providing waterproof, windproof features with adequate breathability and enhanced insulation as well as strength features required for high altitude operations.The three-layered ECWCS is designed to suitably provide thermal insulation over a temperature range of +15 to -50 degrees Celsius with different combinations of layers and intensity of physical work, said the ministry.The ministry further informed that considering the widely fluctuating weather conditions in the Himalayan peaks, the clothing provides an advantage of fewer combinations to meet the required insulation or IREQ for the prevailing climatic conditions, thereby providing a viable import alternative for the Indian Army.Speaking on the occasion, Dr G Satheesh Reddy emphasised on the need for developing an indigenous industrial base for SCME items, not only to cater to the existing requirements of the Army but also to tap its potential for export.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-hands-over-technology-of-extreme-cold-clothing-system-to-5-indian-firms-101640715361792.html
28-12-2021||India||8 new IITs short on all performance, administrative & infra parameters: CAG||New Delhi: The eight new Indian Institutes of Technology established in 2008-09 have fallen short on almost all performance, administrative and infrastructure parameters, an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General has found.They faced infrastructure challenges, recorded less enrolment against available seats, had an inadequate faculty to student ratio, did not have enough representation of reserved categories in student enrolment, and lagged behind in publishing research papers, the government’s auditor said in a recent report.It looked into the activities of eight IITs in Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Indore, Jodhpur, Mandi, Patna and Ropar between 2014 and 2019. The report was submitted in Parliament during the winter session, which concluded last week.According to the audit report, which HT has reviewed, none of the IITs attained the stipulated cumulative intake of 2,360 students each at the end of the sixth year (2013-14).“As against the overall targeted intake of 18,880 students, only 6,224 students (33%) were admitted in all the eight IITs during the first six years,” the report said. “Further, it was observed that till 2018-19, only IITH (Hyderabad) was able to achieve the targeted student intake.”As much as 28% seats remained vacant across the IITs in postgraduate courses during 2014-19. Only three of the eight IITs were offering research programmes by fixing annual intake, while others were accepting students without earmarking seats. But enrolment remained low in these three IITs as well. For instance, in Bhubaneswar, 80% of PhD seats remained vacant between 2014-19, 64% seats in Gandhinagar and 17% seats remained vacant in IITH.There was inadequate faculty to student ratio in all the eight institutes in 2014-19. Inadequate faculty to student ratio may adversely affect the quality of education and increase the workload on existing faculty in these premier IITs, the auditor said. “This would also constrain their research activities,” it noted.The auditor also highlighted poor representation of reserved category students. For scheduled tribes, 73% PhD seats remained unfilled in Hyderabad, while 100% went vacant in Jodhpur. for scheduled caste students, the shortfall was significantly higher at more than 50%) in all IITs, except in Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar, where it was 25% and 28%, respectively, the report said. For other backward classes, the shortfall was high in Gandhinagar (37%), Ropar (36%) and Mandi (32%), the report said.The new institutes failed to attract non-governmental sponsored projects, reported large variance between the patents filed and obtained, and lagged behind in the publication of research papers, the CAG report said.It also pointed out that in some of these IITs, including Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Mandi and Ropar, issues in allotment and transfer of land persisted even after a decade of their establishment, and this led to issues with providing planned facilities to the students. The audit also said that some state governments did not make the requisite land available to the IITs.In their responses submitted through the education ministry, most of these IITs cited unavailability of suitable candidates for vacant seats and faculty positions. Some cited “limited infrastructure” as a reason behind not increasing the intake capacity of students, or fixing PhD seats. In terms of low representation of reserved category students, they cited lack of applications as the reason. The IITs said efforts are being made to increase the number of patents and publish more research papers.Responding to low representation of reserved category students, IITGN said, “Despite adopting measures like waiver of tuition fee, peer group assisted learning, lower application fee, relaxations given during shortlisting and admission process, seats remain vacant because enough suitable candidates are not found.”In terms of research papers publication, IITBBS in its response through the ministry said that it is “encouraging the faculty to carry out more research work and publish more research papers and as a result, the number of publications increased from year to year.”HT tried to reach out to all these IITs. While six of them did not respond to the emails, IIT Bhubaneswar director Professor Raja Kumar said, “At IIT Bhubaneswar we had the highest BTech intake this year among all the second generation IITs. We also witnessed a three-fold increase in PHD intake post 2019. In terms of faculty recruitment, the institute is making continuous efforts of filling all the vacancies. We receive a large number of applications for faculty positions but the recruitment cannot be done overnight. We, at IIT, cannot compromise with the quality of faculty.”IIT Hyderabad said, “The institute now has 100% marking in NIRF Ranking for Faculty-Student Ratio.”In its recommendations, CAG asked the ministry to take work with the state governments to ensure land availability to IITs, and take steps to increase the number of courses as well as student intake. The eight IITs were asked to periodically review the availability of faculty, fix targets for enrolment in postgraduate and PhD courses, and focus more on research.“The Ministry of Education has accepted most of the audit recommendations and has circulated these to all the IITs for acting on the recommendations,” the report concluded.Officials at the ministry confirmed that the recommendations were circulated across these IITs.“The ministry will closely monitor that these recommendations are implemented by these IITs,” said a senior official at the higher education department of the ministry.

Former chief minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, however, said Jain was linked to the BJP itself.Also Read | Their ‘achievement’ is collecting ‘boxes filled with notes’: PM Modi slams SPSpeaking in Kanpur after inaugurating the metro rail project and a pipeline project, Prime Minister Modi said without naming anyone, “Boxes filled with currency notes have tumbled out; I was thinking they will say that this was also done by us,” he said.“Before 2017, the perfume of corruption that they had sprinkled all over UP is there for everyone to see,” he said. Now, the opposition was sitting with its mouth shut, he said. “They are not coming forward to take credit for the mountain of currency notes seen by the entire country. This is their achievement and their reality,” he said.
28-12-2021||India||Key numbers about India’s new vaccination plan||India will start vaccinating children in the 15-18 age group from January 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on December 25. A precautionary third dose will also be given from January 10 to health care and front line workers, and people over 60 with co-morbidities, he said. Those who got the second jab 39 weeks (roughly nine months) ago will be eligible for these “precautionary doses”.How many doses will India require to inoculate the new cohorts? Will there be any shortage? Which countries are giving booster shots to most of their population? We answer these questions in four charts.How many people will the next phase of vaccinations cover?India has 137.9 million senior citizens and 74.1 million in the 15-18 age cohort, according to 2021 projections by the National Commission on Population. The number of health and front line workers will vary, depending on who are currently in that group. However, they will not be an insignificant number, given that 28.77 million first doses were administered to them till 26 December, health ministry data shows. This translates into 240.7 million people, or an additional requirement of some 314.8 million doses in 2022 since the children will require two doses. This is likely an overestimate because not all above 60 years suffer from specified co-morbidities.Demand from children will exceed senior citizens initiallyEven though the 15-18 age cohort is smaller than senior citizens, the initial demand from them will likely be higher. Since there will have to be an interval of 39 weeks for the third dose, the cut-off date for full vaccination is April 19 as inoculations for the elderly start on January 10. For those who become eligible on January 31, the cutoff date is May 10, 2021.Assuming all eligible children receive their first jab in January, India will require an additional 104.1 million doses. It is not an insignificant number seen in comparison with the number of doses the country has administered every month. This is in addition to around 54.5 million people who will be eligible for second doses, if we just take the 12-week gap required for Covishield, or around 90% of the people who received first doses between October 16 and November 15.Older people have more co-morbidities, but make up a small shareThat the elderly are more vulnerable to coronavirus and should be given priority is a sound argument. Diseases such as diabetes, asthma, heart ailments and cancer are less prevalent in younger people, the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey showed. While it was limited to those of reproductive age of up to 49 years, the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India survey conducted in 2017-18 specifically for older age groups suggested even higher prevalence of such diseases in people aged 60 years and above. For instance, 35% of senior citizens reported at least one of three cardiovascular diseases, while only 22% in the 45-60 years cohort had such an ailment.India is already behind in booster coverageIndia is not the first country to announce booster doses for its population. In fact, the trend of booster shots is in keeping with the rich country bias in the progress of regular vaccine programmes in the world, as was shown in an HT analysis on December 9 (https://bit.ly/3Er4x5H). At least 92 countries have administered boosters, according to Our World in Data, and not all of them are rich, western nations. The list includes India’s neighbours Sri Lanka (15.7% of the population given boosters) and China (8%), and economic peers such as Brazil (11.5%).If boosters are the only significant way of protection against the Omicron variant, surely everyone will first need to be fully vaccinated. There are significant gaps persisting there as well. As much as 47% of the 18-45 age group, 30% of the 45-60 age cohort, and 33% of the 60 plus years are yet to be fully inoculated. These percentages are likely even worse in a large number of districts, an earlier HT analysis had pointed out. In mid-December, the share of fully vaccinated adults was less than 50% in more than a third of India’s districts (https://bit.ly/3JwxaT0).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-numbers-about-india-s-new-vaccination-plan-101640714280748.html

The latest desertions from the Congress comes a day after the BJP said it will contest the Punjab polls in alliance with former chief minister Amarinder Singh’s newly-formed Punjab Lok Congress party and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt). The allies have decided to form a six-member panel to finalise seat-sharing arrangements. Last week, Punjab leader and former minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi ended his four-decade long association with the Congress and joined the BJP. Sodhi cited infighting in the party as one of the reasons behind his decision. At Tuesday’s event, three-time Shiromani Akali Dal MLA from Baluana, Gurtej Singh Gudhiyana, former Sangrur MP Rajdev Khalsa, United Christian Front Punjab president Kamal Bakshi, Nihal Singh Wala, municipal corporation member Jagdeep Singh Dhaliwal, and advocate in the Punjab and Haryana high court, Madhumeet, also joined BJP ranks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-cricketer-2-punjab-cong-mlas-join-bjp-101640714161470.html

28-12-2021||India||Can’t rule out possibility of any conflict today: Rajnath Singh||New Delhi: The possibility of “any kind of conflict” cannot be ruled out in the existing uncertain environment, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday as he opened roads and bridges in border areas such as Ladakh, where India is locked in a dragging military standoff with China.India has ramped up efforts to create vital infrastructure such as roads and bridges all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in recent years, mainly to match the dual-use infrastructure built by China on its side. The Indian side’s efforts have gained urgency since the face-off with Chinese troops began in May last year.Singh opened 24 bridges and three roads built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in four states and two Union territories at a virtual event held in New Delhi. Five of the 24 bridges are in Ladakh, nine in Jammu and Kashmir, five in Himachal Pradesh, three in Uttarakhand and one each in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Two of the roads are in Ladakh and one in West Bengal.The highlight of the event was the inauguration of the Chisumle-Demchok road at Umling pass, located at a height of more than 19,000 feet in southern Ladakh, and India’s first indigenous Class 70 double-lane modular bridge, built at a height of 11,000 feet at Flag Hill Dokala in Sikkim. The one in Ladakh holds the Guinness world record for the highest motorable road.“In today’s uncertain environment, the possibility of any kind of conflict cannot be ruled out. Such situations motivate us even more to develop these areas,” Singh said, speaking in Hindi.“The situation we faced recently in the northern sector, and the manner in which we were able to respond strongly to the adversary, would not have been possible without the development of appropriate infrastructure,” he said, referring to the standoff in Ladakh sector of the LAC.“As we move forward in the direction of strengthening our border infrastructure, we have to bolster our surveillance systems as well. The problems of infiltration, skirmishes, illegal trade and smuggling often persist in border areas. In view of this, the government started the Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System sometime back,” he added.Roads in the border areas are required for both strategic purposes and the development of remote areas, Singh said. “In this way, these bridges, roads and tunnels play an important role in our security and in empowering the entire nation,” he said.Referring to the construction of the highest motorable road in southern Ladakh, he said the BRO achieved this “historic feat” despite numerous challenges such as the extreme altitude and sub-zero temperatures.Singh contended that adequate attention was not paid to developing border infrastructure after the country’s independence, and said there has been a major shift in approach in the past few years.“After independence, our policies were such that internal areas of the country developed but the border regions remained relatively deprived of development. This situation continued for a long time,” he said.“The further we moved away from Delhi, the graph of development kept falling in the same proportion. Earlier it was said that people in the border areas may be far from Delhi, but they are not far from our heart. But as the transport sector witnessed major expansion, it became an old saying,” he added.Singh also made a special mention of recent milestones achieved by BRO, including the Atal Tunnel, Kailash Mansarovar road, 54 other bridges built by the organisation and the setting up of centres of excellence on road safety, and roads, bridges, tunnels and airfields.He said the government has several steps in the past six to seven years to strengthen BRO, including increasing its budget by three to four times. He also lauded BRO’s initiatives for the welfare of its personnel, including a special drive to provide quality housing, jackets and rations in high-altitude areas, an increase in the wages of construction workers, improved health care facilities and Covid-19 vaccination for personnel.India and China have massed tens of thousands of troops in Ladakh sector of the LAC for the second consecutive winter after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failed to result in disengagement at all friction points. India has linked the normalisation of ties in all spheres to disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-rule-out-possibility-of-any-conflict-today-rajnath-singh-101640714110752.html
28-12-2021||India||Starlink satellite’s near-collision with Chinese station puts focus on space jam||Earlier this month, China informed the United Nations General Assembly that its manned space station had to adjust its orbit in order to avoid collision with satellites launched by SpaceX, calling on the world body to remind the United States “to bear responsibility” as per global treaties.First reported by The Guardian, which cited experts as saying the Chinese action was unusual, the incident spotlights the growing risk in space, where orbital room is being crowded out by an astronomical race in which nation-states as well as private companies are increasingly active.Behind it are projects such as the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink constellation and rival Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Both companies want to create a web of low-earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft that will beam down internet connectivity to anywhere on the planet. And then there are several countries – Russia and India being the most recent – that have carried out tests of satellite-killing missiles, generating millions of pieces of debris.Scientists said such developments not only increase the risk of collisions, but – particularly the satellite constellations -- raise the chances of interference with astronomical research.

For the first time in months, the proportion of tests turning up positive remained above 0.1% for several days, crossing 0.2% by the time the third week began.From there, the trajectory of new cases went on a sustained rise: The city has had an average of 256 new cases every day for the last week, compared to mere 29 a month ago. On Tuesday, 496 tests turned positive, the highest since June 4, when over 500 cases were last recorded. As the second week of December began, the number of new Covid-19 cases began to inch up in Delhi.

On Tuesday, 496 tests turned positive, the highest since June 4, when over 500 cases were last recorded.|#+|A similar spike has been recorded in Mumbai. Both cities have announced curbs such as night curfews and put tighter restrictions on how many people can gather.Do these trends say anything about the Omicron variant of concern (VOC)?They most likely do.For one, Delhi and Maharashtra account for the largest numbers of confirmed Omicron infections found in Covid-19 positive international travellers. These two cities account for the bulk of international arrivals into the country.Among the countries from where foreign arrivals in India most commonly originate is the UK, the second Omicron variant hot spot after South Africa.Circumstantial evidence suggests a high likelihood then that the cases being recorded in Delhi and Mumbai could be driven by the highly transmissible new variant.What now?The experiences of the UK and South Africa suggest if the Omicron variant has indeed taken hold, it will trigger a surge not seen at any point in the pandemic. The average number of new cases in a day, calculated over a week, was over 108,000 in UK, close to double the peak seen in January. By contrast, the number of deaths in a day is roughly only a tenth of what was recorded.Similar trends were seen in South Africa, where experts first concluded the Omicron variant was milder since deaths and hospitalisations did not rise in sync with new cases.And what after?South Africa, the UK and the US have made some major changes to their isolation and quarantine rules to account for the higher transmissibility and potentially lower virulence of the new VOC.On December 24, South Africa’s health ministry issued new Covid-19 guidelines to scrap mandatory isolation and testing for people in close contact with a known positive case unless they have symptoms. Instead, asymptomatic people should monitor their health and avoid large gatherings for 5-7 days and get tested only if they develop any signs that suggest Covid-19. Those with mild symptoms should isolate for eight days and severe cases for 10 days, the government said, according to Reuters.In the UK, the government said on December 22 that people diagnosed with Covid-19 can end their isolation on Day 7 if they have tested negative twice through home rapid tests taken on days 6 and 7. The new approach that was meant to remain protective will minimise the impact on lives and livelihoods, UK Health Security Agency chief Jenny Harries told The Guardian at the time.The US made the most drastic change of all. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday shortened the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 to five days from 10 days.India may need to confront the possibility and feasibility of some of these steps. But for that to happen, it needs an accurate assessment of the variant causing the infection and whether it is indeed leading to less severe outcomes – which is possible only with more detailed data on hospitalisations and genome sequencing.

He asked them to become champions of technology, but avoid turning into robotic versions of themselves. “Do work on internet of things, but don’t forget emotions of things. Do coding, but stay connected with people around,” Modi said.The in-person convocation, held after a gap of one year due to the pandemic, was also attended by Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, among others. Modi exhorted the new graduates to be impatient when it came to Atmanirbhar Bharat. “Self-reliant India is the basic form of complete freedom, where we will not depend on anyone,” he said. “If we do not become self-reliant, how will our country will reach its destination?” He wanted the students to contribute to the global standing of the country.“When the country’s independence completed 25 years, we should have done a lot by then to stand on our feet. Since then, it is too late, the country has lost a lot of time. Two generations have passed in between so we don’t have to lose even two moments,” the PM added.Modi also praised the diversity of Kanpur. “Kanpur is one of the few cities in India that is so diverse, from Satti Chaura Ghat to Madari Pasi, from Nana Saheb to Batukeshwar Dutt. When we visit this city, it seems as if we are travelling to that glorious past, of the glory of the sacrifices of the freedom struggle.”The Prime Minister inaugurated a blockchain-driven system to deliver educational degrees before his convocation address. This is a massive leap in the field of technology, he said.“Even in this decade, technology is going to increase its dominance in different fields. Life without technology would now be incomplete in a way. This is the age of competition of life and technology, and I am sure you will definitely get ahead in this.”The PM advised students to keep their sensitivity, curiosity, imagination and creativity alive and asked them to be aware of the non-technical aspects of life. “From the time of admission and passing out from IIT Kanpur, you must be feeling a huge change in yourself. Before coming here, there must have been a “fear of the unknown”. Now there is no “fear of the unknown”; now you have the courage to explore the whole world,” he said.IIT-K director Abhay Karandikar welcomed the guests and spoke about the achievements of his institute. Adityanath lauded contributions made by IIT-K, IIT-BHU and IIM Lucknow in leading Uttar Pradesh on the path to development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-advocates-tech-with-a-human-touch-101640713860638.html
28-12-2021||India||13 students test positive for Covid-19 in Himachal Pradesh's Bilaspur district||At least 13 students of a school in Himachal Pradesh tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday.The report came two days after the Himalayan state registered its first case of Omicron variant of Covid-19 in a woman with travel history to Canada.According to an ANI report, the infected children study in Bhakra Senior Secondary School in Bilaspur district. A senior doctor said the Covid-19 positive reports came after rapid antigen test (RAT) was conducted in the district. Of 16 samples that were sent for testing, as many as 13 were found to be positive, said medical officer Parminder Singh.The woman, who tested positive for the Omicron variant in Himachal Pradesh, is aged 45 and had come back to India from Canada on December 3.“The three RT-PCR (tests) of a close relative of the patient came negative,” Hemraj Bherwa, mission director of the National Rural Health Mission, told Hindustan Times.At present, the Omicron-infected woman is isolating at her home in Mandi district. She was found infected with Covid-19 on December 12, and lab results from Delhi following genome sequencing of her test sample revealed Omicron variant's presence on December 18.Meanwhile, one more Covid-19 positive sample of another foreign returnee in Himachal Pradesh was sent to Delhi for genome sequencing on Sunday.Himachal Pradesh is among 21 states and Union territories (UTs) in India where Omicron cases have been confirmed so far, with Maharashtra (167) and Delhi (165) accounting for the majority of the infections. The nationwide tally has now surpassed the 600-mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-students-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-himachal-pradesh-s-bilaspur-district-101640710337446.html

The Delhi Police has denied the charges and said some of its personnel suffered injuries in the melee.An ANI report said the doctors have proposed three demands, including a written apology, to end the stir that has severely impacted healthcare services at government hospitals in several parts of the country, particularly Delhi."First, we want the authorities concerned to ensure that we get a date for counselling right after the Supreme Court's hearing on January 6. Secondly, we want an apology from the authorities as the police manhandled the doctors. Also, all FIRs registered against protesters would have to be withdrawn."Meanwhile, AIIMS Delhi Resident Doctors Association (RDA) said it would not go ahead with its planned strike on Wednesday following the meeting with the Union minister.

28-12-2021||India||Pakistan said will allow Indian wheat for Afghanistan, still blocks it||NEW DELHI: Almost a month after Pakistan said it will allow transportation of humanitarian aid for the Afghan people via the Wagah land border crossing, New Delhi has not been able to ship any wheat as Islamabad has not finalised modalities.The Indian side made the proposal for sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines via Wagah on October 7 and received a response from Pakistan only on November 24. On December 3, Pakistan said it will allow Indian relief materials to be shipped via the border crossing only in Afghan trucks.“The transportation of wheat via Wagah is yet to begin as we are still waiting to hear from the Pakistani side on all the modalities,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Tuesday.People familiar with the matter said the tardy approach of the Pakistani side was surprising as even the Taliban setup in Kabul raised the issue with the Pakistan government in view of the urgent need for food items amid a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. A Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi that visited Islamabad in November specifically discussed the issue of allowing the shipment of wheat from India with top Pakistani leaders.On November 12, well before the formal approvals were conveyed to India, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s office tweeted on his meeting with Muttaqi, announcing the prime minister’s assurance to “favourably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat” from India.The Prime Minister conveyed that in the current context Pakistan would favourably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat offered by India through Pakistan on exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes and as per modalities to be worked out.India has so far sent 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines to Afghanistan on a special charter flight to Kabul on December 11. The flight brought 104 people, most of them Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Kabul to New Delhi, and returned with 85 Afghan nationals who were stranded in India following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August.The supply of medicines, which were handed over to the World Health Organization (WHO) for use at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul, was praised by the Taliban.The Indian side does not recognise the Taliban regime but has repeatedly said it will provide aid for the Afghan people in view of the humanitarian crisis. As there are no direct flights between the two countries, the Indian side proposed that the wheat should be transported via Pakistan.Several conditions were attached by Pakistan to the shipping of wheat via the Wagah land border. Pakistan told the Indian side that the entire consignment of 50,000 tonnes should be transported within the month of December. The people cited above said about 30 to 40 Afghan trucks currently make a daily trip to Wagah and it would be impossible to transport 50,000 tonnes of wheat via the route within a short period of time.

28-12-2021||India||4 more teens detained for disrupting Christmas event in Silchar, released: Cops||SILCHAR: Four teenagers were briefly detained on Tuesday in connection with the disruption of Christmas celebrations over the weekend at Silchar’s Presbyterian Church complex demanding that Hindus should not participate in it, an officer of Assam Police said.Two persons, also minors, were detained and released on Sunday on submission of a bond promising to turn up at the police station if required.The six were part of a group that barged into the complex at about 10pm on Saturday, chanted ‘Jai Shri Ram’, slapped a few persons and demanded that Hindus leave the church saying christmas is a “festival of outsiders”. “We have been celebrating Tulsi Diwas since morning and I think these Hindu boys and girls should have been doing the same instead of attending Christmas here,” one of them said, addressing a local TV news crew.The teenagers claimed they were activists of rightwing group Bajrang Dal but the outfit has denied any association with them. Superintendent of police, Cachar district, Ramandeep Kaur, said: “Nobody has lodged a written complaint but we have identified these boys from the video footage available on social media. All of them are juvenile aged between 15 to 17. We have interrogated and allowed them to go home on a PR bond. But they have to come to police station if we call them.”Kaur said the police spoke to Bajrang Dal’s Cachar wing but it has distanced itself from these boys.“We interacted with official members of Bajrang Dal about it, and they categorically denied about any connection between the organisation and these boys. The detained boys also failed to show any proof about their Bajrang Dal membership,” she said. Mithun Nath, president of Bajrang Dal’s wing in Cachar, Dima Hasao and Mizoram wing said: “Last year, we appealed to Hindus not to celebrate Christmas because a group of Christians attacked a temple in Shillong. This year we asked our members not to disturb any celebration.”“We don’t know if these boys are our members or not, but I don’t support these police proceedings against them also,” Mithun Nath added.Among those who was manhandled Senior journalist from Silchar, Anirbanjyoti Gupta, whose son was among those manhandled by the group, recalled his family’s claimed that his son was manhandled by Bajrang Dal youths on December 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-more-teens-detained-for-disrupting-christmas-event-in-silchar-released-cops-101640702520553.html

Here's what's on agenda||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Wednesday hold a meeting of the Council of Ministers amid the spread of the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. According to Hindustan Times’ sister publication Livehindustan, the meeting will take place at 4pm.It further reported that all the ministers are expected to be present in the meeting, and the discussion points include next year’s assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other states.PM Modi had chaired a review meeting last Thursday where he asked seniors officials to maintain a high level of vigil and alertness.“In view of the new variant, we should be ‘satark’ (alert) and ‘saavdhan’ (take precaution),” the PM added.He said the fight against the pandemic is not over and the need for continued adherence to Covid protocols is of paramount importance even today.PM Modi also gave directions for accelerating the testing to ensure quick identification of cases for timely containment and treatment.India has logged 653 cases of the Omicron variant across 21 states and union territories (UTs) so far, out of which 186 people have recovered or migrated, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday.Maharashtra recorded the maximum number of 167 such cases followed by Delhi at 165, Kerala 57, Telangana 55, Gujarat 49 and Rajasthan 46.The situation in the national capital is particularly worrying as it recorded 331 fresh coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest single-day rise since June 9.The positivity rate in the national capital increased to 0.68 per cent, according to data shared by the city health department.

28-12-2021||India||Assam’s Himanta Biswa Sarma goes on overdrive against drunk driving on New Year’s Eve||GUWAHATI: Chief minster Himanta Biswa Sarma is fronting Assam’s campaign against drunk driving ahead of New Year’s Eve, with video appeals on social media and local TV channels to urge motorists not to drive under the influence of liquor and take other steps to stay safe on the roads.“As we approach the New Year, I fervently appeal to the public to create an accident-free atmosphere by driving vehicles with caution and alertness,” the chief minister said in his new message televised from Monday. Till November 30 this year, 2,756 people have died in 6,745 road accidents and another 5252 were injured. That is an average of 8 deaths every day. On two days, December 31 last year and January 1 this year, Assam lost 29 people to road accidents. “We can avoid these accidents by driving within speed limits, following all traffic rules, not driving under influence of alcohol and wearing seat belts in cars and helmets by both riders in two-wheelers,” Sarma said in his message. Like many other states, Assam has also ordered night curfew effective from December 26 to restrict movement of people from 11.30pm to 6am as part of the steps taken to minimise the spread of Covid-19 infection. An exception has been made for December 31 night when this restriction will not apply.Sarma, however, made it clear that he wasn’t only going to rely on his appeal and has ordered strict enforcement of traffic rules.“I have instructed the police and transport departments to ensure that every two-wheeler rider wears helmet, drivers of cars and two-wheelers have not consumed liquor and speed limits. Let’s ensure that no lives are lost on December 31 and January 1. I seek your cooperation for this,” he added. Officials said police and transport officials across Assam have started putting up check points, especially at night to use breathalysers and also keep tab on over speeding. “In Guwahati, we started our campaign five days ago. Till date, 380 people have been found driving under influence of alcohol beyond permissible limits. We have fined each of them ₹10,000 and suspended their driving licenses as per the rules,” said Guwahati commissioner of police Harmeet Singh.“We want people to realise that driving after consuming liquor and without wearing helmets hurts the society as a whole. The chief minister has directed us to ensure no loss of life due to accident during the New Year celebrations. The society and administration should join hands to ensure safety of all,” he added. From December 1, the state government made it mandatory for all pillion-riders in two-wheelers above four years to wear helmets. Police and transport officers have been levying fines of ₹1,000 each on those violating the rule.

28-12-2021||India||India may face intense but short-lived Covid-19 wave as Omicron spreads: Report||India may see a spurt in the Covid-19 growth rate within days and head into an intense but short-lived virus wave as the highly-infectious omicron variant moves through the crowded nation of almost 1.4 billion.“It is likely that India will see a period of explosive growth in daily cases and that the intense growth phase will be relatively short,” Paul Kattuman, professor at the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge which has developed a Covid-19 India tracker, wrote in an email. “New infections will begin to rise in a few days, possibly within this week,” he said, adding that it was hard to predict how high the daily cases could go.Kattuman and his team of researchers, developers of the India Covid tracker, are seeing a sharp rise in infection rates across India. The tracker spotlighted six states as a “significant concern” in a Dec. 24 note, with adjusted growth rate of new cases exceeding 5%. This had expanded to 11 Indian states by Dec. 26, according to the tracker, which corrects for “day of the week effects” and other variations.India, which has confirmed 34.8 million infections and 480,290 deaths so far, is already gearing up to deal with another massive outbreak even though only 653 cases of the highly-mutated omicron have been identified so far. Last week, it allowed booster shots and included teenagers aged 15 to 18 in the inoculation program. Two more vaccines as well as Merck & Co.’s antiviral pill molnupiravir were approved by the local drug regulator Tuesday. Indian capital New Delhi closed cinemas, schools and gyms and introduced restrictions on public gathering on Tuesday -- a day after it reported the most new cases in more than four months. Night curfew kicks in from 10 p.m to 5 a.m. and bars, restaurants as well as offices will have 50% occupancy.These policy decisions underscore hard lessons India learned after a deadly delta-led virus wave in April and May that pushed infections to a record-beating 400,000-plus each day. It overwhelmed the country’s hospitals and crematoriums and left its citizens pleading for oxygen and other medical resources on social-media platforms.The Cambridge India tracker had correctly called the peak of this devastating second wave in May and also forecast in August that India would see a slow burn in its Covid infections curve until the vaccination coverage was sufficiently high. India crossed 1 billion administered vaccine doses in October and new cases plunged in tandem with that milestone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-face-intense-but-short-lived-covid-19-wave-as-omicron-spreads-report-101640689588574.html

This is the greatest insult to the memory of Mother Teresa who devoted her life to caring for the ‘poor and wretched’ of India,” he said.The issue came to light on Monday after West Bengal chief minister Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee expressed her shock, stating that bank accounts of Kolkata-headquartered organisation were frozen by the Centre.Also read | Mother Teresa's charity denies bank account freeze after Mamata blames CentreFollowing which, the Union ministry clarified that no request or revision application was received for review of the refusal of renewal.

However, this is not the only virus against which human beings need vaccines. There are a host of other viruses which require early childhood immunisation and these likely suffered during 2020. Data shows that while they have recovered in 2021, it is possible that some immunisation doses were delayed.

Banerjee expressed shock over the move. “Shocked to hear that on Christmas, Union Ministry froze all bank accounts of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity! Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines,” she tweeted.The Centre said the licence was not renewed because of “adverse inputs”.The charitable organisation was earlier in the news this month when a case was filed against its Children Home for Girls in Gujarat’s Vadodara for alleged forceful conversions to Christianity. It was also alleged that marriages of some at the home belonging to other religious communities were conducted as per Christian rituals. A nun working at the home rejected the allegations and said children only followed the prayers that the nuns recited.The Centre earlier in July 2018 directed state governments to inspect all childcare homes the charitable organisation runs. This came after the Jharkhand Police arrested a nun and an employee of a Ranchi-based organisation run by the Missionaries of Charity on charges of selling a baby allegedly for ₹1.2 lakh. The Centre also directed the states to ensure that all child care institutions were registered and linked to the country’s apex adoption body within a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missionaries-of-charity-s-troubles-continue-101640686559782.html
28-12-2021||India||Run organised around Chilika Lake to raise funds for kids’ eye cancer treatment||A group of over a dozen people from across the country ran 13km for six days around Odisha’s Chilika Lake as part of a campaign to increase awareness and raise funds for a foundation that supports the treatment of children suffering a form of eye cancer common in developing countries.Named “Mera Terah Run”, or MTR, the group started the daily runs from December 19 at Mangalajodi along the lake. The Indian Navy personnel from the INS Chilka camp also joined them. The group collects funds for social causes annually. It decided to explore the lake this year to raise funds for Iksha Foundation, which identifies children suffering from retinoblastoma and supports their treatment and care. “Like every year, we decided to run for a cause. This year, it was for raising funds for Iksha Foundation through Wildlife for Cancer (website). The runners took an adventurous trail around the lake to explore the biodiversity hotspot coupled with some challenging running pursuits. What began as the runs to raise funds for children suffering from eye cancer grew into much more with our meetings with local communities, researchers, conservationists, and artisans,” said Rajesh Vorkady, 49, a volunteer for MTR.The daily runs began at Mangalajodi, a marshy village on the shores of the lake where thousands of migratory birds arrive annually, on December 19. The next day the runners met Tiasa Adhya, a biologist who works for the conservation of fishing cats in the lake. Over the next five days, the group ran on Rajhans Island, Barkul, and Puri sea beach while trying to raise funds for the Iksha Foundation.Vorkady said the runs were successful as they raised the funds they wanted to. “Wildlife for Cancer was started by Ramki Srinivasan, a wildlife photographer to raise funds for underprivileged children suffering from cancer by selling his stunning pictures of India’s wildlife. The proceeds go to the Iksha Foundation,” said Vorkady.Software engineer Jagdish Damania launched MTR in 2014 with the motto: “run, rail, road, raise”. “All the funds that we raise go directly to the beneficiaries. This collective helps bind like-minded people to participate in events for a cause,” said Vorkady.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/run-organised-around-chilika-lake-to-raise-funds-for-kids-eye-cancer-treatment-101640686379181.html

He said bicycle tracks were built when he was the chief minister but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government ruined them.“Cyclists die in road accidents,” Yadav said in Unnao during his Vijay Rath Yatra ahead of the polls in the state. “Just recently, near here, an elderly woman died after a bull attacked her.”Yadav hit out at the BJP government and called its top leaders liars. He referred to chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement that millions got employment under his government. “...we still believe that Yogis and Babas do not lie. So now tell me, did anyone of you get jobs, employment. This government has started distributing smartphones and tablets, did anyone of you get them?” The Samajwadi Party chief accused the government of running away from its responsibility and leaving people to die during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “This government is responsible for the Covid deaths. People did not get medicines, beds, or oxygen. Unnao’s people saw dead bodies floating in the Ganga.”Yadav called change is necessary for the state. “...there cannot be a bigger liar than BJP (leaders). They lied to farmers about doubling their income, to youths about jobs.” He called the Kanpur Metro project the previous SP’s gift to the city. “This government continues inaugurating already inaugurated projects and relays foundation for already funded projects. And the Kanpur Metro is one more in the series as the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) inaugurated it in Kanpur. The project was founded by the SP government. Today, I announce that on return to power, the SP government will extend the Kanpur Metro to Unnao across the Ganga.”He referred to the recovery of cash worth crores from the house of a trader in Kanpur. “There was so much cash that several currency-counting machines were requisitioned and still the counting continues on the fourth day.” He called it the biggest cash discovery ever in the state. “Take out the call details (of the trader) and it will be proven that the cash is related to the BJP. The BJP should also tell us if so much cash was found, then did the demonetisation not fail?”HT has reached out to the BJP for a response and the copy will be updated accordingly.
28-12-2021||India||Pollution increased in some parts of India during pandemic lockdown: New study||Parts of central-western and northern India recorded an increase in pollution even as the reduction in economic activities during the pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020 led to its decrease in most parts of the country, a report by scientists at Nainital’s Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) has found.The report is based on satellite observations for 2018, 2019, and 2020. It found the influence of the significant decline in activities on the changes in the distribution of ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the lockdown. The study, which was published in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research, found ozone, carbon monoxide, and NO2 showed an increase of about 15% over the central-western part of India. Carbon monoxide showed a consistent increase as high as 31% of concentration at higher altitudes during the lockdown.In a statement on Monday, the Union science and technology ministry said scientists found regions in the country’s central-western part and north India are prone to higher air pollution exposure and hence are exposed to greater risk of respiratory problems.“In 2020, a complete nationwide lockdown was imposed over India to impede the spread of coronavirus disease. This enormously disrupted the economy with a single positive side effect, a short-term improvement in the air quality near the surface,” the ministry said. It cited the satellite-based observation of ozone, NO2 and carbon monoxide near the surface and in the free troposphere and added they mostly showed the reduction of the pollutants over India. But an increase in ozone and other toxic gases was observed in regions such as western-central India, parts of northern India, and remote Himalaya. The ministry said this could have aggravated respiratory health risks around those regions during the pandemic.The study found the long-range transport and downward transport from the stratosphere significantly increased ozone concentrations over north India during the lockdown. It added the Himalayas and coastal cities showed the bare minimum influence of lockdown in air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-increased-in-some-parts-of-india-during-pandemic-lockdown-new-study-101640685359255.html
28-12-2021||India||Congress will fight ‘destructive forces’: Sonia on party’s 137th foundation day||The Congress will fight “destructive forces” threatening Indian democracy at a time when divisive ideologies “anchored in hate and prejudice”, which did not have any role to play in India’s freedom struggle, are wreaking havoc on India’s secular fabric, party president Sonia Gandhi said on Tuesday.The Congress president was speaking in a video message to party workers on the 137th foundation day of India’s grand old party.“They are rewriting history to give themselves a role they do not deserve. They inflame passion, instil fear, and spread animosity and the finest traditions of our parliamentary democracy are being deliberately damaged,” she said, in an obvious reference to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though she did not name India’s ruling party.Gandhi said that electoral victories and defeats were inevitable, and reiterated the Congress’s commitments towards the people of the country. “Today, we rededicate ourselves to the ideals, values, and principles of our organisation that has been shaped, guided, and inspired by some of the greatest, noblest, and most selfless of Indians of the 20th century,” she said.Highlighting the party’s 136-year history with lots of challenges in recent years, Gandhi said they “had confronted several challenges and always demonstrated resilience”.Gandhi said they would counter the forces working against India with all they had. “Let there be no doubt on our steadfast resolve. We have never and we will never compromise on our fundamental beliefs that are part of our glorious legacy. Electoral ups and downs are inevitable but what is enduring and lasting is our commitment to the service of all people of our diverse society,’’ she said.Gandhi said the party “had confronted several challenges and always demonstrated its resilience’’ in the 136 years.When the Congress president was unfurling the national flag at the party’s headquarters in New Delhi, it accidentally fell due to a faulty flag pole. Gandhi, along with Congress treasurer Pawan Bansal and general secretary KC Venugopal, held the flag and displayed it briefly. The pole was later replaced, and the flag was hoisted.

However, the onset of the Omicron and uptick in cases has seen a raft of cancellations but not enough to dampen the sentiment across the state. “We have seen room occupancy of up to 60-70% of pre covid levels. Others have reported that they are seeing their best season ever. So, the sentiments in the industry has been positive,” said Jack Sukhija, who runs a heritage hotel in the capital city.The ongoing Covid night curfews in cities such as Bengaluru and Delhi was initially expected to drive more tourists to Goa given that venues back home will be closed. But the logistics of reaching Goa, and the uncertainty around air travel if infections soar, have created problems. Last minute bookings have not seen an uptick either.“Planning a last-minute trip to Goa was difficult even in normal times. It is all the more difficult during this time,” Sukhija added. For a different set of reasons.He is, however, sceptical how things will pan out over January, saying much will depend on how the new wave of infections pans out.Despite the cancellations, Goa’s popular beaches including the Calangute-Candolim stretch as well as the Morjim-Arambol stretch further north have seen milling crowds with holidayers almost shoulder to shoulder as they soak in the sun and sea breeze. “It is increasingly apparent that the Omicron variant is more of a scare than an actual threat and that we have to learn to live with the virus,” Nilesh Shah, the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, an industry body that lobbies on behalf of the hospitality industry, said, referring to reports that patients infected with the Omicron patients mostly have mild symptoms. So far.To be sure, scientists and the government have urged caution, but not panic, over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus diease, and have underlined that it has a much higher transmission rate. And a large number getting infected means a large number could end up in hospital.Shah said: “Most hotels are taking adequate precautions and necessarily so. The industry recognises that most verticals are still only in survival mode and the numbers have been a welcome relief.”Goa’s tourism industry initially expected a healthy season with the arrival of European charter tourists for the first time in two years. But with the Omicron variant sweeping across Europe, a majority of the planned charter flights from the UK and Western Europe have been cancelled.Goa has to date only received four charter flights from Kazakhstan with charters from Russia that were initially scheduled to land prior to Christmas and will now arrive only on December 30 onwards leaving Goa dependent on domestic tourists to keep the industry afloat during the new year weekend. Charters from the UK are now tentatively scheduled only from the end of January onwards. Goa’s tourism season usually begins with the receding monsoon and as winter sets in across the northern hemisphere, those seeking to escape the biting cold climes choose to spend time in warmer parts of the world and Goa is among the preferred destinations for those seeking to travel.Goa’s tourism sector is a big source of revenue for the state with the industry directly contributing 16.43% towards the state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and also provides employment to nearly 35% of the state’s population that is dependent on the sector, according to official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omicron-prompts-5-8-cancellations-but-goa-remains-booked-this-new-year-s-eve-101640684459114.html

Here’s why they are agitating||Hundreds of resident doctors from several government-run hospitals across Delhi have been protesting for the past few days over the delay in NEET-PG counselling, demanding that the process must be expedited.A protesting doctor told news agency ANI on Tuesday they were trying to march towards the Supreme Court on Monday when they tried to go to the Delhi Police but were stopped and “beaten up” by them. They are marching towards the top court on Tuesday as well, the doctor added.The protest took a dramatic turn on Monday after the doctors and police personnel had a face-off on the streets of Delhi, with both sides claiming injuries during the scuffle.The Federation of Resident Doctors' Association (FORDA), which is leading the stir, has claimed several of its members were "detained" when they tried to hold a protest march from Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) to the Supreme Court on Monday.Also read | Delhi doctors to continue protests over NEET counselling, call for shutdownA PTI report cited FORDA president Manish as saying that, "police force was used and many doctors were injured" during the face-off.On the other hand, the Delhi Police have denied allegations of lathicharge or use of abusive language from their end, and said, 12 protestors were detained and released later, the report further added.Delhi | Resident doctors of various hospitals protest over delay in NEET-PG counselling"Today also we are trying to march towards Supreme Court.

I congratulate you and whole of Uttar Pradesh for this achievement.”Stating that the metro ride that he took earlier in the day was a memorable experience, Modi said that before 2014, the total length of metro running in Uttar Pradesh was 9km. “The length of the metro increased to a total of 18 km between 2014-2017. If we include Kanpur Metro today, the length of metro in UP has now exceeded 90 km.”The Prime Minister also pointed out that before 2014 only five cities had metro services. Today Uttar Pradesh alone has metro services in five cities, he added.The completed 9km long section of Kanpur Metro Rail Project stretches from IIT-Kanpur to Moti Jheel. The entire length of the Metro project is 32km and it is being built at ₹11,000 crore.In 2019, chief minister Yogi Adityanath started the construction work and the trial run took place on the 9km IIT-Kanpur to Motijheel Priority Corridor on November 10 this year.“Improving urban mobility has been one of the key focus areas of the Prime Minister.

28-12-2021||India||PM Modi launches blockchain-based digital degrees at IIT Kanpur. All you need to know about the technology||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a system to award blockchain-based educational degrees in digital form to students. These digital degrees can be verified globally and are unforgeable, according to IIT Kanpur director.The technology has been developed by the institute under the National Blockchain Project.Later, addressing the convocation, PM Modi said that technology is the future and it is getting priceless gifts from prestigious institutes like IIT Kanpur.Here is everything you need to know about the blockchain-based digital degree and how it will impact the educational sector in the futureDecentralised technologyThe blockchain system works on the principle of decentralisation. This means that the control is not in the hands of a central agency, but to a distributed network of nodes.This will help in keeping the data safe even if any specific node is compromised.Also, the information in a blockchain is recorded and stored sequentially along with an exact timestamp. The previous information can’t be altered, only amended by adding a new block. This makes tampering with a transcript very hard.Maintaining student recordsThe blockchain technology can simplify the tedious task of maintain the records of students by making them digitised. Also, the students will be able to access their records remotely.According to US-based Maryville University, the blockchain technology can simplify the verification process. Any institute can do so with a few clicks instead of going through lots of paper documentation, in cases of transfer students, or sharing records with employers, or issuing degrees.Help in preparing curriculum and gradingThe blockchain technology, through its algorithms, also allows teachers to execute a particular curriculum when certain conditions are met. The teachers can set lessons and courses into a blockchain, including programming the tasks too. The algorithm can then verify the completion of each task and provide students with the next one until all the tasks are complete.The same technology can also assist the teachers in grading. The blockchain technology can grade students based on their responses in exams – the algorithm takes into consideration questions, answers, and scoring parametres.Lowering costsThe blockchain technology can lower costs by opening affordable paths to learning. It will require less manual intervention, thereby reducing the need to hire more staff for processes.The technology is already being used in the financial sector and has been powering currencies like bitcoin.ChallengesIronically, security is one of the primary challenges of using the blockchain technology for any purpose. Increased security doesn’t mean that blockchain is not vulnerable. It also eliminates the possibility of modifying student records for legitimate purposes.There is also a limitation with scaling the system beyond a certain level. Increasing the network means adding more blocks, which will slow down the speed of transaction as each transaction requires peer-to-peer verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blockchainbased-digital-degrees-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-technology-101640677737420.html

28-12-2021||India||'Conquer technology but don't become robots': PM Modi to students at IIT Kanpur||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed the 54th convocation ceremony of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur where he told the students that spending time at the prestigious institute “massively transformed” them. He also said that IIT Kanpur has given them a massive canvas. He also urged the students to “choose challenges and not comfort”.“Now there is no ‘Fear of Unknown’, now you have the courage to explore the whole world. There is no longer the ‘Query of Unknown’, but ‘Quest for the Best’ and a dream to conquer the whole world,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also told the students that the training that they have received, skills and knowledge they have acquired will definitely help them in making a mark of their own in the world.He then lauded the history if Kanpur and its diversity.“Kanpur is one of the few cities in India that is so diverse - from Satti Chaura Ghat to Madari Pasi, from Nana Saheb to Batukeshwar Dutt. When we visit this city, it seems as if we are traveling to that glorious past, of the glory of the sacrifices of the freedom struggle,” said PM Modi.“The Dandi March in 1930 had given a direction to the freedom movement. The youth who were 20–25-year-old then experienced their golden phase in 1947. You are stepping into a similar golden era of your lives,” he added.Just before his address, the Prime Minister inaugurated a blockchain-driven system to deliver educational degrees. This is a massive leap in the field of technology, he said, adding that the 21st century is completely technology driven.“Even in this decade, technology is going to increase its dominance in different fields. Life without technology would now be incomplete in a way. This is the age of competition of life and technology and I am sure you will definitely get ahead in this,” said PM Modi.He, however, asked the students to become champions of technology, conquer it but avoid turning into robotic versions of themselves. “Do work on internet of things, but don't forget emotions of things.”“When the country's independence completed 25 years, we should have done a lot by then to stand on our feet. Since then, it is too late, the country has lost a lot of time. Two generations have passed in between so we don't have to lose even 2 moments,” the Prime Minister further said.He then appealed to the students to be impatient to create an Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).The event was attended by Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other leaders. The institute held a physical convocation after a year as it was held virtually last year due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conquer-technology-but-don-t-become-robots-pm-modi-to-students-at-iit-kanpur-101640674457306.html

28-12-2021||India||Diplomatic pressure by Modi govt pays off with SFJ Multani arrest in Germany||The arrest of banned Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) radical Jaswinder Singh Multani by German police is a culmination of more than 72 hours of hectic diplomacy by the Modi government with Berlin with New Delhi making it clear that it would hold Germany accountable if any bomb blast took place in Mumbai or Delhi.According to officials based in Berlin and New Delhi, the Modi government provided actionable intelligence to the German embassy in Delhi and back in Berlin to convince the Federal Police about the urgency of the matter. Indian Embassy officials were recalled from their Christmas holidays by top Ministry of External Affairs officials to ensure that the German authorities understand the seriousness of the matter about an impending terror strike on Mumbai. It is understood that Multani had been able to send explosives to Mumbai with a terror team being assembled for the strike. While the SFJ terrorist is currently being interrogated by the German police, Indian security agencies and the MEA are totally tight-lipped on the matter.The arrest of Multani by German authorities is a huge step in bilateral relations as it will also force countries like the UK and Canada to take action against Sikh separatists, who are being backed by the Pakistani deep state. The inaction on part of the UK and Canada, despite being India’s strategic partners, has convinced Indian security agencies say that these countries with large Sikh populations are trying to fish in troubled waters. Multani recently come to notice of the security agencies for arranging and sending weapons consignments comprising explosives, hand grenades and pistols from across the border with the help of his Pakistan based operatives and arms smugglers. He was planning to carry out terrorist activities in Punjab by using the smuggled consignments.On February 7, 2021, Punjab police initially arrested four local radical criminal module members belonging to the Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Ferozepur districts. Police also recovered 8 country-made pistols along with 8 magazines and 7 cartridges from them. The module members procured the illegal pistols from MP based Sikligar Sikhs and others for carrying out radical/criminal activities in Punjab. Subsequently, Punjab police arrested another radical criminal, Jeevan Singh of Mansa, who was radicalised and motivated by Multani (on social media to target a key farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU-Rajewal. Multani also sent funds to Jeevan Singh for arranging locally made weapons for targeting Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU-Rajewal being linked with left-wing communist ideology.In August 2021, Multani motivated and radicalised Saroop Singh from Johal Dhaiwala of the Tarn Taran district. Police arrested Saroop Singh and recovered 2 hand grenades from him. He was contacted on Facebook by a guy from ‘Surrey’, who was in fact Multani. Later, Multani connected with Saroop Singh on WhatsApp. JSM sent money through Western Union and sent two hand grenades (86P) at Amritsar-Harike road (Tarn Taran) from across the border and shared a photo of the location and asked him to collect them.Two FIRs have been registered against Jaswinder Singh Multani in SAS Nagar and Amritsar. He is closely associated with all the core members of SFJ.

Later, the Kerala police crime branch pieced together all information provided by the other inmate to reach the conclusion, the ADGP said.Jayanandan, who is lodged in Thiruvanthapuram central jail, was formally arrested by the crime branch and a fresh charge sheet will be filed against the serial offender, said Sreejith.According to the police, the twin murder took place on May 30, 2004, when a retired executive officer V Nanikutty Ammal (73) and her cousin TV Narayana Iyer (60) were brutally killed in their home. Both were attacked with a ripper, police said.Though police initially had suspected Jayanandan’s (who also goes by the name Ripper Jayanandan) role in the double murder based on his modus operandi, they failed to get any corroborative evidence. Most of his victims were elderly people and attacked with a ripper, police said. While in most cases robbery was the main motive, he also sexually abused some of his victims, police said.The ADGP said one of the witnesses, who saw the assailant coming out of the house after the crime, also identified the accused during a parade last month. Later, the crime branch recovered some gold stolen from the house.“It was a difficult case to crack. Now we have solid evidence against the serial killer,” said the ADGP. An accused in eight murder cases, besides several burglaries and attacks, Jayanandan was sentenced to death in the double murder of an aged couple in Thrissur in 2014. The Kerala high court, however, commuted it to life sentence without parole in 2016. According to the police, all murders took place between 2002 and 2006. In 2013, he escaped from the central jail in Thiruvananthapuram after scaling an eight-metre-high wall, but police netted him again after three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-serial-killer-jayanandan-behind-2004-kochi-double-murder-kerala-police-101640632192896.html
28-12-2021||India||Stir against paddy cultivation: Telangana Congress chief held for bid to gherao CM’s farmhouse||Hyderabad police on Monday arrested Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and parliamentarian A Revanth Reddy after he tried to lead a delegation of party leaders to Erravelli village in Siddipet district to lay siege to the farmhouse of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, officials said. The leaders were detained for three hours before being let off in the evening, the officials added.On Sunday, Reddy had announced that Congress would organise a “Rachabanda” (open forum) programme at the chief minister’s farmhouse at Erravelli village to expose the latter’s double standards on the cultivation of paddy during the Rabi season. He alleged that KCR was cultivating paddy in 150 acres of his farmhouse while asking the farmers of the state not to raise paddy in their fields during the Rabi season on the pretext that the Centre refused to buy. This lead to the police gathering in large numbers at Reddy’s Jubilee Hills residence Sunday night and keeping under house arrest. They took him into custody soon after he came out to proceed to Erravelli at around 2 pm. Along with the PCC chief, the police arrested several other Congress leaders, including PCC vice-president Mallu Ravi, and took them to Amberpet police station, the police said. Those kept in house arrest on Monday morning included former MPs V Hanumantha Rao and Madhu Yashki, former ministers D Sridhar Babu, Ponnala Lakshmaiah and Md Shabbir Ali and Telangana Mahila Congress president Sunitha Rao. Speaking to media at the Amberpet police station, the PCC chief said the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government had kept the farmers in a state of uncertainty for the last three months. “Many farmers committed suicide due to the inability of the state government in purchasing paddy during the Kharif season. Now, the chief minister tells them not to raise paddy during the Rabi, stating that his government won’t procure paddy in the season. On the other hand, KCR himself is cultivating paddy in 150 acres,” he said. Stating that he wanted to show to the media how KCR was practising double standards, Reddy wondered whether Erravelli was a prohibited area. “Why were we prevented from going to the village? Is the chief minister afraid of being exposed?” he asked. The PCC chief vowed to go ahead with the Rachabanda programme at any cost even at a later date. He accused both the TRS government in the state and the BJP government at the Centre of cheating the farmers. Meanwhile, Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party president Bandi Sanjay staged a six-hour-long Deeksha at the state BJP head office in Hyderabad in protest against the indifferent attitude of the Telangana government in filling up job vacancies for the last seven years. Sanjay told reporters that the BJP would step up agitation and stall the state assembly sessions if the TRS government did not release the job notifications by the first week of January. He described KCR as “inhuman”, as there was no response from the government despite several suicides by the unemployed youth. “We never expected that we would have to take up fasting demanding recruitments in separate Telangana state,” Sanjay said. Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind, Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender and several other BJP leaders spoke at the Deeksha programme. Reacting strongly to the agitations by the Congress and the BJP, senior TRS leaders and state animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivasa Yadav said the opposition parties were craving cheap publicity by taking up meaningless protests. “They have no other business except making false allegations against the chief minister. The Telangana has state achieved remarkable progress in the last seven years. Agriculture has grown by leaps and bounds during the KCR regime. It is the Centre which has betrayed the state by refusing to buy paddy,” Yadav alleged. On the unemployment issue, the minister said the TRS had filled up 130,000 vacancies in the last seven years and would be issuing notification for filling up of another 60,000 vacancies shortly.
28-12-2021||India||The year that was: Hacker at the centre of political furore||Srikrishna, a 26-year-old hacker, was the focal point of the one of the controversies that rocked the BJP government in Karnataka. A probe into an 11-month-old case in Bengaluru involving a cryptocurrency hacker has snowballed into a political controversy with opposition parties accusing the ruling party of a cover-up to protect “two influential politicians”. Who is Sriki? Sriki was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of police on Nov 18, 2020, in a drug peddling case. He had bought drugs from international dealers using bitcoins on the dark web. In the interrogation that followed the CCB found that the software engineer was involved in a series of online crimes. What was the controversy? Police were accused of failing to inform central agencies about Srikrishna’s involvement in the infamous Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange hack in 2016. The Bitfinex hack had alerted international authorities as 1.19 lakh bitcoins were stolen in 2016 and it is considered one of the biggest crypto exchange hackings so far. Alleging there was an intentional delay in informing the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation and Interpol, the Congress alleged that police waited for more than three months to inform central agencies and it was done on behalf of the senior BJP leaders. What police say? Police denied the claims that there was a delay in sharing information. “It is a matter of fact that even though the arrest of the said accused attained wide media publicity till date no foreign law enforcement agencies nor any foreign companies have approached the Bangalore Police about any hacking,” a police statement said. The missing Bitcoins The Congress accused Bengaluru police of misappropriation in handling the Bitcoins allegedly seized during the investigation. Quoting a press note released by Bengaluru police on January 12, 2021, the Congress said 31 Bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were seized by police during the probe, which were missing from the charge sheet submitted before the court. Responding to allegations about the “missing bitcoins”, another senior officer admitted the police department did announce the seizure of the ₹9 crore worth of bitcoins from Srikrishna. “He had done an evidence collection in the presence of two experts, where Srikrishna showed a bitcoin account with 31 bitcoins in it. With the help of experts, he had changed the login details of the account and considered it as seized. However, several days later we realised the seized account didn’t belong to Sriki. We have submitted all these details before the court also. I don’t understand why there is a controversy over this,” said the officer. Where is Sriki now? The controversy has been muted since police came out with a clarification. After the political controversy, Sriki was arrested on charges of drug possession on November 10. He was granted conditional bail a day later. After coming out on bail, he had gone absconding, resulting in the opposition demanding protection for the hacker. However, police said a few days before the charge sheet was filed by the CID, he has appeared before police.

Apart from the police officer, the court has imposed a fine on the rehabilitation centre. The court further expressed its displeasure over the act of moral policing by law enforcement agency and said police don’t have the right to interfere with a person’s married life. The verdict was given by a bench headed by justice NS Sanjay Gowda after hearing a petition filed by the woman seeking her release from the rehabilitation centre meant for human trafficking victims. The petitioner, who got married in 2004 and had a daughter out of wedlock, decided to move out of her husband’s house along with the kid in 2011 over a family dispute. She told the court that after her husband filed a missing complaint with police, she was summoned to the police station. The woman told police that she was in love with a man living in the neighbourhood and wanted to live with him, hence she decided to end her marriage. The defendant in the case, inspector Balasaheb Patil asked the woman to reconcile with her husband and when she refused and decided to live on her own, he sent her to the rehabilitation centre. She also alleged that the inspector forcefully kept her in detention so that she could not have any contact with the outside world, particularly the man whom she loves. The court said that the woman had not requested shelter in the first place and since she rejected living with her husband, she had been sent to the rehabilitation centre. The court also said despite several requests, the woman was not allowed to go outside and said she was kept in illegal detention for 6 months. “This reflects a lack of humanity and sensitivity on the part of the police inspector,” said the court. In its order, the court ordered that the inspector and rehabilitation centre must pay the fine to the court and the registrar should deposit the amount in the name of the girl child as a fixed amount and the petitioner can take the interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-fines-police-officer-1l-over-illegal-detention-of-woman-101640631292333.html

Officials requesting anonymity said they were focussing on the Maharishi Ramayan Vidyapeeth Trust,which bought land inManjha Barhata and Shahnawazpur villagesfrom its Dalit owners. A state government official said the trust allegedly purchased the land from a Dalit person in the name of its own Dalit employee, who was identified as Ronghai, and later showed that the land had been donated to the body. Such a transaction violated norms which state that land owned by a scheduled caste person can only be sold to another Dalit person. A non-Dalit is not allowed to purchase land from a Dalit. In rare cases, permission of the district magistrate concerned is mandatory for such transactions. A case is also pending against the trust in the revenue court (administrative), Ayodhya. “After camping in Ayodhya for three days, the probe team has returned to Lucknow. Land deals of the trust are being investigated. The probe team scanned all documents related with the land deals of the trust,” said the state government official quoted above. “The team also sought details of the ongoing case against the trust in the revenue court (administrative),” added the official, requesting anonymity. The probe team also received a complaint against a senior official posted in Ayodhya whose relatives allegedly purchased land in Manjha Barhata village, a senior official, seeking anonymity.According to officials, the parcel of land purchased by the official’s relatives belonged to three brothers. “Only two brothers had sold the land. The third brother had refused to sell his portion of the land. However, his land has been forcibly occupied by the official’s relatives,” said the above official. According to a senior official of the revenue department, the probe was almost complete and the final report was being prepared for presenting to the chief minister. The probe team headed by Radhey Shyam Mishra, special secretary (Revenue), comprises three members. Radhey Shyam Mishra, special secretary IN THE department of revenue was probing land deals of around 15 officials of the state government, their relatives and politicians in Manjha Barhata and Shahnawazpur villages and other parts of Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharishi-ramayan-vidyapeeth-trust-under-scanner-in-ayodhya-land-purchase-case-101640631234873.html
28-12-2021||India||BJP’s Surya withdraws his comment after row||Bengaluru South MP and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Tejasvi Surya on Monday said he was “unconditionally withdrawing” his comments on the ‘Ghar Wapsi’ of people who converted from the Hindu faith to other religions as a way to protect and review the religion.“At a program held in Udupi Sri Krishna Mutt two days ago, I spoke on the subject of ‘Hindu Revival in Bharat’. Certain statements from my speech have regrettably created an avoidable controversy. I therefore unconditionally withdraw the statements,” Surya tweeted.The BJP leader, however, didn’t offer an apology for his comment, which was demanded by the Opposition. Speaking on Saturday at the Udupi Krishna Mutt, the young MP said, “Those people who have left their mother religion and have for various socio, political and economic reasons throughout India’s History. Those who have gone out of the Hindu fold must be brought back in whole, brought back to the mother faith, to the Hindu faith.” Surya spoke for close to an hour in the coastal district. He further went on to attack the ideas of other religions. “Christianity and Islam are not mere religions. They are political imperial ideologies, and Hindus should understand this,” he said. He added that it was essential for Hindus to understand “who their enemies are”. “The first thing we need to do, identify who is trying to wipe our religion from the face of the earth. This is essential for survival for Hinduism and the Hindu race,” he said. The speech attracted adulation from the hard right and criticism from the larger society. “If everyone has a #GharWapsi as desired by the BJP, where exactly will they fit them in the varna system or will all be considered as Brahmins by default? That would be an interesting proposition for #GharWapsi,” Priyank Kharge, former minister and Congress legislator from Kalaburagi said in a post on Twitter. “And these persons “brought back” will be casteless, I assume? This whole Hinduism is under threat is a ploy by the Hindutva brigade to reestablish the caste hierarchical society,” Karti Chidambaram, Congress MP from Tamil Nadu, said. The statements come at a time when there have been attacks against the Christian community in Karnataka, which under the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government, has been trying to implement contentious laws in the state. These include the recently mooted anti-conversion law, anti-cattle slaughter legislation and the special marriages act or which the right-wing calls ‘love jihad’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-surya-withdraws-his-comment-after-row-101640631233482.html
28-12-2021||India||Police complaint lodged against Bommai over anti-conversion bill||An activist on Monday lodged a police complaint against Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators over the controversial “anti-conversion Bill” in Raichur district, people familiar with the development said. However, a senior officer of the Lingasugur police station in the district said no FIR (first information report) has been registered. Complainant Manaiah R, a Communist Party of India (CPI) leader, alleged that the BJP has portrayed the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities in a bad light in the controversial Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, also known as “anti-conversion Bill”. “The anti-conversion Bill has shown the people of these communities as vagabonds, beggars and portrayed them to be the ones who get converted to other religions with the lure of money, cloth, enticements and acts of donations,” reads the complaint, a copy of which HT has seen, seeking action under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The Karnataka legislative assembly on December 23 passed the Bill, but it was not tabled in the Upper House of the state legislature. Besides Bommai, complainant Manaiah also named state’s home minister Araga Jnanendra, Assembly speaker Vishveshwara Kageri and all BJP MLAs in his complaint. A senior officer of the Lingasugur police station said no FIR has been registered, citing Article 212 of the Constitution that bars judiciary from probing into House proceedings. “We have given in writing to the complainant that a case can’t be registered. We don’t have any powers to book a case against the legislature as the constitution doesn’t allow it… If he wants to take action, he has to approach the speaker (who is named in the complaint),” said the police officer, requesting anonymity. As per Article 212, the “validity of any proceedings in the legislature of a state shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure. No officer or member of the Legislature of a State in whom powers are vested by or under this Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order, in the Legislature shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-complaint-lodged-against-bommai-over-anti-conversion-bill-101640631232223.html
28-12-2021||India||Eateries stare at loss after Karnataka steps up Covid curbs||Pubs and restaurants in Bengaluru are staring at big losses end of the year after the Karnataka government imposed a night curfew and several other restrictions owing to the rising number of Covid cases and the Omicron variant scare. The night curfew between 10 pm to 5 am, applicable from December 28, has led to the cancellation of several special events planned for New Year’s Eve, resulting in major losses. The decision comes a day after the state reported seven more cases of Omicron infections, taking the tally in the southern state to 38. “From December 28 onwards, for about 10 days, we have called (imposed) a night curfew, invoking section 144 from night 10 pm to the next day morning 5 am,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in Bengaluru. According to restaurants and pub owners, the government the order has forced them to cancel several bookings that were made weeks in advance. Amit Roy, a member of the National Restaurant Association of India and owner of restaurants like Watson’s and Slug in Bengaluru said that advance payment and travel ticket booking for artists are proving to be an additional cost to establishments that are already suffering from a lack of customers. “The industry creates so many jobs and we employ more people during the festive season. We are going to lose all that money now. Even though we have been generating revenue for the government, but now they are ignoring us,” said Roy. The state excise department, which collects taxes levied on the sale of Indian made liquor (IML) and beer, breached the target by ₹431 crores as of March 31, keeping up its performance despite the pandemic in 2021. The Yediyurappa regime revised its revenue targets from IML and beer in May after the state underwent a spell of lockdown to curb the spread of the infection. While the government fixed a target of 22,700 crores, the excise department has mopped up 23,131 crores by March 31, according to officials. “The government has got its revenues as spirits are sold in several places and the budget targets are achieved. But those who are dependent on alcohol licence and even veg restaurants... What should they do and how to recover losses? We were not given any concessions in anything?” Govindraj Hegde, president of the Karnataka Wine Merchants Association, said. Hedge said that they are not planning to approach the government to reconsider the situation. “There is no point,” he added. Veerendra Kamat, Secretary of Bruhat Bangalore Hotel Association said people would have to return home by 10 pm due to the night curfew, which would discourage them to visit restaurants in the first place. “Our revenues come during these festive seasons, and the government’s decision would affect us severely,” he said. Apart from the hospitality industry, taxi drivers’ associations have also questioned the government’s move. “Many industries were just bouncing back after facing hardships over the past two years, even ours. In such times, they are imposing restrictions. There are no restrictions on political rallies, but it is we who have to suffer,” said Tanveer Pasha, president of Ola, Taxi for Sure and Uber Owners and Drivers’ Association. The new restrictions came after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai chaired an urgent meeting with ministers, senior government officials and members of the technical advisory committee (TAC) on covid-19 in Bengaluru on Sunday to impose “preventive” measures to contain the growing number of infections. A senior BBMP official, who didn’t want to be quoted, said the authorities are trying to take precautions because of the new variant. “If we allow another super spreader event to happen, we could witness another wave. It is in the best interest of the industry at large; we have taken these decisions,” the official said.
28-12-2021||India||Scrutinise vigilance, corruption complaints to find ‘systemic lacunae’: CVC||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has asked the central government ministries, departments and organisations under its jurisdiction to ensure that every vigilance or corruption complaint received against their officials be scrutinised thoroughly to see if any “systemic lacunae” may have resulted in irregular acts by the suspects.The findings of such scrutinies should then be used to devise “systemic improvements” to stop a recurrence, CVC said in a new set of guidelines on handling corruption or vigilance complaints. The 25-page document also asks government departments to prepare case studies giving details of modus operandi in such corruption matters, along with corrective measures, which should be circulated in the organisation to educate or alert other officials.In case the systemic loopholes may have an impact across the industry, or on other organisations, the details may be shared with the administrative ministry or department, the regulatory authorities concerned, and with the Commission for issuing appropriate guidelines, CVC added. HT has reviewed the guidelines, issued on December 24, aimed at streamlining the process of receiving and handling thousands of vigilance or corruption complaints received from citizens every year. The guidelines say that complaints against government servants should be genuine and “not malicious, vexatious or frivolous” and should be based on verifiable facts. They should be specific with adequate evidence and should not be biased or based on personal grievances, the guidelines add. Apart from specifics on how the complaints should be framed and submitted, the guidelines specify that one particular issue should be raised in one complaint and that they should be about vigilance matters only.For the ministries and government departments, the guidelines ask that proper complaints registered to be maintained and each complaint be examined by the Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of the respective organisation. In case of complaints against officials of central public sector enterprises, public sector banks etc, the initial decision about the existence of vigilance angle in a complaint may be taken by the CVO, according to the guidelines. The guidelines clearly state that complaints against board-level appointees of public sector organisations must be forwarded to the administrative ministry. “Under no circumstances, CVO of an organisation should initiate action against the board-level appointee of his organisation.” The CVC, however, can ask CVOs to investigate and report against board-level appointees. A senior official, who asked not to be named, said: “These will create awareness among the public so that they are able to become active participants in the process of eliminating corrupt and irregular activities from public life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scrutinise-vigilance-corruption-complaints-to-find-systemic-lacunae-cvc-tells-govt-depts-101640631052949.html
28-12-2021||India||Expert panel recommends Covovax for emergency use||The subject expert committee (SEC) of the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) on Monday recommended an emergency use authorisation be granted to Covovax, the second coronavirus vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is expected to be available in large supplies once approved. According to a person aware of the process, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) will now issue a formal approval following which the Union government needs to include the dose in the immunisation programme. “The application was thoroughly examined and the expert panel has recommended it for restricted use in emergency situation,” said a government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.SEC recommendations are typically accepted within days. SII has the license to produce over two billion doses of the vaccine, and according to a government assessment in June, the company could provide millions of doses by December. The Covovax vaccine license and branding is similar to Covishield’s: both have been developed by foreign companies (US-based Novavax Inc in case of Covovax and UK’s University of Oxford and AstraZeneca) and have been licensed to SII for mass production in an effort to allow cheap and mass production.The World Health Organization on December 17 first approved Covovax, fulfilling an important precondition that may have been a part of the decision by the SEC on Monday. The vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine that delivers a full spike of the Sars-Cov-2 to train the immunity. It is the only other dose apart from the mRNA platform doses to demonstrate an efficacy of over 90% against symptomatic disease (against the original Sars-Cov-2 virus), but its production and development was delayed due to several factors, including raw material shortages.In May, this year, the company began at risk production of its second anti Covid vaccine, according to people familiar with the matter, even though there is no clarity on the number of doses that have been already manufactured.In March, the company chief executive officer, Adar Poonawalla, tweeted to inform that Covovax clinical trials had begun in India.On November 27, the subject expert committee evaluated and deliberated on SII’s application and sought additional data from the pharma company. The review of their application took time as the expert panel was looking at the opinion of other drugs regulators, especially the USFDA. SII submitted interim safety and immunogenicity data of phase 2/3 bridging clinical trial conducted in the country as well as interim clinical trial data of safety and efficacy from phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the UK and the US along with its application. The government recently permitted export of 20 million doses of Covovax to Indonesia produced in India by SII, as the vaccine was not yet approved for emergency use in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-recommends-covovax-for-emergency-use-101640630932898.html

The announcement was made by BJP election-incharge and Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat following a meeting with Singh, SAD (Sanyukt) chief Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, BJP president J P Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah at Shah’s residence. According to Shekhawat, a joint six-member committee comprising two leaders from each party will be formed to finalise the seat sharing pact. The parties will also issue a joint manifesto for the impending elections. “Today, we are formally announcing that we will contest the Punjab polls as alliance partners. A six-member committee, having two members from each party, would meet soon and start holding discussions to finalise the seat sharing as well as the manifesto of the alliance for the new Punjab,” Shekhawat said. This was Singh’s first meeting with Shah ever since the former announced floating the PLC on November 2. The former Punjab chief minister’s friend, Lt General TS Shergill (Retd), was also present in the meeting. “Met with Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda, Punjab BJP incharge Gajendra Shekhawat and Akali Dal (Sanyukt) Sukhdev Dhindsa to discuss details of alliance. Look forward to working together to give Punjab a stable government,” he tweeted after the meeting. According to senior BJP leaders familiar with the developments, Singh and Dhindsa held detailed discussions on the rising political scenario in Punjab, especially after 22 farmer unions announced their decision to contest the elections. On Saturday, the unions that protested against the Centre’s now-repealed farm laws under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), announced a political outfit, the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), to contest the state elections. The SKM has, however, decided to stay away from the polls. At Shah’s residence, a detailed discussion was also held on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s possible tour to Punjab in the first week of January, the BJP leaders said, seeking anonymity. Although no talks were held on the exact number of seats to be contested by each party, it is almost certain that the BJP will be the major partner in the alliance and may fight from at least 70 seats. The saffron party wants to contest on most of the urban and semi-urban seats where at least 45% of the electorate belongs to the Hindu and dalit communities, and other backward classes, the leaders said. With Akali stalwart Ranjeet Singh Brahmpura quitting SAD (Sanyukt) and returning to SAD last week, the BJP appears to be in no mood to give more than 8 to 10 seats to the party, the leaders added. 
28-12-2021||India||Pakistan summons Indian envoy over Haridwar hate speech||Pakistan on Monday summoned the senior-most Indian diplomat in Islamabad to convey its concerns over calls for violence against minorities by Hindu seers at a three-day event held in Haridwar. The charge d’affaires of the Indian high commission was summoned to the foreign ministry in Islamabad and asked to convey the Pakistan government’s serious concerns “over the widely reported open calls by Hindutva proponents for carrying out genocide of Indian Muslims”, an official statement said. Police in Haridwar registered a case on Thursday after videos of the three-day Dharma Sansad held during December 17-19 caused a furore as several seers participating in the event had called for violence against minorities. There was no response from the Indian side to the summoning of the diplomat by Pakistan’s Foreign Office. The Pakistani side impressed upon the Indian government that it was “highly reprehensible” that the seers who made the calls for violence had “neither expressed any regret nor the Indian government has condemned or taken any action against them so far”, the statement said. The reported hate speeches were viewed with grave concern by civil society and a cross-section of people in Pakistan, the statement said. A “toxic narrative against minorities, particularly Muslims and their persecution” has become a norm, and such incitement to violence had preceded riots in New Delhi in February 2020, the statement added. “India is expected to investigate these hate speeches and incidents of widespread violence against minorities, particularly Muslims and their houses of worship and take measures to stop such incidents from recurring in future,” the statement said. Pakistan asked India to ensure the safety, security and wellbeing of its minorities, including protection of their religious places and way of life. Relations between India and Pakistan are currently at an all-time low and the Indian side has summoned Pakistani diplomats in New Delhi several times in recent months to protest against instances of oppression of Pakistan’s Hindu minority and attacks on Hindu temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-summons-indian-envoy-over-haridwar-hate-speech-101640630872141.html
28-12-2021||India||No plans yet to vaccinate kids younger than 15, say officials||India currently has no plans to vaccinate children younger than 15, a government official said, citing a risk profile that the administration considered before allowing the 15-18 age group to become eligible from next month.Several countries are inoculating younger children, in some cases as young as five, and there have been stronger calls to expand the universal coronavirus vaccination in light of the threat posed by the highly resistant and transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2.“Our decision is solely based on scientific data that shows that children are not impacted to a great extent by the virus anywhere in the world,” said the official, asking not to be named. “We were initially of the opinion that vaccination should only be allowed for adults, but felt that these young adults (in the 15-18 age group) were going to school or college, or moving around, and so could be carriers of the virus.” When asked why India’s policy was different from that of the United States or the United Kingdom – both countries are vaccinating children of ages 5 and above – the official said India’s decision was also based on the serological survey conducted in July. “It showed that 67.6% of the population had exposure, which also had a significant amount of children,” said the official. At the time, Indian Council of Medical Research chief Balram Bhargava said the survey included children between six and 17 years, and it was found that two-third of the general population above the age of six years had been infected already. “Why should we unnecessarily inflict vaccination on young children”” the official quoted above asked, contending that a purported race to vaccinate everyone could be a marketing gimmick.“Schools and colleges have also been open for some time now in different parts of the country and we are not seeing any surge of infections there. Neither are we seeing children falling seriously ill,” the official said. As the Centre and states move to tighten Covid regulations due to the spread of the Omicron variant, the government’s assessment indicates they are hopeful the threat is manageable. “Out of the 500 cases that have been detected of Omicron in India, half of them are fine and gone home. Forget serious illness, only 13% are symptomatic,” the official said. “If countries like South Africa teach us anything, it is that Omicron spreads rapidly and leads to a very quick increase in daily cases, but the fall is also equally rapid.” From a high of more than 45,000 cases a day, cases in South Africa fell to less than 15,000 new cases in the past 24 hours, data compiled by the government show. Officials also point out that of the around 186,000 known Omicron cases worldwide, there have been only 32 confirmed deaths.However, stricter precautions are necessary to put citizens on guard, they said. The government has begun holding a daily assessment of the situation.“Vaccination of children below 12 years may not be necessary as the number of severe disease is very small. Overall, children between 15-18 years have a slightly higher incidence of severe disease, as compared to below 15. So, at present, the priority is to complete double vaccination of adults, then boosters for the elderly and vulnerable, and eventually target young adults below 18 years,” said Sumit Ray, head of department, Critical Care Medicine, Holy Family Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plans-yet-to-vaccinate-kids-younger-than-15-say-officials-101640630636924.html
28-12-2021||India||Check all cargo containers at ports for contraband: Amit Shah||Cargo containers at all Indian ports will have to be scanned for contraband, home minister Amit Shah said at a meeting Narco Coordination Centre (NCORD), according to people familiar with the development. Authorities at private and state-run ports will have to make arrangements for container scanners and related equipment, he instructed. Concerned authorities will also have to build pool of dog squads that can sniff out outlawed narcotics, he said. The Narcotics Control Bureau will frame a policy in this regard in coordination with the National Security Guard so that law enforcement agencies in all states have access to canine squads that can detect illegal drug consignments.The directions come three months after 3,000 kg of high quality Afghan heroin worth ₹210 billion was caught by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence at Gujarat’s Mundra Port run by Adani Group. HT exclusively reported on the recovery of the largest ever haul of illegal drugs on September 20. The government and security agencies have since then held a series of meetings to find ways to stop drug smuggling through containers, as it was deemed impossible for law enforcers to physically check every container entering the country. Among other key decisions taken on Monday in the NCORD meeting to deal with the drugs smuggling include forming a dedicated Anti-Narcotics Task Force under state police chiefs, which will work as state NCORD secretariats; putting in place an effective system to stop increasing use of Dark Net and cryptocurrency in illegal drugs trade; and using drones, satellites and other technology to keep a watch on illegal drug cultivation across the country, the home ministry said in a statement. NCORD was set up in 2016 under Director General of NCB for effective coordination among all drug law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders, and to also provide a common platform for discussions on drug trafficking related issues. Among those who attended the meeting on Monday included NCB chief S N Pradhan, home secretary Ajay Bhalla, state chief secretaries, chiefs of paramilitary forces and other central agencies. Shah also decided on Monday that a standing interministerial committee will be set up to curb misuse of dual-use precursor chemicals, which will be conducted by the ministry of chemical and fertilizers, and will have representatives from NCB, department of revenue and finance ministry. Along with this, it was decided that “to stop misuse of dual-use prescription medicines, a standing interministerial committee under ministry of health and family welfare should be formed which having experts from department of pharma, National Medical Commission, NCB and the industry,” the ministry statement added. The home minister further asked the agencies and states to prepare a narcotics training module at the national level so that police, central armed police forces, prosecutors and people from civil departments can be trained under it. He directed to form a central NCORD unit under NCB at the national level, which will coordinate all anti-drug efforts with the state units, as well as to have an integrated NCORD portal for information exchange. It was also decided that a national narcotics call centre called MANAS will be launched, elaborate awareness campaigns against drugs would be undertaken, and drug de-addiction centres will be established in all major prisons across the country. Illegal drugs worth ₹18.81 billion was seized between 2018 and 2021, which was three times the value of such drugs seized between 2011 and 2014, the home ministry said. Between 2018 and 2021, about 3.5 million kilograms of drugs were confiscated, while between 2011 and 2014, about 1.6 million kilogram of drugs were confiscated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/check-all-cargo-containers-at-ports-for-contraband-amit-shah-101640630524732.html

With the surge in cases, the Centre has issued a fresh advisory to all states and Union territories, asking them not to let their guard down.The Election Commission has already visited Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand and is scheduled to visit Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday for three-day consultations with stakeholders ahead of the elections. Uttar Pradesh, with 403 assembly constituencies, will be largest state elections to be held during the pandemic so far.The Allahabad high court on Thursday urged the Election Commission to consider postponing the polls in Uttar Pradesh, considering the increasing threat of the Omicron variant. The court asked the officials to stop political rallies in case the elections could not be postponed.Speaking after the visit to Uttarakhand last week, chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra said the commission would examine the court’s observation after analysing the situation in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-reviews-covid-containment-measures-in-5-poll-bound-states-101640630523207.html
28-12-2021||India||Kashi film festival begins with tinge of UP poll campaign||The first Kashi film festival was inaugurated on Monday with fanfare and the promise of attracting more filmmakers to the state, but what was not lost behind the glitz of the silver screen was the campaign mode that Uttar Pradesh is now in ahead of next year’s assembly elections.Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan and the state’s tourism, culture and religious affairs minister, Neelkanth Tiwari, who is also the MLA from Varanasi (south), spoke at the event about the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The three-day festival will showcase films related to Varanasi including some which have been shot in the city. The opening film of the festival is Akshay Kumar starrer Toilet ek Prem Katha. Kishan, the first speaker at the inauguration ceremony, hailed the Adityanath government for a range of achievements, from several state new highways to schemes ensuring ration for all. “We have a saaf sutra (clean) government. It is a transparent government with no corruption charges,” he said. “In Yogi’s UP, there is vaccination, protection, and education,” he said.Tiwari, on his part, spoke about how the Modi government has given relief to “mothers and sisters” by bringing a law against Triple Talaq, in a reference to a passed in Parliament months after the Modi government returned to power for the second term in 2019. He narrated the plight of religious minorities in countries such as Pakistan, asked why they should not be eligible for citizenship in India.The state minister also credited PM Modi for “resolving the 500 years-old land dispute in Ayodhya to create Ram Mandir” and added that the Union government has given employment, housing, universal health care in reference to programmes such as MGNREGS, PM Awaj Yojna and Ayushman Bharat.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won an unprecedented 312 seats in the 2017 assembly elections is pushing to break that record in the face of a challenge for former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party.Speaking about the push for promoting UP as a film-making destination, Kishan said that Adityanath was making a film city which would be bigger than Hyderabad’s Ramoji studio. The new Noida film city, announced by the UP government in 2021, will span 1000 acres and is expected to be completed by 2024. 
28-12-2021||India||Kanpur perfume seller sent to 14 day judicial custody||Officials found 23kg gold, ₹17 crore in cash and 600 kg of illegally procured sandalwood in their 80-hour search at businessman Piyush Jain’s four properties in Kannauj, a government statement said on Monday, as the controversial perfume trader was sent to judicial custody for 14 days.The Directorate of GST Intelligence (DGGI) also said in its statement that the sandalwood was worth ₹6 crore, and that the recovery in Kannauj was in addition to the ₹177.45 crore that the Central GST, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and the Income Tax department found between December 23 and 24 in Kanpur. Jain was arrested on Sunday. On Monday, teh court of the metropolitan magistrate (corporation), Kanpur, remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days after rejecting the Central GST’s plea for his remand. DGGI roped in the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) for further investigation as the gold recovered had foreign markings, the statement said.The Central GST informed the court that the search was continuing in Kannauj. It also informed the court that it wanted to produce Jain in a CGST court in Ahmedabad.DGGI said Jain confessed that the cash recovered from his house was related to the sale of goods without paying GST. “The evidence is overwhelming to show that massive tax evasion by Piyush Jain and his Odochem Industries,” the DGGI statement said.Piyush Jain’s lawyer Subodh Malviya said he was remanded in judicial custody.The lawyer filed an application with the CGST, informing them that the Jains were ready to pay the penalty that accrues to around ₹52 crore. During the hearing, Malviya informed the court that Jain should be released on this ground. The public prosecutor told the court that searches on Jain’s premises in Kannauj were going on and the teams recovered gold from there.Jain’s neighbours said he kept a low profile in the area and use his rickety Bajaj Super scooter, which is parked inside his house, for getting around the city. “I never saw him in Kannauj moving in cars like other perfume businessmen do,” said a neighbour of Jain, requesting anonymity .Another neighbour said Jain showed up at weddings in rubber slippers or in shabby clothes, sometimes even pyjamas. “He isn’t social at all, hardly makes relations or converses in the neighbourhood. When he was in Kannauj, he and others in the family used to keep to themselves,” said the second neighbour, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-perfume-seller-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-101640630394362.html
28-12-2021||India||Modi to visit UAE in Jan to bolster bilateral ties: Officials||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to make his first foreign visit in 2022 to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in early January to chart a course to take forward the burgeoning relations between the two countries, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. India and the UAE will be commemorating the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year, and the visit is expected to focus on both deepening cooperation and looking for new areas for collaboration, the above-mentioned people said. Several agreements in different areas are likely to be signed during the visit. The dates for what is anticipated to be a brief visit are yet to be finalised by the two countries, though it is expected that the prime minister could travel to the UAE around January 6, the people said. Modi is also expected to visit the India Pavilion at the Dubai Expo, which has attracted more than 604,000 visitors in nearly three months. The pavilion has showcased the Indian start-up ecosystem through initiatives such as “Elevate”, which displays unconventional solutions created by 500 Indian start-ups, and also highlighted investment opportunities in sectors such as new and renewable energy, space, urban and rural development, oil and gas, textiles and education. India and the UAE are also engaged in negotiations for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) and are hoping to complete the talks by March next year. The issue is expected to figure during the prime minister’s visit, the people said. The strong bilateral ties between India and UAE got a boost when Modi visited the Emirates in August 2015, marking the beginning of a new strategic partnership between the two sides. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces, was the chief guest at the Republic day celebrations in January 2017. India and the UAE are also now part of a new grouping, which includes the US and Israel and is working on economic and business collaboration. The foreign ministers of the four countries are expected to hold their first in-person meeting in March to take forward an agenda focused on economic and infrastructure projects. The UAE is home to more than three million Indians who are a key source of remittances. India has been pushing countries in West Asia to facilitate the return of Indian workers who had come home at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Defence and security ties between India and the UAE have also grown in recent years. The Indian Army chief, Gen MM Naravane, made the first-ever visit by an army chief to the UAE in December last year, followed by Indian Air Force chief, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, who visited the emirates in July this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-visit-uae-in-jan-to-bolster-bilateral-tiesofficials-101640630392459.html
28-12-2021||India||‘Don’t let guard down’: Centre cautions states amid Omicron concerns||New Delhi Amid growing concerns of spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the Centre on Monday advised all states and Union territories (UTs) to not let their guard down, and consider imposing need-based restrictions ahead of new year celebrations.All states and UTs need to implement a “normative framework” for taking evidence-based containment measures at district and local level till January 31, home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote in a letter. “I would like to reiterate that all the states and UTs must observe all precautions, and not let the guard down. Local and district administration, based on the normative framework and assessment of the situation, should promptly take appropriate containment measures. States may consider imposing need based, local curbs and restrictions, to control the crowd during the festive season,” Bhalla said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the status of Covid-19, the Omicron variant and preparedness of health systems across the country on December 23, following which he directed that everyone should maintain a high level of vigil and alertness, the home secretary said. Bhalla asked the states and UTs to refer to his earlier note, issued on December 21, which focuses on the fivefold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid any surge in Covid-19 cases, especially keeping in view the Omicron variant. The national directives Covid-19 management, such as wearing of masks and practising social distancing, shall continue to be followed throughout the country, the letter said. “For the enforcement of social distancing, states, UTs, may as far as possible, use the provisions of Section 144 (prohibiting gathering of four or more people in a specified area) of CrPC,” it added. According to the directive, any person violating these measures will be “liable to be proceeded against as per the provisions of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, besides legal action under Section 188 of CrPC, and other legal provisions, as applicable.” In his advisory last week, Bhalla said a normative framework has been provided and, with the presence of the Delta variant and detection of Omicron cases in many states, there is need for greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision making, and strict and prompt containment actions at the local and district levels, based on the assessment of the situation.The Centre emphasised the need to strengthen the health systems besides ensuring the installation and proper functioning of oxygen supply equipment.In a bid to prevent spread of any misinformation in respect of the new variant, all states and UTs should proactively and regularly hold media briefings at the highest level to disseminate correct information, Bhalla said. The country has so far recorded 578 cases of the Omicron variant and, with the new year celebrations approaching, experts fear the caseload may rise. Several states like Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have already reinforced restrictions like night movement and limits on large gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-let-guard-down-centre-cautions-states-amid-omicron-concerns-101640630278498.html
28-12-2021||India||Police yet to summon accused in Haridwar hate speech case||Haridwar police is yet to summon the three people named in a complaint on hate speech during a religious gathering as it is “gathering more evidence by verifying the videos of the event.” “Police haven’t yet send notices to the three named accused so far in the case to record their statements,” said inspector Rakendra Kataith, station house officer of Haridwar Kotwali police station, where a case was registered on December 23. “The probe in the case is ongoing, with the police gathering more evidence against the accused by verifying the videos of the speeches made by them during the event.” Police had registered a case under section 153 (a) of the India Penal Code (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred) against Jitendra Narayan Tyagi (formerly Waseem Rizwi) and other unidentified persons at Haridwar Kotwali police station after videos of the three-day Dharma Sansad held from December 17-19 caused a furore on social media, as participating religious leaders called for violence against minorities. One of the participants even said he “wished he could become Nathuram Godse with a revolver and pump all six bullets in former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s chest.”Later on December 25, police added names of two more accused – Annapurna Maa and general secretary of Hindu Mahasabha Dharamdas Maharaj, both hailing from Haridwar. The case is being investigated by a sub-inspector at Kotwali police station.“Such events and hate speeches won’t be tolerated,” Uttarakhand’s director general of police Ashok Kumar had said on December 24, assuring legal action against the accused. “Police had already registered a case on the basis of a complaint lodged by one Gulbahar Khan, in which only Tyagi was named, while others were unidentified,” Kumar had said. “However, police will be adding more names to the case as the probe unfolds.”
28-12-2021||India||Centre to scale up skill programme: Officials||The Centre is scaling up its existing skill development training programmes to allow workers from India to tap work opportunities abroad. In line with the government’s intent, the national skill development corporation under the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship has launched a new programme TEJAS to train, certify and place 10,000 Indian workers in the United Arab Emirates in one year in partnership with some of the leading employers in the region, officials said on Monday.According to an official of the Union ministry for skill development and entrepreneurship, which is the nodal ministry for overseeing skilling programmes, the international workforce mobility market opportunity for India is estimated to be 3.6 million in the next five years, of which 2.6 million Indians can be potentially placed in the GCC (Gulf cooperation council) countries, Europe, Australia, Canada, Russia and Malaysia.Through skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling initiatives under TEJAS, the government is aiming to prepare a trained workforce in both the blue-collar and the white-collar job sectors.“The programme will converge with the existing skill development programmes and leverage training infrastructure of ITIs, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra and Skill training institutes operating under the Central and state governments to ensure sourcing and supply of potential candidates,” said the official.Minister of state for skill development and entrepreneurship, Rajeev Chandrasekhar has held discussions with officials as well as top employers in the UAE for finalising the terms of the program, said the official quoted above.On the work being done to revamp the skilling programmes, Chandrasekhar said, “PM [Narendra] Modi has emphasised the need for upskilling digital skills in a very altered post-Covid world.”Work opportunities have been identified in sectors such as construction and facility management which includes electricians, plumbers and welders; in the logistics and transport sector; food and beverages; retail; IT; finance and healthcare sectors.Mobilisation of candidates will be done with the help of .skill development missions and the network of ITIs, PMKK, and colleges.
28-12-2021||India||Unlike Opposition, BJP is focussed on inclusive growth: PM Modi in HP||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday hit out at political opponents and said the Bharatiya Janata Party was focussed on inclusive development while opposition parties were mired in dynastic politics and selfish family interests.Speaking in Himachal Pradesh after inaugurating a raft of projects, Modi tweaked his party’s poll slogan of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (inclusive development for all) and extolled the benefits of the BJP’s double-engine government, a reference to the party being in power both in the state and at the Centre.Modi said there were two models of governance in the country: “Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas (inclusive development, everyone’s trust and effort)” and “khud ka swarth, parivaar ka swarth and parivar ka vikas (self interest, familial interest and family’s development)”.“Working on the first model, the Himachal Pradesh government not only implemented various schemes for the welfare of people of the state but also expanded Centre-sponsored schemes,” he said, adding the hill state also outperformed other states in vaccinating its adult population against Covid-19.He said the other model was about self-interest and vote bank. “This could be checked from vaccination data of the states where they are running a government.”The proponents of the second model made Himachal Pradesh wait for decades, he said. “That is why, Atal Tunnel was delayed which was completed by us. Similarly, Renuka Dam was also delayed for three decades.”State Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, however, termed Modi’s remarks as “rhetoric”.“Congress is the party that fought for independence of the country. Our leaders have laid their life for nation. All this rhetoric is meaningless,” he said.Himachal Pradesh goes to the polls late next year and the BJP faced some reverses in recent bypolls to three assembly seats and the Mandi Lok Sabha seat. Monday also marked four years of the Jai Ram Thakur government.Modi praised the Himachal Pradesh government for “valiantly fighting” the pandemic while ensuring that the pace of development remained unaffected.“Today, the Himachal Pradesh government has completed four years. During its tenure, the government fought against Covid-19 and simultaneously made sure that development works don’t stop,” he said.On Monday, the prime minister inaugurated 111MW Sawra-Kuddu Hydro Electric Project (HEP) constructed with an outlay of ₹2,081.60 crore and laid the foundation stones of the Renukaji Dam Project ( ₹6,946 crore), 210MW Luhri Stage-I ( ₹1,811 crore) and 66MW Dhaulasidh Power Project ( ₹688 crore). He also presided over the second groundbreaking ceremony of projects worth ₹28,197 crore in the state.Clad in a traditional Himachali cap, Modi stressed that ease of living was a priority of his government.“Our ease of living model is helping conservation of environment and the new hydropower projects, of which inauguration or foundation stones were laid today, is one step forward towards a climate-friendly new India,” he said.“The whole world is praising India for how our country is accelerating development while saving the environment by making full use of every resource of renewable energy.”He said India has achieved 40% installed electricity from non-fossil resources, which was set for 2030, which reflects the rapid pace at which India is working in this direction.“India had set a target in 2016 to meet 40% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil energy sources by 2030. Today every Indian will be proud that India has achieved this goal in November this year itself,” said Modi.Congratulating CM Thakur, Modi said despite cold weather conditions, the crowd at the rally showed that the people were satisfied with the achievements of the state government.Modi said he had an emotional relation with the land and mountains of Himachal Pradesh that played a key role in giving a direction to his life. He added that the government was alert about the damage caused to the mountains due to plastic.“Along with the nationwide campaign against single-use plastic, our government is also working on plastic waste management,” he said, urging tourists to help keep Himachal Pradesh clean and plastic-free.Stating that Himachal Pradesh had a vast potential for industrial development, Modi said the government was focusing on food processing, farming, pharma sector and tourism sector.“Government is promoting the food sector while lakhs of Himachal farmers have already adopted chemical-free natural farming,” he said, while urging farmers from other states to emulate their Himachal brethren. “If India is today called the pharmacy of the world, Himachal is the force behind it,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlike-opposition-bjp-is-focussed-on-inclusive-growth-pm-modi-in-himachal-pradesh-101640630271925.html

Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised,” Banerjee tweeted.The Missionaries of Charity is a Catholic religious congregation established in 1950 by Mother Teresa.Responding to the allegation, the Union government issued a statement saying the request to freeze Missionaries of Charity (MOC) accounts was made by the foundation itself to the State Bank of India. It acknowledged, however, that the renewal of FCRA registration of MoC was refused on December 25, citing “adverse inputs”, and that it has not yet applied for a review.“The application under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act for the renewal of FCRA registration of Missionaries of Charity (MoC) was refused on December 25, 2021, for not meeting the eligibility conditions under FCRA 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR) 2011. No request/revision application has been received from Missionaries of Charity for review of this refusal of renewal,” the ministry of home affairs said.The registration of Missionaries of Charity, under FCRA vide Registration No 147120001, was valid up to October 31, 2021, according to the ministry. It added that the validity was subsequently extended to December 31, 2021, along with other FCRA associations whose renewal applications were pending renewal.However, the ministry added, while considering the MoC’s renewal application, “some adverse inputs were noticed”. “In consideration of these inputs on record, the renewal application of MoC was not approved,” it said.Asked about the nature of “adverse inputs”, ministry officials declined to give further details.The government amended the FCRA in September 2020 to make the law stricter. A new provision in the law mandated that non-government organisations receiving foreign funding will have to operate bank accounts in State Bank of India in New Delhi only.The Missionaries of Charity, when asked about the controversy on Monday, said everything was fine.“We would like to clarify that the FCRA registration of the Missionaries of Charity has neither been suspended nor cancelled. Further there is no freeze ordered by the ministry of home affairs on any of our bank accounts. We have been informed that our FCRA renewal application has not been approved. Therefore, as a measure to ensure there is no lapse, we have asked our centres not to operate any of the FC accounts until the matter is resolved,” it said in a statement.The Trinamool Congress (TMC), however, alleged that the Centre was putting pressure on the organisation.“First the government of India intimidates. For weeks, right through to December 25. And then they pile on the pressure to extract this Shame on the MHA and its shameless damage control tactics,” tweeted Derek O’Brien, TMC Rajya Sabha MP.The Archdiocese of Kolkata condemned the Centre’s decision, though its statement mentioned the freezing of accounts.“In freezing the bank accounts of Missionaries of Charity Sisters and Brothers congregations, government agencies have given a cruel Christmas gift to the poorest of the poor,” tweeted Father Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church.Secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist), Surjya Kanta Mishra, also criticised the move on the same grounds. ““Yesterday, Christmas Day the Union Ministry froze all bank accounts of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity. The govt has frozen all the accounts in India, including cash in hand. Their 22,000 patients, including employees, are left without food and medicines,” he tweeted.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit out at Banerjee.“Poorly informed Mamata Banerjee gets it wrong, like always. This is what happens when you have an eye on Goa polls and religious polarisation and not governance is the only calling card,” Amit Malviya, BJP’s co-incharge of West Bengal, said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengalcentre-row-over-mother-teresa-s-missionaries-of-charity-101640630212372.html
28-12-2021||India||Variant watch: Time to rethink Covid metrics, open up India data||To recap the impressive speed at which scientists responded to the Omicron variant, there are three critical things to know. First, it spreads faster than any Sars-CoV-2 variant yet – a UK study by Imperial College London estimated that for every infection the Delta variant led to, Omicron led to three. Second, it is highly resistant to antibodies from a past infection or vaccination, but only as far as symptomatic disease was concerned. The risk of reinfection with Omicron rose 5.4-fold compared to Delta.But, and the third important point, is that it is significantly less likely to cause severe disease. Some of it could be due to its inherent trait – Imperial College researchers estimate a 0-30% reduction in risk for unvaccinated, previously uninfected people needing to go to a hospital. But most of it, as estimated by South African researchers, is likely due to a past infection or vaccination. On average, the UK study found the risk of needing hospital care to be almost halved.There are some associated insights too, like the two studies by researchers in Hong Kong, Cambridge and Japan that found the Omicron variant replicating more in the bronchus and nasal airways, but was significantly less potent in infecting the lungs. The import, then, is that Omicron is a threat because of the speed at which it spreads even though it is likely to cause milder disease. To look at it differently, if Delta variant caused 100 infections in, say, a week and led to four hospitalisations, Omicron would likely cause 300 infections with six hospitalisations in the same period. In the second week, given what we know of the transmissibility, this number will grow to eight Delta hospitalisations (from 200 infections) and 18 Omicron hospitalisations (from 900 infections). At a population scale, these numbers can be much larger with more confounders. In a population with more past immunity or a more recent vaccination surge, Omicron may cause much fewer hospitalisations. Conversely, a region not exposed to past waves or one where vaccines have waned, the Omicron wave may be more severe. Reorienting perspectivesThe uncertainties make the case for an outbreak to now be assessed more on hospitalisation and fatality rates instead of case rates, experts say. “We have to do a shift. For two years, infections always preceded hospitalisations which preceded deaths… it was largely the unvaccinated people getting infections then. Omicron changes that. We are moving through a phase where large populations that are vaccinated gets infected, be unwell, and bounce back after a few days. I no longer think that infections should be the major metric – sure, we should continue tracking it, especially in unvaccinated people – but we must focus on hospitalisation and deaths now,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, in an interview with ABC News on Sunday.In India, there is no official figure on hospitalisations. The Union health ministry issues a daily bulletin with cases, active cases, and testing bulletin, but offers no figures on how many people with Covid-19 were admitted to a medical care facility. In terms of states, only some, like Delhi, give hospitalisation data in their state-specific daily bulletin. A second expert too recently said this was problematic. “The fact that we are not tracking hospitalisations is going to become very critical in coming months. For example, if Omicron, which is highly transmissible, truly leads to lot of mild infections and we have nothing to worry about, we need to know that,” Bhramar Mukherjee, head of biostatistics at University of Michigan and an epidemiologist who has modelled India’s outbreak, in an interview with The Wire. Mukherjee added that with the lack of this data, restrictions based simply on surging cases can turn into overkill or unvaccinated people may not be aware of the higher risk they will be at. India’s data hurdleThe Indian-origin University of Michigan epidemiologist said predicting India’s outbreak is difficult because of “data denial, data opacity and data paucity”. “What is the breakdown of cases, hospitalisation and deaths, across age, sex and now vaccination status? I cannot find it,” she said during the interview. Last week, the routine press briefing on Covid-19 offered a brief illustration how misrepresented data could be problematic. One of the figures shared by the officials in a slide show claimed 91% of the known cases of Omicron were in fully vaccinated people – without accounting for significant caveats in the fine print. The fine print said vaccination details of 73 of the 183 samples were not available, which meant that in reality, only 47% were know to be fully vaccinated. But the main figures were reported as is, leading at least one respected civil society member to share photographs of a newspaper headline to falsely claim the “vaccinated were more likely to get infected”. Even if it were indeed 91%, a second major caveat was mentioned, either by the government or in the particular report: the large proportion of vaccinated people is simply a testing bias artefact. All international travellers, who are mostly likely to be vaccinated, are tested even if they are asymptomatic, and all positive samples are sequenced for their genome. Omicron changes the epidemic equation significantly. To understand that, all elements of the equation must first be reported and reported faithfully.
28-12-2021||India||Experts concerned as NCR draft regional plan 2041 doesn’t mention Aravalli range||A draft plan approved by the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) does not mention the Aravallis and tributaries of the Yamuna and Ganga in “natural zones”, triggering concerns among experts, who say that such a move will let states be selective about the areas they want to conserve.Under the NCR Regional Plan 2021, which is in force since 2005, nearly the entire Aravalli range in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan is protected, with no construction allowed in the area.While the Draft Regional Plan 2041 states that a “natural zone” is an area with features such as mountains, hills, rivers and water bodies, experts said that if implemented, it would leave out a large portion of the Arvallis from the protected zone. The draft plan was published by NCRPB on its website on December 9, with the board seeking public comments on it.According to the draft, the “natural zones” will be identified by states using revenue records and the ground situation.Chetan Agarwal, an environment analyst based in Gurugram, said that state governments have in the past tried to dilute the definition of the Aravallis. “Haryana has claimed that there are no Aravallis in Haryana records since 2016, but this was not accepted by the NCRPB earlier. In this context, the deletion of the ‘Aravallis’ from the definition of areas included in the Natural Conservation Zone in the new draft Regional Plan 2041 is troubling. This will have adverse implications for the air quality, groundwater recharge, forest cover and wildlife habitat in Delhi, Gurugram and Faridabad,” said Agarwal.An NCRPB official, however, said: “We have clearly stated which natural features fall in the natural zones and we have asked states to identify and notify these areas. State governments are answerable to their people. How can they leave out some areas? This time, we haven’t relied on satellite imagery and haven’t conducted any ground truthing because it’s a very resource intensive exercise. We have instead asked states to conduct ground-truthing exercises. This is why we haven’t named any places.”The current regional plan identifies the Aravalli ridge in Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana, forest areas, Yamuna, Ganga, Kali, Hindon, Sahibi and major lakes such as Badkal, Suraj Kund and Damdama as protected zones, where construction is not allowed. These areas have been further detailed in the sub-regional and development plans.The draft plan, however, does not name the areas and says mountains, hills, rivers, water bodies, forests notified under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, wildlife sanctuaries notified under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and eco-sensitive zones, wetlands and conservation under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 will be declared as “natural zones”. It also says that the extent of natural features under the zones will be identified. Experts say this will leave room for the states to be able to leave out large chunks from the conservation areas.“The previous regional plan was very clear and detailed as far as natural conservation zones. Of course, this leaves much to interpretation by states... The 0.5% restriction on construction has been made toothless as the Aravalli areas to which it is applicable have been removed. The regional plan is a guiding document for sub-regional plans that states develop. But if the guiding document itself is diluted, then obviously states can dilute further,” said Rahul Choudhary, environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-concerned-as-ncr-draft-regional-plan-2041-doesn-t-mention-aravalli-range-101640630031207.html
28-12-2021||India||Kerala tops Niti’s health index for 4th year in a row||Kerala is the best among India’s states in providing healthcare, while Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom of the table among big states, the Niti Aayog’s fourth State Health Index showed on Monday.The country’s most populous state, however, was adjudged the best in improving its performance, followed by Assam and Telangana. Kerala, which topped the overall health performance index for the fourth consecutive time, stood 12th on that count.The report – ‘Healthy States, Progressive India’– considers 15-24 indicators including neonatal mortality rate (NMR), sex ratio at birth, maternal mortality rate, under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) and governance, among others, which are grouped in the three domains of health outcomes, governance and key processes.The states are divided based on their size (19 big and eight small states) and Union territories.The federal think tank has prepared the report with technical assistance from the World Bank, and in consultation with the health ministry. It compared performance for financial year 2019-20 in comparison to 2018-19.Among the eight smaller states, Mizoram topped the list, while Nagaland was at the bottom of the table in overall performance. In the overall health performance of Union territories, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu topped the list, while Delhi ranked fifth.“States are beginning to take cognizance of indices such as the State Health Index and use them in their policymaking and resource allocation,” said Rajiv Kumar, vice-chairman, Niti Aayog.The incremental performance of states is crucial as it indicates efforts made by them to address challenges, officials said. While there is no change in the overall performance of states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar since last year, they have shown some improvement, the official said, requesting anonymity.Similarly, among the Union territories, the national capital emerged as the top performer in terms of improved performance, registering an incremental change of 9.7 percentage points from last year’s index.“Our objective through this index is to not just look at the states’ historical performance, but also their incremental performance. The index encourages healthy competition and cross-learning among states and UTs,” said Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer of Niti Aayog.This report is important as the health ministry has linked the index to incentives to states and Union territories under the National Health Mission, a Niti Aayog official said.“States which have shown improvement in incremental performance will get higher incentives under the NHM. Some states such as Haryana, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, etc., indicate an overall better health system, but have shown a negative incremental performance,” the official said, declining to be named.“There is an urgent need to accelerate efforts to narrow the performance gap between the states/UTs as 50% of the larger states, 50% of smaller states and 43% of the UTs did not even reach the halfway mark in terms of the Composite Overall Index Score (100),” the report said.Telangana, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Mizoram and Tripura are the only states to have shown improvement both in overall and incremental performances.The report pointed out that Rajasthan was the weakest performer both in terms of Overall Performance and Incremental Performance.The performance of states on key health indicators such as U5MR and NMR reflect the need for improvement. For instance, NMR, which should be 12 or less per 1,000 births, is between five and 13 in only five states, namely , Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab and Tamil Nadu.“All states registered a reduction in NMR or its level remained the same during 2014 to 2018, except Chhattisgarh, where the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births increased from 28 to 29. This is an important trend as NMR reflects the availability and quality of prenatal, intrapartum and neonatal services,” the report read.All the larger states recorded a reduction in U5MR between 2014 and 2018, a critical indicator for a child’s survival, the report said. “Kerala continued to be the best performing state with the lowest U5MR of 13 per 1,000 live births in 2014 and 10 per 1,000 live births in 2018,” it said.Assam and Madhya Pradesh are the worst performers with U5MR of 66 and 56 per 1,000 live births, respectively, according to the report.A Niti Aayog official said, “Uttar Pradesh has shown a marked improvement in the performance in majority of the indicators. There has been improvement in its performance with respect to the intermediate health outcome indicators such as full immunisation coverage, total case notification of TB, TB treatment success rate etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-tops-niti-s-health-index-for-4th-year-in-a-row-101640629971974.html
28-12-2021||India||Cases 331: Night curfew begins, Delhi in huddle over fresh curbs||The night lockdown began in the national capital on Monday as the Covid-19 case count continued to tick upwards with 331 new cases, deepening concerns within the Delhi administration that is deliberating on whether to impose additional restrictions planned under its graded response action plan (Grap).The number of active cases has now surpassed 1,300 and the test positivity rate has been over 0.5% for two straight days. As on Monday, there were 266 people with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals.The positivity rate has breached one of the thresholds meant to activate stricter curbs -- which, experts said, would be disproportionate for the current situation -- such as shutting schools and cinema halls, tighter restrictions on how many people can go to a private office, ride a taxi or in the Metro, and which shops can remain open in markets and malls.Officials aware of the discussions in the government said these restrictions -- part of the first level of curbs classified as Yellow Alert -- have not been taken yet due to economic considerations, but they remain on the table. “The government has already imposed night curfew and restrictions on celebrations have already been imposed. A balance needs to be maintained between curbs for Covid management and the employment and economic interests of people,” a senior official in the government said, asking not to be named.This person pointed out that most of the existing Covid-19 beds were unoccupied, the active caseload was 1,300 – below the 1,500 active cases for the Yellow Alert threshold – and the positivity rate was under 1%.A second top government official, asking not to be named, said the government is closely monitoring how the outbreak is unfolding and a decision on further curbs will be taken soon.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued detailed order for the night curfew, specifying what activities cannot be carried out and the exemptions that apply. Going for essential services and to buy routine household supplies on foot are some of the activities that can be carried out during the 11pm-5am night curfew hours.Experts said the current degree of curbs were enough at the moment. Suneela Garg, professor and a member Lancet Commission Covid India Task Force, said: “Since it is not a panic situation yet, no immediate implementation of Grap is not a cause of worry. Delhi’s current Covid situation appears to be under control as of now. The government has already imposed a night curfew and banned New Year celebrations to check the spread of coronavirus. Omicron cases are mild and recovery rate is very high, which is why not enforcing Grap provisions immediately will not lead to long-term harm.”A DDMA officer, who did not want to be named, said a decision on the Grap measures is likely to be taken on Tuesday after further discussions and monitoring. “Some of the curbs under the ‘Yellow Alert’ may be imposed. It is a developing situation, so saying anything in definite terms is difficult now,” this person said, asking not to be named.Grap spells out four different levels of economic restrictions that come into force at different levels of positivity rate. The first Yellow Alert comes into force when the positivity rate breaches 0.5% mark and stays above it for two consecutive days, and the highest Red Alert comes into force if positivity rate goes above 5%.A second expert said the positivity rate metric may not be the correct yardstick to implement strict curbs. “The occupancy of Covid-19 beds is currently negligible. The government should monitor the situation and impose Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among general public strictly which is necessary to check the spread of coronavirus, including Omicron variant,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.Chamber of Trade and Industry wrote a letter to DDMA on Monday seeking relief for trade and businesses because the rising Covid cases have raised concerns.CTI chairman Brijesh Goyal said the restrictions under Yellow Alert should not be immediately implemented because cumulative new positive cases for the last seven days is below 1,500 and beds occupancy is very low. “40 Omicron patients have been cured without oxygen, ICU, steroids and remdesivir and only five patients have shown minor symptoms. It seems that the situation has not worsened yet,” Goyal said. CTI appealed to different trade associations to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.Delhi Gym Association vice president Chirag Sethi said the association has approached Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “The gyms should not be closed under Grap on the basis of the current Covid positivity rate situation because the industry has already suffered a lot during the past few months. DDMA must also consider the total number of cases and the occupancy of oxygen beds in Delhi before imposing further curbs,” Sethi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-331-night-curfew-begins-delhi-in-huddle-over-fresh-curbs-101640629971231.html
28-12-2021||India||15+ can register for vaccines from Jan, set to get Covaxin||All those born on 2007 or earlier will be able to register from January 1 on the government’s CoWIN portal, according to RS Sharma, chief executive of National Health Authority that oversees the CoWIN system.“The system is being modified accordingly,” he said. “Students can make use of their ID cards for the purpose of registration.”The eligible children will be given Covaxin as it has an emergency use listing by the global health agency, the ministry said. India’s drugs regulator has also approved a second vaccine for use in ages 12 and above called ZyCoV-D, a dose made by Gujarat-based Zydus Healthcare. ZyCoV-D is yet to be included in the immunisation programme.The elderly with co-morbidities, and health and front line workers will be able to apply for the third precautionary dose through their existing CoWIN account, or at vaccination centres, the guidelines said.The CoWIN portal, the technological backbone of the country’s inoculation drive, will be suitably modified to send text messages to all applicants on their registered phone numbers once they become eligible.“The system will register if nine months from the second dose have been passed, both for people above 60 with co-morbidities, and health and front line workers,” Sharma said.The move to expand India’s Covid-19 immunisation campaign came amid calls to strengthen the fight against new variants such as Omicron, which has shown a substantial drop in vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease. Protection against severe disease and hospitalisation is likely to remain durable.The new variant of concern is highly transmissible but appears to be leading to milder illness. But it has still raised fears that even a small proportion of serious cases in a large population of infected people will still be a high number that can swamp the health system.The government’s decision to expand the campaign was based on the recommendations of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, which advises the government on inoculation against all diseases, the health ministry said.“It is a good decision to start vaccinating children against Covid-19 even though they may not run the risk of developing severe disease as commonly as adults, they can infect their family members, especially putting at risk the vulnerable population such as the elderly or those with some underlying medical condition. We will eventually have to vaccinate everyone,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of respiratory medicine department, Fortis Healthcare.
28-12-2021||India||38-year-old man digs up mother’s grave, brings body home||For 10 months, for hours on end, he sat next to her grave. He thought she might want water, so he dug a pipeline into where she lay. He didn’t want her to be wet, so as neighbours and relatives watched aghast, he held up white rice bags over the grave when it rained. It didn’t matter that his 65-year-old mother died in February. To anyone that asked, or tried to stop him, he had one unbreakable, unchangeable justification. She was his mother. There were times in these 10 months that he tried bringing her back from under the earth and began digging her grave. Each time, locals stepped in, preventing him from doing so. Until early on December 24, when he did. Later that morning, people walking in the street in Kunnam village in Tamil Nadu’s Perambalur district found a strong, foul smell coming out of the 38-year-old’s one-bedroom home. They made a call to the Tamil Nadu Police Control room to complain. “By the time we reached the spot, the neighbours had gotten him out of the house but no one knew why there was a smell,” said the investigating officer, who didn’t wish to be named.When the team entered the house, they found that he had locked his mother’s body inside the one room, covered her using old sarees, and old banners. They removed the clothes gingerly, to find a pile of bones, the skin on them rotting away, almost non-existent. Even then, he protested. “He didn’t let us take her away and he kept wailing that she was his mother. We consoled him and only after his relatives brought him out of the house, could take her body out,” the officer said. Investigations since have revealed that the 65-year-old woman died in February this year of age-related complications -- 16 years after the death of her husband. For all that time, his mother was his only caretaker, and for the past decade, the 38-year-old was on medication for mental illness. The man has never been employed, and since his mother’s death, his sisters and their daughters, who live close by, have been giving him three meals a day, police officials said. Before her death, the mother worked as a farm labourer to provide for the two. After recovering the body from the house, police officials on Sunday cremated her in a different cemetery in Perambalur after a post-mortem examination. “We didn’t want to take her to the same place to burn her because he would continue going back. Even when we brought him to the station for an enquiry, he asked us where his mother is because he saw us taking her away,” the officer said.Ramesh Karuppaiya, a social activist in Perambalur, said that reports of the incident were being widely circulated on social media and might add to the “stigma” that the man is facing. “The only bond that this man had was with his mother and he completely lacked any social support. There isn’t a great deal of awareness of mental health problems, and no avenues for help. I fear he will be further stigmatised. The police should ensure that he gets continuous counselling and neuropsychiatric doctors are involved so that he is not marginalised further,” Karuppaiya said. A case under Section 174 (police to enquire and report on suicide) of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been filed, officials said. They, however, insisted that they would find mental health support for him. “We are planning to file a petition in court to allow us to send him to Chennai’s Institute of Mental Health,” a senior police official in the district said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, the grieving man is back home. 
28-12-2021||India||Maharashtra passes resolution to defer local body polls over OBC reservation||The Maharashtra assembly on Monday passed a resolution recommending that the state election commission (SEC) should not conduct local body elections until reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) was restored. The resolution moved by the state assembly was unanimously cleared by the Lower House as the Opposition, too, supported the move.The resolution comes on the back of the SEC declaring elections to 567 seats in local bodies reserved for OBCs on January 18. ON December 21, the SEC held elections to 1,533 seats in local bodies not reserved for OBCs. “Going by the existing provisions, the OBC community has 27% reservation in local bodies but the SEC has declared holding polls without OBC reservation. It is necessary to provide the representation, and the SEC’s decision will deprive them of representation. Considering this, the state assembly recommends that the SEC should not hold local body elections without OBC reservation,” said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who moved the resolution. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that they supported the resolution and that it should be passed unanimously. On December 23,the Madhya Pradesh assembly, too, passed a similar resolution. In March, the Supreme Court (SC) scrapped the 27% OBC reservation in Maharashtra local bodies for want of quantifiable data on backwardness. In September and October, the state government promulgated ordinances to ensure reservation for OBCs in local body polls. But in December, the SC stayed both ordinances and on December 13, it directed the SEC to hold elections to seats reserved for OBCs by notifying them as general category seats.Former advocate general Shreehari Aney said that the SEC is an independent body and will have to conduct elections as per rules. “The SEC is ultimately governed by law because it is independent of the state. It will therefore have to abide by the requirement of law. What is being held (by the Supreme Court) is until a certain procedure is completed, you cannot make a reservation in local bodies. Reservation can be provided only after completing the required process so the commission would need to abide by those directives and it would need to tell the state government that until those procedural requirements are complied with, the state cannot make a reservation for local bodies,” Aney said.“As far as the elections are concerned, it is the SEC’s job to conduct, and they will be conducted subject to the limitation of OBC reservation. In other words, non-OBC seats will have to be filled. The election will have to be conducted excluding the OBC seats,” he added.Ulhas Bapat, a constitutional expert, said that the resolution passed by the state assembly cannot be implemented and elections cannot be deferred once the five-year duration of the legislature is completed. It has no legal standing and will be treated as a request. “The resolution cannot be implemented because the duration of the local bodies cannot be extended and elections have to be conducted once these bodies complete five years of tenure. The resolution is nothing but a request which has no legal standing. In my view, the SEC will follow all the directives issued by the apex court, and the resolution will make no difference,” Bapat told Hindustan Times.He said that the state government failed in the triple test laid down by the Supreme Court to provide political reservation to any community. “It is yet to collect empirical data, and thus OBC reservation was declared unconstitutional. In that case, the elections to seats reserved under the OBC category can be held by notifying them as open category or elections can be deferred to those seats, but the power to take any decision in this regard is ultimately with the SEC,” he pointed out.Till the time of going to press, there was no reaction from the SEC.
28-12-2021||India||India’s post-pandemic trade numbers||India’s trade deficit in November stood at a record $22.9 billion, the commerce ministry said on December 14, in sharp contrast to a trade surplus in June 2020. How do we explain this dramatic change? Here are four charts to explain it in detail.Imports suffered a bigger disruption than exportsA comparison of India’s merchandise export and import numbers shows there was a bigger disruption in imports during the early phase of the pandemic. Imports fell to $17.09 billion in April 2020, the lowest in 11 years. Given that most of India’s imports are in the intermediate and capital goods category – the World Bank’s WITS database shows these two had a share of 54% in India’s imports in 2019-20 – imports started rising sharply as the economy opened up. Although exports have increased in the post-pandemic period, the rise is smaller.Is the import spike just a result of rise in crude oil prices?Unlike GDP, trade numbers are measured in nominal terms. It means they are affected by changes in prices of important commodities. One commodity that plays a large role in the volatility in India’s import bill is crude petroleum. The country imports more than 80% of its crude oil, and its prices have fluctuated wildly during the pandemic. The price of India’s crude oil basket (COB) fell from $54.63 per barrel in February 2020 to just $19.90 a barrel in April 2020. It was less than $50 per barrel for the next eight months, a level not seen in the past three years, before climbing once again. Average COB price was $80.64 per barrel in November 2021. Are petroleum prices the biggest reason for rise in India’s import bills? Not entirely, as non-petroleum imports have also shown a large increase.But inflation has played a major role in boosting both import and export numbersPost-pandemic inflation has not been confined to petroleum alone, with most countries clocking high rates of overall inflation and also a rise in prices of non-food, non-fuel items. This has played a role in India’s trade numbers as well. Trade in different commodities in October 2021, as seen in the commerce ministry’s latest data, shows this clearly, according to HT’s analysis. For most of the top 10 items in India’s import and export basket, which account for 80% and 61% of total imports and exports, unit values have increased significantly between April and October 2021 compared to the same period last year.Dependence on Chinese import increasesIndia’s imports from China have also increased in the current year. Despite calls for boycott of Chinese products from time to time, imports from that country between April and October showed an annual increase of 52% to $51 billion. These imports are also 22% higher compared to the pre-Covid period in 2019-20. To be sure, non-Chinese imports between April and October have also seen 82% yearly growth. However, non- Chinese imports in current year are only 14% higher compared to a similar period in 2019-20. India’s exports to China in 202-21 have grown by 16% to $14 billion, compared to last year while non-Chinese exports grew by 59%.The continuous increase in the trade deficit due to increasing import bills could affect India’s economic recovery after the pandemic, as a rising deficit lowers GDP. The share of trade deficit in India’s GDP was 1.27% in 2020-21, the lowest since 2017-18. It was mainly due to a fall in import bills as crude prices crashed in the initial months of the pandemic. With the rise in crude oil prices this year, as well as higher non-crude imports, the negative impact of trade deficit on GDP is likely to grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-post-pandemic-trade-numbers-101640626731867.html

It is expected to be heard after the court reopens on January 3.In a separate application, the Union social justice and empowerment ministry also sought to be impleaded in the proceedings before the court. The ministry said the December 17 order has pan-India ramifications and it deprived OBCs of their constitutionally guaranteed rights of political representation.The order under challenge was passed without hearing the Centre.In its plea, the Centre said, “The upliftment of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes has been the utmost priority of the Union Government and any inadequate representation of OBCs in local self-government defeats the very object, intent, and purpose of the very idea of the de-centralisation of power and taking governance to the grassroots level.”It added the issues raised in the present petition are of great public importance and have a pan-India ramification on the issue of implementation of OBC reservations in the elections throughout the country.The court’s order came when the election process in Madhya Pradesh was going on with the allocation of seats for OBCs. The court directed these seats to be re-notified as general category seats.The Centre argued any intervention at this stage would deprive the OBC community of the quota for five long years. It added five years is not a short period and will cause “grave prejudice to the backward class citizens.”As a temporary solution, the Centre suggested the suspension of the election process while asking the commission to submit its report in three months. “Till such time, the administrator can function who can hand over the charge to the newly elected person/body who will be elected with the provision of OBC reservation,” the application said.The Supreme Court judgments prescribed the triple test for the quota in the K Krishnamurthy case (2010) and Vikas Kishanrao Gawli case (2021).In its plea, the state government cited the constitutional bar on the court from interfering in the reservation of seats in local bodies. “The conversion of seats reserved for OBC into general seats (in the Panchayat elections) when the electoral process had already begun is contrary to the constitutional mandate under Article 243O of the Constitution.”OBCs account for around 51% of the state’s population.“It would cause (a) grave miscarriage of justice if more than half of the total population of the state would have no reserved seats in the Panchayat elections,” the state government said.In its December 17 order, the court requested Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to impress upon the state election commissions to strictly adhere to the triple test, the pre-condition before notifying reservation of seats for OBCs in the local bodies.The Centre, in its plea, informed the court that a detailed advisory has been sent in this regard to all state governments requiring them to comply with the binding judicial pronouncements. At the same time, it said the order of the court could lead to adverse impacts, citing the aspirations of the OBC community.“Such inadequate representation or non-representation deprives the voters belonging to OBC community to elect one amongst them to the elected offices. It is humbly submitted that the same is strictly contrary to the object, intent, and purpose of the constitutional scheme.”The December 17 order was passed in the context of local body elections notified in Madhya Pradesh on December 4. Earlier, the court passed a similar order with regard to civic body elections in Maharashtra, where the triple test was applied and OBC seats were re-notified under the general category. A petition citing this order was filed in the Madhya Pradesh high court for staying the election process for OBC seats. The high court on December 9 declined to interfere pursuant. It prompted the petitioner Manmohan Nagar to move top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-recall-of-sc-order-de-notifying-obc-seats-ahead-of-madhya-pradesh-local-body-polls-101640596187386.html
28-12-2021||Today's||The politics of hate vs politics of secularism||The sun sets on 2021 against the backdrop of hate, prejudice and the growing legitimisation of communal poison that is spreading fast and wide. Last week, we bore witness to the ugly spectacle of the three-day-long “Dharam Sansad” in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, where participants riding on hate gave a public call for genocide against Muslims. As Christmas celebrations began, the anti-Christian mob found its way into schools, on to streets, desecrating statues of Christ and burning effigies of Santa Claus, even as a Member of Parliament gave a clarion call for preventing religious conversion and making re-conversion to Hinduism a priority.

Founders build every aspect of their business from the ground up, including how they want to work, what values they practise, and what sort of culture they wish to adopt. If you look closely at many start-ups today, you will find some element of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices in their make-up already, because these are Millennial and Gen-Z founders, and they have a sense of responsibility towards the world around them.

While both parties claimed progress and exuded hope, a viable deal looks difficult as long as both parties hold vastly diverging positions on its basic tenets.
