The suspects fled away with his Wagon R that they had robbed for a “joyride” while the elderly man was urinating behind the vehicle, police said on Saturday.One suspect, identified as Kapil Tiwari,27, was arrested while the other alleged robber, a 16-year-old boy, was apprehended on Saturday by teams of the Rohini district police. The stolen car was also recovered from outer Delhi’s Shahabad Dairy area, where the duo had parked it at an unauthorised parking lot. Tiwari’s interrogation led to the recovery of a motorcycle that the duo had stolen on December 16 from Rohini Sector-8 and had used it for committing battery thefts, said deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.“The duo stole petrol from parked Bullet motorcycles to ride the stolen bike. They robbed the retired government school teacher, identified as Ramesh Chander Rana, of his car for a joyride and killed him in the process. We have booked the two for murder and robbery,” said DCP Tayal, adding that the school teacher lived with his wife in Rohini Sector-11.Police said they were waiting for the elderly man’s autopsy report to confirm the exact cause of his death, even as the doctors believed that he may have died of shock and cardiac arrest.On December 23 (Thursday) around 11 pm, the KN Katju Marg police station was informed about a carjacking and injury to a person near G3S shopping mall in Rohini Sector-11. By the time, the local police reached the crime scene, the injured man was already rushed to Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in a patrolling van. He was declared brought dead there. One Vijaya Rana arrived and identified the dead man as her husband, Ramesh Chander Rana. She told the police that Rana had left home for some work at around 2 pm.DCP Tayal said that one Aakash Grover was also found at the hospital and he claimed to be an eyewitness to the carjacking incident. Grover told the police that he was passing by in his car with his two friends when he saw one silver Wagon R car being driven at a high speed and a man was hanging on the driver’s side door. After being dragged for 6-7 metres, the man lost his grip on the door and fell on the road.“Grover told us that the injured man was screaming for help to catch the robbers who took away his car. The man then became unconscious. We registered a case of murder and robbery and formed multiple teams to identify and nab the suspects,” added the DCP.The teams scanned nearly 35 CCTV cameras of the routes that the suspects used after the carjacking. On Friday, they located the car parked near Anarkali Park in Shahabad Dairy. Through local intelligence, the suspects were identified and caught from Shahabad Dairy area on Saturday and also recovered a stolen bike from them.“The duo revealed that they were sitting around a bonefire with their three friend when they spotted the elderly man urinating outside his car and decided to rob his vehicle for a joyride. They sat inside the car and switched on the engine. As the elderly man noticed it, he held the driver side door window in his attempt to stop the carjacking. However, the two accelerated the car and dragged him on the road till he lost control and fell down,” said an investigator, adding that Tiwari was previously involved in five cases of burglary, theft and possessing illegal weapon.

According to the board members, the meeting was held to decide on the future course of action related to illegal grabbing of waqf lands in Pune city and district. The meeting was attended by Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel, MLC Dr Wajahat Mirza, Rajya Sabha MP Fauzia Khan and seven other members. The meeting which began early in the morning continued till late in the evening. Jaleel said, “The meeting is being held in the city for the first to decide on the future course of legal action against the offenders who had grabbed waqf land. We have urged the board to take tough action against the violators and ensure that the grabbed lands are restored back to the board.” MLC and Waqf Board chairman Wajahat Mirza said “ We have taken some very important decisions aimed at increasing revenue generation of prime waqf properties in the state. The board has lodged FIRs against those who had indulged in fraud and illegal sale of waqf lands. We want to reduce the pendency issues before the board. We received around 150 complaints in the Pune region which are being looked into by the board.”The Pune waqf lands have been under the scanner of several state and central agencies with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently interrogating two accused in Tabut Inam Endowment Trust waqf land fraud case. Deputy collector (land acquisition) Ajay Pawar attached to Pune district collectorate has been interrogated by the central agency in connection with the ₹9.64 crore waqf land scam. The ED had raided the residence of one Zarif Khan who according to the police and investigating agencies is the mastermind of the Hinjewadi waqf fraud. Khan has been absconding in the case while the anticipatory bail applications of Sahil Munna Khan, Rehana Ishraque Khan and Uzair Ishraque Khan have been rejected by a Pune court recently. The FIR in relation to the case was lodged by Pune Regional Waqf Officer Khusro Khan at Bund Garden police station. According to the FIR, Taboot Inam Endowment Trust, which is registered with the Waqf board, owns eight hectares 57.1 R land at Gat no. 335/1 in Maan village in Mulshi taluka of Pune district. The state government acquired five hectares 51 R land of the total for the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government was supposed to give around ₹9.64 crore to the trust in return and accordingly the government had released an amount of ₹7.73 crore. The amount was siphoned off by the accused who prepared bogus documents and resorted to cheating the government. According to waqf board officials, Pune has nearly 2,800 wakf properties on 3,724.55 hectares located in prime areas like Deccan Gymkhana, Kondhwa, Baner and Aundh which have been illegally grabbed and under litigation. According to the waqf board officials at Pune, the issue related to a 50 acre waqf land belonging to a Mughal era mosque in Kondhwa Budruk, 80 acres spread from More Vidyalaya to the ILS Law College in Deccan including waqf land parcels in Karve, 23 acres waqf land in Aundh and Pimple Nilakh are also being dealt with utmost priority. Currently, the Maharashtra state government has lodged seven FIRs against waqf land encroachers in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-waqf-board-holds-its-first-meeting-in-pune-several-acres-of-encroached-properties-under-scanner-101640455767550.html

25-12-2021||Pune||Community surveillance to gauge spread of Omicron variant in Pune||PUNE According to officials, at least 315 samples have been collected from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad in order to understand the community spread of Omicron variant. These samples are randomly positive samples from the city and their genome sequencing will highlight if they are the Omicron variant. Pune district has reported 41 cases so far. Directorate of health services issued a letter stating that community surveillance on the emergence of the Omicron variant will be carried out from December 21 to 31.Dr Archana Patil, director of health services, Pune said daily positive samples of RT PCR from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Mumbai will be collected and sent for genome sequencing. “Hundred samples each day from PMC and PCMC and 300 samples from Mumbai will be sent for genome sequencing. PMC and PCMC samples will be sent to BJ Medical College,” said Dr Patil.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, professor and head of department, Microbiology, BJ Medical College said that the whole genome sequencing of positive patients will be done for PMC and PCMC. “These are randomly selected RT PCR positive samples. As Omicron cases are on the rise, we are trying to see if there is community spread of the variant. Until December 21, we have sequenced around 865 samples and there has been no Omicron variant in the test results. There are 499 samples which are in the process of sequencing,” he said.He added that patients who tested positive and have a travel history, their samples are sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.“Community samples are to be collected in bulk. At present the positivity rate is very low. As of now, over 300 samples are ready for genome sequencing run which will be done on Sunday,” said Dr Karyakarte. “Earlier,at least 1,364 samples were sequenced. Sufficient samples should be sequenced to get a better and clear picture of the lineage of the virus. Whole genome sequencing of more samples should be emphasised,” added Dr Karyakarte.Speaking about the samples, Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said that the samples are still being collected and the results are expected soon.For community surveillance, BJ Medical College will distribute samples to Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) as per the requirement. Whereas in Mumbai, Kasturba Central Laboratory will conduct the genome sequencing and additional samples will be referred to BJMC as per the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/community-surveillance-to-gauge-spread-of-omicron-variant-in-pune-101640455170320.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Night schools in Mumbai struggle to keep full strength of students||Mumbai: Once abuzz with activity and full strength, night schools in the city are now struggling to come back to normalcy in the pandemic- more so, with a possibility of a third wave looming large. Determined to get the students back to classes, the principal of St Xavier’s Night High School Ajit Dave and his team are on the lookout for the students in slum areas, who did not return to the school after they reopened a few weeks ago.“We have tried reaching out to the students through the contact numbers provided by them but most are unreachable,” began Dave with palpable angst in his voice. He shared, “We normally have a strength of about 150 students spread across classes 6 to 10 but at present, only 7-10 students attend physical classes regularly.”Dave and his team now hope that they may find the students at the addresses provided by them.This is the current scenario with the majority of Mumbai night schools. Most students studying at night earned a living in the day and due to the pandemic, many have lost their jobs and are now settled in their respective hometowns. What’s worse is the fear of a third wave which is pushing more people away from the city.Mumbai is home to more than 120 functional night schools, most of them in south Mumbai. In 2013, there were 151 schools in the city but over the years, several schools have shut down or merged with other existing night schools due to falling demand and the pandemic has made things even worse. Niranjan Giri, who teaches at Modern High School in Mumbai Central said Of the 120 existing night schools in the city at present, only a handful of schools managed to start online classes during the 2020-21 academic year and this year, most institutes are working on 10-25% attendance for physical classes. “In the last few years itself, ten schools in the city shut down due to lack of students and three of those were merged into my school. While it might look like new rules have pushed more students to opt for day schools, the fact remains that night schools are the only source of education for the middle-aged as well as the elderly population of the city and we need to support them,” he said. Most night schools bring together students of all age groups, but all are determined to study. “I work as a nursemaid at Cama Hospital and for many years it has been my dream to study till class 12 at least. But during the pandemic, we were so busy with work that I could not attend online classes and at present, I’m busy taking care of my grandchild so getting back to school is becoming a problem,” shared a former night school student.While the school education department, as well as civic authorities, are encouraging school principals to reach out to students and bring them back to school, several non-profit organisations are also supporting the cause. “Several problems are plaguing the night school student count—students who went back to their hometowns have not returned, many lost their livelihood and can now not afford to stay in Mumbai without a job, while many are still not vaccinated which means they can’t attend a physical school,” said Nikita Ketkar, CEO, Masoom, an NGO that works closely with night schools. While the NGO helped a few students in finding employment in 2020 to ensure they continue studying, this year the organisation has also gone door-to-door looking for students on-roll who have not come back for in-person schools. “We recently were informed about a student of a night school who along with her mother was forced to live on the streets after her mother lost employment and could not find another job to pay rent regularly. We contacted some of our regular donors and have now managed to give the mother-daughter duo shelter and some extra money on the condition that the girl gets back to school,” added Ketkar.

District forest officer P K Srivastava said that a local found the two sarus chicks unconscious at Dhanauri wetland on Saturday and informed the forest departement around 12 noon.”Forest rangers immediately reached the spot and got the birds examined by the chief veterinary officer. While one was declared dead, the other one was alive and given medical treatment,” said Srivastava. “Dhanauri is the largest habitat for sarus crane in Gautam Budh Nagar. There has been a steady rise in the population of birds,” said Srivastava adding that the official count of the bird at the wetland, which spans over 101-hectares, is currently 120. Anand Arya, a Noida-based birder who was among the first to have found the wetland in 2014 and initiated the legal battle for its recognition as a Ramsar site, said that the wetland needs immediate conservation. “I have been fighting for Ramsar recognition for Dhanauri wetland but it has not been done yet. If the site had been recognised as a Ramsar site, the wetland would have been more protected and such incidents could have been avoided,” said Arya. Ramsar sites are the wetlands of international importance. India is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention held in 1971 in Iran that seeks to recognise and protect important wetlands of the world. India currently has 47 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites), with a surface area of 1,090,230 hectares. Srivastava said the district forest department is working on getting the wetland a Ramsar tag. Other than Dhanauri, sarus cranes are found in various small fields and marshes of the district, such as Khodna Khurd, Ishapur, Rawani Bujurg, Parsaul and Nagla Bhatona.

25-12-2021||Noida||We have carried out development without discrimination, says Yogi||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Saturday that the BJP government has done works in the state without discrimination and be it the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya or the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the party has delivered on its promises. Yogi was in Ghaziabad to attend the ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ on Saturday on the occasion of the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The yatra is a roadshow launched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on December 19 to extend its outreach among the public in the run up to the state assembly elections scheduled in the first quarter of 2022. Ghaziabad has five assembly segments, all of which are ruled by BJP MLAs. The rally , which was taken out from Bijnor last Sunday among the other districts in western Uttar Pradesh, reached Modinagar in Ghaziabad on Saturday. “Through this yatra, we have come to seek your blessings. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government, during the past five years, has done works without any discrimination and has introduced policies for women, traders, youth and every segment of society,” said Adityanath during the gathering at Kalka Garhi Chowk. “On one hand we carried out development and public welfare works while respecting religious beliefs, on the other hand, we did not hesitate to drive bulldozers on the illegal properties of professional mafias. We did what we said and the works are before you. What the BJP told you five years ago, whether it was related to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya or abrogation of Article from 370 for Jammu and Kashmir, we have done it,” said the CM. Adityanath was accompanied by Union minister General V K Singh (retired), who is also an MP from Ghaziabad. After the public address, both Adityanath and Singh boarded a ‘rath’ (a decorated and furnished vehicle) and participated in the rally. “We will continue our agenda of security and prosperity and will protect your interests,” said Adityanath during the course of the rally. BJP workers and supporters chanted slogans of “Modi, Yogi” and “Jai Shri Ram” during the entire rally, which was taken out from Kalka Garhi Chowk to Thakurdwara, a distance of about 2.5km. The city unit of the BJP also made arrangements for the CM’s welcome at about 50 different locations on the route. The Ghaziabad traffic police announced major traffic diversions from 3pm over GT Road and Ambedkar Road--the two key roads of the city. While the roadshow started at around 7pm, commuters had a tough time wading through congested roads in Nehru Nagar, Kavi Nagar, Loha Mandi, Lal Kuan and other locations as police had put up barricades on roads and announced traffic diversions on Saturday evening. “Hundreds of commuters in their vehicles were stuck up in Nehru Nagar, Kavi Nagar and Vivekanand flyover and even pedestrians were finding it difficult to move. Since it was Christmas, the diversions compounded traffic congestions,” said Akash Vashishtha, a resident of Raj Nagar. Police said that the roadshow ended in about two hours while personnel were deployed to manage traffic on different routes. “It is estimated around 20,000 people participated in the rally. We deployed our personnel to ensure smooth flow of traffic while ensuring safety and security of the participants of the rally along the designated route,” said Nipun Aggarwal, superintendent of police (city 1).

Pawar interacted with media representatives during her Pune visit on Saturday. Pawar also assured quick assistance from the union government to the states if the need be. As omicron cases have been increasing in some states including Maharashtra, which has imposed restrictions ahead of holiday season and new year celebrations. “In the states where Covid cases are increasing, respective state governments can decide on restrictions to be imposed. Wherever help is needed, we will provide it. But in case of restrictions, it will be a decision depending upon the situation in the states. If people follow the rules, then risks can be reduced. If rules are not followed then they are increasing their own risks,” said Bharati Pawar. She also said that teams are being sent to the states where Covid situation has become sensitive. “The union government has taken meetings with states. The Central government will send teams in those states where the situation is sensitive, in order to find out the challenges, problems and also provide guidance if need be. The Centre has issued guidelines and the top officials are monitoring the situation,” added Pawar. BOX Health minister of Maharashtra Rajesh Tope, said that lockdown will be imposed in the state if the requirement of medical oxygen exceeds the limit of 800 MT per day. “There is a possibility of a third wave due to the rising Omicron cases. Now, we have decided that level curbs will depend upon the consumption of medical oxygen. The day oxygen exceeds the limit of 800 MT per day, we will impose a lockdown. If this variant spreads quickly then this limit of 800 MT may have to be reduced to 500 MT,” said Rajesh Tope while speaking in Jalna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/states-should-take-call-on-imposing-curbs-depending-on-situation-says-bharati-pawar-101640454508170.html

The suspects were operating from Assam and the calls were made from Bharatpur in Rajasthan. We have seen many gangs based out of Assam involved in sextortion cases,” Rao said, adding that two teams were sent to Assam twice, but no arrests could be made. The gang has duped over 300 people in Delhi-NCR this year, police officers said, adding that they have received over 50 complaints from Gurugram alone. Police said the fraudsters first befriend the victims on WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook and then lure them using sex video clips. “A woman, who is part of the gang, make video calls to the victim after getting his number during their chat and starts stripping during the call, while encouraging him to do the same. The victim, with no idea that the call is being recorded, gives in. Then the gang blackmails the victim by threatening to upload the photos on social media,” said Rao. Rao said that the gang sometimes also sends morphed video clips to the victim to extort money as in the case of the lawyer who had lodged the complaint at the Cyber police station in December last year. A case under Section 384 (extortion) of Indian Penal Code and Section 67A (material which contains sexually explicit act or conduct) of the IT Act was registered, police said. According to police, many victims give in to extortion demands and avoid lodging a complaint for fear of social stigma. Aman Kumar Chauhan, the lawyer, said that he registered a complaint at Cyber police station in December last year. Chauhan, a resident of Bhora Kalan in Pataudi, said that as soon as he received a call the screen went blank and the call got disconnected on its own. “Within minutes, I received a video on my WhatsApp number where my face was superimposed onto another man performing a sexual act while talking to a woman. I was shocked and then approached police,” he said. In January, a 35-year-old executive of a private company and was asked to pay ₹3 lakh by the suspects, police said. In March, a 45-year-old senior executive of a private company was also targeted in a similar manner. “I received a call from an unknown number. When I took the call, there was a nude woman on the screen. For a few seconds, I could not understand what was happening. I disconnected the call. A little later, I received a video where my face had been embedded,” he said, seeking anonymity. The executive paid ₹1 lakh to the suspects, but did not approach the police. 
25-12-2021||Noida||With nine fresh cases, Covid tally in Ghaziabad highest since June||Nine fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in the district on Saturday, taking the total tally of infections reported in the month of December to 67, the highest in the last six months since June, when the district recorded 324 cases. Of the 67 cases reported this month, 40 are active patients, 35 of whom are in home isolation while the remaining are taking treatment in hospitals. Of the cases reported on Saturday, two cases each have been reported from Indirapuram, Vasundhara and Vaishali while the three other cases have emerged from Kavi Nagar, New Vijay Nagar and a high-rise in Sahibabad. A 14-year-old boy studying at a school in Indirapuram is among those who tested positive for the infection on Saturday. According to official data, there are four patients studying in educational institutions in Ghaziabad, Delhi and Gurugram who tested positive for Covid on Saturday. A 41-year-old man, a resident of Vaishali and basketball player who returned from Central Africa’s Cameroon on December 17, are among the confirmed cases reported on Saturday. “The cases which are coming to the fore are either asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. We are keeping a track of all cases. Most of the cases have travel history while others are mostly contacts of previously infected patients. Our focus is now on early detection through rigorous testing and early treatment so that the spread of the infection can be checked,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer (CMO). According to official data, total 324 Covid cases were reported in the district in June, which drastically dropped to 65 in July, 26 in August, 18 in September, 14 in October and six in November. “There has been a rise in Covid infections and the cases are increasing gradually. It is likely that the trend will continue...

The opening of the academy was attended by former India international and now a mentor, Abhishek Nayar and Mumbai Ranji Trophy player, Tushar Deshpande.“The pitches made at this academy are unique. I am sure the students here will get a very good exposure under Raje,” said Nayar.Raje, who played for Mumbai Indians in 2008 and 2009 in the IPL and who lives in Badlapur, said that whatever he has learned in IPL and while playing for Mumbai, he would share with the budding players.“I used to wake up at 4am and travel to Mumbai for matches. I want cricket players to have the opportunity here in Badlapur so that they can give more time for the sport. I have learnt a lot during the days when I played IPL and I would like to share the same at the academy,” said Raje.The academy, named Pro Athletes Cricket Academy, has six nets including two for kids and is located at the Gorphode ground in Hendrepada, Badlapur (W). The academy has already got 25 admissions.“There are many potential players in the outskirts. However, due to lack of exposure, they fail to make a mark. If provided with proper guidance, they can go further,” added Raje.The coaching at the academy would be headed by Kiran Ramayane while Raje will join him frequently.“This is such a good opportunity for cricket players like us who do not have much exposure to the sport as we come from the outskirts and have less idea about the proper process to reach the bigger platform. If players like Raje share their experiences, it will definitely help many like me,” said Ishaan Gaikwad, a 14-year-old trainee at the academy.

The biggest farmer outfit in Punjab claimed that they will not support any party, but have also not given any call of a poll boycott either. State president Joginder Singh Ugrahan and general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said, “Farmers’ struggle against farm laws has proved that the rights and interests of farmers cannot be saved and ensured by sitting in Parliament or assemblies; this can be achieved only through struggle.” “We consider electoral politics as a derailing and misleading activity and therefore, we will call for people and farmers to maintain their unity,” they said, adding that they have had to hold Pakka Morchas (permanent sit-ins) opposite deputy commissioners or SDM offices in 15 districts for implementation of demands, even after the Punjab government had accepted these.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-struggle-not-poll-plunge-will-help-farmers-bku-ektaugrahan-101640451867105.html

Under pressure to crack the case, the Nehru Nagar police had rounded up 14 suspects and on June 23 sent their samples for DNA fingerprinting. Javed was placed under arrest on July 1, after forensic reports revealed that his DNA matched with the samples collected from the decomposed body. Police examined 36 witnesses in support of their case against Javed and on September 5, 2015, the sessions court convicted him for kidnapping, raping and killing the minor and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

25-12-2021||Mumbai||Covid surge forces authorities to restrict year-end celebrations||Mumbai As Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has banned New Year parties and gatherings at all public and commercial places across the city, Mumbaiites have chosen house parties or quiet weekend getaways near Mumbai for New Year celebrations. Some Mumbaiites have chosen to attend New Year’s bash outside the Greater Mumbai jurisdiction, even as event planners and commercial party hosts are looking for a last-minute destination outside the city.On Friday night, BMC issued an order disallowing New Year parties in the city. Restaurants, bars and pubs, and eateries will still continue to remain open but will have to operate at 50% of the capacity. This comes in light of the recent spread of Omicron cases. To date, 46 Omicron cases have been reported in Mumbai. Over the past three days, Mumbai has recorded a rise in the number of daily Covid cases. On Saturday, Mumbai reported 731 Covid cases. The trend of increase in daily count started on December 21, Tuesday, when Mumbai reported 312 cases in a day, followed by 480 cases on December 22, 577 cases on Thursday, and 673 on Friday. However, Mumbai on Saturday reported zero deaths, for the sixth time in the month of December.Regarding curbs on New Year celebration in Mumbai, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the public health department in BMC said, “Restaurants that serve food, and those that also serve alcohol are allowed to remain open on December 31, and operate at 50% capacity, with prior reservation of tables from their customers. If any of them choose to do something special or different- it’s allowed, as long as they do not break the rule of less than 50% of their capacity.”As large parties are no longer allowed, event planners said their business has been badly affected by the last-minute decision. A city-based event planner, who did not wish to be named, said, “We sold tickets for our event on the internet. Now we have two options, either to refund the money to those who have made the bookings or to shift our venue to a location outside the city.”Meanwhile, the state and city authorities have also imposed night curfew to curb its transmission.On Saturday, the state reported 1,485 new Covid cases and two Omicron cases from Aurangabad.Some of the districts have imposed curbs, while there are plans to impose restrictions at hill stations and weekend spots to prevent crowding. In addition, the state has also ramped up its vaccination drive.On Friday night, the state government announced a night curfew between 9 pm to 6 am across the state. Recently, the Ahmednagar administration launched the ‘No vaccine, No entry’ order, where those who are unvaccinated are not allowed in various places. Those who are not vaccinated will not be allowed to enter various public areas, including private establishments, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, cinemas, auditoriums, marriage halls, government or semi-government offices. The Nashik administration already has this restriction in place.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that the restrictions are imposed in view of the surge. “Our first priority is to prevent gatherings as Omicron cases are on the rise. We have instructed the local district authorities to impose curbs according to the local conditions,” said Dr Awate.There are indications that the popular shrine in Ahmednagar, Shirdi Sai Baba temple, may also impose curbs on the devotees.Pradeep Shetty, senior vice-president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), called the night curfew a regressive step. “After almost two years of sitting at home, citizens were looking forward to welcoming the new year at their favourite restaurants. However, this announcement has come as a dampener,” said Shetty.Meanwhile, the state government is ramping up the vaccination drive. According to the health department, the second dose of around 10.20-10.30 million people in the state is due and efforts are made to complete their vaccination. Similarly, 5,13,84,885 citizens have been fully vaccinated, that is, approximately 56% of the targeted population of 91.50 million people. The people who have taken the first dose come to 7,95,26,375, which is 86% of the targeted population.Dr Archana Patil, director, Maharashtra Health Services, said that they are not leaving any stone unturned to vaccinate the people. “We are calling up people, having flexible timings as well as roping in celebrities to ramp up our vaccination drive,” said Dr Patil.On Saturday, Maharashtra added 1,485 new Covid cases, taking its tally to 66,56,240. It also reported 12 fatalities due to Covid, pushing the death toll to 1,41,416. The positivity rate stood at 1.26% as 1,485 cases were recorded of the total 1,17,793 tests.

A huge number of auto-rickshaw drivers have still not recalibrated the meter of auto-rickshaws; only 16, 700 registered auto-rickshaw drivers have upgraded their meters,” said, Sanjiv Bhor, deputy regional transport officer.There are 27-meter recalibration service centres in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad where autorickshaws can upgrade the meter.“The auto rickshaws which are running in the city area have upgraded their meters while many which are providing service to Ola and Uber are yet to upgrade it. Many auto-rickshaw drivers are showing new rate cards and charging fare,” said Shivaji Lohokare, who runs a meter recalibration service centre at Dandekar Pul.Auto drivers charging extra from publicEven though, RTO has warned auto-rickshaw drivers to not charge more than meter rates – the driver who has not upgraded the meters are asking for ₹20 to 30 more for a ride.“If they have not recalibrated meters, they have to take a fare of ₹18 for the first 1.5km and they cannot charge extra. We have received few complaints from commuters from whom auto-rickshaw drivers have charged extra money and action will be taken against such auto rickshaw drivers,” said Ajit Shinde, RTO.Vaishnavi Gargi, a resident of Aundh, said “Twice auto-rickshaw drivers asked for Rs30 extra and when I asked them, they start arguing and both of them did not have a rate card.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/auto-metre-recalibration-process-moves-at-snail-s-pace-101640448386665.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation records 50+ Covid positive cases for the first time in 45 days||Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has noted a marginal increase in daily positive cases. After more than 45 days, the Covid positive cases have breached the 50 Covid positive cases mark.The last time the Covid positive cases touched 50 or more in Thane city was on November 10. And, on Friday, the city recorded 53 positive cases.“Keeping in mind the new Covid variant, Omicron, we had planned to increase the number of tests in the city. A gradual increase in daily testing has been noted but the overall positive cases continue to be under control. As the positivity rate within the city is still at 0.29%, there is nothing to panic. We have enough provisions in terms of beds and oxygen facilities as well. Also, we are closely monitoring the daily number of cases and are keeping a track of all the international passengers,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, Thane Municipal Corporation chief.Despite TMC’s claims about the testing having been increased, there has hardly been a rise in the tests. Until last week, there were regularly around 1,800 to 2,000 tests being conducted by the TMC. This week, it has slightly increased to around 2,600 tests. In the last 45 days, the daily positive cases were continuously among 30 to 40 daily positive cases. The weekly average was also below 40 cases every week until this week when the weekly average is close to 50.“The hesitancy among residents to get tested continues. People claim that they are vaccinated and have not come in close contact with any traveller or positive person, and hence they are safe. Moreover, as very few have symptoms nowadays, there are fewer who come forward to get tested,” said an officer from TMC’s testing team on the condition of anonymity.TMC continues to propagate vaccination and provide vaccination facilities to all quarters with the aim that vaccination will help curb the increase in cases.“We are conducting vaccination among naka kaamgars (daily wage workers) at various junctions across the city. We have also initiated vaccination camps in the evening at some locations in the city. The more people get vaccinated, it will help curb the number of cases,” said an officer from TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-corporation-records-50-covid-positive-cases-for-the-first-time-in-45-days-101640448208214.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Transport resumes stand booking, revenue up by 6% to 8%||The Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) has resumed its stand booking facility post-Covid. This has helped increase the revenue by around 6% to 8% on a daily basis, claims the transport department.During peak hours, the buses are crowded and often many have to get down within two or three stops. It becomes difficult for a single conductor to manage the crowd and give tickets. Hence, this facility to provide tickets at the bus stand or depot itself has become convenient.“It is only after we started such a facility a few years ago that we realised we could manage the situation better. Owing to the pandemic, we had stalled this system as there were fewer people opting for public transport. With a large number of people being vaccinated now, the number of travellers has increased and is almost equivalent to the pre-Covid times. Hence, we resumed the stand booking facility and thus saw an increase in revenue by 6% to 8%,” said Bhalchandra Behare, TMT manager.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-transport-resumes-stand-booking-revenue-up-by-6-to-8-101640446827546.html

Kejriwal, who is here on a two-day Punjab tour, and was heading to a meeting, told Warring that he agreed with the demand.Later, a Punjab government press release said Volvo buses of the State Transport Undertaking (STU) have been barred from going to Indira Gandhi International Airport, even as these charged only ₹1,200 per passenger, even as Badal family’s privately-owned buses were being allowed, despite charging between ₹3,000 and ₹3,500 per passenger.Warring added that he had written 13 letters to Kejriwal, but the Delhi CM still pretended to be unaware of the issue. Prior to this, the principal secretary, transport, K Siva Prasad has also raised the issue in writing with his Delhi counterpart four times from December 6, 2018 to August 21, 2019, but Kejriwal had neither stopped the entry of Indo-Canadian buses nor allowed Punjab Roadways and the PRTC to go till the transport, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/warring-meets-kejri-seeks-restart-of-buses-to-delhi-airport-101640445986554.html
25-12-2021||Other||Sacrilege now routine, a political conspiracy: Akal Takht jathedar||Amritsar Sacrilege incidents have become a ‘rampant routine’, as the Central and the state law enforcement agencies had failed to bring the perpetrators to justice, acting Akal Takht jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh, has alleged, adding all this was a part of a deeper conspiracy against the Sikhs. The jathedar said this after a meeting with the five high Sikh priests. The meeting had been called in the wake of the sacrilege attempt at the Golden Temple on December 18. “For the past few years, some invisible anti-Panthic powers, under a deep conspiracy, have been degrading the honour of the Guru Granth Sahib... this has now reached the Golden Temple. No law appears to be taking any effective action, nor has judiciary awarded strict punishment,” the jathedar said, after the meeting, adding that hundreds of accused were handed over to the law, with most acquitted on the grounds of mental illness.  “The intelligence agencies of governments are appearing helpless in curbing these incidents of sacrilege, and identifying the hidden powers behind them,” the jathedar claimed, adding, “If the government of India and its investigative agencies, the intelligence wing and the judiciary had acted immediately after the culmination of the farmers’ agitation and played their role responsibly, it would have been a slap on the faces of the conspirators, who are trying to break Hindu-Sikh unity.”“In the wake of the incident at the Golden Temple, we appeal to the Panth that under a deep political conspiracy attempts are being made to disrespect the honour of Sikh institutions, gurdwara management committees and sects. Women, children and mentally ill people are being used for such acts. All gurdwara management committees should take adequate steps to curb such incidents,” he added.The jathedar also expressed disappointment against a section of the media, which, he claimed, tried to present a ‘wrong image of Sikhs by ignoring the disappointing working of the state’s law’.Giani Ranjit Singh Gauhar-E-Maskeen, jathedar of Patna Sahib, Giani Malkiat Singh, head granthi of the Akal Takht, Giani Raghubir Singh, acting jathedar of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, and Giani Gurminder Singh, granthi of the Golden Temple, were also present at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sacrilege-now-routine-a-political-conspiracy-akal-takht-jathedar-101640445626369.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||MPCB discovers 9 spots in Badlapur where waste mixes with Ulhas River||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has found nine spots in Badlapur region where activities like discharging of untreated effluents, domestic waste and vehicle washing are leading to pollution in Ulhas River.Ulhas River is a major source for drinking water for Kalyan, Dombivli, Badlapur, Navi Mumbai, Ambernath and Ulhasnagar.An investigation was initiated by the MPCB officials of Kalyan division in November after the local residents of Rayate village complained of water pollution in Ulhas River on November 22. Following the findings, the MPCB has written to the Kulgaon-Badlapur Municipal Council (KBMC), pointing out the cause of the pollution in the river in its jurisdiction and also highlighting the measures to be taken by the civic body.During the investigation and the visits by the MPCB officials, it was observed that a part of untreated domestic effluent generated from KBMC area is mixing into the Hendrepada nullah, which ultimately meets the river. Also, the domestic effluent generated from the old Badlapur area is also discharged into the river.The officials found that the domestic effluent generated from the cow shed located at Sonavali, Yadav Nagar, Badlapur (E) observed discharging into the Ulhas River without treatment and domestic waste discharged into the Panvelkar nullah.The vehicle washing activities were observed at Badlapur Chowpati, which also mixes with the river water.“We have identified several such spots in the city where the domestic waste is discharged into the nullah that further meets the river. There is no proper treatment done to this waste and hence the pollution. The council has been asked to set up necessary sewer networks so that the domestic waste does not mix with the nullah,” said an officer of MPCB, Kalyan.The pollution control board has asked the KBMC to come up with proper sewer networks in those parts of the city in order to treat the domestic waste.KBMC chief officer, Yogesh Godase, said, “There is a regular visit carried out by the MPCB in the region and they ask us to come up with measures to deal with the domestic waste. Accordingly, several works are undertaken. The work for a sewer network for the mentioned areas is already under progress, which will be completed by 2022. The project cost is ₹43Cr. This will help ensure the domestic waste from those areas is not adding to the river.“Meanwhile, there are chemical effluents of industrial area that mix up with the domestic waste that we have mentioned to the MPCB. This is one major reason for the pollution in the river,” added Godase.

25-12-2021||Patna||Red faces after sudden postponement of Munger bridge inauguration||The double-decker road and railway bridge over Ganga river in Bihar’s Munger district, whose inauguration scheduled for Saturday by union minister for road transport Nitin Gadkari was suddenly postponed on Friday evening, will now be formally opened up after January 15 next year, 20 years after its foundation stone was laid in 2002.State’s road construction minister Nitin Nabin said the bridge would formally be inaugurated after January 15 following the end of Kharmas (a month-long period considered an inauspicious for starting new ventures as per Hindu religious beliefs).Although no official reason was given for postponement, road construction department (RDD) officials said the approach road to the bridge was yet to be completed. “We plan to open it on January 16 tentatively,” said the minister. The 3.8- kilometre-long bridge, constructed at a cost of ₹2,776 crore, will connect Munger with Jamalpur and make road and railway traffic more convenient for those commuting to north Bihar and eastern parts of the state and north eastern India.The postponement of inauguration, which Gadkari himself informed on Friday evening citing “unavoidable reasons”, has raised many eyebrows given the fact that the minister himself, in a virtual speech from New Delhi earlier in the day, had announced the completion of the bridge and expressed his happiness over dedicating the bridge to the people on December 25, the birth anniversary of former prime minister Atal late Bihari Vajpayee. Gadkari had said the bridge had been named after Bihar’s first chief minister and eminent freedom fighter Shri Krishna Sinha. Nabin said it was Vajpayee who had laid the foundation stone of the double decker bridge in 2002.According to officials, the 14-kilometre-long approach road to the bridge is not complete yet while one of girders was installed just about 10 days back. One of the reasons for the delay in completion of the bridge has been hurdles in land acquisition for the approach road and encroachments in the stretch, sources said. The state cabinet, a few months back, had sanctioned ₹60 crore for acquisition of the land following which work started on the approach road, officials said. Nabin conceded technical hurdles. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar also advised that it would be not be prudent to open the bridge unless it commutable because of the technical specifications and asked us to hold the inauguration for a fortnight,” he said. Earlier, there was a political controversy over union rural development department minister Giriraj Singh’s name missing from the invitation cards for the event. Singh, MP from Begusarai, was reportedly upset over not being invited at the event, prompting Gadkari to invite him personally. Singh’s name was later included in the invitation cards.“The issue was sorted out. There was some confusion as officials thought the project fell in Munger district although the approach road fell in Begusarai district. It had nothing to do with the event getting postponed,” the RDD minister said.
25-12-2021||Patna||Bihar panchayat poll winners allege threat from criminals||Panchayat elections in Bihar are over, but the newly elected representatives, who constitute the electorate for the impending elections for block pramukh and other posts, are a frightened lot after the killing of 13 of them, including five mukhiyas (panchayat heads).The election for chairman for district boards and deputy chairmen is scheduled from December 27 to January 3, while the election for deputy mukhiya and deputy sarpanch is scheduled from December 24 to 31. The election for panchayat samiti chief and deputy chief will be held from December 27 to January 3. Several elected representatives have complained of threat from notorious elements to vote for their favourite candidates in these elections. For instance, in Khusrupur block in rural Patna, newly elected members of panchayat samiti have alleged life threat from a history sheeter Sanjay Yadav, whose wife Anju Devi has been elected to the panchayat samiti from Sukerbeg-Chak panchayat. In letters sent to top police officers and the Governor, they have said, “Yadav has issued a diktat that all should vote for his wife in the block chief’s election, else they will be shot. He is going door-to-door, issuing threats. Many panchayat samiti members have left their homes out of fear. Yadav faces nearly 30-40 cases and is absconding on record,” the letter says. One of the members, Naresh Ravidas of Hardas Bigha, alleged that the local police of Khusrupur was in collusion with Yadav and no effort was being made to arrest him. “History sheeters have got their wives or kin elected to control things by proxy. They want their representation in block and district level committees, which happens through election from among the elected representatives. This is causing more unrest,” said a mukhiya, who did not want to be quoted. Dinesh Prasad, former mukhiya of Kasimchak panchayat in Danapur, who lost this time, said that increase in fund allocation to the panchayati raj institutions had made the stakes higher. “Be it the appointment of teachers, purchase of solar lights, payment under Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, rural development work, job cards or food grain distribution or any other activities, PRIs have been under scanner over corruption charges due to higher flow of funds,” he said. Panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary said he has already directed the additional chief secretary of his department to provide security to any elected representative if he or she feels any threat. “With over 90% new members winning this time, it is really a big challenge for the administration to ensure their security,” he said. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar said ADG (law & order) Binay Kumar has written to all district police chiefs to take action.Meanwhile, Station House Officer of Khusrupur police station, Chandra Bhanu, admitted that Sanjay Yadav is absconding and said raids are on to nab him.

Gupta had gone to Kalyan railway station on Wednesday to drop his mother, who was travelling to Uttar Pradesh, when he was robbed. In his statement, Gupta said that he was buying fruits for his mother at a stall outside the station when an unidentified person accosted him, forcibly took his cell phone and fled the scene at around 11.30am. The police registered a case of robbery against unknown persons under and started inquiries.“We obtained CCTV camera footage of the accused and sought assistance from local informants, which led to a tip off that the accused would regularly frequent the station premises to target lone passengers or commuters. We laid a trap late on Wednesday night, and intercepted the accused from outside the station at around 10.45pm,” senior police inspector, Ashok Honmane, Mahatma Phule Chowk police station, said.The accused, identified as Avinash Gaikwad (26), was searched and was found to be carrying five cell phones including the one stolen from Gupta that morning. He was taken to the police station for questioning, and allegedly confessed that all the other cell phones were robbed as well, two of them from the Kalyan station premises.“We scanned our records and found that we had FIRs registered for the other cell phones he had robbed in Kalyan earlier this year. Further inquiries also revealed that he had broken out of the Adharwadi Central Jail in Kalyan last year. He was in the area where prisoners meet visitors when he managed to slip out of the prison, and an offence was registered against him with the Khadakpada police in this regard,” Honmane said.Gaikwad was placed under arrest and produced in court, after which he was remanded in police custody till Monday. The police then interrogated him further and found that he had cases of robbery and burglary registered with him in police stations like Paithan, Pandharpur Rural, Parali, Pachod, Aurangabad GRP and Kalyan Railway Police from 2018 till date.“Gaikwad hails from Paithan and keeps shuttling between there and Kalyan, committing crimes to make money. He was arrested in 2018 and lodged in the Pandharpur jail, and had broken out of it as well. We have sought necessary information regarding this jailbreak from the concerned police station,” Honmane said.The Mahatma Phule Chowk police have informed all the other police stations where Gaikwad is wanted about his arrest, so that they may seek his custody in connection with their respective cases. The police are still interrogating him to find out if he has committed any more crimes than the ones that have already come to light, officers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/serial-offender-arrested-in-kalyan-wanted-in-several-cases-across-maharashtra-101640444366335.html

The programme was held at a sports complex at Kandivali East, where Nadda was scheduled to be present.However, Shetty, who represents Mumbai North in the Lok Sabha, said that the inauguration of the statue had to be cancelled as sports minister Sunil Kedar, who belongs to the Congress, and holds charge of the sports portfolio, denied permissions. “The Mumbai suburban district collector and the commissioner of sports had given their consents in March. However, the file was pending till 4.45 PM on Friday and the permission was refused,” charged Shetty. He added that this had led to Nadda cancelling his visit to Mumbai.This last-minute denial had also prevented the BJP from approaching the courts for redressal, said Shetty. Kedar was not available for his comments despite repeated attempts. However, Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) president Bhai Jagtap questioned, “How can BJP leaders celebrate Atal Mahotsav when the number of Covid and Omicron cases are on the rise.” Jagtap said that while they respected Vajpayee, it was wrong to launch public celebrations in times of a public health emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/event-to-unveil-atal-statue-cancelled-at-last-minute-101640442866230.html

While the first arm will start near the Mulund-Airoli creek bridge (Airoli end), the other will start from Thane-Belapur Road.“We have observed that the Airoli node and its peripheries have a population of more than one lakh. To board the freeway for their routine commuting, people will have to travel either to the creek bridge or to Thane-Belapur Road on a daily basis and that will create traffic congestion in the entire area. To avoid that, we are developing two roundabouts at Airoli and residents will be able to board the freeway without travelling much,” a senior officer from MMRDA said.“Presently, it takes around 40 minutes to travel from Airoli to Katai Naka. With the completion of the freeway and by using the roundabouts, the Airoli residents will reach NH-4 in 12 minutes. Around 50% work of the roundabouts has been completed so far,” he further said.MMRDA has undertaken a 12.30km elevated road project, and it is expected to cut down the travelling distance between Airoli and Kalyan-Dombivli by 10km.“The phase 1 which includes developing an elevated road connecting Thane-Belapur Road with NH-4 will be completed by March 2022 while the tunnel road from Central MIDC to NH-4 near Mumbra will be completed by March 2023. The second phase, an elevated road between Mulund-Airoli creek bridge (Airoli end) and Thane-Belapur Road, is likely to be completed by December 2022. The third phase of elevated road between NH-4 and Katai Naka is still in the tendering stage. The estimated cost for the first phase is ₹382.02Cr and the second phase is ₹275.90Cr,” the officer further said.

Saturday's spike is also the biggest jump in 24-hours since June 13 when 255 coronavirus cases were recorded, according to health bulletin data.Furthermore, the national capital reported yet another death due to Covid-19 on Christmas, thereby taking the death toll to 25,104. This was the sixth fatality the city reported in this month. Last month, Delhi reported as many as seven Covid-19 deaths; in October, only four people had succumbed to the virus in the national capital.Saturday's single-day figures show that the national capital is maintaining its trend of rising Covid-19 cases. On Friday, the city logged 180 fresh infections, 62 more than Thursday.Also Read | Delhi and Mumbai witness spike in Covid cases as Omicron triggers alarmMeanwhile, what can be considered as a good sign is that higher number of patients are recovering from the infection. On Saturday, as many as 96 fresh recoveries were reported, up from Friday's 82 and Thursday's 57.

During the day, Rajasthan and Kerala also reported fresh Omicron cases, following which their tally rose to 43 and 38, respectively.Kejriwal on Thursday urged the people of Delhi to stay at home amid the Omicron spread, highlighting that his government is “strengthening” the home isolation system. “Such patients will receive a medical kit from health authorities and they will undergo tele-counseling for 10 days,” he added.The chief minister further stated the Delhi government is prepared to handle nearly 1,00,000 Covid-19 cases in a single-day and that arrangements have been made along those lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sees-biggest-jump-in-new-covid-cases-since-june-logs-249-infections-101640438405256.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Central Railway developing infrastructure, parking space for empty rakes in Juinagar||Considering the inevitable rise in train traffic in Navi Mumbai with the completion of Nerul-Uran corridor, the Central Railway (CR) is developing a new infrastructure near Juinagar railway station. This includes additional space for parking empty rakes and a new rail bridge.The train traffic in Navi Mumbai will increase to a great extent with the completion of the Nerul-Belapur-Uran railway corridor (phase II). More than 75% work in that corridor has been completed.According to the railway officials, four stabling sidings for parking the empty rakes at the Sanpada end of Juinagar station are developed to make additional parking space. That area was earlier occupied by slum dwellers. The CR, which owns the land, vacated them and started working on the sidings a few months ago.“For parking the empty rakes at nights and during noon (when the train frequency is low), we will need space. Hence, we are developing the stabling sidings in Juinagar,” a senior railway officer from Navi Mumbai said.Secondly, the CR is developing a new bridge above a nullah at the Nerul end of Juinagar station. They are also laying tracks from the site of that bridge to the stabling sidings. Shivaji Sutar, chief PRO of CR said, “We have a car-shed in Sanpada, where the routine maintenance of the rakes is conducted. We are developing the new bridge so that we can easily take our rakes from the stabling sidings in Juinagar to that car shed. We did not allocate a separate budget for this infrastructure. The stabling sidings and the bridge are being developed with our routine budget allocated for such projects.”Bhakti Dave, president of Panvel Pravashi Sangh, said, “We recently met the railway officers and requested them to extend the Panvel-Goregaon services up to Borivali. We also requested them to provide more trains on that line. The railway officials informed us that a new platform is being developed at Borivali station and as soon as that is ready, the services will be extended and increased. So, apart from the Nerul-Belapur-Uran corridor, the number of trains will increase on the harbour line too. The railway authorities have taken timely action by developing new infrastructure in Juinagar.”
25-12-2021||Lucknow||CM Yogi kickstarts campaign to distribute tablets, smartphones to 1 crore youth||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday inaugurated the scheme for the distribution of tablets and smartphones to one crore students of the state. On the occasion of the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary, nearly 60,000 students pursuing higher education received the gadget.Amidst the cheer of several thousand elated youths, Yogi began distribution of tablets and smartphones in a mega event held at Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in the state capital. The CM announced that along with tablets and smartphones, the government is planning to provide free internet access and content for the students. To begin with, tablets are being provided to 60,000 youths. He resolved to take ‘Digital Revolution’ from village to village by organizing such programmes in other districts of the state so that students preparing for competitive examinations would also get the full benefit from it.On the occasion, the CM tried to inspire youth by citing examples of young Indian CEO’s who are leading top multinational companies across the globe such as Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, Shantanu Narayen, chairman and CEO of Adobe among others.Speaking at the event, the chief minister mentioned the achievements of youths and girls who made the state proud in every field- from sports to start-ups. Giving an example of Lord Krishna, he said that even Krishna was young when he liberated the people of Mathura from the tyranny of Kansa. Moreover, Lord Buddha or Adi Shankaracharya in their youth gave the message of nirvana to the world. Adi Shankaracharya lived only 32 years, he said.He also launched ‘Digi Shakti Portal’ and ‘Digi Shakti Adhyayan App’. The app is installed on all smartphones and tablets and all the information related to government welfare schemes as well as study material will be made available through this. Addressing the gathering, the CM said, “The importance of technology was closely witnessed during the pandemic. Children did not have the facility of online education and classes. That’s when we decided that we will connect one crore youth with technology and give out tablets and smartphones.”Training guns on the opposition and accusing them of promoting “Bhai-bhatijavad” (nepotism) in the state, the chief minister pointed that all the characters of ‘Mahabharat’- the chacha, Shakuni mama, Duryodhana bhanja, bhatija fanned out to do extortion in job recruitments during the previous government’s tenure. “But under the BJP rule all the job processes were transparent and the present government gave 4.5 lakh jobs to youths in 4.5 years of its tenure,” he said. Without naming any SP leaders, he took potshot on dig saying those who opposed vaccines are ‘tired’ and ‘retired’. He also accused them of nurturing the mafia and creating an environment of fear in society stating that bulldozers are razing down the properties of mafiosos and their henchmen in UP now. Our government emphasizes ‘Soch Imaandar, Kaam Damdaar’,” he added.Taking a dig at the SP chief, the CM said, “It is to be remembered that during the Covid-19 pandemic, some people created a crisis of life by spreading rumours against the vaccine. Those who wake up at noon are not youths; rather they are tired and retired.” Sending across a note of warning to all those who tend to vitiate the transparent recruitment process, the CM asserted that “If someone is trying to play with the life of youth, then he should be aware of the consequence. They will be sent to jails.”Remembering the legendary leader AB Vajpayee, CM Yogi said that Atalji is an inspiration for all. “He always believed ‘Siddhantviheen rajneeti maut ka fanda hoti hai’, the person who lives a life full of principle and for the welfare of other people, only his life is meaningful.”Yogi gave gadgets to some students from the stage. He congratulated Sagar Upmanyu, a visually impaired student pursuing MA in political science at Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehab University, Lucknow for his confidence and consistency to move forward.On this occasion, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath honoured Mirabai Chanu, a weight lifter who brought laurels in the Olympic Games played in 2021. Union minister of education and minister of skill development and entrepreneurship, Dharmendra Pradhan was also present on this occasion.
25-12-2021||Lucknow||Bateshwar to be developed to keep Atal’s memories alive: Yogi||Agra Chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath paid tributes to former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee in his paternal village Bateshwar, on his birth anniversary on Saturday. Yogi also inaugurated and laid foundation stones for projects worth ₹230 crore for Bateshwar and assured that all efforts would be made to develop Bateshwar to keep Atal’s memories alive.. To note, Atal’s birth anniversary was observed as ‘Sushashan Diwas’ (Good Governance Day) all over the nation. Yogi viewed the photo gallery on the life of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and addressed the gathering at a ground in Bateshwar. “Former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a great personality and had such a good reputation that even his opponents could not criticize him. He was an open-hearted person who said that one needed to think big if one intended to do big. In his political career spreading over six decades, there was not a single blame on his personality,” said the chief minister. “Atalji inspired us all and paved the way for various schemes in favour of the poor and needy. He gave different schemes for developing road network and free ration for the poor and always stood in favour of the last man in the chain of development. All through his life, he stood for ethics and principles,” said Yogi. The CM targeted the Samajwadi Party leadership, without taking names, and blamed them for ‘loot’ while in power in the state. “They had been out of power for the past five years, yet ₹200 crores are being unearthed from their houses in income tax raids. Where did this money come from? It seems to be that which was looted and stored when they were in power in the state,” alleged Yogi. “Money meant for poor was wasted on subjects like kabristan (graveyard) in previous regime. Those not even knowing Urdu were appointed as Urdu translators and posts were created for them but nothing was done for students and teachers of Sanskrit. It was during BJP regime that Sanskrit schools were taken care of,” claimed the CM. “The previous regimes in Uttar Pradesh committed a crime by denying the benefits due to the poor. The cash now being unearthed from opposition party leaders and supporters was meant for the poor but was misappropriated. The BJP has given due share to the poor through various schemes like PM Awas Yojna,” he said. “Our government is now giving tablets and smart phones to youth in Uttar Pradesh. There are various schemes in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Medical colleges, residential schools and intermediate schools are coming up in his name,” said the chief minister, promising that a museum, a ‘sanskritik sankul (cultural complex) and park in name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee would soon come up in Bateshwar. Also present on the occasion were cabinet minister Mahendra Singh, former minister Aridaman Singh, MP from Fatehpur Sikri Rajkumar Chahar and MLA from Bah Rani Pakshalika Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bateshwar-to-be-developed-to-keep-atal-s-memories-alive-yogi-101640442026302.html

Preliminary investigation revealed that credentials of a genuine exporting company were misused, a customs officer said, adding that the probe is on to nab the culprit involved in the smuggling. The special intelligence and investigation branch (export) of the Customs department had received a specific input about smuggling of red sanders and following the tip-off, Customs officers intercepted a container inside the GTI Terminal of JNPT before it left the country. The container, destined for UAE with declared goods as “empty glass bottles 90ML”, was examined and found to be stuffed with red sandalwood, weighing about 15,020 kilograms, worth about ₹15 crore in the grey market , the Customs official said. “A case has been registered under the Customs Act and we have started recording statements of the people connected with the case,” said the officer, refusing to divulge further details about the exporter or the people involved in the smuggling. Another Customs officer, however, revealed that the exporter is a Mumbai-based firm and it appears that the smuggler was trying to misuse the genuine documents of the company to run his smuggling racket, but did not succeed in the endeavour. The second officer said they are also trying to ascertain if the gang has sent any other consignments to the UAE or some other foreign destinations and if some regular gang of smugglers was involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/customs-seize-red-sandalwood-worth-rs-15-crore-at-mumbai-s-nhava-sheva-101640440346204.html

25-12-2021||Mumbai||ED detaches Nirav Modi’s assets over ₹1000 crore, Rhythm House in auction list||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has detached assets worth ₹1000 crore belonging to diamantaire Nirav Modi – prime accused in the massive fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB), including the iconic Rhythm House at Kala Ghoda in south Mumbai, four flats in Worli and an office building in Kurla. A senior ED officer said that a liquidator appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal will conduct the liquidation process of the properties . The seized properties will be auctioned to recover the amount payable by Modi’s firms to the PNB, the officer added. Nirav Modi and his wife Ami, who is an American citizen, fled the country in the first week of January 2018, shortly before the massive fraud at the public sector bank came to light. On January 31, 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered an offence under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act (POC) and the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Modi and several others, including two officers of the PNB. According to the complaint lodged by the PNB, between February and May 2017, Nirav Modi and his firms namely, M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamond got fraudulently issued 150 Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) from Brady House branch of PNB and duped the public sector bank to the tune of USD 1015.35 million, equivalent to ₹6498.20 crore, resulting in loss of ₹6,805 crore to the public sector bank. Similarly, Modi’s maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, another prime accused in the case, has allegedly duped PNB of ₹7,080.86 crore. Choksi’s Gitanjali group has also defaulted on payment of dues to the tune of ₹5,099.74 crore to several other banks in India. Modi is currently lodged in a jail at Wandsworth Prison in South-west London ever since he was arrested by the British police in March 2019 on charges of extradition warrants issued against him, whereas Choksi is reportedly acquired citizenship of Antigua and is presently residing in the Caribbean island nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-detaches-nirav-modi-s-assets-over-1000-crore-rhythm-house-in-auction-list-101640437405786.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra utilised only 20% of NCAP funds||Mumbai As of November 2021, Maharashtra has spent just about 20% of the funds it has received under the Centre’s National Clean Air Program (NCAP). A total of ₹11.27 crore has been spent so far across 17 non-attainment cities, leaving an unspent balance of ₹39.98 crore, according to data available with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). The majority of the funds have been spent in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, while in two cities (Akola and Amravati), zero funds have been spent.Dr VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB, could not be reached for comment on Saturday. However, Motghare had presented these numbers at an MPCB review meeting on November 23, a recording of which is available online. “Maharashtra is lacking in fund utilisation of the NCAP program,” Motghare had said. A sub-regional officer with the MPCB, who did not wish to be named, explained that the unspent balance is currently lying with ULBS, and that they are expected to be used to bolster city-level action plans against air pollution, with a focus on measures like dust mitigation, traffic regulation, waste management and so on. NCAP does not have a legal mandate but aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) concentrations over 2017 levels in over 100 cities by 2024.“The ULBs have been slow to utilise the funds. Covid has been a major hurdle, and most municipal councils and corporations have focused their attention on dealing with the pandemic. But yes, there is also an issue of lack of expertise and technical knowledge on the part of the ULBs, which slows things down. As far as possible, when dealing with contractors and vendors, we have to follow Make in India guidelines and work with Indian companies, so it can take longer to outsource the work,” said the MPCB official cited above. “We will aim to use all the funds before the financial year ends,” they added.This issue isn’t just restricted to Maharashtra, according to data released by the environment ministry during the first meeting of the NCAP’s National Apex Committee on December 17. A total of ₹375.44 crore was provided under NCAP to 114 cities from 2018-19 to 2020-21, and ₹290 crores were allocated to 82 cities for 2021-22. The Centre will be providing a further ₹700 crores for the 2021-26 period.Although utilisation of the ₹375.44 crore given in the past two years has been low by most states, according to the data, with 22 states under NCAP collectively utilising only 33.53% of the amount. Bihar and Chandigarh utilised 77% and 82% respectively of the fund, but Punjab and Uttar Pradesh utilised only 17%, Chhattisgarh 21%, Andhra Pradesh 10%, Assam 4%, Himachal Pradesh 2%, and Jammu & Kashmir 1%. The utilisation by Uttarakhand and West Bengal was 53% and 58% respectively. Maharashtra has also been allotted a total of ₹2,981 crore, at the recommendation of the 15th FC, specifically to address air pollution in the state. The funds are to be utilised by the end of the financial year 2026. Of the ₹2,773 crore which the state government plans to spend by the end of FY2025, 80% (or ₹2,218 crore) is proposed to be spent on the EV Policy, primarily on electrifying bus fleets in major urban clusters. The balance of ₹555 crore will be spent on local interventions, such as increasing Maharashtra’s air quality monitoring network (3%), implementing dust control measures (8%), and regulating construction (4%), industries (2% ), bakeries and crematoria (3%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-utilised-only-20-of-ncap-funds-101640436445763.html

Train services joining regions along the Kosi and Kamla rivers were totally snapped. After 86 years, the people living along Kosi and Kamla will be able to get connected again after train services resume next year.On Friday, railways conducted a speed trial between Asanpur Kupha and Nirmali of Samastipur railway division under East Central Railways (ECR) paving the way for the restoration of train services on this route after over eight decades. The broad gauge conversion of tracks between Asanpur Kupha and Nirmali has been completed.During the last month, top railway officials have been taking stock of the tracks and finally on Friday a speed trial was conducted successfully.“The trial was successful and we hope very soon train services will be restored on the track,” Samastipur divisional railway manager (DRM) Alok Agrawal, who was present on the occasion, said.Principal security commissioner eastern zone AM Choudhary and several other top railway officials were also present on the occasion.On June 6, 2003, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee laid the foundation stone of Mahasetu over Kosi river which paved the way for linking the two peoples. The Mahasetu has already connected Mithilanchal and Kosi and now rail connectivity is expected to be restored by the next year. Train services on the route started in 1887 and the 1934 earthquake damaged it completely.Meanwhile, the speed trial on the tracks has come like a dream come true for thousands of people who have been waiting for it for a long time. “We had become almost hopeless but our hope has once been revived and now we are waiting for the regular train services on the track connecting us to Mithilanchal,’’ a local, Gautam Kumar said.On the other hand, businessman Mahendra Jain who was also present on the occasion said, “The restoration of train services will give a boost to trade and commerce between two regions which remained disconnected for a long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-86-yrs-speed-train-trial-raises-hopes-of-reconnecting-people-of-kosi-and-kamla-101640434527340.html

Party leaders familiar with the developments said that the JD(U) has demanded most of the seats around Bihar from the BJP. “RCP Singh will hold further talks with the BJP regarding the agreement on seats,” said the party president. The party national executive held recently passed a resolution in New Delhi and expressed its willingness to contest UP assembly polls in alliance with BJP provided it gets a respectable number of seats else it would contest independently on no less than 200 seats. If party leaders are to be believed, JD(U) wants to contest 100 seats but given its performance in the 2012 UP assembly polls, “it would rest satisfied if it gets around 20 seats.” HAM-S and VIP mull tie-up A meeting between Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM-S) national president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) president and Bihar minister in Patna on Friday evening, lasting over an hour, set the sparks flying in the political circles.

25-12-2021||Lucknow||Bundelkhand “Jal Sahelis” release ‘public manifesto’ for 2022 UP polls||“Jal Sahelis” (friends of water)—a group of women working for water conservation and revival of ponds in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh—have called upon the political parties to include water conservation, revival of water bodies, demarcation of water structures, allotment of land and houses to the landless besides proper implementation of MNREGA scheme in their manifestos for 2022 UP assembly polls.They handed over the copies of their “public manifesto” to BJP state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh; UP Congress unit president Ajay Kumar Lallu and leaders of the Samajwadi Party in a programme organised here on Friday. Addressing a press conference on the occasion, state coordinator, “Jal Jan Jodo Abhiyan”, Shivani Singh said, “The geographical location of Bundelkhand region is different in Uttar Pradesh. Spread in the hilly terrain, the region is drought-prone. A few years back, the area was in the grip of drought for a decade and people had to migrate in search of livelihood and water. The 1.3 crore people residing in the region depend on agriculture for livelihood. Around 40%-50% of the population regularly migrate to cities and other states in search of petty jobs.” “With the release of the public manifesto, the ‘Jal Sahelis’ wish to draw the attention of political parties towards the issues and problems faced by the people residing in the seven districts of Bundelkhand region- Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot. The political parties should address the issue and include the demands of the people in their election manifesto for the 2022 UP assembly election,” she said.National convener, “Jal Jan Jodo Abhiyan”, Sanjay Singh said, “Along with water conservation, the issues of unemployment, environment, tourism, art and culture have been included in the public manifesto. The people of Bundelkhand region have demanded formation of a Pond Conservation Authority to deal with water crisis and protection of water bodies. Each person should get 55 litre pure drinking water per month. Also, participation of the voluntary organisations in MNREGA should be encouraged. The state government should appoint a retired judge for hearing the cases associated with the MREGA and women should also get farming and land ownership rights.” Meera, a “Jal Saheli” and a resident of Jhansi district said, “Before election, political parties make promises to the people of Bundelkhand region to redress their grievances but after polls they dump the issues. The political parties should include water, environment, forest protection, agriculture, drought and employment issues in their election manifesto.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bundelkhand-jal-sahelis-release-public-manifesto-for-2022-up-polls-101640431885735.html
25-12-2021||Dehradun||‘Some course corrections needed to win U’khand polls’: Cong leader Harish Rawat||A day senior Congress leader Harish Rawat’s position as the face of the Congress in Uttarakhand ahead of polls in the hill state was reiterated, the former chief minister on Saturday said that some “course corrections” are needed to win elections.“...Some course correction is important to win upcoming elections...sometimes expressing pain is also beneficial for the party...,” Rawat told news agency ANI.Rawat’s statement comes a day after meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi following his public outburst. The senior politician on Wednesday posted a series of cryptic tweets, with the developments being deciphered in political circles as his ‘unhappiness’ with the grand old party. His tweets came nearly two months after he was replaced as the Congress’ in-charge for Punjab by Harish Chaudhary.“One thing we all should understand is that the AICC (All India Congress Committee) is the boss, just like the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India). The election in-charges are like a coach. But the playing captain, too, is important. So, there should be a relation of confidence and understanding among the three,” the former Uttarakhand chief minister said.If you play for the cross-purpose, then the match will be lost, the veteran party leader further said. “Therefore, whatever I said was so that we would win the match. If I would have said it normally, then people would have accused me of political adjustments. So, expressing pain often benefits the party, and I think it will benefit the party,” Rawat elaborated.When asked about his meeting with Gandhi, he said that it has been made clear that everyone has to work together.“I will lead as the campaign committee chairman and everyone will support me,” he said. He added that he was asked to ensure that the members of the party should not be seen working in different directions.In other words, he said, the elections in Uttarakhand will be fought under him. However, the party stopped short of announcing him the party’s chief ministerial candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/some-course-corrections-needed-to-win-u-khand-polls-cong-leader-harish-rawat-101640431826954.html
25-12-2021||Patna||Bihar CM calls on women to carry forward social reforms agenda, resurrect image||Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s ongoing ‘Samaj Sudhar Yatra’ has brought forward a striking aspect - his trust in the caste-neutral women constituency, which he has nurtured since the very beginning, to take his messages across.All through his yatra, which will continue till January 15 and crisis-cross the state, Kumar has been focusing on the women as the harbinger of change in the state and experts feel that at a time when he has been politically cornered after the 2020 Assembly elections as the third-rank party in the state, he banks on them to script his resurrection.“We started Jeevika group from just 50 blocks at the beginning with a small initiative but big vision. Today, it is a big movement with over 10.5-lakh self-help groups and contributing to the state’s growth and social transformation. Mothers hold the key to a stable and sustainable society. Never let child marriage and dowry crush women. My government has taken a number of initiatives to make them self-reliant in every way,” he said on the first day of his yatra in Motihari and has continued with the same tenor since then, linking it with social evils like child marriage, dowry and liquor consumption.Bihar has the highest number of Jeevika groups in the country involving 1.27-crore women through a World Bank-supported poverty alleviation programme operational in the state since 2007. In fact, Kumar started working on it soon after he became the CM in 2005 to empower women through their financial inclusion by awarding them different kinds of work from the government.“With the inclusion of over 50% women in the panchayati raj institutions and schools as teachers, the government hopes to make Jeevika the nucleus of rural development, and involve the SHGs in a whole range of activities, viz animal husbandry, agriculture-related activities, supervision work related to health and environment, tailoring, mask making, banking and running small enterprises among other things. The government has also decided to settle ponds in the name of Jeevika SHGs for maintenance and fishery.“The objective is to make them the engines of rural economy and the CM has full faith in their potential for the way they have responded to every challenge and delivered to transform the rural landscape. The CM feels that only women could sustain the rapid progress the state has made over the last 15-16 years by ushering in much-needed social reforms to take it forward. Therefore, women hold the centre stage in his plan for action,” said water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha.When Kumar took the daring decision of introducing liquor prohibition in the state in 2016, he attributed it to the call of women. Now that he is facing opposition from all sides in prohibition, he has now looked towards women to make it their cause, reminding them in all his speeches how women experienced empowerment during the last decade and why it was important.Social analyst professor NK Choudhary said that Nitish Kumar was aware of how time was running out for him and so he was trying to appear different from the political crowd around him by doubling up as a social reformist politician who looks beyond the social and economic transformation of a state with a permanent ‘laggard’ tag.“He did his bit well, but Bihar needs a lot more catching up. He wants history to remember him as a different politician and refurbish his social image, which has taken a beating of late. The political undercurrent is always there, but more important is the urge to be remembered as a man with a difference. The use of religion in politics is known, but not many politicians take up social issues for politics. The growing empowerment of women was apparent even during elections when they outnumbered men, but that did not help him politically,” said Choudhary.Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, DM Diwakar, said, Kumar’s focus on the women constituency would not help him politically as it would not be able to hide apparent governance deficit in recent years and impact of burning issues like rising prices and growing unemployment.“The fact is that a woman is affected more by the LPG cylinder costing ₹1000 and the difficulty in running a household. Rhetoric politics is reaching saturation stage now. People want governance reflected through a strong delivery mechanism, check on corruption and inclusive growth. Social reforms are best left to social reformers. For Nitish Kumar, governance has been his USP all through and that is what people expect from him,” said Diwakar, adding that he got a taste of policing when his Scorpio was stolen from Bhagalpur on November 29 and despite CCTV footage there was no trace of it.

25-12-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Robust rise of new successful firms||2021 has proved to a turning point for the Pune startup ecosystem. For starts, as per the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the number of startups in Pune is now 3,200 which is almost equal to the 3,274 registered in India’s financial capital - Mumbai. Pune has seen emergence of three new unicorns – including two which started out from Pune, but now moved to either Bengaluru or Mumbai – taking its total tally to six. Also, the existing unicorn companies doubled or tripled their valuations. Startups in Pune were also on the radar of venture capital firms and this year Pune startups received a total investment of about USD 538 million – of which USD 213 million were raised by the newly minted unicorns. Financial services, agriculture, health and software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups dominated the funding space this year followed by some action in education, logistics, electric vehicles, food, robotics and biotechnology sector. On the infrastructure side, even though the city is still in want of an international airport and expansion of metro routes, real-estate sector has seen an uptick with maximum number of small-ticket-size commercial spaces projects designed for startups and information technology (IT) companies launched in the last one year. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has also formed an EV cell to address the roadblocks on infrastructure as well as charging infrastructure. Della Leaders Club (DLC), a global community of entrepreneurs, young leaders and professionals launched its Pune chapter to come up with a support system for budding bigwigs. College of Engineering Pune’s (COEP) Bhau Institute of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Leadership has been selected under the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS). Six unicorns The year started with Pune-based insurance technology startup ‘Digit Insurance’ turning unicorn in January month itself after raising funding of USD 18.5 million. This trend continued with SaaS company Mindtickle and cloud-kitchen startup Rebel Foods bagged the unicorn tag in August and October respectively with funding rounds of USD 100 million and USD 14.5 million respectively. Another interesting turn of events was that two Pune-based companies – Noccarc and E-Spin Nanotech – helped IIT Kanpur’s Technology Business Incubator ‘Startup Incubation and Innovation Centre (SIIC)’ to cross the crucial milestone of incubating 100 startups which at a combined valuation stand at a valuation of more than USD 1 billion. SaaS-based contract management company ‘Icertis’ tripled its valuation at USD 2.8 billion early in March 2021 with a fund raiser of USD 80 million. Another unicorn, cloud data protection and management company ‘Druva’, founded in Pune and turned unicorn in 2019, raised USD 147 million in April 2021 which raised the company’s valuation above USD 2 billion. Druva also announced it has surpassed seven million daily backups with 169PB of data under management. Prime startup Epicenter Vivek Sadhale, co-founder, LegaLogic Consulting says, “2021 started with a bit of uncertainty. As things started to look up, second wave of coronavirus pandemic played a big dampener. However, second half of 2021 has been absolutely rocking. Pune witnessed a flurry of activity both in the M&A and investment side. It was great to see a Pune company Go-digit start the year of unicorns. Technology sector is red hot. Fintech, Agritech, InsureTech, EdTech all have received attention from investors. Services companies have seen M&A. Manufacturing sector has not participated in this run as much as technology sector has. Pune has become a hub for product companies. SPPU’s innovation cell, Venture Centre, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), Bhau Institute, Software Exporters’ Association of Pune (SEAP), and many more industry bodies have created a vibrant ecosystem. During the pandemic this ecosystem worked as a catalyst. This ecosystem is one of the important pillars for Pune to see a vibrant 2021.” Coming of Age If we analyse the funding statistics available in public domain, Pune-based agritech startups have raised USD 78 million, fintech startups USD 73.6 million, health startups USD 32 million, SaaS startups USD 12.15 million and edtech startups about USD 7.22 million in funding in 2021. Vinit Deo and Prajakta Shetye-Deo of Posiview Ventures shared, “Pune’s ecosystem also has come of age in terms of size of funding with a few large ticket size deals such as Firstcry (USD 300 million), Elasticrun (USD 75 million) and Agrostar (USD 70 million) taking place during the year. While ecommerce and infotech sectors, led the pack in terms of number of investments, others sectors such as food and beverages, agriculture, artificial intelligence, edtech and fintech saw a few transactions.” “Pune’s startups received the fourth highest funding after Delhi NCR, Bengaluru and Mumbai as per a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). Interestingly, Pune’s startups received almost 4x funding of almost USD 845 million in the first three quarters of this year versus USD 189 million in the same period last year - highest year-on-year growth in funding across cities. It is also important to note that this funding went to startups in a wide range of areas and not just technology. Pune has a thriving incubation culture with non-profit organisations such as TIE, Savitribai Phule Pune University Center of Innovation Incubation & Enterprise, Bhau Institute’s Incubation Center, Venture Center and a host of institutions as well as Atal Innovation Centres taking the culture of entrepreneurships to the grassroots level starting from colleges.” Vinit Deo and Prajakta Shetye-Deo of Posiview Ventures Unlocking great potential Vishesh Rajaram, managing partner and Ishika Mittal, research analyst, Speciale Invest said, “Pune has historically been a hub for technology startups and this year we saw active work in deeptech, healthcare, clean-tech, and SaaS, amongst others. We have incredible work done by a few early-stage biotech startups such as Cygenica and Synthera Biomedical. Similarly, engineering heavy startups such as Quasar - building a platform for SDR apps and Stiger - building electric fleet vehicles have also made significant progress. Also, Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) joined hands with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) earlier this year to support deeptech entrepreneurship and selected Venture Centre to lead the program. “With the rise of deeptech startup funding in India, Pune seems to be on the verge of unlocking great potential. In 2021, deeptech startups raised over $500M in funding in Q2 and Q3, comprising 19 per cent and 15 per cent respectively of all investments - encouraging numbers considering this was less than 6 per cent in 2017. Pune might soon become a pioneering space for startups in the advanced technology sector.” Vishesh Rajaram, managing partner and Ishika Mittal, research analyst, Speciale Invest Immense challenges and opportunities In the words of Dr V Premnath, director of Venture Center NCL, the year 2021 has been a landmark year for startups. Two startups from Pune — Noccarc Robotics and SynThera Biomedical — bagged the top awards constituted by the Technology Development Board on occasion of National Technology Day. Says Dr Premnath, “In this year, overshadowed by the pandemic, startups around the world stood out in their contributions to the world and inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs. The contributions of MyLab for diagnostics, ScanRay and Nocca Robotics for ventilators, Blackfrog Technologies for cold chain, and many startups for PPEs and sterilisation stand out. In the backdrop of Covid, the startup world saw tremendous interest from the investor community for startups serving a population and businesses in extended lockdowns and uncertain work environments and startups leveraging science-based deeptech to address the world’s most important problems. There was a new realisation of the importance of science-based deeptech solutions against the backdrop of the pandemic.” “In FY 2020-21 alone, Venture Center supported over 200 entrepreneurs, and Venture Center startups raised a phenomenal ₹150 crore in investments during FY2020-21. The year 2022 comes with renewed promise for the startup ecosystem in Pune. Venture Center also expects that the country is entering a phase of action for agrotech and medtech startups.” Dr V Premnath, director, Venture Center EV readiness Says Akshima Ghate, senior principal, RMI India – an independent think tank – “It has been an interesting year for the EV ecosystem. Despite the challenges of Covid-19, month-on-month sales of EV vehicles are on a continuous increasing trend. About 3 lakh EVs are being sold in the country while in Maharashtra, EV sales have increased to almost 2.5 per cent of total new vehicle sales. Maharashtra EV policy gives best incentives, big fiscal support, to manufactures, components, batteries, OEM, charging infrastructure. As a result, we have seen good amount of industrial activity and start-ups coming up in Maharashtra, in particular Pune and Mumbai region – around electric vehicles (EV).” “We are working with the Pune Municipal Corporation to help them develop an ‘EV Readiness’ plan for the city. It will identify what needs to be done in next three months, six months, one year to remove the roadblocks to EV deployment in the city. We have broadly identified eight actionable steps including specific initiatives, projects and actions that different departments should undertake and implement. This will position Pune much better in terms of EV adoption and the city will get more business interests.” Akshima Ghate, senior principal, RMI India Commercial real-estate picking up The ‘affordable commercial space’ segment is seen in demand. For example, managed office space provider Smartworks leased a total of 5.6 lakh sq ft at Baner, of which 40 per cent was pre-booked by IT/ITeS, BFSI and manufacturing clients. Says Jatin Suratwala, chairman of Suratwwala Business Group, “Real-estate market was picking up after first wave ended. Buyers were taking benefits of stamp-duty incentive till March 2021 but the second wave in April (to June) was a dampener. The overall cycle came back to routine only after July 2021. We could see that the investor-class had backed out while the residential buyer, especially from the affordable segment, dominated the pre-Covid period. However, after Covid, spacious home became a need due to work-from-home (WFH) requirement. Buyers started upgrading to larger homes while the investor-class got attracted to commercial properties.” “Maximum commercial projects were launched in last one year within an affordable ticket size of ₹30 or ₹40 lakh onwards. Small businesses, startups and mid-sized IT companies need small commercial spaces and prefer such rental arrangements. We are seeing that 80 per cent purchases of such properties is being done by investor-clients, while IT and startup companies and banks (for their back offices) are on top in terms of demand for such commercial spaces.” Jatin Suratwala, chairman of Suratwwala Business Group||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-robust-rise-of-new-successful-firms-101640429905455.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||HC upholds jail term for man who sneaks in neighbour’s house, touches her feet||The Bombay high court on Friday upheld a one-year jail term for a 36-year-old man from Partur in Jalna district for outraging the modesty of one of his neighbours by touching her feet by discreetly sneaking into her house late in the night.As per the prosecution case, at about 11 pm on July 4, 2014, the woman sensed someone touching her feet. She woke up and found the convict, her neighbour Parmeshwar Dhage, sitting on her cot. Shocked, the woman shouted for help, which woke up her grandmother-in-law, who too screamed for help. Before their other neighbours gathered on hearing their screams, Dhage fled from the house. The next day, she approached the police and set the criminal law in motion. On June 25, 2015, a judicial magistrate, first class at Partur, convicted him for criminal trespass and for outraging the modesty of the woman and sentenced him to one year’s rigorous imprisonment. Dhage moved the HC after Jalna sessions court upheld his conviction and maintained the prison term. It was argued on his behalf before the high court that on that fateful night, the woman’s husband was not at home and the door of the house had not been latched and these factors indicated that the convict had entered her house with her consent. At any rate, his counsel submitted that Dhage had no sexual intent in touching the woman’s feet and therefore his conviction was liable to be set aside. The argument, however, failed to impress upon the single-judge bench of justice MG Sewlikar, who noted that the convict was sitting on the woman’s cot in the dead of night and touching her feet. “This behaviour smacks of sexual intent,” said the judge. “Otherwise, there was no reason for the applicant to be in the house of the victim at such an odd hour of the night.” Moreover, the court said, “touching any part of a woman’s body by a stranger, without her consent, that too in the dead of the night would be a violation of modesty of a woman.” “The applicant did not enter the house of the victim with any sublime motive,” said the court after noticing that in the evening he had enquired with the woman and confirmed that her husband would not be present in the house in the night. “Therefore, the applicant ventured to enter the house. This clearly indicates that the applicant had gone there with sexual intent and violated the modesty of the informant,” the court observed. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-upholds-jail-term-for-man-who-sneaks-in-neighbour-s-house-touches-her-feet-101640429726312.html

25-12-2021||Bangalore||Will make decision on imposing night curfew in tomorrow's meeting: Karnataka CM||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Saturday that a decision on imposing night curfew in the state will be made on Sunday in a meeting with experts, according to news agency PTI. His statements come in wake of India reporting 415 cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19.Bommai added that his fear is that Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - all of which are neighbouring states of Karnataka, are rising following the emergence of Omicron. “I will discuss with all the important people and will decide the next course of action keeping in view the present situation,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.The Karnataka chief minister on Tuesday banned public gatherings or celebrations due to Christmas and New Year between December 30, 2021 and January 2, 2022. The state government has only permitted clubs and restaurants to run with a 50 per cent seating capacity, and without special events such as disc-jockeying (DJ).

25-12-2021||Noida||Noida’s farm tourism, an apt break from city’s humdrum||With Covid-19 taking a toll on not only those infected by the viral disease but also those who have been restricted to their homes ever since the pandemic began, the vast expanse of agricultural land in Gautam Budh Nagar has opened the doors of farm tourism in the district, providing a refreshing break to people who want to break free from the humdrum of their city life and reconnect with nature.Farm tourism involves inviting and attracting visitors to a farm land usually for recreational purposes. These farms are run by locals, who have either bought the land or are leasing it out. Visitors can take a stroll along the farm and also learn farming from the owner or the local villagers at the fram. Many families plan their picnics in these farms, which also sell the organic products produced by the locals. Some farms also serve food made from the locally grown vegetables.Located in Sector 126, Beejom is one such sustainable farm spread over two acres, which started in 2018 but gained more popularity post lockdown. Sector 20 resident Aparna Rajagopal, who owns and runs the farm, said since they reopened to visitors after Covid curbs were relaxed, there has been a revived interest in farm tourism.“Most of the visitors we had before the pandemic would get to know about Beejom through word of mouth. By the end of 2019, we used to host at least 50 people every weekend as entry remained free. After the lockdown was imposed, we could reopen in January this year and then again shut down in March after the second wave happened. After we reopened in September, we are hosting almost 100 people every weekend,” said Rajagopal adding that now they have started charging an entry fee of ₹100 per person on all days, except Saturdays, in order to keep Covid protocols in place.“Since this place is within easy reach, it serves as a convenient place for people to spend their weekend at. Though restrictions are relaxed, many are still working from home and schools too have not opened completely. As a result, going outdoors has almost become a luxury and people are looking to reconnect with nature now,” added Rajagopal, who is a lawyer-turned-farmer.Nandini and Manish Gupta, residents of Noida’s Sector 52, came to the farm on Saturday with their 2-year-old son Shael. “Our son was born just before the pandemic and we never got an opportunity to connect him with nature. We show him animals and plants in children’s books but in the city life, we are never able to show him these things in real. We got to know about Beejom through social media and decided to come here. It was a delight to see him beaming with joy watching the hens, ducks, rabbits and other farm animals here,” said Nandini, who works in an MNC.Puneet Tyagi, who owns Prodigal Farms in Sector 131 and has been hosting visitors here since 2017, said the footfall in his farm has doubled post lockdown. “Just before the lockdown in 2020, visitors to the farm had started increasing as people were interested to spend time with nature. After we shut in March 2020, we could resume operations from October this year and the response has been better than the pre-Covid era,” he said.On the other hand, there are also those who picked up the concept during the lockdown. Sector 104 resident Sanchaita Mazumdar left her job after the Covid outbreak in June 2020 and found herself scouting for land in Noida to grow her own organic produce.“What started as a lockdown hobby to grow our own vegetables at a rented land turned into a family-run farm, which started hosting visitors by October 2020. The farm is filled with vegetable crops that we plant and harvest. My mother cooks these for visitors at a small kitchen here. Because of Covid, we only take bookings in advance and no walk-ins are allowed. We are overwhelmed with the response from people, looking to reconnect with nature and have a rural experience,” said Mazumdar, who runs Baagh Bagicha farm and nursery in Sector 135.“Though restrictions are relaxed and we can go for a vacation, going to the farms on the outskirts of the city seems to be a more convenient alternative. I recently discovered such a farm near my residence, which opens for visitors on weekends and I have been going there with my family for the last three weeks,” said Atul Rathore, who lives in Sector 137 and visits a farm called Baagh Bagicha in Sector 135.Having been through the worst during the Covid pandemic, visiting farms is also therapeutic for some. “After recovering from Covid in June and staying at home for months on end, both have had a negative impact on my mental health. I got to know about one of the farms here through an acquaintance and one visit here felt like I have healed. The wind feels totally free from pollution and it feels refreshing to visit the fields. I try to learn some farming and connect with nature,” said Rakhee Vashisht, a resident of Greater Noida west who has been visiting Baagh Bagicha for the past one month.Greater Noida resident Vikrant Tongad, who is an environmentalist, offered up his land in Kheri Bhanauta village for community farming in 2014 to a group of environment-conscious working professionals from Noida. Today, visitors throng the farm, which is about 15-20 kilometers from Noida.“While group of visitors used to visit earlier too, queries and visits have increased manifold after Covid. While earlier, those visiting the farm were mostly from the environment conservation community, now those who are busy with their hectic schedules also visit the farm, learn farming and teach their kids the same,” said Tongad, who invites visitors through social media.However, he added that the concept of farm tourism still runs in an unorganised manner and needs a push from government agencies to gain more popularity.“These farms are located in rural villages of the district and those who maintain these farms and work here the whole week are local villagers themselves. It becomes difficult for them to work here when there is a lack of basic amenities like public washrooms, steady supply of water and uninterrupted electricity. If the district authorities ensure such basic necessities here, it will be easier for workers as well as visitors to have a good time,” he said.There are about seven to eight more such places in Noida and Greater Noida which are being used for farm tourism. District magistrate Suhas L Y said, “There are various government policies under which rural and agricultural areas are being developed in the district. Further, if villagers and farmers face any issues, I will direct concerned authorities to resolve them.”

25-12-2021||Other||‘He hasn’t resigned, issue is resolved’: Uttarakhand minister’s close aide||After a dramatic turn of events during the cabinet meeting in Uttarakhand, in which senior cabinet minister Harak Singh Rawat stormed out by tendering his “oral resignation” as a minister, BJP MLA and his close aide Umesh Sharma ‘Kau’ on Saturday morning claimed that “the issue has been resolved with no resignation from Rawat.”On late Friday evening, Rawat stormed out of the cabinet meeting citing “government inaction” on proposed medical college in his constituency. Before leaving, he “tendered his oral resignation as a minister.”Rawat, after leaving the meeting, left the state secretariat in his car without informing anyone about his whereabouts.According to a government senior official, present during the cabinet meeting, “While the cabinet was discussing various proposals during the meeting led by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, Rawat raised the issue of approving the proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar before the former which led to an argument between the two.”“The argument heated up after Rawat alleged that the development projects in his constituency are not being approved by the cabinet in a conspiracy. He then stormed out of the meeting saying, “There is no use of being a minister, I am leaving the cabinet”,” said the official.While speaking to media persons at his residence in Dehradun, Kau said Friday’s episode happened over Rawat’s unhappiness over the “proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar.”He said, “It was not a big issue. The episode happened over the lack of approval of a proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar. It has now been resolved as the government has approved it and would likely pass its government order on Monday.”“Rawat is also an MLA and was trying to carry development works in his constituency. However, if the officials put hurdles, then it is natural for him to get upset and angry. But now all is well. He never tendered his resignation and is with the party,” added Kau.
25-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi's AQI improves to 'very poor' category on Christmas Day||The pollution level in national capital Delhi improved marginally on Christmas Day (December 25), but still remained in ‘very poor’ category. Delhi’s air quality has been oscillating between ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ over the last few weeks due to a combination of factors.The air quality index (AQI) recorded a reading of 398 on Saturday morning, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), as per news agency ANI.The morning was also cold, with the temperature settling at 7 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).On Friday, the AQI in Delhi was ‘severe’, with a recording of 433 at 7am, as per CPCB data. The average 24-hour AQI was 423 on Thursday. On Wednesday, the AQI was 407 and 402 on Tuesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".Despite bad air quality, which led to reduced visibility, the flight operations remain normal at Delhi airport.In Delhi’s neighbours Noida and Gurugram, in the national capital region (NCR), the AQI was in ‘severe’ category. The AQI in Noida was at 491, while in Gurugram, it stood at 365, according to news agency ANI.Weather experts said the slowing down of winds due to a western disturbance affecting northwest India is leading to accumulation of pollutants, and high moisture content in the air makes pollutants heavier, making dispersion difficult.Light rain is likely in the plains of north India between December 27 and December 29, which may improve the air quality a bit.On Saturday, Delhi is expected to see mainly clear sky, and the maximum temperature may reach up to 23 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.On Monday, the CAQM lifted restrictions on construction and demolition activities in the Delhi-NCR and entry of trucks into the national capital in view of an improvement in the air quality and "favourable" meteorological forecast.However, Delhi's air quality turned 'severe' the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-aqi-improves-to-very-poor-category-on-christmas-day-101640413868283.html

25-12-2021||Delhi||Travel trends that satisfied wanderlust in 2021||Extended lockdown, limited social gathering and homestay compelled travel enthusiasts to think beyond and discover their love for travel again. Here are some popular trends from 2021: WorkationAs offices shut down, WFH gave us the freedom to work from anywhere. Many chose to combine work with leisure as they headed to exotic locations. “Workation saw a massive rise among professionals in 2021. With offices and schools shut, guests went to vacation homes with their families. Some of our bookings were extended to six months,” says Devendra Parulekar, founder SaffronStays. As people reported to work online, surrounded by mountains or sitting on a picturesque beach with their laptops, many felt that the soothing touch of nature improved their productivity. Hotels and vacation homes geared up to create remote work spaces by providing high-speed internet service, peaceful workspaces and study areas for children.Revenge Travelling After being locked up in their homes for about a year, people flocked to popular tourist destinations and spent longer time than usual, as if they were settling scores with the coronavirus for inflicting boredom and monotony upon them. There was a deeper urge to explore new destinations and cultures, and unwind with family and friends. Travel became more of a need than desire for people. Sunil Suresh, chief marketing officer, goibibo says, “There was a 45% month-on-month increase in hotel bookings on our site as people opted for quick getaways around New Year.” The trend grew strong over the next few months, with travellers choosing long-duration stays. “As the second wave hit us, summer travel season was washout. But things normalised by the end of June and travellers hit the road with vengeance once again,” says Suresh.Caravan Travelling Caravan travelling came up as one of the top domestic travel trends because of the safety bubble it offered. “Tourism in general went up in the second half of 2021. In this hike, caravan tourism also picked pace quite fast. It served the purpose of social distancing, hygiene and safety along with offering a unique travel experience to people ,” says Jigyasu Joshi,co-founder, Carvaa Travelers. Caravan travelling also provided travellers a lot of freedom and flexibility in their journey. They could relive the charm of a nomadic lifestyle while having access to modern amenities. People could take a halt at their own will, explore quaint locations, enjoy camping near a scenic lake or mountain, cook their own meals, and move ahead at their own pace. And families could also take their pets with them and carry extra baggage without any restrictions.Community Travelling Community-based tourism became a popular concept in 2021 as people had a renewed desire to connect to rural communities and know more about their history, culture, tradition and cuisine. Tourists lived like natives in homestays and took part in farming, cooking, milking cows, taking them for a swim, learning village craft and storytelling. Community tourism tours to remote, unexplored villages in Nagaland, Assam, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh helped people get an authentic insight into local culture, rituals and beliefs. It also helped empower small communities. “In 2021, we noticed that people became more thoughtful and they wanted to use travel to positively contribute to the communities they visited,” says Amanpreet Bajaj, general manager - Airbnb India, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. No Contact Travel Also known as zero contact and contactless travel, this trend became a necessity after the lockdown. From airports to hotels, everyone came up with contactless services to ensure maximum safety. Self-check-in kiosks, contactless identification at security, contactless sanitisation of luggage at airports, hotels offering scanned menus for ordering food and online concierge services gave people the confidence to travel once again. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) was the first airport in India to introduce a QR-code based technology to give passengers contactless check-in experience. This technology allowed passengers to use their own phone to scan the QR code to remotely self-check-in, thus minimising surface contact.

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||After Court Complex blast, Ludhiana railway station gets new scanners, cameras||A day after a blast at the court complex sent ripples across the city, security was finally ramped up at the Ludhiana railway station, which is one of the busiest terminals in the state, on Friday. Soon after the court complex blast, Government Railway Police (GRP) officials headed by additional inspector general (AIG) Pritipal Singh and officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) met to review the security arrangements at the station. In the past, intelligence reports have indicated that the station is on the radar of Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, and a few national rebel groups. Officers were told to keep an eye on the staff, sweepers, porters and vendors at the railway station. “We have been asked to frisk everyone and even keep an eye on the regular staff as anyone can be a member of a terror organisation”, said an officer, requesting anonymity. With security forces at the railway station grappling with shortage of staff, more security personnel from different parts of the state were deputed to Ludhiana. Five GRP personnel from Patiala and 20 RPF personnel have reached the district, while 20 Railway Special Force personnel have reached from Jammu. The security personnel were seen manning and frisking the public at the foot over bridge, which was not done before the blast. Teams of dog squads were seen keeping a strict vigil on every moment. 2 new scanners installedAfter being reprimanded by the AIG over defunct scanners, two new scanners were installed at Gate 1 and 2, respectively, under the supervision of deputy superintendent of police Balram Rana and inspector Jaskaran Singh on Friday. A defunct scanner was repaired and installed at the third entry exit gate of the railway station. However, the security made sure that each passenger entered the platform after getting their luggage scanned through the lone luggage scanner which usually breaks down after getting heated.New cameras orderedA senior official said of the 100 cameras at the railway station, a few are defunct and an order has been given to immediately replace or repair the CCTV cameras. Moreover, the location of a few cameras has been shifted by the GRP for better surveillance at blind spots. Parking shiftedThe parking has been shifted at some distance from Gate 1 and 2. “We do not want to take any chances, and thus the best possible security arrangements have been made at the Ludhiana station. The staff has been instructed to cooperate with security here”, said Tarun Kumar, station director, Ludhiana.
25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Security tightened after Ludhiana court complex blast||It took a bomb blast, and the loss of two lives to rouse the police from its deep slumber and tighten security at the district court on Friday. With the crème de la crème of politics, including Union minister Kiren Rijiju, visiting the spot, the court complex, which was earlier at the mercy of two defunct door-frame metal detectors and a handful of police personnel was turned into a mighty fortress. A four-layered defence was put up in the Mini Secretariat with the police personnel going as far as to scan advocates’ tiffins before allowing them to enter the premises. All advocates, and accused persons being brought to court were frisked before being granted entry. Though courts resumed on Friday, the spot where the bomb exploded was sealed by police personnel and other investigating agencies. All senior officers with the force were deputed at the court complex on security duty.The police have also frisked the accused brought to the court for the hearing. The police allowed very few visitors to enter the court complex who had court hearings on Friday. In most of the cases, advocates appeared in courts on behalf of the litigants. With the courts’ winter vacations, all courts will be closed from Saturday which will give agencies time to investigate. The police also closed some of the entry points to the court complex. With the cops busy probing the blasts, most complainants turning up at the commissioner’s office had to return as most officers were on VVIP duty. Police commissioner, Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, said that security had been beefed up at the court complex and other public places.
25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana Court Complex blast: City on high alert, but no frisking at bus stand||Even though the city was on high alert a day after the explosion at the Ludhiana Court Complex, nothing seemed out of the ordinary at the Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Inter State Bus Terminal on Friday, as travellers were not subjected to checking or frisking. Hundreds of visitors from different districts and states visit the bus stand, but no metal detectors have been installed at the entry points. A lone cop stood sentinel at the entry point, but he let the travellers enter and leave as they pleased without checking their baggage or their person. Some travellers were also spotted entering the bus stand from the rear end, Jawahar Nagar camp side. A passenger, Daljit Singh, said, “The police should not wait for a tragedy or calamity before tightening security, and should make proper security arrangements. Even if there are no intelligence inputs, regular checking should take place to deter people with criminal intentions.” Agreeing, another traveller, Jashandeep, said,”At least, metal detectors should be installed at the entry points. Security cameras should also be installed to keep an eye on suspicious activities.”Station supervisor, Kuljit Singh Sodhi, said, “The cops had carried out a thorough inspection of the bus stand on Thursday evening. A dozen security guards have been deputed at the bus stand, most of whom are ex-servicemen. We are also keeping a lookout on suspicious activities, if any.” Chinks in security at civil hospital, govt offices Though VIP movement has increased at the civil hospital over the last two days , there was no check on visitors and the entry of private vehicles. Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Randhawa, director general of police Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, BJP state president Ashwani Sharma met the injured persons on Thursday, while AAP state president Bhagwant Mann visited the injured on Friday.Despite the Opposition taking digs at the government over the lack of security, there was no check on visitors at the MC’s offices, and civil surgeon office among other places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-court-complex-blast-city-on-high-alert-but-no-frisking-at-bus-stand-101640385202410.html

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University senate to meet after two years on January 8||Even as the elected members from two constituencies are yet to be notified, the Panjab University (PU) senate is scheduled to meet on January 8, 2022, after a gap of two years.Senate’s last meeting was held in December 2019, before the term of the last senate ended in October last year without fresh elections. A meeting notice, issued by PU registrar Vikram Nayyar on Friday, stated that a meeting of the senate will be held on January 8, 2022, at 11am in the senate hall of the university. However, the agenda for the meeting is yet to be announced.The development comes days after 35 members, including 33 elected members, were notified to the senate by Vice-President of India M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the PU chancellor. So far, 71 members, including 36 nominated by the chancellor, have been notified. Six members elected from the constituency of faculties and eight members elected from the constituency of the teachers of affiliated arts colleges are yet to be notified.From both the constituencies, most of the members are from the Goyal group. The group had majority in the previous senate and syndicate as well. The election to the PU senate was held from August this year after a delay of one year. The elections, which began on August 3, were first scheduled in August 2020, but were postponed by vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 are nominated by the Vice-President of India, two are nominated from the Punjab assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected from the eight constituencies. 
25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh municipal corporation elections see 60.7% voter turnout||A sizeable 60.7% of the city’s 6,33,475 lakh voters on Friday sealed the fate of 203 candidates, as voting for the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections concluded peacefully.The voter turnout was highest in the past six elections since 1996, although only marginally higher than the last MC elections in 2016, when it was 59.5%. In the 2011 elections too, the voting percentage hovered around 59%.In the last Lok Sabha elections in the city, in 2019, 73.6% city residents had casted their votes.At 73.31%, ward 1, comprising Sector 47, Blairmajra, and Faidan and Chahar Taraf in Burail, registered the highest voting, while ward 23 (Sectors 34, 35 and 43) recorded the lowest voter turnout at 42.66%.Counting of votes and declaration of results is scheduled on December 27.A total of 212 polling stations were set up in different parts of the city. Among the 694 booths, 220 were declared sensitive. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, a higher number of polling booths were set up. As voting started at 7.30am, little activity was seen. Till 10am, only 12.37% votes were cast. Voting gradually increased over the day, touching 46.9% by 3pm. At the conclusion of voting (5pm), it finally reached 60.7%.The wards comprising villages and rehabilitation colonies witnessed heavy rush of voters, with long queues lasting till the last few hours of voting. At some booths, voters, particularly the senior citizens, complained that there were no facilities for them.In most wards with sectors, voting progressed at a slow pace. Ward 2, which comprises Sectors 1 to 10, saw only 50.8% voting. In comparison, several rural wards logged over 70% polling (see box).Currently, 103 people are suffering from Covid-19 in Chandigarh. Of these, only two came forward to cast their vote. Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “We contacted every patient and asked if they wanted to cast their vote. Only two men from Sector 21 showed interest.” The official said the patients were made to wear PPE Kits and taken to the polling station in an ambulance, during the last 30 minutes of voting.The Aam Aadmi Party alleged multiple instances of bogus voting. Party’s city president Prem Garg said, “In every ward, AAP workers found at least five-six bogus votes being cast. But the actual number can be much higher. We will ask the Election Commission to probe this.” He also complained that the commission didn’t provide the party photo electoral rolls. Congress president Subhash Chawla also claimed that a couple of incidents of bogus voting came to their notice, but added that they wouldn’t impact the election results. Countering AAP’s allegations, BJP’s Chandigarh president Arun Sood said, “These baseless and vague claims are being made only because the party knows that it is losing the election. They have repeatedly made unsubstantial allegations.” Returning to Chandigarh after a year, local MP Kirron Kher cast her vote at Government Model Nursery School, Sector 7. Having missed the election campaign due to her poor health, Kher visited Chandigarh especially for the voting day from Mumbai, where she is undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. While talking to media, Kher said, “The BJP will win the MC elections once again. In our last tenure, we ensured development through various projects. It was Congress leader Pawan Bansal who signed the contract with a private firm to run the garbage processing plant at Dadumajra. We are now cleaning up the mess that Bansal and the Congress made. Now they are trying to put the blame on us.”Kher added, “Bansal should tell what he and the Congress have done for the city rather than misleading people.”Lashing out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Kher said, “AAP wishes to turn Chandigarh into Delhi, while conditions in the capital are extremely poor. They should instead work on making Delhi like Chandigarh.”Covid protocols given the go-byAt most polling booths, especially in colonies, the large voter turnout meant long waiting, which led to many lowering their guard. While some voters gave masks a complete miss, others didn’t wear them properly. Even as social distancing circles were marked, voters were seen clinging on to each other, with little effort by authorities to keep a check. Cops, candidates and polling agents, too, did not set the right example, and were seen crowding and moving around without masks.Elections pass off peacefullyBarring some arguments and face-off between supporters of different parties, the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections passed off peacefully on Friday. A total of 3,700 police personnel were deployed from various units to maintain law and order, especially at the 52 sensitive polling stations and 220 sensitive booths. “No untoward incident was reported and the elections concluded peacefully,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. Protests over ‘irregularities’Protests were staged at two polling stations in Hallomajra and Colony Number 4, Industrial Area, against alleged irregularities during voting on Friday. Shashi Shankar Tiwari, a former Congress leader and currently heading the Azad Front, a group of independent candidates, alleged, “All polling agents, other than those of the BJP, were sent outside from the polling station in Electricity Office, near Colony Number 4 in ward 9 at 4.30pm.”Tiwari alleged that they were let in after 45 minutes following protests by his supporters.At the Hallomajra polling station, the polling agent of an independent candidate left for a while and was not allowed to re-enter. Thereafter, his supporters staged a protest against the election officials. Meanwhile, an official of the Election Commission refuted the allegations.Face off at PU Congress and AAP candidates, Sachin and Chandermukhi Sharma, respectively, had heated arguments on the PU campus after the latter objected to the presence of a large number of Congress supporters near Ankur School. ‘Fake’ voter ID cards: One booked, BLO suspended A day after the AAP alleged distribution of fake voter ID cards in Sector 34, police on Friday registered a case under Sections 419, 170 and 171 of the Indian Penal Code against the accused, Sanjeet Kumar, 34, a resident of Sector 33. Block level officer (BLO) Vasu, who was entrusted with the job of distributing voter ID cards, was also suspended.

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana Court Complex blast:Sukhbir, Mann visit blast victims, seek ex-gratia||Ludhiana A day after the court complex blast, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, and Aam Aadmi Party state chief Bhagwant Mann visited Dayanand Medical College and Hospital to enquire after the persons injured in the explosion, and demanded that the state government cover the hospital bills, and announce an ex-gratia grant for the victims.Berating Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for “politicising the ghastly attack,” Badal said, “Covering hospital bills of the victims, and announcing an ex-gratia grant should be the CM’s priority, rather than playing a blame game. Channi should review the law-and-order situation, instead of meeting top police officers to devise ways and means to frame Akali leaders in false cases.” “What measures has the Congress government taken to identify the culprits and unravel the conspiracy behind the five bomb blasts over the last four months? Had measures been taken in time, the Ludhiana tragedy could have been averted,” he said. He said if the government had acted in time and taken timely measures the Ludhiana tragedy could have been averted. Govt weak, unstable: Mann The AAP state chief also blamed the “weak and unstable” government for the blast and sought a compensation of ₹5 lakh for the victims. “Had the government taken exemplary action in the Bargari sacrilege (2015) and Maur Mandi blast (2017), incidents of sacrilege and Ludhiana Court Complex blast would not have taken place,” said Mann.“What can be expected from home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa who has been accused of seeking a bribe from his colleague to transfer police officers. The state Congress Committee chief, Navjot Singh Sidhu, only raises questions, but does little for the betterment of the masses,” he said. Sessions judge, DC enquire after victims Ludhiana district and sessions judge Munish Singal and deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma met the victims injured in the blast and enquired after their health. Calling the blast an unfortunate incident Singal said, “Luckily, a major tragedy was averted as the blast took place in the restroom. We will beef up security at the complex with the cooperation of the administration and police to avoid a repeat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-court-complex-blast-sukhbir-mann-visit-blast-victims-seek-exgratia-101640384546071.html

Contractors of MC and the railway department have been directed to complete the RUB from Pakhowal road canal bridge towards Sarabha Nagar by December 31. The deadline for the entire project is March 2022. Initiated in December last year, the project has missed several deadlines. Earlier, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had assured that one of the RUBs being constructed from Pakhowal road towards Sarabha Nagar area, would be completed by July but the deadline was put forward to August 31 and then to Diwali. Now, recently the deadline was further extended to January.Commuters facing harrowing timeFor commuters moving towards the Pakhowal road canal bridge from Sarabha Nagar and Hero Bakery Chowk; closure of the stretch has meant taking a detour via the Shastri Nagar Railway Crossing, Model Town Extension, or Cremation Ground Road (Ishmeet Singh Road). The bad condition of Ishmeet Singh road adds to the woes of the commuters.Sabharwal said, “The project got delayed due to the pandemic and railways department had also delayed the work in the past. The work was also put to halt for around three week in November after the main sewer line got damaged and the site turned into a cesspool.”Under the project, a 839.83 metre-long ROB, is being constructed for the movement of traffic from Pakhowal road canal bridge towards the Hero Bakery Chowk.

Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure was imposed by the administration and heavy police was deployed at the bridge during the protest.SAD slams gov over Court Complex blast SAD leaders also slammed the government over the Court Complex blast on Friday, stating that the government failed to act despite alarms raised by Intelligence Bureau and other agencies in the past. SAD leaders led by district president Harbhajan Singh Dang and district president of Youth Akali Dal , Gurdeep Gosha said rather than taking up development of the state, the Congress government is indulging in ‘vendetta politics’ by lodging false FIRs. Senior leaders including MLA Manpret Ayali, former district president Ranjit Dhillon, RD Sharma, Pritpal Pali among others joined the agitation.Gosha said, “The congress government is trying to divert the attention of the public from main issues by lodging false FIRs against SAD leaders. The Congress has failed to take up development. The blast incident in Ludhiana is the sixth such incident in Congress goverment’s tenure and the Congress is again trying to push the state towards the dark days of terrorism. The law and order situation is deteriorating but the government is involved in vendetta politics, which is shameful,” said Gosha.“SAD will continue to raise its voice against the false cases being registered by Congress and further action plan will be chalked out as per the directions received from the state body,” said Dang.Snarled-up trafficMovement of traffic was obstructed on the bridge and Field Ganj area owing to numerous vehicles of SAD leaders and supporters being parked on the bridge.

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Women vote for safety, better facilities at public places||Women voters, who account for over 47% of the total voters in Chandigarh, had safety and facilities at public places on their mind as they exercised their franchise during the civic body polls on Friday. Parminder Kaur, a resident of Sector 40, said, “Even though women account for 48% of the voters, the authorities are doing little to facilitate them. Most of the public parks and roads in the city do not have enough streetlights, making it difficult for women to step out during evening hours. Besides, parks do not have facilities such as open-air gyms and toilets for women.” Kiran Sharma, 73, a resident of Sector 41, said, “My husband and I live alone in a flat on the second floor. Garbage collectors refuse to come to the second floor, due to which we have to climb down the stairs every day. For senior citizens like us, it is a difficult task. Not only this, sweepers don’t even turn up on some days.”Savita Devi, a homemaker residing in Basti Kishangarh, which falls under ward 4, said, “The city definitely lacks maintenance of public infrastructure. Roads need recarpeting while streetlights are also out of order in the area. The newly added area in the MC does not even have a single park and women and children have no place to walk or play. Drinking water is contaminated and sewer lines are blocked. Door-to-door garbage collection is also irregular. Since we are voting for the first time, we expect councillors to provide basic facilities to the people.” Bharti Batra, a resident of Sector 15, said, “My family has always motivated me to vote for the leader I believe in. It is our duty to elect a candidate who can work for the betterment of the city, and not blindly follow political parties. The city has major issues such as cleanliness, parking and welfare schemes, but women’s issues also need to attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-women-vote-for-safety-better-facilities-at-public-places-101640382324049.html
25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Farmers extend protest till December 30||Despite tight security outside the mini secretariat, a day after the court complex blast, farmers continued to protest outside the establishment on Friday, and also extended their protest by five days. Farmers protesting under the banner of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), have extended their protest till December 30, despite the imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). In the wake of the blasts, the protesters have moved out of the mini secretariat. The farmers said that chief minister Charanjit Channi, who had met their representatives in Chandigarh on Thursday had agreed to most of their demands. However, another meeting had been called on December 30 to discuss their key demand for debt waiver. The farmers said the protest will not be lifted until all their demands were actually fulfilled. The farmers had commenced a five-day, 24-hour protest outside the secretariat on December 20, seeking fulfilment of the promises made by the Congress government ahead of the state polls. The demands include debt waiver, compensation for damaged cotton crop, and payment of increased state advisory price (SAP). The farmers are carrying gas cylinders, wheat, vegetables, mattresses and other necessities in their tractors so as to be able to carry on with the siege.The union’s Raikot in-charge Gurpreet Singh said, “The CM has assured us that all our demands, including payment of increased SAP for sugarcane, and compensation for damaged cotton crop, will be fulfilled. However, nothing has been done at ground level yet. The protest will continue day and night till December 30 and further action will be taken on the directions of the state body.”Farmers protest outside bankAccusing the bank authorities of committing a fraud in the name of providing subsidies on farming, farmers also staged a protest outside a bank in Feroz Gandhi Market on Friday.

It also asked the district authorities to take appropriate action to ensure full adherence to the directives.Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Association Traders, however, said that the order was issued without a consensus of the traders. “The administration has imposed odd-even to hide its own failure. Since the order has come late at night, all shops will open on Saturday,” he said.Earlier on Friday, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, said, “We have seen the video… Covid-19 or no Covid-19, the situation is eerie.

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: A problem begging for an end||Children should be in schools, adults at work!Begging should be discouraged at all costs. Children should be in schools while adults should find jobs to support themselves and their families. If the authorities take adequate steps to put all children in schools and create enough jobs, we can certainly tackle this menace. Education up to class 12 must be free of cost. Schools must also have skill development programmes and offer students part-time jobs, so that children don’t turn to begging to fulfill their basic necessities. Ankush Dubey, via emailTax beggarsDecriminalising begging has only increased the problem. Begging is smart work done by clever artists, many of them able-bodied, who even use infants for evoking sympathy. What we have not done is register begging as a service. By doing so, the state can tax the beggars. Many of them earn better than the common man. This will also help keep a check on illegal activities of kidnapping and maiming of children.Gehna Vaishnavi, PanchkulaHelp them find avenues of growthChild begging is a scourge on an educated society. Lack of database about child beggars is one reason for this unending menace. People also give alms to these children out of sheer lack of awareness or religious beliefs. This makes a child beggar continue on the path, instead of exploring other avenues of growth. Remedial action needs to be taken and solutions found. The administration should have a dedicated child helpline number, where public can report child beggars, so that they can be rehabilitated. Rajeev Kumar, ChandigarhEducation and vocational trainingThe menace can be tackled by giving vocational training to the abled-bodied beggars and creating rehabilitation homes for the old and disabled beggars. With regards to child beggars, they must be educated and encouraged to become self-dependent adults. Capt Amar Jeet, KhararStrict policing There should be strict policing to identify and rehabilitate beggars. They must be thoroughly examined by doctors, introduced to personal and public hygiene, and told about the various policies of government for self-employment. NGOs must be roped in to help them pick-up skills. Retired educators should come forward to teach them moral values and dignity of labor. Ramanjit Kaur, via emailHelp them be self-reliantSupport the poor, but by helping them to get educated and become self-reliant. There are several wealthy families and city that can get together to fund counseling sessions for those who getting into begging. Start by first providing them food and shelter and then win their trust and teach them the right way of living.Shubham Dhiman, ChandigarhStart by working to eradicate povertyTo end begging, start by working to eradicate poverty. Of late, begging has become part of an organised crime. Small shelters have to be made to impart skills to beggars, so that they can get themselves some jobs. They should be made to earn their livelihood by working and not begging. Government and NGOs should look after people who are aged and physically challenged. Vineet Gandhi, ManimajraTrack beggars to identify their originsBegging is not an easy option and many with no family or financial support are compelled by their circumstances to get into begging. Beggars need to be tracked to identify their origin and dealt with accordingly. Those with no financial support should be helped to earn a respectable living by gainful employment. Giving out alms will only add the number of beggars.DS Banati, MohaliBan entry of beggars Many squatters throng the City Beautiful to earn easy money. Residents who are in a habit of buying items at traffic lights boost their morale of not giving up begging. The administration must ban the entry of squatters and a verification check should be made. A shelter should be made for beggars, and they should be imparted education apart from providing some vocational.Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Society needs to be compassionate While the sudden appearance of beggars at traffic signals is irritating and risky both for the driver and the beggar, they cannot be done away with as the Indian society needs to be compassionate and is happy with the joy of giving. SC Luthra, ChandigarhAuthorities haven’t made enough effortsNow beggars have become omnipresent, they are present around all religious places, bus stops, railway stations, markets and traffic lights. They disturb the traffic, sometimes even cause accidents. Begging is banned in the city, yet it continues unabated as neither the police department, not the administration or municipal corporation has made concerted efforts to end the menace. Kidar Nath Sharma, ChandigarhSociety needs to introspectSeveral measures have been taken over the years to end the menace of begging, but it continues to prevail. We, as a society, must introspect into why the situation prevails. One can often see the destitute trying to eke out a living by selling small products at lightpoints. Many can also be seen living in jhuggis. We is it that some sections of the society are still deprived of a decent. Kundan Lal Sharma, MohaliNo fear of lawBegging is not an old-age scourge but also a curse for mankind. From the past few years, we have been seeing a lot of begging children in the tricity and its outskirts. The recent incident of attack on a cop who was trying to rescue a child beggar shows that people involved in human trafficking have no fear of police or law. Police should strengthen their informer network so that they can keep a close eye on people involved in human trafficking. Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhNGOs, residents must work togetherThe menace of begging is growing day by day. The administration, NGOs and residents must come together to help beggars get educated and earn a living through employment. Residents also need to form a platform to ensure that the administration doesn’t give up on this campaign.Rajiv Varma, via emailAs responsible citizens, stop giving alms The best way is to abolish the begging is stop giving alms. Police patrolling should be increased in every area to curb the activities of anti-social elements, including human trafficking gangs. Penalise those involved in begging. Provide education opportunities, shelter, healthcare and insurance to the destitute to keep them away from begging. Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurDon’t promote idlersIn Indian mythology ‘daan’ or charity has great significance, and is said to be the path to moksha or salvation. But sadly, in reality, charity only promotes idlers. Begging is a nursery for drug addicts, and criminals. Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhA social menaceBegging is not just a menace but crime. Those who are forced into begging are mostly kidnapped children. If begging is to be wiped out of society, administration must not let the beggars roam around the city. Residents should refrain from giving alms. Opinder Kaur Sekhon,ChandigarhA reflection of gap between rich and poorBeggary is a reflection of the divide between the rich and the poor. It also means governments of the day have failed to provide social security to all its citizens. There should be a law to take care of beggars and a minimum social guarantee for food, medical, education and shelter should be provided by the government. After all, they are also humans!Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhNeed clear roadmap to tackle menaceOn one hand, Chandigarh aims to be a smart city, on the other hand, it is unable to deal with the age-old practice of begging. One can find several beggars, many of them minors, at the traffic lightpoints, near shopping centres, religious places and even in the university. Drug and other nefarious activities are also inter-woven with the menace of begging. The administration must chart out a clear roadmap to tackle the problem. It should start by conducting a survey to ascertain the number of beggars in the city, and then work to rehabilitate them. The administration must also crush the mafia running the begging racket. Col RD Singh (retd), Ambala CanttPunish those encouraging beggarsHuman trafficking rackets are not only ruining the future of the children, but also forcing adults and old agers into beggary. Beggars are a common site at traffic junctions, busy markets and religious places. It is due to the laxity of the social welfare and police departments that the menace prevails. Beggars should be put in shelter homes and provided food and essentials. As members of the public, we can play an important role by not entertaining their demands. There should be punishment against giving anything to beggars. Subhash Chugh, via emailNeed a clear cut law on beggingIndia has no clear cut law on begging and seeking alms was common practice. Times have changed and the need of the hour is to ban begging completely as it puts the lives of public at risk. Authorities. with help of NGOs, and social organisations must set up shelter homes for beggars and provide them vocational rehabilitation training to make them self-occupied. Beggars’ children must be provided free education, uniforms and books to make them self-reliant at par with other children.Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliProsecute those giving out almsA person will beg only if there is any chance of receiving alms. A beggar cannot survive if no one is giving him anything. What authorities do to curb this scourge is that they catch the beggar but no one catches the person who is paying a beggar. I believe society is the main culprit for this unending practice. To bring this menace to end the easiest and most successful way will be to prosecute/fine the people who are giving alms and supporting the beggars. Gaurav Jain, ChandigarhMonitoring needed24x7 monitoring by traffic police and social welfare department officials will prove helpful in putting an end to this old menace. P Mehta, via emailMenace has acquired enormous proportionsBegging, in our nation, has acquired enormous dimensions as a distasteful profession, having been patronised by unreasonable sanction from citizens. Whatever miserable be one’s plight, an aggrieved person is often shy to beg at public places. We do observe in daily life many physically handicapped persons earning money through whatever work they can perform. It’s not the poor but mischievous hard-work shirkers who beg so blatantly. MPS Chadha, MohaliDonate to NGOs that work for needyResidents must stop giving out alms to beggars, and instead give to NGOs that are known to work for the poor and needy. The government authorities must make sure that each citizens is assured of the basic necessities, so that they are not pushed into poverty. For those, who are already trapped in the problem of beggary, authorities must make efforts to teach them skills that can help them gain employment. Strict policing at public places is also needed to curb beggars.Vijay Malia, ChandigarhAccess to job opportunitiesInitiatives taken by the welfare department have failed to check beggars who can be found in crowded markets, outside places of worship and those who go door -to-door on auspicious days like weddings and birthdays. The worrisome part is they train small children to beg. It is a matter of shame that small girls and transgenders are seen begging in trains. It is important to offer paid jobs to able-bodied beggars. Identifying them and knowing their number requires an exhaustive survey. Non-governmental organisations should come forward to collect ration from the residents and supply it at their shelters. Usha Verma, ChandigarhReader of the weekEducation only way to bring children out of beggary We, as a society, need to have a compassionate outlook towards beggars, most of who enter the trade as a result of extreme poverty. There needs to be an organised and committed campaign to end this menace. Education is the only way to bring children out of clutches of beggary. V K Aggarwal, via emailWhat experts sayOrganised racketBegging in India is an organised racket, carried with the help of local criminals. Children from poor families are kidnapped, maimed and forced into begging. The menace prevails largely due to official apathy. APS Shergill, lawyer, Punjab and Haryana high court Two-pronged approach The dept is adopting a two-pronged approach to address child beggary --educating the masses on ill-effects of giving alms and setting up alternative education/skill building systems to pull families away from beggary. Nitika Pawar, secretary, social welfare department AwarenessMarket associations must put up posters asking customers not to give money to child beggars. Sometimes the beggars also snatch things from customers. But unless the administration and police don’t play a proactive role in implementing the ban, things won’t improve. Neeraj Bajaj, president, Business Promotion Council, Sector 17, Chandigarh Discourage the practice I urge people not to give any money to beggars as it encourages child trafficking. Police must appoint a nodal person for each area and responsibility must be fixed to rescue child. Parents who send children for begging must be penalised and these children must be taught useful skills and enrolled in schools. Harjinder Kaur, CCPCR chairperson RehabilitationPeople move to cities in search of jobs, but due to non-availability of jobs, many are forced to sell or send their children for begging. Covid has also aggravated the miseries of poor families. The authorities must make efforts to rehabilitate such children.

25-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The way we were||Those white houses are gone. See the photo to know how they looked like. This site is now a levelled ground.There used to be a straight row of seven homes. Painted in white, they resembled miniature, single-storey bungalows, like a Lutyens’ Delhi doll house. The residences were symmetric. A cement yard ran along the entire length. Railway tracks ran behind it. The tracks are still there.The houses were part of the so-called railway colony in Gurugram, and were allotted to railway employees. The station is nearby. This afternoon, a group of railway employees are huddled around a table in the station’s backyard. One of them says the houses were razed “around 5-6 months ago”.The housing gave this part of the world a sense of orderliness and also a feel of fine aesthetics. It was as if it were designed to permeate the daily existence of its inhabitants. The soothing simplicity was in dissonance with the chaotic architecture generally encountered in the Delhi region.The island of subdued architectural elegance is now history.During a visit to the area just before the pandemic started in early 2020, this reporter was able to see the houses. It was a sunny winter morning. Many residents were sitting outside on their respective porch.One of them, Vinod Kumar — a “senior technician blacksmith” — had compared the colony to “swarg” (paradise). Each house, he explained, had two rooms, with a porch in the front and a courtyard in the back. Revealing that most dwellers preferred to lounge on the front porch than in the much more private courtyard, Mr Kumar reasoned that “out here, you feel the openness, and time passes quickly as you see people coming and going”.The disappeared houses faced a row of newer (still existing) mustard-green, multi-storey apartment blocks. Gazing towards the flats that morning, Mr Kumar had said that the same kind of white houses had once stood there, too. “Our side also will be demolished to make way for such flats,” he had observed. A part of that prophecy has come true.If you think of it, these multi-storey buildings are able to accommodate more households on the same acres. This afternoon, a woman is standing in one of the lower balconies. She looks surprised at the mention of white houses. “We moved in two months ago… no idea about them.”All isn’t lost, though. One of those seven houses — the first one — is still standing. It’s vacant but intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-way-we-were-101640381537975.html
25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala admn to come up with complete tourist circuit||To make Ambala a tourist destination, the district administration has started the documentation work for places of interest and historical significance in the twin towns. As per officials, a complete circuit will be prepared for tourists.Ambala, situated almost in the middle of NH-44, connects the national capital to Amritsar and also shares its border with Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh. Therefore, it is often a stop for travellers, who commute through the twin towns – Cantonment and City, that are full of destinations as old as 400 years.Officials said that till now, six destinations from Cantonment have been selected to add to the directory after the documentation is completed by the authorities concerned. These include St Paul’s Church, Holy Redeemer Church, Rani Ka Talaab, Marthoma Syrian Church, Heritage Mess and Sirhind Club.In the city, places like Old Cloth Market, Guru Gobind Singh Library in Queen Victoria Hall, Navrang Rai Talab and Mahavir Park are expected to make it to the list. Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Sachin Gupta, who is overseeing the initiative, said, “Projects like Subhash Park, under-construction 1857 war memorial, science centre and other important sites will also be added to the list to create an ecosystem for tourism.”During an event last week, Haryana home minister Anil Vij had said that the directory will help the tourists identify the sites they can visit in terms of their historical importance and specifications.“The list will also be uploaded online, so that foreigners or Indians living abroad could plan their visit to these places easily,” said Vij, who is also the MLA from Ambala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-admn-to-come-up-with-complete-tourist-circuit-101640381182322.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||All adults in Delhi have taken at least one Covid vaccine jab||All eligible residents of the national capital have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a significant achievement for Delhi that comes amid concerns of the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2, and a landmark that experts said may help the city soften the effects of any future Covid-19 surge.In a tweet on Friday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said all of the Capital’s 14.83 million eligible adults have been inoculated with at least the first dose.The chief minister hailed the efforts of the city’s health care and front line workers, who played a key role in achieving this target.“Delhi completes first dose to 100% eligible people - 148.33 lakh. Salute to Doctors, ANMs, Teachers, ASHAs, CDVs and all other Frontline workers. Congratulations to DMs, CDMOs, DIOs and all district functionaries,” Kejriwal tweeted on Friday.Over 10.5 million in Delhi have been completely vaccinated.Delhi has a population of roughly 20 million people, of whom about five million are children, and are still beyond the net of Covid-19 vaccinations. The adult population figures are according to a November estimate of voters in Delhi by the Election Commission.To be sure, Delhi is not the first state or Union territory to cover all its adults with the first dose of a vaccine. Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Goa have also administered first doses to all of their adults, among states in the country. Among UTs, Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Jammu & Kashmir and Chandigarh have earlier hit this milestone.The vaccination milestone for Delhi comes 343 days after the national Covid-19 immunisation programme kicked off on January 16, and coincides with an uptick in the city’s infection caseload over the past few days.Delhi on Friday added 180 cases of Covid-19, the largest single-day spike since June 16, when the city logged 212 infections, showed data from the state government’s daily health bulletin. In the past seven days, the city added an average of 116 cases each day.The fresh infections on Friday came at a test positivity rate of 0.29%, the highest since June 14.The rate of vaccinations in Delhi has picked up significantly since news of the highly transmissible Omicron variant emerged globally on November 25.In the seven days ending November 25, Delhi administered an average of just over 33,420 first vaccine doses. This number went up to nearly 36,800 in the week ending December 2, then shot up to 50,446 seven days later.Roughly two weeks since then, this number has dipped, but likely because the number of unvaccinated residents in the city began to shrink.To be sure, a proportion of these vaccines will have been administered to residents of other cities, especially those in the National Capital Region.The city’s peak of single-day first doses came on June 26, when it administered 172,755 shots, showed data from the CoWin dashboard.So far, over 1.44 million people in the city have been infected with Covid-19, of whom 25,103 have succumbed to the illness, according to state government data.A district immunisation officer said the pace of vaccinations was slow initially because people were concerned about potential side effects, but picked up as these concerns were allayed. “I would like to appeal to those whose second dose is pending to come forward and get it on time,” said the officer.Experts said the complete vaccine coverage among the city’s adults will help check the severity of any future Covid-19 wave, if any.“Vaccines don’t stop any wave. Singapore would not have witnessed such a massive wave of cases despite 100% vaccination. But vaccines check the severity of infections and deaths due to it. Now that Delhi has inoculated 100% population with first dose of Covid vaccine, it can reduce the impact of the next wave and there will be fewer deaths,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-adults-in-delhi-have-taken-at-least-one-covid-vaccine-jab-101640380545958.html

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Amidst Omicron threat, tourists rush to Himachal for festivities||Even as the Omicron threat looms large, tourists are rushing to Himachal in hordes to celebrate Christmas and New Year while throwing all the pandemic norms to the wind. Most hotels in the major tourist towns are full to capacity with an increase in the footfall from neighbouring, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi. What makes the situation even grave is that the state government hasn’t yet ordered any restriction given Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mandi rally on December 27 to mark the Jai Ram Thakur’s four years in office. More than one lakh people are expected to attend the rally which may also trigger a new spurt. “Tourists are rushing to Shimla and other hill resorts. As of yet, no booking has been cancelled, as the state hasn’t yet reported the Omicron variant. The influx is huge as there has been a snow forecast on Christmas in the state,” said Rajender Singh, a hotelier who has units in Shimla, Manali and Kasauli. “We are adhering to the Covid-19 protocol in our hotels and expect a good business in days to come,” he said, admitting that the fear of new variant remains but also people in the state have been fully vaccinated which reduces the chances of infection. Meanwhile, tourists say they were expecting great fun as snowfall would likely occur on the festive days despite the virus threat. While some say they would follow the norms others were of the opinion that they were now fed up with the theory and wanted to enjoy to the full. “We are very excited as there is a snowfall forecast. Yes, there are concerns regarding the Omicron variant but we have taken both the doses of vaccination and would strictly follow whatever norms put in place by the government,” said Vanshika Tiwari, a tourist from Maharashtra. Priyam, a tourist from Nagpur, said he was happy to be in Shimla to enjoy Christmas and New Year. Part of a group of travellers, Priyam said people were fed up with the Covid-19 theory and many several of them have stopped adhering to the norms. Those who are solely dependent on tourism says it is time to earn some extra bucks. “We no more fear the pandemic. We have already suffered a lot and this time around we hope to cover our losses that occurred in the last two years,” said Maqsood, who works as a porter. Meanwhile, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that directions have been issued to the authorities to implement the Covid-19 protocol in the state. He said the state has fully vaccinated the 100% legible population of the state and this will help prevent the spread. The Himachal Pradesh tourism industry is worth ₹12,000 crore and contributes 7% to the SGDP besides creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs. Before Covid-19, nearly 2 crore tourists visited Himachal.Covid-19 dealt a blow to the tourism industry in 2020 as the number of visitors dropped to 32 lakh. As per data available with the tourism department, there were about 6,000 registered hotels, homestays and guest houses in the state. In 2019, more than 1.72 crore tourists, including 38,28,76 foreigners, visited the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amidst-omicron-threat-tourists-rush-to-himachal-for-festivities-101640379989110.html

He also flayed the BJP for spending a large amount of money on government functions across the state. “The Prime Minister describes Himachal as his second home and we respect his sentiments and feelings, but chief minister Jai Ram Thakur should explain to the people what he got for the state,” said Chauhan, claiming that a majority of the promises that were made in the BJP’s vision document were incomplete. He said Union minister for road transport and shipping Nitin Gadkari announced ₹60,000 crore for national highways in the state but there is nothing on the ground. He had promised to construct 59 highways, but there is nothing.“To attract industries to the state, the first global investors’ meet was organised in the presence of the Prime Minister in 2019 in which investment MoUs worth ₹96,000 crore were signed. The government had announced that it will provide jobs to one lakh people but the reality is otherwise,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-cm-jai-ram-thakur-s-tenure-a-failure-congress-101640379987814.html
25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Farooq Abdullah: Will approach Supreme Court against Delimitation Commission proposals||National Conference president Farooq Abdullah has said they will approach the Supreme Court against the draft proposal of the Delimitation Commission.The commission in its draft proposal had told five associate membersUnion minister Jitendra Singh, NC chief Farooq Abdullah, NC MP Mohammad Akbar Lone, NC MP Hasnain Masoodi and BJP MP Jugal Kishore Sharma on Monday in New Delhi that they have proposed six seats for Jammu and one for Kashmir.They also proposed reserving nine seats for Scheduled Tribes and seven for Scheduled Castes, a first in the union territory.If the proposal is cleared, the total number of poll constituencies will rise from 83 to 90, with 43 in the Jammu region and 47 in Kashmir. In the current state House, Jammu has 37 members and Kashmir has 46.“When we went to the commission, my partner Member of Parliament Hasnain Masoodi put before them (commission) that we have sent a letter which you have not replied in which we have said the matter is pending before the SC, therefore, this exercise you are doing is illegal,” NC president Farooq Abdullah told Karan Thapar in an interview.Abdullah said first of all the chairman of the commission said they haven’t seen the letter. “Probably, the letter has been kept away from them or her,” said Abdullah who was present when associate members were shown draft proposal by the commission in tabulated form.”Abdullah further said: “The chairman of the commission agreed that whatever the SC will say will be binding on us.” “But she said I have the mandate from the government and Parliament and I am fulfilling that mandate. If the SC comes with suggestions, we have to go by the SC verdict,” Abdullah said.The NC president said they are going to the Supreme Court. “We are going to the Supreme Court any way that delimitation commission work is a breach of the SC. We are going to go the way they (commission) are going about it and if they have taken population then Kashmir should get more seats. Why is it that they have given us only one seat, that too in the Kupwara region. What about other places,” Abdullah told Thapar.Abdullah, who is a Parliament member from the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat, said both Srinagar and Jammu have grown and got more seats. “Srinagar in itself has grown so much or in Jammu, there is a place called Gandhi Nagar where the population has grown so much they should have got another seat.”He said there are others who feel there should have been reserved seats for them. “There are so many others like the Kashmiri Pandits feel they should have seats.”The NC president and former chief minister hoped that the SC will do justice to them.“We hope that the SC will do justice. Let’s see what the SC says once it takes its direction then we can take another step,” he said.Farooq Abdullah said the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) had already made it clear that they don’t agree with the decision of the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farooq-abdullah-will-approach-supreme-court-against-delimitation-commission-proposals-101640379985371.html

The 13 villages — Behlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas — were taken over by the civic body in December 2018, after which the number of wards in MC were increased from 26 to 35 by the UT administration, solely to incorporate the,.

Though not openly, but residents of these villages said that they have the year-long farmer protests in mind. “Nothing much seemed to change ever since we were included under MC, but I am hopeful that we may get some respite from the choked drains that overflow on the narrows lanes of the village,” said Satnam Singh, a resident of Sarangpur village. Dhanas resident Jitender Kumar, said, “Cattle dung is dumped all over the village, and we talk of improving Swacchata rankings.

25-12-2021||Other||Channi playing cheap politics on Ludhiana blast: Sukhbir||Jagraon/Moga Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday challenged Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to either give evidence linking the Ludhiana bomb blast to his political rivals’ or apologise to the public for playing cheap politics. “Channi should not play politics on such a sensitive issue, as this could destroy peace and communal harmony in the state,” he told media persons after addressing a rally in support of SR Kaler in Jagraon and Baldev Singh Manuke in Nihal Singh Wala on Friday. On Thursday, at a rally in Mullanpur Dakha, the CM had pointed fingers at Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia for the Ludhiana blast. Channi had asked the gathering to question as to why these incidents had happened after Majithia’s booking in a drugs case. Retorting to this, Sukhbir on Friday said that it did not behove the CM to make such allegations, even after he had registered a false case against him (Majithia). “It seems Channi has lost his mental balance. In case he has any evidence linking any Akali leader with any such heinous crime, he should make the evidence public immediately. If he cannot do that, then he should issue a public apology for trying to politicise the tragedy,” Sukhbir said, adding that five more blasts had taken place in the state over the past four months. He said the CM must give a status report of the probe into all these incidents. “It is clear that the government has been caught napping. It has been busy trying to frame its political rivals and given a field day to anti-national forces to disturb the state’s peace,” he alleged. Warning officers that all false cases would be probed by a commission, if the SAD-BSP alliance government was voted to power, action would also be initiated against those who were responsible for filing the false cases. He also accused Channi and Punjab home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa of not taking the recent sacrilege bids seriously. In Moga, he alleged that the Congress government had done nothing in Punjab except politicising sacrilege and drug issue. “Nothing new has come up in Punjab over the past five years. Navjot Singh Sidhu is demanding capital punishment for culprits of the sacrilege incident. I am daring him to demand it for the ‘Gandhi’ family; Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar.”Sacrilege bid a Cong conspiracy: ChandumajraPatiala Senior vice-president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra has alleged that the sacrilege attempts at the Golden Temple at the Ludhiana bomb blast was a deep-rooted conspiracy of the Congress party. “The Congress is trying to create chaos and distract people’s attention from real issues. The sacrilege attempt is another example of the party’s conspiracy,” he alleged, adding, “The SIT constituted by the state government, regarding the Darbar Sahib incident was not acceptable to the SAD, therefore the incident should be investigated by a sitting judge of the high court,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/channi-playing-cheap-politics-on-ludhiana-blast-sukhbir-101640377701858.html
25-12-2021||Gurugram||Cops ensure peace during Friday namaz in Gurugram amid conflict on prayers||Namaz was offered peacefully for the first time in the past several months despite attempts by vigilantes to disrupt prayers at some places in Gurugram, which has been at the centre of a bitter conflict over Friday prayers offered in the open.Muslim groups, however, congregated at only six public places that were jointly identified by Hindu-right wing groups and Imam Council of Gurgaon. A group of people did try to disrupt the namaz congregation near Shankar Chowk, Udyog Vihar, and Tau Devi Lal Park in Sector 22, but were turned away by police. Police also detained some right-wing group members, who were let go after the situation was under control. Rajiv Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said that they controlled the situation, did not let anyone create any ruckus, and that namaz was offered peacefully. Hindu right-wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram for the last three years. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, last month, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing groups and locals continued to protest and disrupt prayers. Muslims, however, have maintained that they were forced to use public spaces since there were not enough mosques in the city. On December 10, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said offering namaz at public places cannot be tolerated, even as the district administration withdrew permission for Friday namaz at 20 designated sites amid protests by members of Hindu outfits who parked vehicles and organised programmes to prevent Muslims from offering namaz. Meanwhile, a group led by Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor to Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti (SHSS), an umbrella organisation of Hindu bodies leading the protests against namaz in open spaces, filed two separate complaints at the Sector 29 and Udyog Vihar police stations demanding a complete ban on Friday prayers in open areas. “Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has given a statement in the assembly saying no namaz will be allowed in open areas. Earlier in Gurugram, the CM had said that namaz in public will not be tolerated. Police and administration should work in view of these statements,” said Kulbhushan Bharadwaj, adding that in his view namaz in open area was a means of “jihad” and a show of strength. Unlike the past two weeks, when Muslims gathered at multiple designated places (which were later withdrawn by the Haryana government) to offer prayers, this Friday they come together at only six places -- two spots in Udyog Vihar, Sector 42-Golf Course Road, Sector 40, Sector 69, and Sector 29.Gurugram district has around 500,000 Muslims, of whom around 150,000 offer namaz on Fridays, said officials.A small group of Muslims gathered in the morning in an open area at Sector 40, but were asked to return by the police. Some Muslim groups claimed that the land belongs to them, but failed to produce papers to prove that, even as some locals contended that the land was reserved for the construction of school. Mufti Ahmad Salim Qasmi — president of the Gurugram unit of Jamiat Ulama and member of Gurgaon Muslim counsil — said that they have been offering namaz at the Sector 40 spot for the past two weeks. “The place has a makbara (tomb) and in our records it is a kabristan (graveyard). Today we had no paper, we will check with the revenue officials and verify the land records,” said Qasmi, adding that they don’t want any confrontation. Praveen Yadav, a member of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, who has been leading the protest against Friday namaz in Sirhaul, Sector 37, Sector 22 and Udyog Vihar, said nobody will be allowed to offer prayers in the open across the city. “Even after the CM announced the authorities are still not taking any action against those who are coming to offer namaz in public. The matter has been under control because of us as we are still giving chances but now this is getting too much and we will not let them enter parks and public spaces,” he said. Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson of the Gurgaon Muslim Council, who approached the apex court on the namaz issue last week, said the intention of right-wing group was not just to stop Juma Nama (Friday namaz) in Gurugram but to remove the Muslim identity altogether from public places. He said that (SHSS) president Mahaveer Bharadwaj was emboldened after returning back from a “Dharma Sansad” in Haridwar (against which cases alleging hate speech have been filed), and alleged that he was calling for a conversion of Muslims to Hindus.“Could a similar thing be tolerated if Muslims or any other minority community would have given a call for conversion?” he asked.Bhardwaj called the allegations “baseless”. “We will continue to fight this issue and not let anyone offer namaz in the open, apart from identified sites which are yet to be decided,” he said.

Recently, chief of Congress’ Punjab unit and Harbhajan’s former India teammate Navjot Singh Sidhu posted a picture with him on Twitter and captioned it “picture loaded with possibilities”. This led to speculation of him joining the party. The cricketer said that he hasn’t yet taken a call on the matter. “Frankly speaking, I don’t know what’s in store for me. I just want couple of days to figure out in which direction I would like to move. Yes, I want to give back to society,” Harbhajan told PTI in an interview when asked about his future plans. “If I join politics, how and in what form, I need to figure those things out as main aim is to help people if I at all take the plunge,” he added. While he didn’t want to speak about it openly, but people in the know said that there is very little chance that he will be fight the Punjab state assembly elections because of some cricketing and media commitments that would keep him busy. The feisty former player said he would not want his association with the game to end completely with retirement. “As far as cricket is concerned, I will remain associated with the game. I am open to coaching, mentoring IPL sides, may be play a bit of veteran’s cricket,” he said. There is a high possibility that Harbhajan might work as a mentor with Kolkata Knight Riders or Mumbai Indians, where he had 10 eventful years as a cricketer. He is also working on his autobiography, which will be hitting the stands in the next six months. “Oh yes, I have nearly completed my autobiography. It would be out in next six months and it’s my tell-all story as to how I have seen Indian cricket as an insider. Hope people love that book as much as they loved me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/need-to-think-about-many-factors-before-i-decide-on-joining-politics-harbhajan-101640377101770.html

Efficient and honest police officers will be given important postings so that a peaceful atmosphere is created,” he said, addressing a rally at Hanuman Chowk in Gurdaspur. He claimed there will be no interference of any MLA or political leader in the working of the state police.“Copies of FIRs registered in police stations will not be sent to the houses of the MLAs concerned. Former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had conducted probe in Bargari sacrilege incident, but his report was not taken seriously. If he was allowed to work without any interference and with honesty, there would have been no more incidents of sacrilege in Punjab. Honest police officers are not given important postings,” Kejriwal alleged.As his second promise, Kejriwal said all important cases, including Bargari sacrilege and the cases of bomb blasts, will be probed thoroughly. As his third promise, Kejriwla claimed that the border security will be intensified.“We will protect the border so that no terrorist would enter in the state. We will also ensure that there would be no smuggling of drugs from across the border,” he said.“We will provide the best technology to the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Punjab police to tackle the threat of drones being used for smuggling of narcotics and weapons from across the border. During our government’s tenure, the BSF and police will not face any problem while gunning down the drones,” Kejriwal said, adding that his 5th promise was the creation of a separate police force to protect all gurdwaras, deras, temples and masjids of Punjab.“I was saddened after hearing the news of Ludhiana bomb blast. Why do such incidents happen before elections. Those who committed sacrilege in 2015 are still roaming freely and no justice has been done in the past more than five years. If the masterminds of 2015 sacrilege had given strict punishment, there would be no incident of sacrilege,” he claimed.He claimed that if voted to power, the AAP government would free the state of the drug menace in six months. “If people want good schools in Punjab, they should vote for us. Teachers of Punjab also want to change the atmosphere of Punjab schools, but the government is not supportive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-kejriwal-s-five-promises-for-state-security-policing-and-tackling-drugs-101640377044204.html

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Cong screening committee to seek suggestions from members individually||Chandigarh : The Congress screening committee, constituted for the selection of candidates for the upcoming elections in Punjab, has decided to seek suggestions from its members one by one, raising eyebrows in party circles. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Ajay Maken, who heads the screening committee, told the panel members present in the meeting held in Delhi on Friday night to give their suggestions individually in a day or two, party leaders familiar with the development said. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and state campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar and some central leaders were among those who attended the meeting, whereas chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary were not present. Chaudhary said the panel would meet the members one by one and he was not supposed to be there in today’s meeting. The meeting held in the party’s ‘war room’ at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, was wound up quickly. “We brainstormed on the strategy. This process will carry on. Nothing has been decided on seats so far,” Maken told reporters after the meeting. Though panel members were tight-lipped on the reasons behind the move to meet leaders one by one to seek their suggestions on ticket allocation, a party leader said there was something amiss, indicating that this could be linked to internal feud in the party. Both Channi and Sidhu are not on the same page on several issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-cong-screening-committee-to-seek-suggestions-from-members-individually-101640376442087.html

Rijiju said central and state agencies are already conducting an in-depth probe into the incident that left one person dead and six injured, prompting the Punjab government to declare a high alert. Police suspect that the man killed in the blast on the second-floor washroom was trying to assemble or plant the explosive device. “I had a detailed meeting with the law enforcement agencies trying to probe the case and we shall be reaching a conclusion in the case soon. I have not come here due to any political reasons but purely to convey a message to the people of Punjab that we are really worried and the incident is being thoroughly probed,” he said. He also conveyed empathy and support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the blast victims and the people of Punjab. Rijiju said he had spoken to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and it was decided that the central and state agencies will jointly probe the matter. The Centre and the state should have one voice on such sensitive issues, Rijiju said. In reply to a question that some political leaders in poll-bound Punjab were speaking in different voices on this incident, Rijiju said, “It is unfortunate, we are responsible people. We should speak responsibly. Politics should be the last resort.” Rijiju added that such an unfortunate incident should not be diluted with politics. “We should not spin other issues around an incident of such grave nature,” he said, while referring to the statement made by the CM on Thursday that Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia could be behind the blast. Rijiju was accompanied by Union minister of state Som Prakash and National Commission for Scheduled Castes chairperson Vijay Sampla. They also met the injured blast victims in hospital. Rijiju also held an interaction with the district and sessions judge and lawyers regarding the security arrangements and said that the security system in courts across the country will be revamped. He said the safety and security of the judiciary and judicial complexes is the central government’s top priority. Review committees are already in place, said the minister, adding that he would also hold talks with the Chief Justice of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rijiju-visits-ludhiana-court-blast-site-asks-punjab-govt-to-act-responsibly-101640376204771.html

Those displaying illegal advertisements have been given three days by the MCG to remove their advertisements. After this, action will be taken to remove illegal advertisements, and violators will be fined and FIRs will be registered against them,” said Sharma.The Haryana Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1989, carries a fine of up to ₹10,000 and imprisonment for up to six months.The additional commissioner said that illegally placing advertisement material on public property, electric poles, public walls, and roadsides is a punishable offence and they not only make the city look dirty but also obstruct the view of traffic signals and cause a distraction while driving.“The entire approval process for advertisements is online. Those wishing to display advertisements can apply for it by visiting the outdoor media management portal on MCG’s official website www.mcg.gov.in,” said Sharma.MCG officials also said that on average a one-kilometre stretch of road in the city has at least 50-60 illegal advertisements. They further said that the rationale behind the drive is to also increase the civic body’s annual revenue through the issuance of licenses for displaying advertisements.Last year in December, the MCG had cleared over 1,600 illegal advertisements and registered FIR against 80 people for defacement in a three-day drive.“Most hoardings, advertisements bear the contact number either on the front or on the back of the poster. Through this, we track down the violators and take action against them. If we find a repeat offender then we send an email to the closest police station to register an FIR against the person, otherwise, first-time offenders have to pay fines to the MCG,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.Last month, the MCG had prepared an action plan to tackle the issue of illegal advertisements in the city, and also formed a demolition team for the purpose, said officials.

The case, however, was dismissed by the Supreme Court on July 19 this year.Justice Ramana, who took over as the CJI on April 24, came to the Telugu states on June 11 and was accorded rousing reception in Hyderabad by the Telangana government led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.He also visited Tirupati to have a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara on Tirumala, but the Andhra Pradesh chief minister conveniently avoided calling on the CJI. Instead, he was received by two local MLAs and TTD Trust Board chairman Y V Subba Reddy.However, this time, the Jagan government decided to extend cordial welcome to Justice Ramana, who landed in Andhra Pradesh on a three-day visit on Friday. A rousing welcome was arranged for the CJI on his arrival to his native village Ponnavaram in Krishna district in the morning.On behalf of the chief minister, his senior cabinet colleague Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, besides MLAs M Jaganmohan Rao and Vasantha Krishna Prasad and MLC M Arun Kumar received Justice Ramana and accompanied him to the village, where he was felicitated by the local people and legal fraternity.On Sunday, the CJI would attend a series of programmes in Vijayawada and Amaravati, including addressing a judicial officers’ conference at Acharya Nagarjuna University and high court bar association at Amaravati, besides returning to Hyderabad.

When the local civic body officials initiated action and issued lock and seal and demolition notices, they moved the high court challenging the same. Sensing the mood of the court that it was likely to dismiss the petitions, they indulged in ‘forum shopping’ by filing applications before some other court. The bench, however, dismissed the petitions as devoid of merits, last week.What prompted the bench to chide the IAS officers was the alleged non-implementation of the earlier orders of the bench and the inordinate delay on their part in disposing of the applications of the petitioners against the demolition notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ias-officers-should-be-shown-the-door-if-they-don-t-comply-with-court-orders-madras-hc-101640375602958.html

Bhupendra Mishra, in-charge of Gejha police check post, said the victims’ family members informed police about the matter on Friday morning. Sher Singh (65) told police that his two-year-old granddaughter Prachi, and his tenant’s six-year-old daughter Yashu and son Divyansh (8) were sitting near a bonfire in their house on Thursday evening. “The tenants had lit the bonfire as it was cold and later, they got busy in some household chores.

The three children were rushed to a private hospital in Noida’s Sector 110, where doctors referred them to Safdarjung Hospital. Mishra said Prachi died on Thursday evening while Yashu succumbed to her burn injuries on Friday. “The family members informed police on Friday as the hospital refused to hand over the bodies. We then facilitated the process and reached the spot to investigate the matter,” he said. The two bodies were handed over to the family members after a post-mortem was performed. Police said Divyansh is stable and is undergoing treatment at the hospital in Delhi.

25-12-2021||Bangalore||Only 10% of winter session time spent on northern Karnataka: Speaker||Out of the 52 hours of total business conducted in the Karnataka legislative assembly in the ongoing winter session, just around 10% of it was dedicated towards discussing problems of northern districts, defeating one of the main reasons for holding the winter session in Belagavi, about 505 km from Bengaluru.According to Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, the assembly speaker, out of the total 52 hours of business between December 13 and 24, only 5.45 hours were dedicated to discussing northern Karnataka.“If we are conducting the session in Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belagavi and if no time is given to discuss the problems of north Karnataka, it shows that they (BJP) are enemies of the region,” Siddaramaiah, the Congress’s leader of the opposition said on Friday.He said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had called for the session just to pass bills and not to discuss problems of the region or development of the state.The statements come at a time when the growth gap between the northern and southern parts of the state, which could not be more different from each other, continues to widen, alienating the region which has within it some of the most underdeveloped, arid and backward districts in the country.The southern regions of Karnataka have traditionally been more prosperous and have a bigger influence on state politics and policy.Among other reasons, the decision to construct a second seat of power in the border district of Belagavi in 2007 was to discuss problems of the region which have seldom received the attention it deserves. The region has in the past also demanded separate statehood.AS Patil (Nadahalli), the Congress legislator from Devar Hippargi in Vijayapura, made a passionate speech in the assembly saying all statements on speaking about north Karnataka were just “lip talk (service)”.“There is Kittur-Karnataka, Kalyana-Karantaka, Mumbai-Karnataka, coastal-Karnataka, central-Karnataka, Mysuru-Karnataka, Bengaluru-Karnataka...when will we become united,” he said.“When KAS, KPSC exams take place, everyone is expected to compete. How will you facilitate competition? Your children, my children and those of the rich study in St Mary School and Bishop Cottons. The children of poor study in government schools. How will they compete,” he added.The naming of Basavaraj Bommai as the chief minister in July helped assuage some of the anger of people from the region as the former is from the northern parts. But his own party members expressed their dissatisfaction at the lack of time spent on north Karnataka.“The discussions that have happened have not been satisfactory. There were some discussions on irrigation projects but not enough was done on getting basic amenities, development, education, employment industries and other issues concerning north Karnataka,” BC Patil, Karnataka’s minister for agriculture said on Friday.He added that it was the Congress who wasted time on discussing unwanted topics and not allowing the house to function.Regional imbalances in Karnataka have only grown over the years irrespective of the party in power that has forced successive governments to dedicate more resources for healthcare and infrastructure in India’s technology capital while leaving other parts of the state largely underdeveloped. The push to divert investments to other parts of the state has not materialised. More so because corporations are keen on remaining close to the ecosystem in Bengaluru and not be disadvantaged due to the distance from the capital or the lack of infrastructure in other underdeveloped parts just for cheaper land.The per-capita income of the region was ₹128,761 in 2018-19 as against Bengaluru which stands at ₹301,748.The Kalaburagi division which covers the Kalyana-Karnataka region, home to six of the most backward districts in the country, at ₹114,133, according to the 2020-21 economic survey of Karnataka.The per capita income of the Mysuru division stands at ₹205,829 and ₹156,729 in Bengaluru rural (not including Bengaluru city), according to data provided in the economic survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/only-10-of-winter-session-time-spent-on-northern-karnataka-speaker-101640375481840.html
25-12-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka: BJP dithers to table anti-conversion bill||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka on Friday held back tabling of the contentious anti-conversion bill in the upper house of the state legislature, delaying a law it considers key to its core ideology. With barely a day to go in the legislative council before the end of the winter session in Belagavi, about 505 km from Bengaluru, the BJP decided against tabling the bill after managing its passage in the assembly despite stiff opposition on Thursday. “There was not enough time for discussions on the bill so we decided against it,” said a BJP legislator, requesting not to be named. He added that the BJP will get the bill passed in the joint session of the legislature likely to be held in the first quarter of the next year. The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021 or anti-conversion bill has become one of the more controversial legislations proposed by the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government that has been accused of trying to polarise the population with laws meant to divide people. Since the idea of such a bill was first mooted during the monsoon session, there has been a spate of attacks against the Christian community across several regions in the state. The BJP has been trying to introduce laws in line with its core beliefs and in line with its ideological parent, RSS, like the anti-cattle slaughter bill and the special marriages act which the right wing calls ‘love jihad’. Senior BJP leaders said the special marriages provision has been partially included in anti-conversion bill. The BJP is also looking to consolidate some of its core support base under the larger umbrella of Hindu and Hindutva in a political climate that is caste-centric. The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), the two main opposition parties in the state, had opposed the tabling and passing of the bill in the assembly. Despite winning higher number of seats in the December 10 MLC polls, the BJP is still short of one vote to get the contentious anti-conversion bill passed in the council when they decide to table it next. “We are just one short of the magic number (38) and the likes of Lakhan Jarkiholi (Independent) will help passing the bill,” the legislator cited above said. The BJP fell short of securing a majority and gaining control in the upper house of the Karnataka legislature which would force the saffron outfit to continue its dependence on outside support for passage of key and contentious bills. The BJP won 11 out of the 25 seats that went to the polls on December 10 which now takes its tally to 37--one short of the halfway mark in the 75-member house. Though the Congress did see an overall reduction in its tally in the upper house, the national outfit managed to win 11 seats in a hotly contested election that has helped the party gain steam with more polls in the state next year. The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) was decimated as the former prime minister HD Deve Gowda-led regional outfit managed to win just 2 out the seven it contested and even lost in several districts which it considered a stronghold.

HT had published that BVU, one of the private deemed universities, is conducting its winter 2021 semester examination for various courses starting from December 15 and it is going to be held only in offline format. “There are thousands of students studying in various courses at BVU and most of them are not physically present at college to attend offline lectures and even appear for exams. So, we wrote to the varsity to give online option to appear for the exam for this semester. Now, vice-chancellor M M Salunkhe sir has issued orders to give online option to students appearing for the examinations,” said Rishi Pardeshi, state observer, Nationalist Students Congress Party. As the universities and colleges in the state are gearing up preparations for conducting examinations, the state higher education minister Uday Samant had earlier announced to give both options of online and offline mode for conducting the exams depending on the Covid situation. However, BVU students were upset over the decision of not giving online option for exams, as many of them are back into their village, some are afraid of the new Omicron Covid variant and want to appear online for exams.

25-12-2021||Gurugram||Bhondsi inmate caught with drugs while returning from court hearing||A 21-year-old convict lodged in the Bhondsi jail in connection with a murder, robbery and assault case was booked on Wednesday (December 22) for allegedly carrying drugs during a hearing at the Jhajjar court the same day, police said on Friday.The suspect, Brijesh Singh, when returning from the Jhajjar court after the hearing was caught with a packet of sulfa (also called sulfonamide) drugs, said officials of the Bhondsi jail. A case has been registered against Singh under Section 20B (ii) of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act, 1985, on Wednesday night.According to Bhondsi jail officials, they have been struggling to stop smuggling of drugs, which the inmates bring inside the jail -- mostly when they return from hospitals or court hearings. The prisoners are able to smuggle drugs because police teams accompanying them do not maintain a strict vigil, the officials added.Muhammad Akil, director general of police (prison), said, “Inmates returning from parole, court visits and hospitals often bring drug substances, SIM cards and cellphones with them... Strict frisking and three-layer checking is conducted to ensure that they don’t smuggle anything inside the jail. Baggage scanners often spot such substances, but if not, other items are checked before the prisoners enter the jail premises,” Akil said.Police teams accompany the inmates, and they are not allowed to meet their families and friends without permission from the court and the prison department.The police personnel need to keep a strict vigil to stop this menace, said the officials.Akil said the jail authorities conduct search operations in all the barracks regularly, to ensure the usage of cellphones and drugs is not allowed. There were regular complaints of cellphone usage for extortion calls earlier, but now the situation is under control as the department scans CCTV footage regularly and also conducts human intelligence programmes.Harinder Singh, jail superintendent, said that drugs are not available inside the jail unless it is thrown or carried inside the premises by the inmates and staff. “We are taking strict action against those found in possession of drugs or are found smuggling, they are booked under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC),” Singh said, adding that they have written to the Gurugram police to keep a check on the inmates and their movement when they are taken to the court or hospitals.The Bhondsi jail houses all types of prisoners -- gangsters, murderers, robbers, snatchers and rapists among others, many of whom are rich and infamous. There are 23 barracks in the jail, including six security cells where dreaded gangsters are lodged.

25-12-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka: RSS barges into child’s naming ceremony alleging religious conversion||Members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Wednesday interrupted a child’s naming ceremony in Hubli district, alleging religious conversion. The incident was reported while the anti-conversion bill was passed by the Karnataka assembly on Thursday. The incident took place in Koliwad village in the district, located around 400 km from capital Bengaluru. A group of RSS members allegedly barged into the house of Nilavwa Bhajantri on Wednesday night. The group interrupted a gathering of children and their parents. Following this “raid”, a pastor and a local resident were called in for questioning by police. Nagaraja Gunjala, an RSS leader, told media that at least 10 conversions were reported in the village in the past few years and the pastor was trying to convert more people. “What is the need for teaching the bible at a naming ceremony? This is an attempt to convert and we will oppose,” he said. HT could not verify the claim made by the RSS leader and even police said they couldn’t find any evidence supporting the activist’s claim. The pastor was not available for the comment but in a statement given to police, he and guest presents have denied the allegations made by RSS workers. A day after the incident, on Thursday, police called both the RSS leader and the pastor for questioning. Both parties were let off after a discussion with police. P Krishnakant, the superintendent of police, Hubli rural, said since no complaint was lodged by both parties as no FIR has been registered in the matter. “We have investigated the matter. We have not come across any evidence of religious conversion so far. We were informed about an attempt to conduct conversion, but it was found not to be true. The house owner has also given a statement stating the same,” said the officer. When asked if any action has been taken again the RSS workers, the officer said there were no complaints filed and if any “cognisable matters” come to light action will be taken. In another incident, Christmas celebrations at a school in Mandya district were interrupted by Hindutva activists on Thursday, alleging religious conversion. The mob barged into Nirmala English High School and College as the Christmas celebrations were underway. Officials of the school said the parent of one of the students had informed the right-wing groups that the school was preaching Christianity during the celebrations. A video of the incident has gone viral on the social media on Friday. No police complaint has been registered so far. On Wednesday, a 150-year-old church was allegedly vandalised by unidentified people in Chikkaballapur district, 65 km from Bengaluru. The miscreants vandalised the statue of St Antony, at St Joseph’s church, in Susaipalaya area. The incident came to light when a parishioner, who arrived for prayers at around 6 am, found the broken statue and informed the parish priest. In a complaint, the church authority said a large stone was found near the broken statue. The incident came hours before the Karnataka legislative assembly passed the contentious “anti-conversion bill”, amid din, to prevent “unlawful conversions”. These attacks are also the latest in the spate of attacks on various Christian groups. Members of right-ring groups set ablaze Christian religious books alleging religious conversion by the church while a viral video purportedly showed a man chasing a priest with a machete earlier this month. A viral video on social media last month showed members of the Bajrang Dal barging into a prayer hall and stopping a service mid-way in Hassan district. In a similar incident in September, a group of right-wing activists barged into a Christian prayer hall Karkala in Udupi district and allegedly attacked devotees while a prayer meeting was underway. A fact-finding report by several civil society organisations earlier in December claimed that Karnataka was witnessing one of the highest incidents of attack against Christians due to the government’s “attitude”. The report by United Christian Forum (UCF), Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), and United Against Hate also claimed that Karnataka ranks third among states with the most number of attacks on the community and their places of worship in India. A separate report released by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) last week documented 39 instances of attacks on Christians in the state this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnatakarss-barges-into-child-s-naming-ceremony-alleging-religious-conversion-101640375121607.html

25-12-2021||Noida||Restaurants and pubs in Noida fear huge losses as UP goes under curfew||The Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to impose a curfew from 11pm to 5am has brought down the spirits of those in the hospitality sector as owners of restaurants, pubs and bars fear they will incur major losses during the festive week from December 25 (Christmas) to December 31 (New Year’s Eve). The hospitality industry was pinning hopes on Christmas and New Year’s Eve to recover losses incurred throughout the year because of previous curfews.“After a very bad year of business, the last week of December was our only hope to generate some revenue. This week is very important for us as it generates revenue that is equivalent to a month’s business. Now with the curfew coming into effect at 11pm, a large number of reservations by customers for Christmas and New Years’ Eve are getting cancelled. We are staring at a loss of at least 40 to 50%,” said Umang Tewari, co-owner at Local Noida restaurant in Gardens Galleria Mall in Sector 38, which opened just a month ago. “Our launch in Noida was also delayed due to Covid-19 and curfew restrictions in Uttar Pradesh. Business has not even started picking up and night curfew will further dampen spirits,” he added.Restaurants and pubs in Noida have licenses to operate till 1am but will not be able to do so during the night curfew. “On such days, especially on New Years’ Eve, most of the customers come in by 9-10pm and stay on till 1am to celebrate the New Year. But now, the footfall will definitely reduce as there is no point going out on New Year’s Eve if one cannot stay out till midnight,” said Saurabh Agrawal, founder & CEO, Rubarru Clubstraunt, Gardens Galleria.Earlier on October 20, the Uttar Pradesh government had lifted the night curfew, that was in effect from 11pm to 6 am since April. “It has only been two months since the night curfew in UP was lifted. Before we could make up for lost business, we are hit by another curfew. We are staring at a loss of at least 50% revenue,” said Yogesh Sharma, owner at The Flying Dutchman restaurant and pub. It has outlets in sectors 62 and 32.Some restaurants had also booked artistes to perform on Christmas and New Year’s Eve, which will have to be cancelled now. “Considering that we all went through two national lockdowns, where restaurants had to pay rents to landlords, maintenance to malls and salaries to employees, with the government announcing night curfews, the losses are going to be huge. We had booked a singer to perform at one of our outlets on Christmas but will have to cancel the event,” said Naresh Madan & Sharad Madan, co-founders and directors, Imperfecto Group that has outlets in sectors 38 and 32. Manish Khatter, owner at The Bar Company in Sector 38, added that customers are visiting pubs and restaurants as they feel safe on observing that the Covid protocols are being followed.“All restaurants are following Covid protocols as it has become a new normal and our staff is fully vaccinated as well. The hospitality industry is following all regulations diligently to provide a safe environment for customers. At such a time, night curfew hurts our sentiments,” he said.Varun Khera, head of National Restaurants Association of India, Noida chapter, said that restaurants will cooperate with the government’s decision. “We will cooperate with the government’s decision to impose the night curfew. However, this night curfew singles out restaurants and pubs that stay open till 1am and it does not seem fair considering the restrictions were only lifted two months ago. The night curfew hits the hospitality industry the most as we are the first ones to get affected and last ones to get relieved,” said Khera. On the other hand, medical experts say that while the night curfew may affect businesses, it is one step in the right direction to curtail the spread of coronavirus.“The new variant of Covid-19 is known to spread five times more than the earlier one. Moreover, active cases of Covid-19 have started increasing in Gautam Budh Nagar which is again more alarming. Moreover, large gatherings on such events also pose a risk of turning into super-spreaders. In such a situation, a night curfew comes as a precautionary measure to control the spread of infection,” said Dr Sunil Awana, president of Indian Medical Association, Noida chapter.Meanwhile, district magistrate Suhas L Y said that all establishments will have to follow the restrictions imposed by the government. “The decision has been taken after much deliberation and has to be followed by all establishments. District authorities have been asked to ensure the restrictions are enforced strictly,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/restaurants-and-pubs-in-noida-fear-huge-losses-as-up-goes-under-curfew-101640374883006.html

25-12-2021||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan firing: Accused cops skip hearing citing security threat||Faridkot : A day after the Ludhiana court complex blast, policemen accused of the 2015 Behbal Kalan firing incident gave the hearing at the Faridkot court a miss on Friday claiming security threat. Suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal, former senior superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Sharma and superintendent of police Bikramjit Singh, who are accused in the Behbal Kalan firing case, sought exemption from personal appearance. Additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi allowed their applications and adjourned the matter to January 4. In the application seeking exemption from personal appearance, former SSP Sharma said keeping in view the sacrilege attempts at the Golden Temple in Amritsar and Kapurthala as well as the blast at the judicial courts complex in Ludhiana, the situation is not conducive for them to appear in person in the court. Sharma said he apprehend that due to the recent surcharged atmosphere, some untoward incident may happen with him and other police officials, who are also appearing in the case. Umranangal’s counsel also raised the security threat and told the court that despite the Union home ministry’s directions, the Punjab government has not stepped up his security cover. In September, the Union ministry of home affairs had asked the Punjab government to provide adequate security to Umranangal and his family following his request to the central government. “The request of Umranangal has been examined in the ministry in consultation with the central security agency. As per their report, during the militancy days in Punjab, his family faced the ire of terrorists. His father was killed by a Bhindranwale Tiger Force militant in 1987. Umranangal was attacked by the militant in 1988,” the letter of the ministry to the Punjab government read. Victim’s son continues protest Sukhraj Singh, son of the 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing victim Bhagwan Krishan Singh, whose protest for justice at the incident site entered the 9th day on Friday, said: “They (accused) have always tried to delay the trial by making excuses. In the last six years, no one ever tried to touch them, so where is the threat. We are the people who suffered, but we will continue our fight against them peacefully.”

25-12-2021||Noida||9 Covid cases reported in a day in Ghaziabad, 17 localities affected so far||Ghaziabad Nine fresh Covid-19 cases emerged in the district on Friday, taking the tally of infections reported in the month of December to 58, of which 32 are active cases. According to official data, seven of the nine patients have no travel history. Five of the total Covid cases reported on Friday are not even contacts of a previously infected patient. All the nine patients have been put in home isolation and are having mild symptoms, such as cough, fever, sore throat and loss of smell and taste. All the nine cases are fully vaccinated, except for one patient who has received only one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. According to officials, the infection has spread to many parts of the city as the new cases have been reported from 17 different localities, with Indirapuram, Crossings Republik and Nehru Nagar accounting for the maximum Covid cases. Officials said they are taking containment measures to check the spread of the infection. “We are scaled up surveillance and are scanning at least 90-100 contacts of each positive case. We are also putting up fliers outside the house of the patients and informing their neighbours so that they can keep a check on their movement. In all the present cases, the patients have mild symptoms and none of their condition is severe,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. He added so far, at least 17 private hospitals have submitted their applications for empanelling them as paid Covid treatment facilities. “During the second wave, we had about eight government hospitals and 50 private hospitals, which provided Covid care. This time, if cases rise, we will rope in more hospitals so that there is no shortage of Covid beds. We have already asked the private hospitals to check their preparedness beforehand,” said the CMO. According to the state control room figures of December 23, Ghaziabad district stands third among the top three districts in Uttar Pradesh having the highest number of active cases at 32. Of the total active cases, 28 are in home isolation while four are taking treatment in healthcare facilities.  Experts said the trend indicates that the cases will rise. “There is need to spread awareness among masses for maintaining social distancing and also for wearing face mask. There is hardly any adherence to Covid protocol in public places. Ground-level enforcement is needed, instead of a night curfew which will have less impact in terms of enforcement,” said Dr Ashish Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). The state government has imposed a night curfew from 11am to 5pm everyday starting from December 25 in the wake of the recent rise in Covid-19 cases. According to the official figures of the district health department, till Friday, Ghaziabad has had 55,738 cases since the beginning of the pandemic last year and 461 deaths.

This means that the district has received 158 applications more than the total number of deaths recorded. Officials explained these are applications from the kin of all those residents, who died outside the district or state. Most applications are genuine and can be verified from the online state portals, said officials. “The higher number of applications does not mean that 626 people died in Noida. The applications are from the kin of all those, who were residents of Gautam Budh Nagar but may have died here or in other districts or states and added to that particular region’s death toll. At the peak of the second wave, people got admitted to other places too, wherever they could find a bed. Others were probably already living or visiting another city when they got infected,” said additional district magistrate Vandita Srivastava, who is the nodal officer for the compensation disbursement. She added about 300-odd applications are from the kin of those, who are residents of Noida and have died here. Their details are available in the district’s list.She further explained that of the total 468 deaths recorded in Noida, just 377 were Noida residents. The remaining 91 were residents of other districts and states, whose kin will have to apply in those districts for compensation. She clarified that of the 377 residents whose deaths have been recorded in Noida, not all their relatives have applied for the compensation yet. Officials said the applications are being examined, against which the disbursement will soon begin. “We are verifying all applications and they all seem to be genuine. Some of them have minor errors that we are getting rectified. We are trying to ensure most of these applicants receive the compensation soon,” said Srivastava. Rolled out by the Centre and approved by the Supreme Court, all states and UTs are supposed to disburse the compensation amount from State Disaster Response Fund. Across Uttar Pradesh, 22,915 deaths have been reported so far. Districts, such as Lucknow, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Meerut, Kanpur, Gorakhpur and Jhansi, have recorded more deaths than Gautam Budh Nagar. Meanwhile, neighbouring Ghaziabad is close with 461 deaths. Ghaziabad has also received around 150 applications more than the total number of deaths reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-receives-626-applications-for-covid-compensation-101640374161745.html

He said everybody was aware what the state government had done for welfare of cows.Lallu said a sum of only ₹30 per animal had been allotted for cow shelter homes and this was not sufficient for their maintenance.

With the release of Hindi films, almost every cinema hall is fully booked and every show starting as early as 8 am to the last show at 11.40 pm. Speaking to a cricket fan, Ravi Pendse, who prebooked a ticket for “83” at City Pride for the afternoon show paying a premium, said, “I am a fan of cricket and this was the first time India won the World Cup, so a few of us friends decided to book early to avoid rush and glad we did. With 50% capacity, the show was houseful and we paid double the usual rate for the film, but it is worth it.” Arvind Chaphalkar, MD of City Pride multiplexes said, “The response for “83” movie started in prebooking and is increasing even though it is the first day today. We have all our shows full, but interestingly it is not the youth who are coming to see this film but people in their mid-thirties and forties who possibly were young then.” He said that even as seats are sold at a premium rate as per show is for 50% capacity, the multiplex is running at 100 per cent with no compromise.

25-12-2021||Lucknow||Discrepancy in teachers’ recruitment: 6,000 reserved category candidates to be appointed in Uttar Pradesh||Lucknow: The day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath met the reserved category candidates regarding the alleged discrepancy in the reservation in 69,000 assistant teachers’ recruitment, the state government on Friday announced to appoint 6000 reserved category candidates and fill 17,000 additional teacher posts soon. “The 6000 posts will be filled to resolve the issue of discrepancies in reservation in the recruitment of 69,000 teachers. The recruitment will start with immediate effect,” informed state basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi. According to a press statement issued by the basic education department, the list of selected candidates in reservation category will be made by December 28 and announced by December 30. The selected candidates will be called to review their documents between January 3 and 5. The joining letter to them will be given on January 6. Beside this, the minister announced that new recruitment would also be done on 1,700 vacant posts of teachers. The process of new recruitment would begin shortly, the minister said. This comes after protest by thousands of candidates for the last several months. Taking cognizance of their protest and demand, the chief minister gave instructions to basic education department for a speedy and an equitable solution to the problem, according to a tweet from chief minister’s office. It took the state government two years to wrap up the appointment process of 69,000 assistant teachers in government primary and upper primary schools across UP. Posts were advertised in December 2018 and the state government could complete the appointment only in December 2020, after a long-drawn legal battle in the high court and the Supreme Court after some candidates filed a lawsuit. The chief minister had distributed appointment letters to select new recruits in October and December and even interacted with them while others received them from local MLAs, MPs and ministers in the Yogi government in their respective districts. Soon after that, hundreds of candidates who could not make into 69,000 teachers recruitment conducted by the state government staged demonstrations in the state capital, alleging foul play by the basic education department officials as they did not adhere to the reservation policy, protesters claimed. These candidates claimed that the department gave only 3.86% reservations against 27% and in Scheduled Caste category 16.6% reservations were given against 21%. Likewise, in OBC category, against 18,598 candidates only 2,637 were selected. All this amounts to gross violation of reservation policy. They alleged that rules were violated in the teachers’ recruitment. The protesters recently took out a candle light march from 1090 Crossing to the chief minister’s residence. However, the police resorted to lathi charge. The opposition parties had slammed the police lathi charge on the protesting aspiring teachers in the state capital when they started their candle light march and headed towards the chief minister’s office at Kalidas Marg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/discrepancy-in-teachers-recruitment-6-000-reserved-category-candidates-to-be-appointed-in-uttar-pradesh-101640373390866.html
25-12-2021||Pune||Pune food vendors to increase prices after FDA bans newspaper use in packaging||Pune: After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Maharashtra issued orders instructing food vendors to not use newspaper for wrapping of food items as it is harmful for customers due to the ink used, city-based food stalls, snacks centres and sweet shop owners have decided to use blank white paper for wrapping and it will increase the cost of food items. FDA issued the order for Pune on December 22 and launched random checking of food stall and snack centres across the city. “Despite hike in fuel prices causing rise in cost of oil and other raw materials, we did not change the cost of food items. However, the latest FDA order has left us with no alternative but to increase price by 10 per cent to 15 per cent as plain white paper costs around ₹60 per kg. We have decided to increase the food item rates from January 1, 2022 at our shop,” said Sagar Galande, owner of a sweet mart shop on Shivaji road. Mahesh Chavan, secretary of small-scale food vendors association in Pune, said, “There are more than 2,000 small food vendors which include shops, street vendors, hawkers and other food item stalls that daily use newspapers for food wrapping. And some of the food items like bhel, vada pav and chaat items are given only in newspapers for wrapping and parcel delivery. Using white paper leaves us no option other than increase the food rates.” Currently on average the cost of food items sold and packed in newspapers costs around ₹10 to ₹40 depending of items like bhel, vada pav, samosa and kachori, sweet items, bakery items and other things. As old newspapers are sold at cheap rates from scrap dealers, shop owners find it affordable. Using white papers or thin plastic bags for packaging will lead to rise in cost of snacks for customers. Talking about the harmful effects of newspaper ink, Dr Kailash Mistry said, “The ink used to print newspapers are made of chemicals and it contaminates the food which is wrapped inside it. It causes many people to suffer of stomach issues or vomiting. Also, stomach infection can be caused after consuming such harmful food items packed in newspapers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-food-vendors-to-increase-prices-after-fda-bans-newspaper-use-in-packaging-101640373389617.html
25-12-2021||Pune||Rise in active Covid cases in Pune district||Pune: As Maharashtra crosses the mark of 130 million vaccination, there is a gradual rise in active Covid cases since the past few weeks. A similar trend is seen in Pune city as well as per the data released by the state health department. Medical experts suggest that with increasing cases of Omicron variant, citizens should take utmost precautions to keep themselves safe. On Friday, six more patients tested positive for Omicron variant in Pune taking the tally to 41. On Thursday, Pune district reported 13 new cases of Omicron variant, the highest number of Omicron cases. 20 new cases of Omicron were reported in Maharashtra on Friday taking the total to 108. Dr Sanjay Patil, former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Pune chapter, said the government should take initiative for booster doses for healthcare workers. “IMA members checked their spike protein antibodies in October. As compared to April, the antibodies were less in number. Since healthcare workers were the first set of beneficiaries to receive the vaccine, they should be given priority for booster dose now. Also, healthcare workers will be more exposed to Covid if the cases increase in the third wave,” said Dr Patil. Along with healthcare workers, senior citizens, high-risk patients should also be given priority for booster dose vaccination. According to the health department of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), active cases of Covid on December 2 were 868. As of December 24, the active cases in Pune city are 942. On Friday, over 47,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Pune district. So far, over 86 lakh beneficiaries have received the first dose and over 61 lakh the second dose. On Thursday, Maharashtra reached the mark of 130 million vaccination. State additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said on Thursday that so far Maharashtra has administered 130,075,106 Covid vaccine doses. “Over 50 million individuals have received both the doses of Covid vaccine that is 55.47 per cent of the eligible population and over 79 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine that is 86.76% of the eligible population in Maharashtra,” said Vyas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rise-in-active-covid-cases-in-pune-district-101640373383138.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Speaker’s election: MVA prepares for showdown as BJP cries foul over timing, change in rules||MUMBAI: With the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) crying foul over the timing of the Speaker’s election, the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition is preparing for a showdown on the floor of the assembly on December 28. The BJP has questioned the timing of the Speaker’s election as 12 of its MLAs have been suspended for unruly conduct. Besides, the party says it was not consulted by the government before finalising the date of the election.Wary of cross-voting from its ranks, the MVA government has amended the rules for the Speaker’s election by allowing open voting instead of secret ballot. This will eliminate chances of sabotage as legislators who vote against the party whip will stand to face disciplinary action and will get disqualified. Senior MVA ministers said that the elections will be announced on Monday, and will take place on Tuesday which is the last day of the ongoing winter session of the legislature.Congress legislators Amin Patel, Sangram Thopte and Suresh Warpudkar and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan are among those being considered for the post. There are also chances that a Congress minister might be asked to quit and be fielded for this position with Nana Patole replacing him in the cabinet.Leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis and senior BJP legislator Sudhir Mungantiwar questioned how the Speaker’s election could be announced when the issue of 12 opposition legislators being suspended for unruly conduct was pending in the Supreme Court. “How can the election take place in this situation? The voters (suspended MLAs) will not be allowed to vote and the rules have also been changed,” said Mungantiwar, adding that a government should to work within the confines of the Constitution. Fadnavis reminded the ruling side that the 12 legislators had requested reduction in their suspension period as suggested in the Supreme Court and hoped that a decision on the same would be taken before the Speaker’s election. The BJP has challenged the suspension in the apex court.The BJP also objected to the decision to hold the Speaker’s election by open or voice voting instead of secret ballot. However, Prithviraj Chavan, who is a member of the rules committee of the state legislature, said that this was as per the convention in Parliament and other state legislatures. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and minority welfare minister Nawab Malik said that these rules for the election had been amended by the rules committee and approved by the house. “The rights of the legislature are supreme… no one can try to curb them,” he said, while responding to the BJP’s charges. Malik said that the government had the support of over 170 legislators in the 288-member house.Meanwhile, MVA ministers said that they had changed the rules to ensure that governor B S Koshyari, with whom the regime has a running battle, was only ‘informed’ about the election as against earlier when he both finalised and notified the date.Asked about the authority of the governor being curbed in the electoral process, Malik said, “Those occupying Constitutional positions have authority and also limitations to this authority. There is a system of checks and balances.” Malik pointed at how Koshyari had written to the legislature secretariat earlier this year about holding elections to the post. He added that a reference had been made to the governor about the elections. In February, Speaker Nana Patole resigned after being chosen as the president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) and Narhari Zirwal of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has been the deputy Speaker since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/speakers-election-mva-prepares-for-showdown-as-bjp-cries-foul-over-timing-change-in-rules-101640372901426.html
25-12-2021||Lucknow||BSP gearing up to contest UP polls with full might: Mishra||PRAYAGRAJ: National general secretary of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Satish Chandra Mishra said on Friday that the party was gearing up to contest the coming assembly elections in the state with its full might. He said that for the reserved seats of Prayagraj division, the party was also busy holding small meetings with leaders and workers of these constituencies. Mishra was in Prayagraj to participate in the divisional-level convention of the BSP at Sardar Patel Seva Sansthan in Alopibagh. UP has 86 reserved seats, with 84 reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and two for Scheduled Tribes (STs). In Prayagraj, three out of the 12 assembly constituencies, including Koraon, Bara and Soraon, are reserved for SC. Addressing party workers, Mishra said that people were very enthusiastic about the BSP as they had seen the quality of governance when the party was in power in the state. People still recalled the development works as well as the law and order situation that prevailed in UP when BSP president Mayawati was the chief minister. The jobs offered to the youth were still fresh in the memory of the people and they were strongly standing behind the BSP, he said. “The BSP will surely form the government in the state this time. People are fed up of the Yogi Adityanath government and every section of the society is angry with the BJP as it has dragged the state into darkness,” he claimed. Coming down hard on the Samajwadi Party (SP), Mishra said that the poor state of affairs in UP during the SP regime was known to all. “This time the BSP is moving ahead taking everyone with it, on the principle of “Bahujan Sukhaya Bahujan Hitaya” (public welfare lies in the happiness of the masses).” On the Allahabad high court requesting PM Narendra Modi and the Election Commission to consider postponement of UP elections for 1 or 2 months considering rising cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19, BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said that it would not be appropriate for him to comment on it. “This is the Election Commission of India’s prerogative,” he said. Mishra, however, did point out that the high court had simply given an advice and not issued any order in this regard. He also refrained from commenting on the state government decision of re-imposing night curfew and restrictions on gatherings at marriage and other functions in view of the re-emergence of pandemic threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-gearing-up-to-contest-up-polls-with-full-might-mishra-101640372841691.html

25-12-2021||Delhi||Christmas a muted affair this year too in Delhi||Amid concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and a rise in Covid-19 cases, Christmas celebrations will be a muted affair in the Capital for the second year in a row, as most churches have directed parishioners to attend mass online on Saturday. Some churches will, however, go ahead with the Christmas mass with a 50% cap on visitors.Churches in Delhi have taken steps to avoid large gatherings after Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued guidelines on Wednesday, banning Christmas and New Year celebrations in the Capital even as it allowed religious places to remain open for prayers and visitors. The order allowed devotees to offer prayers at churches in compliance with Covid-19 protocols. Reverend Mohit Hitter, presbyter-in-charge of the Cathedral Church of the Redemption in New Delhi’s North Avenue, said that church services will be streamed online this year as well. “We will not have a mass for the public,given the current restrictions and protocol. The service will be streamed on our YouTube channel and only the technical team and people involved in the service will be present in person,” said Hitter. Last year, too, the church held the service online as it shared videos of carols and other Christmas activities with the parishioners. The St James’ Church in Kashmere Gate, the oldest church in Delhi, also plans to hold virtual mass for parishioners. “We have a responsibility towards each other. If cases are rising, we need take precautions and avoid large gatherings. Christmas will come next year as well. Keeping in mind everyone’s safety, we are allowing very few people to attend the service physically, the others will watch it online,” said Reverend Prateek Pillai, Presbyter in-charge of St James’ Church.Meanwhile, some churches have set a 50% cap on those attending Christmas mass physically.At the Christ Methodist Church near Tis Hazari, which has a seating capacity of 400, around 250 people were expected to take part in the service on Christmas Eve. Reverend Samson R Nath, the priest-in-charge of the Christ Methodist Church, said Covid-19 protocols will be followed during the in-person service. “Around 250 people will be present within the church, whereas for others, the order of service will be streamed online. There will be recitation of Christmas carols in remembrance of Christ, and the pastor’s prayers,” said Nath, adding that Christmas Eve before the pandemic used to be a busy affair at the church with people from other states also joining the service. “In non-pandemic years, we used to see many people from other states as well. While we are expecting many people to turn up due to the festival, the number will be capped and not go beyond a certain number in compliance with the prevailing norms. We will be in touch with the police authorities as well so that things take place as per the norms,” he said. Like last year, a number of virtual Christmas music concerts, on social media channels including YouTube, have already taken place.Royall McLaren, director at Delhi Christian Chorus, the oldest choir group in the Capital, said that as the activities moved online, virtual concerts reached a much larger audience. “We presented our virtual concert earlier this month. Last year, we had a much shorter preparation with only a handful of songs. This time, however, we conducted a complete concert virtually with around 14 songs,” said McLaren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/christmas-a-muted-affair-this-year-too-in-delhi-101640372541492.html
25-12-2021||Noida||Five manufacturing units to soon start operations near Noida airport in Jewar||The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Friday said at least five big manufacturing units will soon start operations near the Noida international airport at Jewar along the Yamuna Expressway. A mobile manufacturing unit is about to finish construction work and is likely to start operations in Sector 24. Three other units, which deal with packing material, food products and printing, will become operational in Sector 29 and one unit that is into product labelling is set to become functional in Sector 32 next year. The mobile manufacturing unit alone is expected to create at least 7,000 jobs. The four other units will create around 8,000 jobs.“We hope these five units start operations in 2022 and employ at least 15,000 people in the first phase. The employment generation will grow in the time to come and will boost growth in urban areas along the Yamuna Expressway,” said Arun Vir Singh CEO of Yeida. On April 24, 2001, the Uttar Pradesh government established Yeida for development in areas between Greater Noida and Agra. The objective was to set up industries to generate employment and develop urban areas. Around 2.5 lakh hectares from 1,187 villages of six districts--Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra--were notified under Yeida. However, the authority has been able to acquire only 16,000 hectares of land along the expressway. The five units will be the first ones to start operations here because before them, no other factory could start operations amid the slowdown in the market, said officials.Yeida officials said now, since the Noida International airport has become a reality and the work at the site is in full swing, the region will witness unprecedented growth in the time to come.“Since 2017, the authority allotted at least 1,940 plots under different categories, thereby selling at least 1,200 acres of land to different companies for setting up businesses. We have raised ₹7,500 crore revenue in the last 4.5 years from the sale of plots for industrial purposes.

25-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Mehrauli restaurant sealed for violating Covid protocols||A day after Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) banned New Year and Christmas gatherings and congregations, a popular restaurant in south Delhi’s Mehrauli was sealed for allegedly organising a gathering of around 600 people in violation of Covid-19 protocols on Thursday night.A district official, requesting anonymity, said authorities dispersed the crowd and sealed the premises.DDMA has capped seating capacity in restaurants and bars in Delhi at 50% and is strictly enforcing the restrictions in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases.“As part of a series of inspections conducted in view of the latest DDMA orders to prohibit large congregations and imposing a 50% cap on the total capacity in restaurants and bars, a flying squad from the South district went for a surprise inspection at one of Mehrauli’s renowned restaurants where they found a large gathering of around 600 persons. The club had organised an event in complete violation of prevalent Covid-19 protocols,” the district authority said in a statement.“Immediately, the Tehsildar (Mehrauli) dispersed the crowd and sealed the premises on the spot for gross violation of DDMA guidelines, especially in the wake of emerging Omicron variant of Covid-19,” an official said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (south) Harsha Vardhan Mandava said: “A restaurant named Diablo was found violating DDMA guidelines. There was overcrowding in the restaurant. FIR u/s 188, 269 IPC has been registered against the establishment at PS Mehrauli. The premises were also sealed.”Priyank Sukhija, the owner of the restaurant, refuted the allegation of there being 600 people on the premises, and said there the number of people was slightly more than 50% of the restaurant’s 280 seating capacity. “The manager was not aware of the recent restrictions. We will ensure that this will never happen again, and we are ready to pay the fine. The videos being circulated on social media have also captured the footage of the guests outside the restaurant,” Sukhija told HT.The district authorities have again directed all restaurants to follow the guidelines in letter and spirit and ensure they don’t become super spreaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhimehrauli-restaurant-sealed-for-violating-covid-protocols-101640372302733.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC completes restoration of 122-year-old TB hospital||Mumbai After a two-year work, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) heritage department has now completed restoration of the 122-year-old tuberculosis (TB) hospital building near Grant Road in South Mumbai. The ground-storey structure is at the junction of Balaram Street and Alibhai Premji Road near Rusi Mehta Chowk. Constructed in 1899, this is part of the civic body’s comprehensive plan to restore heritage structures across the city.This restoration project has been different from most others undertaken by the heritage department over the past few years, as it involved reconstructing the original elements of the hospital building - such as the front porch, corridors circling the external side of the building, and extensions of the Mangalorean pitch roof. The front porch was demolished over 60 years ago during the road widening, while the semi-open corridors were walled in either with concrete or an iron protective grill. Part of the Mangalorean pitch roof was replaced with asbestos during haphazard repair over the years.BMC found old blueprints that showed designs for the front porch, but restoring the corridors and the pitch roof extension had to be done after careful study and ‘detective’ work.Pankaj Kathole, the heritage conservation architect who worked on the project, said, “We found an old blueprint of the building that shows a front porch. However, while restoring the corridors, we found grooves on the floor, that indicated wooden columns could fit in, and also found grooves along the external wall, just under the roof. This led to the idea that there have been semi-open corridors. The wooden beams and corridors were then restored, and the Mangalorean pitch roof over these was replaced.”A senior civic official from the heritage department said, “We assume the porch was used as a drive-through and bullock carts used to be pulled in here to drop off patients. At some point in time, this was partially demolished due to road widening. The other part was converted into a storage room, and locked.”In 2016, during a survey of the city’s buildings, BMC had declared that the TB hospital was dilapidated. As the building is a Grade 2B heritage structure, the heritage cell planned its restoration.The building is made of Malad sandstone and has a triple-arched beach roof made of Mangalorean tiles. The structure’s brownish golden stone has been arranged in a rare honeycomb pattern. The cornerstones of all rooms are made in black basalt stone. According to BMC’s heritage cell, the original building had arched doors and windows made of Burma teak wood. It has circular windows below the roof.The official said, “Over the years, patchwork repairs diminished the building’s original charm. The inside walls were lined with white tiles and extensive use of cement, which acts as a corrosive agent on the stone. The wooden doors and windows were either replaced with modern aluminium sliding windows or were painted over in odd colours.”BMC raised the entire height of the building by nine inches to deal with the monsoon waterlogging, the dilapidated part of the wooden pitch roof was reconstructed and refitted with the Mangalorean tiles. The height of the external corridor was also increased to match the increased road height over the years.Moreover, all of this work was done while the hospital continued to cater to TB patients. Pankaj Kathole said, “We took over half the building and completed work on it, while the other half continued to operate as a hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-completes-restoration-of-122-year-old-tb-hospital-101640372301649.html
25-12-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand minister Harak Singh storms out of cabinet meeting, says I resign||Dehradun: Uttarakhand minister Harak Singh Rawat stormed out of a cabinet meeting late on Friday reportedly upset over alleged “government inaction” over a proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar, declaring his intention to resign from the cabinet, people familiar with the development said.Rawat flagged delay in approval to a proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar during the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. According to officials present at the meeting, it led to an argument between the two.“The argument heated up as Rawat alleged that development projects in his constituency are not being approved in conspiracy. He then stormed out of the meeting saying, ‘There is no use of being a minister, I am leaving the cabinet’,” said one official.Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal and BJP party state president Madan Kaushik later insisted that Harak Singh Rawat, a seven-time MLA, hadn’t resigned.Uniyal said he had “no information about his resignation”. “But he was unhappy over an issue related to a proposed medical college in his constituency as apart from being a minister, he is also an MLA,” the cabinet spokesperson said.Kaushik said the party will speak with him and resolve any issues that Rawat had about his constituency. “Nobody has resigned from the party,” he said.Phone calls and texts to Harak Singh Rawat for comment went unanswered.Rawat is considered to have played a key role in the rebellion of nine Congress MLAs in 2016 who switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party, before he also signed up in 2017. Harak Singh Rawat’s exit from the Congress had hugely contributed to the collapse of Harish Rawat’s government in 2017. But there have been swirling rumours over the last few months that Harak Singh, a Thakur leader from the Garhwal region who first became an MLA in 1991, was looking at exiting the BJP.It was in context of this speculation that Harish Rawat appeared to raise the bar for letting former Congress leaders return to the party, demanding that they will have to give a public apology before being considered.Harak Singh Rawat reached out to the Congress leader soon after, persuading Harish Rawat to tone down his pitch. “In disasters, even animals come together then why not two brothers,” Harish Rawat said, reciprocating to the Uttarakhand minister declaring Harish was his “elder brother” and his “place is always at his (Harish Rawat) feet.”The conciliatory tone between bitter rivals further triggered concerns in the Uttarakhand BJP that there was a possibility that Harak Singh Rawat could head back to the Congress. BJP leaders have denied such a possibility, reaching out to Harak Singh Rawat to mollify him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-minister-harak-singh-storms-out-of-cabinet-meeting-says-i-resign-101640372183936.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||Transpersons in Palghar to get ₹1k pension every month||Transgender persons in Palghar district are set to receive monthly pension of ₹1,000 as part of the Centre’s Sanjay Gandhi Pension Scheme, making this the first district in Maharashtra to do so, district collector Dr Manik Gursal said.“We are nearly finishing a survey to identify eligible transgender persons in the district, and we have managed to identify 100. Hopefully, pension will be started within a month or two,” Gursal said. The district has set up a four-member team, comprising the civil surgeon, a gynecologist, a psychiatrist and a medical officer to issue transgender identity cards, which is one of the requirements mandated by the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act for transpersons to receive benefits and to ensure that other documentation can be brought in line with the transperson’s gender identity. Vaibhav Sankhe a social activist from Boisar is assisting the collector’s office in issuing the cards.Arti,a transgender person from Boisar said the ID cards would “help us gain access to various government schemes and help us gain respect in the society.”In 2014, the Supreme Court of India passed a landmark judgment affirming an individual’s right to choose their gender identity. In 2019, it passed a law that sought to ensure that transpersons receive their Constitutional rights; the act, however, has been critiqued for deviating from the spirit of the 2014 SC judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/transpersons-in-palghar-to-get-1k-pension-every-month-101640372182746.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||Task force essential to stop dengue outbreak: Delhi HC||Noting that no corrective measures were taken by authorities to prevent the increase in dengue cases, the Delhi high court on Friday directed all civic bodies to constitute a task force headed by their commissioners to take steps to prevent the city from “being infested by mosquitoes”. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh came down heavily on the authorities, adding that someone must take responsibility for the rise in cases. “On paper, on file, you will pass orders that there should be no breeding. But will the mosquitoes stop breeding if you mention it on the files… But there is nothing on the ground… It is a regular cycle... How can it be that the [cases] more than double in one year? If you are being so proactive if you have taken measures… People of Delhi continue to suffer,” the court said. The bench, while hearing a plea it initiated regarding the mosquito menace in the city, said that civic bodies cannot use excessive rain as an excuse for their failure to prevent several deaths caused by vector-borne diseases. “You want to put the entire blame on excessive rain. That means we are then left to the Gods. That is only giving excuses… You need to put the responsibility on some person. If the numbers don’t come down, that person should be liable for contempt action,” the court said. While expressing its displeasure regarding the “inaction of the authorities”, the court said, “Every year, for the past 20 years, we are suffering the same thing. And nothing seems to happen. Why does the Commissioner not take the moral responsibility and tender his resignation? What prevents him?” The court asked if the civic bodies required more force on the ground to complete their tasks. “Maybe you need a larger force to do this checking. You need more people on the ground. There should be proper monitoring of those who are put to tasks. Probably there is no supervision… Probably because the top man is sitting in his air-conditioned office in the months of July or August when this is spreading...,” the court observed. Expressing its concern on the enormity of the problems due to mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and chikungunya, the court said that it is high time that the matter is taken up seriously by all the local bodies. It directed that each of the local bodies, including east, south and north MCDs, Delhi Cantonment Board and New Delhi Municipal Council, set up task forces headed by their commissioners to monitor and control mosquito breeding. It that members of the task forces must visit the sites, ensuring that actual work is being carried out on the ground and asked the authorities to file a common status report before the next date of hearing on January 14. During the hearing, the court also said that a stern message should be sent across the city that any violation of bylaws will be dealt with strictly. It directed the Delhi government to initiate the process of amending its bylaws to increase the penalty for people who do not keep their surroundings clean and allow water to stagnate leading to mosquito breeding. The court noted that at present, there is a paltry fine, up to ₹500, for this violation. “Looking at the laid back attitude of people, you need more teeth. Your fine amount is only ₹500,” it said. Appearing for the North and South MCDs, counsel Divya Prakash Pande told the court that a mobile application was created for logging visits by the MCD employees, which enables the authority to check whether the staff actually visited the site. The court appointed advocate Rajat Aneja as an amicus curiae to assist it in the mosquito disease-related matters. It said that authorities have become so populist in their approach that they make policies only in populist ways and are scared of doing anything that will lose their votes. 
25-12-2021||Lucknow||Covid-19 cases rising,still the defiant keep masks in pockets||LUCKNOW: New Covid-19 cases are on the rise in state once again, but people can still be seen wandering around unmasked and unmindful of the infection, something that experts say can cause a sudden spurt in the number of patients. On December 21, Uttar Pradesh reported 23 new cases and the next day 21 new cases. On December 23, there were 31 new cases and on December 24, the state reported 49 fresh cases, highest since December 18 when there were 33 new cases. “One in five attendants reaches the trauma centre emergency or OPD without mask. Before starting treatment, we have to convince them to wear a mask, at times strictly,” said Dr Samir Misra, senior faculty, trauma surgery department, King George’s Medical University. “At public places or in parties, the commonest unseemly practice is to carry a mask but, in the pocket,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, Indian Medical Association, Lucknow. Earlier, the careless attitude of people saw results in the form of fine. Over 55 lakh people were fined by police across the state for not wearing masks during the previous Covid waves. Lucknow Commissioner of Police (CP) DK Thakur said, “The city police will re-launch the drive aggressively and fine people if major violation of Covid protocols is seen.” Not only were 55 lakh people fined but action was also initiated against over 5 lakh during strict enforcement of restrictions imposed due to outbreak of corona virus across the state between March and July this year, said the data from the police department. Experts said people had to learn to trust the use of mask to protect themselves and others. “A mask, in addition to social distance, creates a physical barrier against respiratory droplets containing virus. Also, when an infected person sneezes, it restricts droplets from infecting others,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-cases-rising-still-the-defiant-keep-masks-in-pockets-101640372121486.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||Contempt action by Delhi HC against cop, NDMC staff over Sarojini crowd||Taking note of overcrowding due to the rampant encroachment of hawkers in the Sarojini Nagar market, the Delhi high court on Friday initiated contempt proceedings against the station house officer (SHO) concerned and the enforcement officer of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for their failure to limit the number of vendors to 80.Terming the sight of hundreds of people thronging the Sarojini Nagar market and pushing each other in a viral video as “frightening” and “eerie”, a bench comprising justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that there could a be possible stampede, leading to several deaths.“We have seen the video… Covid-19 or no Covid-19, the situation is eerie. There can be a stampede where hundreds of people can die… And don’t tell us that this is state-managed. Hundreds of people are pushing each other...” justice Sanghi said.The court also said that the area is vulnerable to terror attacks. In 2005, 62 people had died and over 200 were injured when several bomb blasts had taken place in the market.The court said that there was a blatant breach of its orders to limit the number of vendors to 80.“There has also been a bomb blast in the area. Just think even if a small bomb was to go off, how many people will die because of this and because of the stampede...God forbid something like this happens,” justice Sanghi said.While hearing a plea by the shopkeepers’ association of the market against illegal vendors and encroachments, the court directed the Delhi Disaster Management Authority to visit the market and assess the situation on the ground.On October 8, while hearing the plea filed by advocate Kajal Chandra, the court limited the number of vendors to 80 taking note of the fact that there are 200 shops in the market in accordance with the Master Plan of Delhi-2021.Pulling up the NDMC and the city police for their failure to restrict the number of vendors to 80, the court rejected the claims of the SHO, Sarojini Nagar, that action has been taken to stop the encroachment of vendors.“This is something that has to be done every day. You may say that everyday this is being done, but we can’t shut our eyes. Should we believe what we are saying or should we believe what you are telling us? Eighty thousand people will go to a market where a large number of people are selling their goods. If you restrict the number of vendors, the number of buyers will also be restricted. Moreover, it will allow people to circulate,” the court said.The bench said that even in the viral video, squatters are seen displaying their goods in a larger than permissible area. It sought to know from the enforcement officer as to why no one was complying with judicial orders to curb encroachment.“What have you done about the squatters? We have made it clear that you will not allow anyone to encroach [space], including shopkeepers? If any shopkeeper is encroaching the land, you will wait for our orders to remove him? You will not remove him on your own? Do we have to give directions? What is happening? You’re saying in order for you to perform your functions, you need an order from us,” the court said.It directed the authorities to install poles with chains and mark the floors with white paint so as to specify the area within which the shopkeepers and squatters can operate. The bench also ordered that no goods must be left at the site at night and must be removed on a daily basis.“If you think you can so brazenly violate the orders of the high court, then we will tell you what we can do. If there is any loss of life because of Covid-19 or stampede or any other incident in this market, you persons will be personally liable for that. Because we know when you want to do something, nothing can stop you from that. The state, municipality, police, enough power is there with you to take action,” justice Sanghi told the SHO and the officer of NDMC.Seeing the video and photos of the crowded market, the court said that there was absolutely no improvement in the situation on the ground. It directed the police to work out a movement plan for the people who visit the market.It directed that the goods seized from illegal hawkers and vendors will not be released to them without the court’s permission.“The purpose of permitting street vendors whose goods have been seized under sec. 19(1) to be reclaimed as goods after paying such fee as prescribed in the scheme, cannot be to perpetuate openly an illegality but also a breach of the orders of this court,” the court said.“If you were to implement our orders, don’t permit squatters who do not have valid licences, there would be no such problem,” it added.Appearing for the Delhi government, additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan told the court that the situation is very grim with the increasing number of cases. He said that there is no compliance by the enforcement authorities in curtailing the overcrowding or the encroachment. He also proposed the odd-even opening of shops to restrict the number of visitors to the market.The counsel for the petitioner, advocate Chandra, said that customers are not being able to reach the shop due to the crowd.The court directed the authorities that no overcrowding is permitted and all the Covid-19 protocols laid down for the marketplaces must be followed.The matter will now be heard on January 17.
25-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC seals 4 liquor shops in Najafgarh over building violations||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) sealed four liquor shops in Najafgarh on Friday, citing violations related to building norms. “Teams from the corporation have been inspecting liquor shops and we will continue to take sealing action if any irregularities are found,” SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said. Satpal Malik, the chairman of the Najafgarh zone, said that the sealed liquor shops are located in Kakrola, Nangli, Sakrawati and Rajapuri areas.Over the last three weeks, the three municipal corporations have been carrying out special drives to check the documents of liquor shops opening in the city according to the new excise policy. All three corporations have passed resolutions against the new excise policy during the last month. Last week, the north corporation said that five liquor vends were sealed while notices were issued to 18 units. The north MCD building department teams sealed three liquor shops in Civil Lines and one outlet each in Karol Bagh and Rohini.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) also sealed three liquor outlets on December 10, 2021, while citing Unified Building Byelaws (UBBL) violations in C-Block DDA market, Dilshad Garden and GTB Enclave where eleven DDA shops were merged to create three liquor shops without any approval from the municipal corporation.Delhi moved to a new excise regime from November 17, 2021. Both Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress have opposed the new excise policy over the last month while Aam Aadmi Party functionaries have repeatedly argued that the parties are trying to deflect attention from the misgovernance in the BJP-led municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisdmcseals-4-liquor-shops-in-najafgarh-over-building-violations-101640371883881.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi south civic body contractors’ union on strike due to unpaid dues||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) contractors’ union began a protest on Friday at the Civic Centre on Minto Road claiming that it has been not paid around ₹450 crore for the last three years.Netra Kumar Sharma, who heads the contractors’ union, said, “If the funds are not released in the next 15 days, we will start gheraoing officials and municipal functionaries.”In a memorandum submitted to the SDMC municipal commissioner last month, the All SDMC Contractor Association stated that they have stopped all engineering works until they are paid.Sharma said that they held several rounds of meetings with municipal functionaries but found no resolution to the problem. “No new payment has been cleared for works carried out since 2019. Civil works worth ₹450 crore have been completed and contractors are not being paid. Forget about the 10-15% profit margin, even our capital investment is getting destroyed,” he added.The civil works said the union has not been paid for include road carpeting, their repair, new drains, school building development, the construction of a yoga centre, among other engineering-related projects.Over the last month, several municipal councillors complained that the developmental work in the run-up to elections can be stalled. Municipal elections in Delhi are staled to be held next year. Mahesh, an SDMC standing committee member and Bharatiya Janata Party councillor from Molarband, said that roads in his area have been dug up and the condition of his areas is bad. “Their payments have not been made since 2019. How will they work without any money? This will affect our poll prospects. Where is all the money from the corporation going?” he said.A senior official from the engineering department said that there is a financial crisis in the civic body and the corporation tries to release part of the payment on a monthly basis but the pending liabilities have accumulated a lot in the last few years. “It has been reviewed even at the commissioner level but we don’t have money to release immediately,” the official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-south-civic-body-contractors-union-on-strike-due-to-unpaid-dues-101640371761246.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||Pollution in Delhi stays ‘severe’ for fourth day||As pollution levels in Delhi remained in the ‘severe’ zone for the fourth straight day, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday asked citizens of the city and experts to pitch in with measures for a permanent solution to Delhi and the National Capital Region’s (NCR) air crisis.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 415 (severe) at 4pm on Friday, as against 423 on Thursday. Pollution levels plunged into the “severe” category for the first time since December 2 on Tuesday, and have remained in that zone since then, showed data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The Commission put out newspaper advertisements on Friday, saying that the Supreme Court in a December 16 order directed the body to invite suggestions from the public and field experts, as part of its efforts to permanently solve the region’s annual winter air hazard recurrence.“We plan to use the suggestions we receive for our long-term planning. We will consider these on their merit towards devising a long-term strategy for Delhi-NCR,” said a CAQM senior official.In November, Delhi recorded 11 “severe” air days according to data from CPCB, the highest since detailed records have been maintained by the pollution watchdog.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.Meanwhile, the weather office attributed the city’s ongoing pollution spike primarily to meteorological factors, including slow winds.“There was hardly any wind yesterday [on Thursday]. The mixing height [height of vertical mixing of air and suspended particles above the ground] is very shallow. This happens when the temperatures are very low and there is no wind. We expect air pollution levels to improve marginally tomorrow [Saturday] and significantly on December 26 and 27 because rain is expected,” said VK Soni, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) environment and research centre.The air quality is likely to improve to the “very poor” category on Christmas day and December 26 according to the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system. Pollution levels are likely to improve significantly from December 27, when the AQI is expected to be in the “poor” or “moderate” category.The city meanwhile recorded a minimum temperature of 6.9 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung on Friday, a notch below normal. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, logged a maximum temperature of 22.9°C, a degree above normal.The weather office has forecast marginally higher minimum temperatures for the city in the coming days, primarily due to the advent of a western disturbance, which is likely to give Delhi some light rain the day after Christmas, as well as Monday and Tuesday.

25-12-2021||Delhi||Omicron in sight, Delhi ups guard: ₹1.54 cr fines for Covid violations in 2 days||The Delhi government has imposed ₹1.54 crore as fines in 7,778 cases over two days for violating Covid appropriate behaviour -- like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and spitting in public -- in crowded areas in the Capital.Officials said the total amount of fines imposed on Wednesday and Thursday is one of the highest in recent weeks, adding that the crackdown is part of the plan to curb the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in the Capital.In comparison, the Delhi government imposed fines totalling ₹21 crore in November.The most fines were recorded in North and East districts where officials imposed fines of around ₹29 lakh and ₹25 lakh, respectively. Central and East districts recorded the least amount of recorded violations, seeing around ₹5 lakh in fines each.The South district administration has also sealed a restaurant in Mehrauli for allowing a gathering in violation of the DDMA guidelines mandating a 50% seating cap.Officials said district authorities have formed multiple flying squads -- consisting of civil defence volunteers and one officer from the revenue department -- to carry out raids in crowded areas like restaurants, bars, markets, interstate bus terminals and malls, especially at night, to ensure adherence to DDMA guidelines on gatherings ahead of Christmas and New Year.“They are on patrol in all crowd pulling areas like markets and the like. We have also deployed civil defence volunteers in the markets... The flying squads visit different bars and restaurants as well to ensure DDMA order is complied with,” said a senior official official.Officials said the flying squads also gather intelligence from market sources to plan raids.Reports of overcrowding in markets, like the one witnessed in Sarojini Market on Thursday, has already drawn the attention of top authorities.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal also directed Delhi Police commissioner and divisional commissioner (revenue) on Friday to strictly ensure compliance with Covid appropriate behaviour in the Capital, in line with the latest DDMA guidelines.“Media reports and inputs from the ground point out that markets are overcrowded and there are violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour at all markets, bars and restaurants and other public places, even as the number of positive cases were maintaining a rising trend and positivity rate had risen to 0.29%,” LG office said in a statement.A senior government official said that all police officers and field functionaries have been directed to immediately launch a crackdown to ensure strict enforcement of curbs announced by DDMA.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said in light of the rising cases of Covid in Delhi, people, especially those with co-morbid condition or are immunosuppressed or unimmunised, should avoid public places. “That said, this variant is not severe and may not have serious consequences. So panic and fear should be strictly avoided. For mild respiratory symptoms, there is no need of testing or any antiviral drugs. Healthy food and hygiene is required for all,” he said.Chamber of Trade & Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal said that markets are implementing ‘No Mask No Entry’ directive. “Markets do not have legal authority to enforce the DDMA order, shopkeepers can only follow the Covid guidelines in their shops. The district administration should cooperate with the traders,” he said.Experts have said that the Omicron variant is highly transmissible, expressing fear that overcrowding will aid in its easy spread.The city’s Covid graph has surged upwards over the past week, amid global concerns over the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.Delhi added 180 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday, higher than the 118 reported the previous day, showed the state’s daily health bulletin. The new infections came at a test positivity rate of 0.29%, marginally higher than 0.19% on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/omicron-in-sight-delhi-ups-guard-1-54-cr-fines-for-covid-violations-in-2-days-101640371341347.html
25-12-2021||Lucknow||Lease deed finally signed, Hindu hostel now belongs to Allahabad University||The lease deed for formal transfer of Hindu hostel and its adjoining grounds to Allahabad University (AU) at a nominal lease rent of ₹1 per annum for the next 29 years and 11 months has now been signed.The ensuing legal formalities were completed on December 21, said AU’s public relations officer prof Jaya Kapoor on the eve of the birth anniversary of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya who had got the hostel constructed in 1901. It is in his honour that Hindu Hostel is formally known as “Madan Mohan Malviya University Hostel”.The Allahabad University had initiated efforts to formally take over the Trust-owned Hindu Hostel after the executive council, the apex decision making body of the central varsity, in a meeting convened on November 23, 2021 unanimously approved the proposal in this regard. The decision of taking over the hostel having 184 double-seater rooms (with capacity of 368 students) had been first mooted and proposed by the Madan Mohan Malaviya Hindu Boarding Society (a Trust) more than 25 years back. Thereafter the society has been regularly sending communication in the matter. With no action initiated on part of the university, there was no development in this regard for years.When Prof Sangita Srivastava took over as the vice chancellor on November 30, 2020, a proposal to the effect was sent once again. She followed it up paving way for its formal takeover of it on lease by AU. “The hostel building will need some restoration work apart from clearing of the pending electricity bill of around ₹2.5 crore before it can be opened for allotment to students. There are also several proposals under consideration for utilising the grounds available for research and teaching projects,” prof Kapoor said.“The final decisions in this regard will be taken in the near future as the university is preparing for the implementation of new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 in the 2023-24 session,” she added. The Hindu hostel was built by visionary nationalist leader and educationist Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya in 1901 at a cost of ₹2.5 lakh collected entirely as donations to help students coming from far corners of the country find easy accommodation. At the time its name was MacDonnell Hindu Boarding House. In 1951, its name was changed to Madam Mohan Malaviya University College. Till 1982-83, AU teachers used to frequently visit the hostel to organise seminars and conduct tutorial classes. However, in recent years it fell to neglect with most toilets unusable and the building in poor state due to lack of proper maintenance. The importance of this transfer can be gauged from the fact that cost of just 10.10-acre land of the hostel located in heart of the city is estimated to be in crores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lease-deed-finally-signed-hindu-hostel-now-belongs-to-allahabad-university-101640371101792.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||In view of Omicron, Delhi govt to add 1,500 Covid beds in makeshift hospitals||In view of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the Delhi government has taken steps to add over 1,500 more Covid beds at makeshift hospitals in two sports complexes, a banquet hall and a public school.Two makeshift hospitals have already come up in Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games (CWG) Sports Complex, and officials said they will convert the Shehnai banquet hall in Daryaganj and a government school in Rouse Avenue if the need arises.Officials said the government has also engaged ‘Doctors for You’, an NGO, to get the makeshift hospitals in four facilities up and running.Dr Rajat Jain, president of ‘Doctors for You’, said 65 beds have been set up at CWG sports complex and 50 beds are ready to admit patients at Yamuna Sports Complex. “CWG village has the capacity for 500 beds and the Yamuna sports complex can accommodate 800 beds. Currently, no patient is admitted at these facilities, but we have kept doctors and healthcare staff on standby so that the facilities are ready to respond to any situation,” said Jain.Officials said Shehnai banquet hall will have a capacity of 125 beds and 120 more beds will be set up at the Rouse Avenue school.Additionally, the Yamuna Sports complex facility is attached to four oxygen production plants installed in its premises that can provide non-stop oxygen through the day to 250 beds. Similarly, three oxygen production plants installed at the CWG facility can provide 200 beds with oxygen support for 24 hours.Dr Jain said that 1,000 oxygen cylinders and 250 oxygen concentrators are also in place as a backup measure for the four facilities.Dr Suneela Garg, director-professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, said the government’s move to enhance infrastructure in advance is a right step but added that it should also focus on home isolation. “Since the symptoms are mild in Omicron cases, people can recover in home isolation by following necessary health protocols,” said Garg.A health department official, who did not want to be named, said, “Covid care centres played a major role in helping patients with mild symptoms and those who were asymptomatic recover, especially those who did not have adequate facilities for home isolation. A private agency has been engaged for running the four facilities,” the official said.While Delhi currently has 21,000 hospital beds earmarked to treat Covid-19 patients, this number can be scaled up to 37,000 in days, if required, said state government officials, adding that 100 oxygen beds can be set up in every ward within two weeks if the situation demands. Delhi has 272 municipal wards.The state’s larger plans involve setting up over 65,000 Covid-19 beds in the coming weeks.The city’s Covid graph has ticked upwards over the past week, amid global concerns over the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. So far Delhi has detected 64 cases of the variant, according to the Union health ministry. Delhi added 180 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday, higher than the 118 reportedthe previous day, showed the state’s daily health bulletin. The new infections came at a test positivity rate of 0.29%, marginally higher than 0.19% on Thursday.The city has over the past seven days added an average of 100 infections each day, the first time this statistic has touched triple digits since June 28. Compared to this, Delhi added just 31 cases in the seven days ending December 1.The city endured a punishing fourth wave of Covid-19 infections between April and May that left health infrastructure overrun, overwhelmed medical workers, and led to crematoriums running out of space. Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, while over 13,000 died of the infection between April and May alone. Cases in the city begin to peter out towards the middle of May on the back of a lockdown, which the state government imposed from April 19 onwards.The state government is also creating a two-month buffer of 32 types of medicines used to treat Covid-19 patients. The government has also revamped the city’s oxygen infrastructure and is working to amp up staff power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-view-of-omicron-delhi-govt-to-add-1-500-covid-beds-in-makeshift-hospitals-101640370981442.html
25-12-2021||Delhi||Exhibition at Kashmere Gate to mark Delhi Metro operations anniversary||New Delhi: The Delhi Metro on Friday entered its 20th year of operations, marking the occasion with the field trials of the first-ever indigenously developed signalling technology, and launching an exhibition on “Tracing Delhi Metro’s Journey” at Kashmere Gate Metro station.Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had inaugurated the first ever Metro corridor -- spanning 8.2 kilometre from Shahdara to Tis Hazari -- in the national capital on December 24 in 2002.Union housing and urban affairs secretary Durga Shanker Mishra inaugurated the exhibition on Friday. “The station has been redeveloped into a full-fledged exhibition with priceless photographs and anecdotes which shall take the visitors on a ride down the memory lane of that historic day which ignited a new revolution in India’s mass transit history. This shall be a permanent exhibition and the passengers using Delhi Metro network’s largest interchange facility shall be able to visit this exhibition without any additional cost,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.Officials said the new signalling system -- Indigenous–Automatic Train Supervision technology (i-ATS technology) -- is one of the many significant achievements of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and was jointly developed by the DMRC and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)Explaining the new technology, Dayal said, “The development of the i-ATS system is a major step towards the development of an indigenously built CBTC (Communication-based Train Control) based signalling technology for Metro railway... The i-ATS is a computer-based system, which manages train operations.”He said that the new system is indispensable for high density operations, such as the Metro, where services are scheduled every few minutes. “i-ATS is an indigenously developed technology, which will now significantly reduce the dependence of Indian Metros on foreign vendors dealing with such technologies…India will become one of the few countries in the world to have its own ATS product which can be implemented in other Metros as well as railway systems,” Dayal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exhibition-at-kashmere-gate-to-mark-delhi-metro-operations-anniversary-101640370621286.html
25-12-2021||Lucknow||Farmer killed, another injured after tiger attack in Unnao village||KANPUR A tiger killed a farmer and left another critically injured in Unnao’s Rampur Gadhoha village on Thursday evening after it strayed into the forests here from either Pilibhit or Lakhimpur Kheri, said officials. The two villagers, Ram Lakhan Pasi and Kamlesh Pasi, were attacked in their fields about 100 metres apart. Lakhan had taken his herd of goats to the field for grazing while Kamlesh was working in the field. After being attacked by the big cat, Kamlesh was being rushed to the trauma centre in Lucknow, but died on the way while Pasi was admitted to the district hospital in Unnao. “I was sitting when I heard a growl and something like a tiger leapt at me,” he said. Hearing his screams, a few villagers reached the spot but the tiger left Pasi and disappeared into the mustard field. They maintained that they saw the tiger.Chief conservator of forests (Lucknow division) RK Singh confirmed that the pugmarks were that of a tiger, which possibly entered Unnao from either Pilibhit or Lakhimpur Kheri. Earlier, it was presumed that a leopard might have attacked the two villagers. Meanwhile, a team from Lucknow arrived with tranquilizer guns and the forest deployed drones to locate the tiger. At some places, fire crackers were burst to scare the feline, which was believed to be in the area, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/farmer-killed-another-injured-after-tiger-attack-in-unnao-village-101640369781262.html
25-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC suspends 3 officials over conservancy worker’s death by suicide||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday morning suspended three civic officials from the solid waste management department, after a conservancy worker allegedly died by suicide on Thursday night, over pending salary for the past 2.4 years. The civic body has set up an inquiry into the matter, suspending three of its employees who were held responsible for salary delays, a senior civic official said on Friday. “These three officials were responsible for the clearing of salaries, and have been suspended for neglecting their duties, pending an inquiry. The BMC’s inquiry department will now carry out an independent investigation into the incident, following which a final decision will be taken,” the officer said.The three civic officials who have been suspended are Anita Naik who is an administrative officer, Sameera Manjrekar who is the head clerk, and Pankaj Khillare clerk from the SWM department in the P/South ward.BMC has announced a compensation of ₹100,000 to the kin of the conservancy worker.Corporators from the Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday demanded that one family member of this conservancy worker should be given a job by the civic body. Vinod Mishra, BJP corporator said, “We have demanded a compensation of ₹5,000,000 to the family of the conservancy worker. The standing committee on Friday approved that the brother of the deceased conservancy worker will be given a job. The solid waste management department has also committed that an enquiry of five civic officials associated with the case will be conducted.”Mishra said the conservancy worker was given an appointment letter by the civic body in 2020. His father was also a conservancy worker with the BMC, and after the father’s death, the deceased was given a job on compensatory grounds. Due to technicalities, the deceased’s file moved from one department to another, including the head office, the chief engineer of the SWM department, and the ward.“He kept following up on his file and on why he was not being paid. On December 20, 2021, he reached out to an official from the P/South ward. Owing to personal commitments, the official was not available, and also shouted at the conservancy worker for disturbance. He lost hope, and attempted to take his life,” Mishra said.The uncle of the deceased, who is also a labourer working with BMC in the P/South ward said, “My brother died on duty two years ago. When Mumbai was waterlogged, he died while doing his work on field. After this incident. BMC gave a job to his son, my nephew. BMC did not clear pending dues for my brother. Meanwhile, my nephew worked for two years without receiving his pay. He was bogged down mentally. He met many officers, and they kept shuffling him from one department to another, from the headquarters to the ward office. He eventually gave up.” The deceased is survived by a brother. The uncle further said, “Neither of their parents is alive. The two brothers lived in a rented room. It come to a point where room rent of 7-8 months was over due, and the landlords constantly asked them to pay or move out. My nephew must have thought there is no way out for him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-suspends-3-officials-over-conservancy-worker-s-death-by-suicide-101640362220800.html
25-12-2021||Lucknow||CBIC unearths ₹150 cr cash in raids on Kanpur-based bizman||KANPUR Tax raids on the premises linked to Piyush Jain, a Kanpur-based perfume businessman, yielded more than ₹150 crore in cash, Vivek Johri, chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), said in a statement on Friday.. This was the biggest cash recovery in the history of CBIC and no arrest was made so far in the case, he told media. Officials of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) at Jain’s house in Anandpuri said 57 big tin boxes were purchased to keep the cash and a container truck was hired for its transportation amid tight security. The number of currency counting machines was also doubled to eight — two were brought in from the State Bank of India’s Kalyanpur branch in the noon. “The counting of notes was continuing for the second day,” the officials said indicating that the cash was in excess of ₹150 crore. Videos and photographs coming from inside the house showed cash stuffed in two wardrobes of Jain’s house. The bundles of currency were wrapped in paper, plastic covers and were secured with Khaki coloured tape. Another picture showed income tax officials surrounded by more piles of cash, and three currency counting machines in the room. The raids on multiple premises in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Mumbai began on Thursday at a factory owned by Ms Trimurti Fragrances, which manufactures Shikhar brand of paan masala in Kanpur. The raids extended to offices and warehouses owned by Ganpati Road Carriers, also in Kanpur, following which the action shifted to Piyush Jain, a supplier of perfume compound to Shikhar. “Based on intelligence inputs, the residential premises of partners of Ms Odochem Industries supplying perfumery compounds was also searched,” said a GST department’s statement. “During the search proceedings at the residential premises, huge amounts of cash, wrapped in paper, plastic have been found. The process to count the cash has been initiated with the help of State Bank of India (Kanpur) officials, which may continue till December 24 evening,” the statement said. “The total amount is expected to be in excess of ₹150 crore,” it further said. GST officials said the money was linked to the dispatch of goods through fake invoices and without generating e-way bills by the transporter who generated multiple invoices in the name of non-existent firms. All the invoices were below ₹50,000 for one truck-load to avoid generation of bills. At least 200 fake invoices used for transportation of goods without payment of GST had been recovered from the warehouse of the transporter, said the DGGI. The DDGI team from Ahmedabad zone took Jain’s two sons, Pratyush Jain and Molu Jain, to their ancestral house in Chipatta locality in Kannauj later in the day. The house was sealed on Thursday as Jain refused to be present when asked to come for the search, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cbic-unearths-rs-150-cr-cash-in-raids-on-kanpur-based-bizman-101640361200757.html
25-12-2021||World||US sanctions: China replaces Xinjiang party chief amid forced labour allegations||The ruling Communist party has replaced its chief in the volatile northwest region of Xinjiang Chen Quanguo who was last year sanctioned by the US for alleged human rights abuses against the minority Uighur Muslims in the remote region.Ma Xingrui, who was the governor of Guangdong province, has been appointed as new party chief for Xinjiang.“The CPC Central Committee has appointed Ma Xingrui as new party chief for Xinjiang. Chen Quanguo, who no longer serves as secretary of the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPC, will be given another appointment, according to a decision by the CPC Central Committee,” a statement published by the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday.The move to replace Chen, who has earlier served as the party chief of Tibet, comes a day after US President Joe Biden signed a bill banning goods from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they aren’t made with forced local labour.Rights groups have alleged oppression of Uighur Muslims in a region that holds a major place in global supply chains.China has consistently denied such allegations.Xinjiang is a source for cotton used in clothing and is a key location for producing polysilicon used in solar panels, seen as crucial in the global shift away from fossil fuels. Chen has been accused by the US, the UK and the European Union of widespread human rights abuses against Uighurs, but he is tipped for a promotion, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on the development.The three Chinese officials sanctioned by the US last year were Chen, Zhu Hailun, the then party secretary of the Xinjiang Political and Legal Committee and Wang Mingshan, the party secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau.China is battling allegations of human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in the last few years from the West.The allegations include incarceration of around 1mn people from minority Muslim communities in detention camps, forced labour in manufacturing units of the resource-rich Xinjiang, forced abortions, and mass indoctrination.Denying these allegations, Beijing says its security crackdown in Xinjiang is aimed at the separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which is accused of fuelling terrorism and separatism in the region.Beijing says it had opened centres for vocational training and deradicalisation of people influenced by separatist forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-china-replaces-xinjiang-party-chief-amid-forced-labour-allegations-101640450068383.html
25-12-2021||World||As Omicron spreads, time to upgrade your mask. Why? Experts explain||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has been spreading across the world – as well as India – at an alarming pace. In just about of month of being confirmed in South Africa, the variant has affected people in more than 100 countries; in India, the tally has already crossed the 400-mark.Also Read | Why do vaccinated people too get Covid? Study explainsSo, it is time that people upgrade the “universal vaccine” against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) - the humble mask. Medical Analyst Dr Leana Wen, visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, told CNN that cloth masks "are little more than facial decorations", adding that there is no place for them in light of Omicron.What is the correct protection against the highly-mutated variant then? "We need to be wearing at least a three-ply surgical mask," Dr Wen said. "You can wear a cloth mask on top of that, but do not just wear a cloth mask alone."Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, said that cloth masks can filter large droplets.Omicron started to spread across countries like wildfire soon after its detection in South Africa. The Indian government then warned about the decline in usage of face masks across the country.At a press conference on the Covid-19 situation, Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (health), said that mask usage is declining in India and people are operating at a “risky and unacceptable” level, stressing that both masks and vaccines are important for protection against coronavirus disease (Covid-19).India has so far recorded more than 430 cases of Omicron, which has 37 mutations – more than any other variant of coronavirus. Due to so many mutations, it is believed to be more resistant to existing vaccines.Maharashtra is the biggest contributor to nationwide Omicron tally, followed by national capital Delhi. Rajasthan and Gujarat are jointly at number 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-omicron-spreads-time-to-upgrade-your-mask-why-experts-explain-101640440272240.html
25-12-2021||World||Tear gas fired as thousands march in Sudan in anti-coup rallies||Thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied Saturday two months on since a military coup, demanding soldiers "go back to the barracks" and calling for a transition to civilian rule.Waving flags, beating drums, dancing and chanting, crowds marched on the streets of Khartoum despite a heavy deployment of security forces -- who later fired tear gas canisters to break them up.Officers had earlier blocked bridges connecting the capital to suburbs, cut phone lines and restricted the internet ahead of the planned protests.At least 48 people have died in crackdowns during weeks of protests, according to the independent Doctors' Committee, and Khartoum's state governor has warned that security forces "will deal with those who break the law and create chaos".Demonstrators converged on the presidential palace in Khartoum, the headquarters of the military government in control since General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan seized power on October 25.Burhan held civilian leader Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok under effective house arrest for weeks, but reinstated him on November 21 under a deal promising elections for July 2023.The move alienated many of Hamdok's pro-democracy supporters, who dismissed it as providing a cloak of legitimacy for Burhan's coup.Protesters online had encouraged supporters with slogans, including demanding "no negotiations" with the army.As well as rallies in Khartoum and its suburbs, protesters also marched on the streets of Madani, a town around 150 kilometres (more than 90 miles) to the south, witnesses said.- Internet cut at dawn -Security forces with cranes used shipping containers to block the bridges across the Nile river connecting Khartoum to the cities of Omdurman and North Khartoum, and web monitoring group NetBlocks reported mobile internet was cut at sunrise on Saturday.Activists reported the arrest of several colleagues beginning Friday night, and Volker Perthes, the UN special envoy to Sudan, urged the authorities to "protect" the protests not to stop them."Freedom of expression is a human right," Perthes said Saturday, adding that it includes "full access" to the internet. "No one should be arrested for his or her intention to protest peacefully.""We draw the attention of the world and ask them to monitor what happens in Sudan on the issue of the revolutionary movement for freedom and democracy", said the Doctors' Committee, which is part of the pro-democracy movement.Khartoum's governor warned that "approaching or attacking buildings of strategic sovereignty is punishable by law".At rallies last Sunday, held on the third anniversary of mass demonstrations that led to the ouster of veteran strongman Omar al-Bashir, crowds began a "sit-in" protest outside the presidential palace.- Rape used as 'weapon' -Within hours, security forces dispersed the thousands of protesters with truncheons and firing tear gas canisters.Activists have condemned sexual attacks during those protests, in which the UN said at least 13 women and girls were raped.The European Union and the United States issued a joint statement Thursday condemning the use of sexual violence "as a weapon to drive women away from demonstrations and silence their voices".Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, has a long history of military coups, enjoying only rare interludes of democratic rule since independence in 1956.Over 14 million people, a third of Sudan's population, will need humanitarian aid next year, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the highest level for a decade.Activists say more demonstrations are planned for December 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tear-gas-fired-as-thousands-march-in-sudan-in-anti-coup-rallies-101640437820569.html
25-12-2021||World||World's most powerful space telescope launched on quest to behold 1st stars||The world’s largest and most powerful space telescope rocketed away Saturday on a high-stakes quest to behold light from the first stars and galaxies and scour the universe for hints of life.NASA's James Webb Space Telescope soared from French Guiana on South America’s northeastern coast, riding a European Ariane rocket into the Christmas morning sky.The $10 billion observatory hurtled toward its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, or more than four times beyond the moon. It will take a month to get there and another five months before its infrared eyes are ready to start scanning the cosmos.We have LIFTOFF of the @NASAWebb Space Telescope! At 7:20am ET (12:20 UTC), the beginning of a new, exciting decade of science climbed to the sky. Webb’s mission to #UnfoldTheUniverse will change our understanding of space as we know it. pic.twitter.com/Al8Wi5c0K6First, the telescope’s enormous mirror and sunshield need to unfurl; they were folded origami-style to fit into the rocket's nose cone. Otherwise, the observatory won’t be able to peer back in time 13.7 billion years as anticipated, within a mere 100 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang.“It’s going to give us a better understanding of our universe and our place in it: who we are, what we are, the search that’s eternal,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said earlier this week.But he cautioned: “When you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.”Intended as a successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope, the long-delayed James Webb is named after NASA’s administrator during the 1960s. NASA partnered with the European and Canadian space agencies to build and launch the new 7-ton telescope, with thousands of people from 29 countries working on it since the 1990s.With the launch falling on Christmas and a global surge in COVID-19 cases, there were fewer spectators at the French Guiana launch site than expected. Nelson bowed out along with a congressional delegation and many contractors who worked on the telescope.Around the world, astronomers had eagerly waited to see Webb finally taking flight after years of setbacks. Last-minute technical snags bumped the launch nearly a week, then gusty wind pushed it to Christmas. Inside Launch Control, there was a smattering of Santa hats.“We launch for humanity this morning,” Arianespace CEO Stephane Israel said minutes before liftoff. “After Webb, we will never see the skies in quite the same way.”The telescope's showpiece: a gold-plated mirror more than 21 feet (6.5 meters) across.Protecting the observatory is a wispy, five-layered sunshield, vital for keeping the light-gathering mirror and heat-sensing infrared detectors at subzero temperatures. At 70 feet by 46 feet (21 meters by 14 meters), it’s the size of a tennis court.If all goes well, the sunshield will be opened three days after liftoff, taking at least five days to unfold and lock into place. Next, the mirror segments should open up like the leaves of a drop-leaf table, 12 days or so into the flight.In all, hundreds of release mechanisms need to work — perfectly — in order for the telescope to succeed. “Like nothing we’ve done before,” said NASA program director Greg Robinson.Retired astronaut-astronomer Steven Hawley is more stressed over Webb than he was for Hubble, which he released into orbit from space shuttle Discovery in 1990. That’s because Webb will be too far away for rescuing, as was necessary when Hubble turned out to have blurry vision from a defective mirror.Spacewalking repairs by astronauts transformed Hubble into a beloved marvel that has revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the universe, casting its eyes as far back as 13.4 billion years. It’s now up to Webb to draw even closer to the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, its infrared vision keener and more far-reaching than Hubble’s is in the shorter visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.NASA is shooting for 10 years of operational life from Webb. Engineers deliberately left the fuel tank accessible for a top-off by visiting spacecraft, if and when such technology becomes available.When he released Hubble, "I never would have believed that it would still be going strong almost 32 years later,” Hawley, now professor emeritus at the University of Kansas, said in an email. “I hope that in 32 years we’ll be able to say that JWST did as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-most-powerful-space-telescope-launched-on-quest-to-behold-1st-stars-101640435253488.html
25-12-2021||World||Russia blocks website OVD-Info that tracks political arrests||A Russian organization that tracks political arrests and provides legal aid to detainees said Saturday that government regulators blocked its website, the latest move in a months-long crackdown on independent media and human rights organizations.OVD-Info reported that Russia's internet and communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, blocked the group's website. The organization said in a tweet that it wasn't formally notified about the decision and doesn't know the reason for the action beyond that it was ordered by a court outside Moscow on Monday.OVD-Info gained prominence for its meticulous tracking and counting of arrests at street protests in Russia. Activists first started the practice during mass protests triggered by a 2011 Russian parliamentary election tainted by numerous reports of voter fraud and then formed a group that has continued the work over the years.The data has been indispensable to news outlets over the years as Russian authorities largely kept quiet or underplayed the scale of mass arrests at protests and demonstrations.OVD-Info operates as a legal aid group as well, dispatching lawyers to help detained protesters at police stations and in courts. In September, a Sweden-based international human rights organization awarded OVD-Info its Civil Rights Defender of the Year award.That same month Russian authorities designated the group as a “foreign agent” — a label that comes with excessive government scrutiny and strong pejorative connotations that can discredit recipients. OVD-Info's founders vowed to continue the organization's work despite the designation.Russian authorities have mounted pressure on rights groups, media outlets and individual journalists in recent months, naming dozens as foreign agents. Some were declared as “undesirable” — a label that outlaws organizations in Russia — or accused of links to “undesirable” groups.On Friday, Russia's Justice Ministry added two more rights groups to the registry of foreign agents: Coming Out and Revers, which advocate for LGBT rights and provide assistance to Russia's embattled LGBT community.Russian law mandates a non-governmental organization, a media outlet, an informal movement or an individual to be listed as a foreign agent for having received foreign funding — even a small donation from a foreign national counts — and engaging in loosely defined political activity.OVD-Info, together with other rights groups, launched a campaign in September to abolish the “foreign agents” law. As of late December, more than 240 organizations and over 260,000 individuals had signed a petition that describes the law as “discriminatory and unlawful.”OVD-Info submitted the signatures to Russia's lower parliament house, the State Duma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-blocks-website-ovd-info-that-tracks-political-arrests-101640430946719.html
25-12-2021||World||New research claims Omicron has cold-like symptoms, resembles parainfluenza||Amid the global spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the scientists in the United Kingdom have said that its symptoms now match those of common cold. They have also urged the UK government to include more number of symptoms in its public health policy on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The most common symptoms reported by UK scientists are running nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats. This is based on the analysis of confirmed cases in London, as listed on the Zoe Covid app.At least half of those reporting cold-like symptoms tested positive for Covid-19, according to a Guardian report on the analysis of data. But only half of infected users also reported on classic three symptoms – fever, cough or loss of smell or taste – the Guardian report further said.A committee of scientific advisers had also backed this analysis in a meeting on Thursday, saying that the loss of smell or taste seems to be reported less frequently.On Thursday, Dr Bruce Patterson, who works for single cell diagnostic company IncellDx, also claimed that he has not seen as much of a loss of taste and smell compared to the previous variants.He added that fatigue is present in Omicron-affected patients too, like in the cases of other coronavirus variants.Dr Patterson said that Omicron looked similar to a virus called parainfluenza.So far, Omicron is causing less severe strain, compared to early variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. A doctor in the United Kingdom has revealed a new Covid-19 symptom caused by the Omicron variant - really bad night sweats.Dr Amir Khan, a physician with the UK’s National Health Service, told The Sun last week about the "telltale sign" - the sweats which are "those kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes”.Omicron was detected in samples in South Africa on November 24. Since then, it has been confirmed in more than 100 countries. Omicron has 37 mutations, due to which it is believed to be more resistant to drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-research-claims-omicron-has-cold-like-symptoms-looks-like-parainfluenza-101640427485954.html

He also mentioned that Elon Musk had to borrow money from friends to pay the rent.Responding to the tweet, Musk said it was the “crazy tough year”. He also recalled that Tesla's financing closed at 6pm on Christmas eve in 2008, the last hour of the last day possible, he added.“Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas,” he further replied.Pranay Pathole also thanked Elon Musk for never giving up.Also read | Elon Musk doppelganger? Viral video stuns netizens, but some say it's deepfake. Watch hereThat was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve – last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.Notably, Tesla was hard-hit during the financial crisis of 2008, according to reports. The company had to struggle like any other automobile company and was in dire need of cash to survive the recession years.This was not the first time Elon Musk was replying to a tweet by the engineer.Earlier, Musk had earlier replied to the engineer's tweet about him undergoing an internship to learn about the work. Musk had responded with some interesting facts about his internship days.“When @elonmusk was 18 he did an internship at Nova Scotia bank. It was over there where he realized that money is low bandwidth and you don't need huge infrastructure resources to online transfer money from one bank to another. This knowledge set him up on course to start X .com,” the tweet by Pathole said. To this Musk replied with some interesting inputs.“I worked for Peter Nicholson, who is awesome. Mostly, we exchanged math riddles, although I did figure out a multi-billion dollar arbitrage opportunity for the bank,” Musk wrote. He also spoke about another reason why he decided to leave the organisation and start anew.The tweet became quite popular with netizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/musk-reflects-on-tough-year-that-2008-was-for-tesla-in-a-reply-to-engineer-101640426620805.html

The latest incident took place in hamlets like Ganjgaal, Sarkano and Kunar - in the Bajaur area - on Friday. Various reports in the local media and videos tweeted by journalists show both the sides firing at each other.According to some reports, the firing continued for 30 minutes on Friday afternoon.The firing started after a sniper, reportedly belonging to the Taliban, shot dead two Pak soldiers where a border fence was being installed. The Pakistani side fired at border hamlets in response, prompting retaliation from the Afghan side.Heavy clashes took place in the area, with a number of shells and artillery hitting the villagers, the local reports further said.Meanwhile, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday claimed responsibility for the December 19 attack on federal minister Shibli Faraz in Darra Adam Khel in which his driver and bodyguard were injured.The latest border clashes come amid claims from both Taliban and Pakistan that they have resolved the recent row over border fencing by agreeing that further work on the project that led to a tense situation would be done through consensus.A senior official, who spoke to a group of journalists on Friday, said it had been decided at a senior level that fencing-related issues would in the future be dealt with through mutual agreement.The official, however, did not exactly specify at which level the talks between Pakistan and the de facto Afghan government were held after Wednesday’s incident in which Taliban fighters disrupted border fencing and took away spools of barbed wire, the Dawn newspaper reported.Pakistan has been fencing the 2600-kilometer-long border with Afghanistan since 2017 to end terrorist infiltration and smuggling despite very intense opposition from the neighbouring country, the report said.Besides the erection of a fence, the project also includes the construction of border posts and forts, and the raising of new wings of Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force that guards the border.The official said 90 per cent of the fencing had been completed.Fencing has been a contentious issue in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties because the Afghans dispute the border demarcation done during the colonial period.While Afghan Pashtuns define their country borders on basis of Durand Line, Pakistan is opposed to this demarcation.The differences over the status of the border have been so intense that they have in the past resulted in several fatal clashes between the troops of the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-troops-taliban-exchange-fire-along-durand-line-as-fencing-continues-101640426185783.html

Residents need special permission from their employer or local authorities to leave the city.Xi'an has recorded 330 locally transmitted symptomatic cases since the first case was reported on December 9 2021, few compared to outbreaks elsewhere in the world.But some 26 Xi'an government officials have been punished for lapses in virus prevention, China's disciplinary body said Friday.Local authorities who are deemed to have failed at controlling the virus in their region are regularly sacked or reprimanded under Beijing's strict zero-Covid approach.Cases from Xi'an have so far spread to five other cities including Beijing, according to state media, fuelling fears about how quickly the virus can spread geographically across the vast country.China has reported 100,871 symptomatic cases and fewer than 5,000 deaths since the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-biggest-daily-surge-in-covid-cases-in-4-months-amid-omicron-threat-101640421357326.html

During this time, she has made numerous trips to other countries to boost America’s ties. But now, she has talked about her “biggest failure” since becoming the Vice President.In an interview with CBS News, Harris talked about a number of issues, including her “biggest accomplishment”. The clips of the pre-recorded interview from CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’, which will air on Sunday, was posted on Twitter.In one of the clips, host Margaret Brennan asks Harris: "What do you think, as you come to the end of this first year, what do you think your biggest failure has been at this point?"The US Vice President replies: "To not get out of (Washington) DC more.""I mean, and I actually mean that sincerely for a number of reasons," Harris further said. "You know, I, we, the president and I came in, you know, Covid had already started. It was, the pandemic had started. And when we came in, we really couldn’t travel..@VP Harris admits that her biggest failure is not leaving DC more due to COVID: “My biggest concern is I don't ever want to be in a bubble when it comes to being aware of and in touch with what people need at any given moment.”More of @margbrennan’s exclusive interview, Sunday pic.twitter.com/8nH0ByAs7v"You know, a large part of the relationship that he and I have built has been being in this, you know, together in the same office for hours on end, doing Zooms or whatever because we couldn’t get out of DC, and on issues that are about fighting for anything from voting rights to child care, to one of the issues that I care deeply about, maternal health,” Harris was quoted as saying.She also talked about her “biggest accomplishment”: Inspiring children.WATCH: @VP Harris discusses her biggest accomplishment during her first year in office: Inspiring children.More of @margbrennan’s exclusive interview this Sunday on Face The Nation pic.twitter.com/nw4pQ66wcr"You know, a large part of the relationship that he and I have built has been being in this, you know, together in the same office for hours on end, doing Zooms or whatever because we couldn’t get out of DC, and on issues that are about fighting for anything from voting rights to child care, to one of the issues that I care deeply about, maternal health,” Harris was quoted as saying.She also talked about her “biggest accomplishment”: Inspiring children.|#+|Harris is currently spending the holidays in Los Angeles and was tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) following her close contact earlier this week with an aide who later tested positive.

The first woman vice president of the United States is struggling to find her place in the White House due to strained relations with the members of President Biden’s team, reported news agency AFP.The reports were based on exits of her chief spokesperson Symone Sanders and communications director Ashley Etienne.After taking over the Oval Office in January, Biden asked Harris to become a champion of voting rights even as the passage of any such legislation in Congress remains a remote prospect. She has been handed over the job of resolving the migration crisis at the southern border, an issue that several of Biden’s predecessors have failed to address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-kamala-harris-lists-her-biggest-failure-since-taking-office-101640416795878.html
25-12-2021||World||Omicron-free New Zealand celebrates Christmas without curbs||New Zealanders celebrated Christmas on Saturday in the warmth of mid-summer with few restrictions, in one of the few countries in the world largely untouched by the Omicron variant of Covid-19.Ninety-five percent of adults in New Zealand have had at least one dose of the vaccine, making it one of the world's most vaccinated populations. The only Omicron cases that have been found in New Zealand have been safely contained at the border.As Covid-19 spread around the world over the past two years, New Zealand used its isolation to its advantage. Border controls kept the worst of the virus at bay and by Christmas this year, New Zealand had recorded 50 deaths in a population of 5.5 million.The delta variant penetrated New Zealand’s defenses in August and its largest city, Auckland, was thrust into lockdown for 188 days. At its peak, the outbreak saw around 220 cases a day. Lately, the daily average has been around 50.But that success has come at a cost. There were empty chairs at some tables this holiday season because some New Zealanders living and working overseas have not been able to return home due to limits in the country's managed isolation and quarantine program.The traditional dining tables of a northern winter — turkey and all the trimmings — are common in New Zealand. But Kiwis also celebrate in an antipodean manner, with barbeques on beaches fringed by the native pohutukawa tree, which blooms only at Christmas.At New Zealand’s Scott Base in Antarctica, some New Zealanders enjoyed a white Christmas. During summer on the frozen continent, the sun never dips below the horizon and in 24 hours of daylight, the temperature hovers around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).Around 200 people pass through the base over the summer season — scientists, support staff, and Defense Force personnel who provide communications and other services. Numbers are lower this year because of the pandemic and all staff traveling to the continent have had to isolate and undergo Covid-19 testing before departure.“Adding a two-week isolation period and multiple Covid-19 tests to Antarctic pre-deployment is a big commitment for our people heading south this year,” Antarctica New Zealand chief executive Sarah Williams said. “But we want to ensure we’ve done everything we can to keep Antarctica Covid-19 free.”Most Pacific Island nations whose health systems might have been overwhelmed by Covid-19 outbreaks have largely managed to keep out the virus through strict border controls and high vaccination numbers.Fiji has an ongoing outbreak and has had almost 700 deaths. About 92% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, 97.7% have received at least one dose and many in the deeply religious nation will celebrate Christmas at traditional church services and family gatherings.Health Secretary James Fong, in a Christmas message, urged Fijians to “please celebrate wisely.”In remote Macuata province, residents of four villages received a special Christmas present: Electricity was connected to their villages for the first time.Australia celebrated Christmas amid a surge of Covid-19 cases, worse than at any stage of the pandemic, which forced states to reinstate mask mandates and other preventative measures. The Omicron strain is prevalent in some states and is estimated to represent more than 70% of all new cases in Queensland.In his Christmas message, Prime Minister Scott Morrison referenced Covid-19's toll on society.“This pandemic, it continues to buffet us,” Morrison said. “The Omicron variant is just the latest challenge that we have faced. But together, always together and only together, we keep pushing through.”Summer heat might have discouraged outdoor Christmas feasts in some places. The temperature in Perth in Western Australia was expected to hit 42 Celsius on Saturday, making it the hottest Christmas since records began more than a century ago.On Christmas Eve, a student driver in the Northern Territory made off with a truck containing more than $10,000 in Christmas hams that were empty when it was found.“This behavior can only be described as Grinch-like,” police detective Mark Bland said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicronfree-new-zealand-celebrates-christmas-without-curbs-101640402458211.html
25-12-2021||World||'Let's Go Brandon': Caller taunts Biden during White House Christmas event||President Joe Biden was trolled by a caller Friday who said "Let's Go Brandon" -- a coded insult that has become a rallying cry for supporters of Donald Trump -- during a White House Christmas Eve event.The incident, which quickly went viral online, took place after Biden and First Lady Jill Biden spoke by video conference with North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) officials, who track Santa's travel across the globe.After being assured of St Nick's progress, the president fielded calls from several American families.One man identified himself as "Jared," a father of four. Biden spoke briefly with the caller's children, asking what presents they wanted for Christmas and telling them they needed to be in bed before midnight. He also remarked on how he and Jared both had sons named Hunter.Wrapping up the call, Biden wished Jared a "wonderful Christmas.""I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas as well, Merry Christmas, and let's go Brandon!" Jared replied."Let's go Brandon, I agree," returned Biden, without reacting to the dig. It was not immediately clear if the president had understood the reference, though Jill Biden chuckled uncomfortably and rolled her eyes.Biden asked Jared where he was calling from, but by then the call had been disconnected. A clip of the moment spread widely on social media, with some praising the president for his calm response."Let's Go Brandon" is a euphemism for a vulgar insult that originated when a reporter at a NASCAR event misheard a chant of "F- Joe Biden" while interviewing driver Brandon Brown in September.Since then it has been taken up as a political slogan by supporters of Trump, Biden's predecessor.Trump had his own headline-grabbing Christmas Eve moment when, in 2018, he raised doubts about Santa's existence in a call with a seven-year-old boy."Are you still a believer in Santa Claus? 'Cuz at seven it's marginal, right?" he said.The Santa tracker presented by NORAD dates to 1955, when a Colorado newspaper advertisement misprinted a phone number to connect children with Santa and mistakenly directed them to the military nerve center hotline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lets-go-brandon-caller-taunts-biden-during-white-house-christmas-event-101640400727427.html
25-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: 108 countries and over 1.5 lakh patients in a month||The Omicron variant, which was first reported last month from South Africa, has fuelled thousands of cases worldwide and forced governments to impose stricter restrictions including travel bans.The speed with which Omicron infections have spread can be gauged from the fact that in just one month 108 countries have reported 151,368 cases and there have been 26 deaths.The first case of Omicron was reported on November 24 in South Africa and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a variant of concern within a couple of days as experts said it has an unusually high number of mutations that could make it more transmissible and even result in immune evasion.South AfricaIn South Africa, Delta was responsible for only 2 per cent of new cases in early May, rising to 89 per cent by July 12. On the other hand, the first case of Omicron was detected on November 24 and as of December 13, the latest variant has become a major variant in South Africa. At present, data shows there are 95 per cent of Omicron cases in the country.BritainIn Britain, only 0.10 per cent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases were due to Delta as of April 5, which increased to 74 per cent by the end of May. By June, the Delta variant was behind more than 90 per cent of the Covid-19 cases.Also read | Omicron fallout: Over 4,000 flights cancelled world over on Christmas weekendNow, coronavirus infections in the UK have broken records within a month due to Omicron.

25-12-2021||World||South Africa to stop contact tracing as 80% have some immunity||South Africa will stop coronavirus contact tracing and won’t ask those who’ve been directly exposed to infected people to quarantine, indicating a shift away from tough restrictions to contain the pandemic.Authorities in Africa’s most-industrialised nation will only try and track the spread of the disease in a cluster outbreak, the nation’s director-general of health said in a circular dated Thursday. As much as 80% of the population has some sort of immunity from prior illness or vaccines, the department said.“Containment strategies are no longer appropriate -- mitigation is the only viable strategy,” Sifiso Buthelezi said in the missive. “Quarantine has been costly to essential services and society as many people stay away from their work and thus lose their income.”While South Africa’s contact tracing has been negligible compared with many countries outside the continent, the move still represents a change in approach even as the highly transmissible omicron variant continues to rage. The government declared a state of disaster when the coronavirus arrived in March 2020 and has followed an alert level-based system of curbs depending on the prevalence of infections ever since.The rationale provided for the strategy change “is that the quarantine process does not have a major effect in terms of chains of transmission and is difficult to implement and sustain,” Adrian Puren, acting executive director of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said in an e-mailed response to questions. The shift may also be influenced by South Africa’s push to recover from its deepest economic contraction in at least a quarter-century last year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict gross domestic product will expand 4.9% in 2021, compared with a previous estimate of 5.1%, partly due to travel bans that followed omicron’s emergence. The nation’s official jobless rate is at a record of almost 35%, with a lack of major sports and entertainment events restricting even informal work.Omicron was identified by scientists in South Africa and Botswana last month, and the region has been the front runner in the latest phase of the global pandemic. Yet there are positive indications that the variant does not lead to the same extent of severe illness and death as previous incarnations, and the South African government has held off toughening containment measures as a result.Those contracting Covid-19 in the current fourth wave of infections are 80% less likely to be hospitalized compared with other strains, according to a study released by the NICD this week. Meanwhile, there are indications the surge may already have peaked in some areas, with the reproductive rate -- or the number of people to which each infected person passes on the virus -- falling below one in Gauteng, omicron’s original epicenter.  That may be affected by the time of year, which sees many migrant workers and holidaymakers travel out of Johannesburg and Pretoria to rural and coastal areas. The seven-day rolling average of new confirmed infections in the country has slumped to less than 17,000 from a peak of more than 23,000 on Dec. 18, although that data may also be skewed by reporting lags over the holiday seasons and the rationing of tests. Just over 9,200 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized, about half the number during the height of previous waves. “The initial data show that inland provinces have reached a peak and Gauteng has a sharp decline in cases,” Puren said. “It does not mean that we are over the fourth resurgence as there is still accumulation of cases and the coastal provinces have not reached their peak infections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-to-stop-contact-tracing-as-80-have-some-immunity-101640397099197.html
25-12-2021||World||Christmas celebrations subdued in Bethlehem for 2nd year due to Covid-19||In Bethlehem's Manger Square, visitors in Santa hats and scouts beating drums marked Christmas Eve on Friday, but numbers were lower than usual as coronavirus fears overshadowed celebrations for a second straight year.The city where Christians believe Jesus was born is usually a focal point of the holiday, with thousands packing the streets and filling hotels.But Israel, which controls all entrances to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, barred its borders to foreigners in an effort to rein in infections from the Omicron strain of the coronavirus."It's very strange," said Kristel Elayyan, a Dutchwoman married to a Palestinian, who came to Bethlehem from Jerusalem."Before (the pandemic), you had a bunch of people coming in from different countries to celebrate Christmas, and now you know that everybody who is here is probably not a tourist."Last year, Bethlehem curtailed celebrations sharply because of the pandemic, with a virtual tree lighting and just a handful of visiting scouts.This year, the celebrations were more vibrant -- but still a fraction of their usual size."If it's one year, it's an interesting experience," Elayyan said of the pandemic. "But because this is the second year and we don't know what is going to come in the future, it's a huge loss for the people here."Local visitorsAn upbeat Palestinian tourism minister, Rula Maayah, said it was "thanks to the vaccines" that Bethlehem was celebrating again.In his homily for midnight mass celebrated in St Catherine's Church in Bethlehem, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Pierbattista Pizzaballa said it was encouraging that celebrations were "certainly more joyful this year"."Compared to last year's Christmas, the participation is much greater and this is an encouraging sign," he told the masked congregation, but regretted the absence of foreign worshippers due to the pandemic."We pray for them and at the same time ask for their prayers, so that all this may end soon and that the city of Bethlehem may once again be full of pilgrims."On average, Bethlehem welcomed three million visitors a year before the pandemic, with Christmas alone drawing 10,000 people to the city's hotels, around half from abroad.The municipality said it worked this year to appeal to local visitors from Palestinian communities across the Holy Land.Some hotels were busy, but about a quarter of available rooms citywide were shuttered because of the pandemic, said Elias Arja, head of the Palestinian Hotel Association.Several businesses kept their doors shut on Friday, despite Christmas Eve being the most important day of the year for many in Bethlehem.Inside the Church of the Nativity, visitors were even able to meditate nearly alone at the grotto where Jesus is said to have been born."Surreal," observed Hudson Harder, a 21-year-old American student at Hebrew University in Jerusalem."Of course, there is a selfish part where it's like, 'Oh, I get to see this place so empty' but on the other hand you feel for the shops, all the money they are losing."'Worse than war'Steps away from the basilica, images of Popes John Paul II and Francis covered the front of a shop selling carved olive wood figures and nativity scenes.Owner Victor Epiphane Tabash said it was his 57th Christmas behind the counter. For him, as for many shopkeepers around Manger Square, "there is nothing to say about Christmas"."Only the scouts give a bit of the holiday feeling," he said, as the uniformed groups marched past, blasting out Christmas carols on drums, trumpets and bagpipes.Tabash said he kept his business alive during the pandemic by exporting because no customers came to buy in person. He compared the pandemic to two previous Palestinian uprisings, or intifadas."We have lived through the intifadas, wars. But the coronavirus is worse," he said.Outside, Maram Saeed, a Palestinian woman from Jerusalem, took a selfie with her husband and two children in front of a towering Christmas tree decorated with shining red and gold spheres.Saeed said it was a time of joy after many days of depression."It's not like a usual year, we have the fear of the worst, we still fear Covid," she told AFP."When there is war, we know the enemy, and we know who we are fighting. But with Covid, it's a very tiny enemy that we don't see, so it's worse."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-celebrations-subdued-in-bethlehem-for-2nd-year-due-to-covid19-101640395549117.html

He joined Lawyers for Human Rights in 1993 and went on to become its national director in 1995, serving in that position until the end of 1996.In 1997, he took up a post as commissioner of the South African Human Rights Commission and went on to serve as chair of the commission for seven years from 2002 until 2009. He was appointed as chair of the South African Law Reform Commission in April 2016.Kollapen serves on the structures of numerous NGOs and community-based organisations, including the Legal Resources Centre, the Foundation for Human Rights, and Laudium Care Services for the Aged.He has also been invited to speak on human rights issues across the world, including at the United Nations and Harvard University.He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Durban University of Technology; the Turquoise Harmony Institute's award for his contribution to society in the area of law and human rights; and a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Congress of Business and Economics, which was born out of the erstwhile Transvaal Indian Congress from the days when Mahatma Gandhi was in South Africa.In 2010, while in the position of acting Constitutional Court judge, Kollapen made a strong statement about cultural and national identity as the keynote speaker at the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the religious organisation Siva Gnana Sabhay in Lenasia.Kollapen said there was no need to shy away from the unique Indian identity, culture, and religion brought to South Africa by the first indentured labourers 150 years earlier, but that South Africans of Indian origin should use this to help build the rainbow nation as citizens of the country.Kollapen's mother was among the women in the historic protest march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the seat of the apartheid-era government, in 1956 to protest discriminatory laws. She was arrested and jailed twice for her participation in passive resistance protests.Kollapen often recalled how his mother had told him that she was pregnant with him at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-judge-appointed-to-south-africa-s-highest-judicial-bench-101640394661127.html
25-12-2021||World||James Webb telescope, successor of Hubble, set to be most powerful observatory ever sent into space||James Webb Space Telescope, a revolutionary instrument designed to provide mankind with the first-ever glimpse into an infant universe as it existed when the earliest galaxies are believed to have been formed, will be launched on Saturday by Nasa.The device, which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hails as the “premiere space-science observatory of the next decade”, is set for launch on December 25, from the northeastern coast of South America, according to an official statement.If all goes according to plan, the French-built Ariane 5 rocket will blast off from the European Space Agency (ESA)'s launch base in French Guiana at 1220 GMT (5:50pm Indian Standard Time) with the telescope bundled inside its cargo bay area.After a 26-minute ride into space, the rocket will release the 14,000-pound instrument, which will then unfurl to nearly the size of a tennis court.What is the James Webb Space Telescope?Named after James Edwin Webb, the chief of the American space agency during most of the agency's formative decade of the 1960s, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is planned to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as Nasa's flagship astrophysics mission.The new space telescope is about 100 times more sensitive than its predecessor, Hubble, and is expected to profoundly transform scientists' understanding of the universe and our place in it.With improved infrared resolution and sensitivity, the JWST will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterisation of potentially habitable exoplanets.The telescope will also help astronomers better study supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, and planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy. More specifically, astronomers will be able to study for the first time ever the “dark ages” of the universe, the history of which remains mostly unknown.When is the launch?The JWST is scheduled for lift-off on the back of the Ariane flight VA256 at 5:50pm IST on Saturday – Christmas Day – from a European-managed spaceport in South America's French Guiana. The launch window will stretch for over half an hour to ensure that there are no last-minute errors or technical snags.Nasa will run a live stream on its YouTube channel beginning at 4:30pm, and on its Twitter and Facebook accounts as well beginning at the same time. Moreover, the European Space Agency will also be running its own live stream in French and Spanish languages on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-webb-telescope-successor-of-hubble-set-to-be-most-powerful-observatory-ever-sent-into-space-101640389184130.html
25-12-2021||World||Greece: 13 dead, others missing in new migrant boat accident in Aegean Sea||At least 13 people died after a migrant boat capsized in the Aegean Sea late Friday, bringing to at least 27 the combined death toll from three accidents in as many days involving migrant boats in Greek waters.The sinkings came as smugglers increasingly favor a perilous route from Turkey to Italy, which avoids Greece’s heavily patrolled eastern Aegean islands that for years were at the forefront of the country’s migration crisis.The coast guard said 62 people were rescued after a sailboat capsized late Friday some 8 kilometers (5 miles) off the island of Paros, in the central Aegean. Survivors told the coast guard that about 80 people had been on the vessel.Five coast guard patrol boats, nine private vessels, a helicopter and a military transport plane continued the night-time search for more survivors, authorities said, while coast guard divers also participated.Smugglers based in Turkey increasingly have packed yachts with migrants and refugees and sent them toward Italy.Earlier, 11 people were confirmed dead after a sailboat Thursday struck a rocky islet some 235 kilometers (145 miles) south of Athens, near the island of Antikythera. The coast guard said Friday that 90 survivors ‒ 52 men, 11 women and 27 children ‒ were rescued after spending hours on the islet.“People need safe alternatives to these perilous crossings,” the Greek office of the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet.In a separate incident Friday, Greek police arrested three people on smuggling charges and detained 92 migrants after a yacht ran aground in the southern Peloponnese region.And a search operation also continued for a third day in the central Aegean, where a boat carrying migrants sank near the island of Folegandros, killing at least three people. Thirteen others were rescued, and the survivors reported that at least 17 people were missing. Authorities said the passengers originally were from Iraq.Greece is a popular entry point into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But arrivals dropped sharply in the last two years after Greece extended a wall at the Turkish border and began intercepting inbound boats carrying migrants and refugees ‒ a tactic criticized by human rights groups.More than 116,000 asylum-seekers crossed the Mediterranean to reach EU countries this year as of Dec. 19, according to UNHCR. The agency said 55% traveled illegally to Italy, 35% to Spain, and 7% to Greece, with the remainder heading to Malta and Cyprus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-13-dead-others-missing-in-new-migrant-boat-accident-in-aegean-sea-101640390348643.html
25-12-2021||World||Omicron fallout: Over 4,000 flights canceled world over on Christmas weekend||Commercial airlines around the world canceled more than 4,300 flights over the Christmas weekend, as a mounting wave of Covid-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant created greater uncertainty and misery for holiday travelers.Airline carriers globally scrapped at least 2,366 flights on Friday, which fell on Christmas Eve and is typically a heavy day for air travel, according to a running tally on the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Nearly 9,000 more flights were delayed.The website showed that 1,616 Christmas Day flights were called off worldwide, along with 365 more that had been scheduled for Sunday.Commercial air traffic within the United States and into or out of the country accounted for more than a quarter of all the canceled flights over the weekend, FlightAware data showed.Among the first US carriers to report a wave of holiday weekend cancellations were United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which scrubbed nearly 280 flights combined on Friday alone, citing personnel shortages amid the surge of Covid-19 infections.Covid-19 infections have surged in the United States in recent days due to the highly transmissible variant Omicron, which was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of US cases and as many as 90% in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard.The average number of new US coronavirus cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.New York reported more than 44,000 newly confirmed infections on Friday alone, shattering that state's daily record. At least 10 other states set new one-day case records on Thursday or Friday.Rising hospitalizations were hitting healthcare systems especially hard in the US Midwest, with intensive care units in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan bracing for the worst even as they remain under pressure from an earlier wave of Delta variant cases.In Britain, many industries and transport networks were struggling with staff shortages as sick workers self-isolated, while hospitals have warned of the risk of an impact on patient safety.One in 20 Londoners had Covid-19 last week, a figure that could rise to one in 10 by early next week, according to data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics. https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/one-10-londoners-likely-infected-with-covid-ons-models-2021-12-24Government data showed a record tally of 122,186 new infections nationwide on Friday, marking a third day in which the number of known cases has surpassed 100,000.While recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness, and a lower rate of hospitalizations, than previous variants of Covid-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook."There is a glimmer of Christmas hope ... but it definitely isn't yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat," Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC.France hit another Covid-19 infection record on Friday, with its daily tally exceeding 94,000 while hospitalizations from the virus reached a seven-month high, prompting the government to convene a special meeting for Monday that could trigger new public health restrictions.Despite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season.Moses Jimenez, an accountant from Long Beach, Mississippi, flew to New York with his wife and three children, even though the latest torrent of coronavirus cases dashed their hopes of catching a Broadway performance of "Hamilton" or visit some museums."Hamilton" was one of a dozen productions to cancel shows this week as cast and crew members tested positive for Covid-19. Museums were scratched from the family's itinerary because many now require proof of vaccination and the two younger children are ineligible for the shot.Instead, Jimenez, 33, said his brood will make the best of roaming the city's streets and parks, while also seeing relatives and friends."We just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas," Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York's LaGuardia Airport.New York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year's Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-scale-down-new-years-eve-celebrations-times-square-2021-12-23, capping the number of attendees 15,000.The Biden administration will next week lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the Omicron variant, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-fallout-over-4-000-flights-canceled-world-over-on-christmas-weekend-101640388978794.html

The Kremlin reiterated on Friday that it reserves the right to move its own forces on Russian territory as it sees fit and that Western countries were carrying out provocative military manoeuvres near its borders.US, European and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of building up troops again near Ukraine’s border since October after an earlier brief buildup in April, when Maxar also released images. US President Joe Biden and other leaders say Moscow appears to be weighing an attack on Ukraine as soon as next month, something Moscow has repeatedly denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-expect-us-answer-on-security-guarantees-next-month-101640386048185.html

Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.“The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in profound reductions in the department’s visa processing capacity,” it said in a statement. “As global travel rebounds, we are taking these temporary steps to further our commitment to safely and efficiently reduce visa wait times while maintaining national security as our priority.”The consular officers will now be temporarily authorised to waive in-person interviews for nearly a dozen visa categories, including Persons in Specialty Occupations (H1B visas), visas for students, temporary agricultural and non-agricultural workers, student exchange visitors, as well as athletes, artists and entertainers.The state department also said it has extended indefinitely the authorisation to waive the in-person interview for applicants renewing a visa in the same visa class within 48 months of the prior visa’s expiration.US state department in March 2020 had suspended all routine visa services in most countries due to the pandemic. While the services have been reinstated with a limited capacity and on a priority basis, months-long wait times for certain visa appointments persist due to a massive backlog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-waives-in-person-visa-interviews-in-a-bid-to-cut-wait-times-101640385810447.html

Passengers were required to be vaccinated and they were tested before leaving last Saturday, according to Carnival.“Carnival Freedom is following all protocols and has a small number on board who are in isolation due to a positive Covid test," the statement said. “Our protocols anticipate this possibility and we implement them as necessary to protect the health and safety of our guests and crew."Ashley Peterson, a passenger on the ship, tweeted a photo of a Dec. 22 letter from the ship's captain apologizing for being unable to make the stops in Aruba and Bonaire. The letter said passengers would get $100 per room in onboard credit and refunds for excursions planned at the two stops.“We know these unexpected changes are disappointing and impact your cruise vacation, however we trust you understand this is outside our control," said the letter from Capt.

There is no leadership change,” Nalin Kumar Kateel, the state BJP president, told reporters in Bengaluru on Saturday. The Chief Minister, who would complete five months in office in the next couple of days, had turned emotional in his home town Shiggaon in Haveri district a few days ago and said he was aware of the fact that posts and positions were not forever, raising eyebrows.However, Kateel termed these talks of leadership change, a conspiracy.According to him, when senior BJP leader B S Yediyurappa became the chief minister, speculations started about his exit but he remained in power for two years.”This news (about Bommai’s exit) is a figment of imagination. I feel this is a conspiracy to create confusion, problem in the state politics and to defame the BJP government,” Kateel said.He suspected the involvement of Congress behind spreading the rumours.Kateel also ruled out Bommai going abroad for the treatment of his knee related ailment.“He is not going abroad. There is nothing wrong with his health but only some leg related issues for which he is getting treatment. He is healthy. His leg related problem will be cured here only,” Kateel said.He added that Bommai was supposed to go abroad from the government side, which has been postponed. Hence, the foreign trip has been cancelled.Union Minister for coal and mines Pralhad Joshi too dismissed the issue of leadership change.“I have made it clear several times that Basavaraj Bommai will remain as Chief Minister till 2023 and under his leadership, the government is performing well and bringing good name,” Joshi told reporters in Hubballi.He said it was wrong to spread such news as there was no issue of leadership change.“There is no leadership change. I am always in touch with our national level leaders regularly and I have good relationship with them. If such was the case, then certainly I would have come to know. There is no such proposal. He is doing a good job,” the union minister said.Ruling out Bommai’s foreign trip, Joshi said such speculations should not be given any credence.To a query on cabinet rejig, Joshi said there were no such discussions happening at the state and national level as of now||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-to-be-cm-till-23-polls-karnataka-bjp-chief-101640456070503.html

But as a preventive measure, from tomorrow onwards it has been decided to conduct tests on 10 per cent of passengers arriving from ‘non-risk’ countries as against the current practice of randomly selecting two per cent of the passengers”, he said..Subramanian said the Omicron variant can spread fast in crowded places and appealed to hotels and pubs to avoid conducting New Year celebrations.In another significant development, the Minister said 39 persons who had come in contact with doctors, nurses and medical workers at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital have been detected with the ‘S’gene drop variant of COVID-19.He said a doctor who performed a surgery on a patient on December 17 has tested positive, following which 3,038 of his ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ contacts were tested, of whom 54 contracted COVID-19. “Of the 54 people, 39 have been detected with the ‘s’ gene drop variant. Their samples have been sent to the National institute of Virology, Pune for genomic sequencing analysis. All the patients are aysmptomatic and are doing well”, he said.To a query on Tamil actor Vadivelu testing COVID-19 positive, he said RT-PCR tests done on both the actor and film director Siraaj at the international airport here on their return from the United Kingdom had confirmed it.“They have been admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College Hospital. Both have been detected with the ‘S’ gene variant, following which their samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune for genomic sequencing analysis. Both are asymptomatic and are doing well”, he said.The minister said the 16th edition of the state-wide Mega Vaccination Camp would be held on Sunday and urged the 94 lakh people eligible to receive the second dose of vaccination to make use of the opportunity and take the jab.“In Tamil Nadu, 85 per cent of the people have received the first dose and 55.8 per cent, the second dose,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-plans-random-testing-of-10-international-passengers-from-non-risk-countries-101640456067982.html

But the State government has not taken steps so far to provide the ex gratia,” Palaniswami alleged in a statement here.On December 6, the State government issued an order granting an ex gratia of ₹50,000 from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to the kin of those who died due to Coronavirus, and others who lost their lives in operations or associated with preparedness activities.Palaniswami pointed out that the Supreme Court had directed all States to give wide publicity to make people aware of the procedure and where to approach to make the claim for Covid ex gratia.“Further delay in disbursing the ex gratia would only create a situation leading to the affected families to take to the streets and agitate. Hence, I urge the Chief Minister to immediately disburse the ex gratia,” the leader of the opposition in Tamil Nadu assembly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-aiadmk-urges-govt-to-urgently-disburse-aid-to-kin-of-covid-victims-101640456007258.html

Among the infected people, four have symptoms of the new variant of coronavirus.The state government and especially the district administration of Bengaluru have already placed measures to contain the spread, falling back on restrictions as the antidote to the virus. Prohibitory orders will be issued ahead of New Year celebrations, which are likely to restrict movement within the city on New Year’s Eve after prescribed hours, Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said on Friday.Karnataka has already put other measures in place like restricting entry to unvaccinated people to malls, theatres, pubs and restaurants as a move to increase vaccination coverage. “We will issue a prohibitory order on Monday and Tuesday. It will be difficult to restrict gatherings in public places without such an order. Since the Assembly session is going on, we will need to announce the decision once ministers are back in Bengaluru,” said Pant, HT reported. However, malls were seen with haphazard attempts to check customers who continue to throng these venues on account of attractive sales and spending time with family and friends during the holiday season. Karnataka on Saturday logged 270 fresh Covid-19 cases and four deaths, taking the caseload to 3,004,239 and the toll to 38,309. Recoveries numbered 246, taking the total to 2,958,630, leaving 7,271 active cases, a health department bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-reports-7-new-omicron-cases-cm-to-hold-meet-today-101640455953661.html
25-12-2021||India||Coxavin gets DCGI nod for use among 12-18 age group||New Delhi The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Saturday approved Covaxin for use in children between the ages of 12 and 18, a significant step towards opening vaccinations to the age group that has so far remained ineligible in India’s immunisation programme against Covid-19.The decision came shortly before Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation and announced that the government was opening vaccinations to children between the ages of 15 and 18 from January 3 next year.“Covaxin receives approval for emergency use in children 12-18 years of age... We have documented excellent safety and immunogenicity data readouts in children,” the maker of the vaccine, Bharat Biotech, said in a statement.India previously approved ZyCoV-D, a vaccine made by Zydus Cadila, for those between the ages of 12 and 18 (there are around 150 million), although vaccinations in children did not begin after the move.The move comes amid concerns of the spread of Omicron, a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus. Children are likely to remain less at risk due to their inherent immunity advantage, experts have said, but a highly transmissible virus will breach deeper into the population, posing a greater threat to any child with compromised immunity.The approval from DCGI came nearly 10 weeks after the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended Covaxin’s use in children based on clinical trial data submitted by the Hyderabad-based company. The panel recommended the use of the vaccine in those aged between two and 18.Covaxin is one of the two Covid-19 vaccines that are the mainstay in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme; the other vaccine is Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield, which is being locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.“The Drugs Controller General of India took his time to approve the vaccine for paediatric use after carefully scrutinising the data and looking at some additional data from around the world where vaccination in children has begun. It is a sensitive matter, which is why it made sense to be thorough before granting approval,” a senior official in the ministry of health and family welfare said on condition of anonymity.For a vaccine to be included formally in the government’s coronavirus immunisation campaign for children or adults, DCGI’s approval is mandatory. Six Covid-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorisation by the national drugs regulator so far based on the recommendations of the subject expert committee.Experts welcomed the approval and said it was high time children were vaccinated against Covid-19.“Children may not get severe disease but there will always be the risk of others getting infected through children, especially elders and those at high risk in the family,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of the respiratory medicine department, Fortis Healthcare.

SDPI has alleged that RSS workers are behind this attack.Earlier, an RSS worker S Sanjith was hacked to death allegedly by the workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of the PFI, on November 15. Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan has said that the Kerala government is utilizing the Alappuzha twin murder issue to denigrate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and alleged that “the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) is a terrorist organization.”“Kerala government is utilizing Alappuzha twin murder issue to denigrate RSS. They will (state police chief) prepare a list of RSS and SDPI members with a criminal background. The 2 cannot be equated. SDPI is a terrorist organization,” Muraleedharan told ANI.Kerala DGP Anil Kant has issued fresh guidelines in the wake of the Alappuzha murder case. As per the guidelines, officials have been told to prepare a district-wise list of those previously involved in criminal cases, including members of the RSS and the SDPI.MoS added, “Criminal list should be impartial without considering the party a person belongs to. In Kerala, the largest number of criminals will be from CPIM anyway. Cases of thousands of CPIM workers were withdrawn when this govt came to power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alappuzha-twin-killings-7-more-held-for-sdpi-leader-s-murder-says-kerala-police-101640455947214.html
25-12-2021||India||Karnataka anti-conversion bill: We lacked majority in Upper House, says CM Bommai||A day after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided against tabling the bill the controversial anti-conversion bill in the Upper House, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday said that the decision was based on the lack of a clear majority in the state legislature. “It is clear. We don’t have support in the upper house and there were three or four of our legislators who were not present,” Bommai said. In the Lower House, the bill, titled The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Act, 2021, was discussed for barely a few hours before it was passed with a voice vote over the screaming and sloganeering by Congress on Thursday. While the BJP has a clear majority in the state legislative council, it still has to depend on the JD(S) to make it past the halfway mark of 38 in the 75-seater Upper House. As it stands, there are 32 BJP members in the house, 29 of the Congress and 12 of the JD(S). This will change after the newly elected members enter the council, with BJP much closer to the halfway mark at 37 after the party won 11 seats in the December 10 MLC polls while the Congress will be at 26. The JD(S) has been reduced to 10. The key will be which way the independent candidate Lakhan Jarkiholi will swing.At least two people aware of the developments said that the bill will now be passed in the joint session of the House, though it remains unclear when it will be held or how the party will muster the required numbers, considering that the BJP has far bigger problems with its leadership. “We will get the support of Lakhan Jarkiholi since two of his brothers (Balachandra and Ramesh) are legislators in our party,” said one BJP MLC, requesting not to be named. The vote on this bill could help Ramesh and Balchandra assuage some of the anger within their party, a section of who believe that they put the interests of their family before that of the party’s. According to people in the know of the developments, Ramesh believes that he can get Lakhan into the BJP, but has revived his earlier demand of being reinducted into the cabinet. Another brother of the influential and powerful sugar barons, Satish Jarkiholi a legislator with the Congress, might also be called in from within his party to help Lakhan not cast his vote in favour of the BJP. The JD(S), which walked out in “protest” during the anti-cattle slaughter bill in February, had indirectly helped the BJP in February (to do what?). The JD (S) has tried to play neutral this time, blaming both national parties for drafting a bill that would impact its voter base or at least does not see any significant improvement to its poll prospects by denting a move to its secular credentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-anti-conversion-bill-we-lacked-majority-in-upper-house-says-cm-bommai-101640455888516.html

Yogi also inaugurated and laid foundation stones for projects worth ₹230 crore for Bateshwar and assured that all efforts would be made to develop it as a prominent pilgrimage in honour of Vajpayee. The former PM’s birth anniversary was observed as ‘Sushashan Diwas’ (Good Governance Day) all over the country. Yogi viewed the photo gallery on the life of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and addressed the gathering at a ground in Bateshwar. “Former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a great personality and had such a good reputation that even his opponents could not criticize him. He was an open-hearted person who said that one needed to think big if one intended to do big. In his political career spread over six decades, there was not a single allegation regarding his personality,” said the chief minister. “Atalji inspired us all and paved the way for various schemes in favour of the poor and needy. He gave different schemes for developing road network and free ration for the poor and always stood in favour of the last man in the chain of development. All through his life, he stood for ethics and principles,” said Yogi Adityanath. The CM targeted the Samajwadi Party leadership, without taking names, and blamed them for ‘loot’ while in power in the state. “They had been out of power for the past five years, yet ₹200 crores are being unearthed from their houses in income tax raids. Where did this money come from? It seems to be that which was looted and stored when they were in power in the state,” alleged the CM. “Money meant for poor was wasted on subjects like kabristan (graveyard) in previous regime. Those not even knowing Urdu were appointed as Urdu translators and posts were created for them but nothing was done for students and teachers of Sanskrit. It was during the BJP’s regime that Sanskrit schools were taken care of,” claimed the CM. “The previous regimes in Uttar Pradesh committed a crime by denying the benefits due to the poor. The cash now being unearthed from opposition party leaders and supporters was meant for the poor but was misappropriated. The BJP has given due share to the poor through various schemes like PM Awas Yojna,” he said. “Our government is now giving tablets and smart phones to youth in Uttar Pradesh. There are various schemes in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Medical colleges, residential schools and intermediate schools are coming up in his name,” said the chief minister, promising that a museum, a ‘sanskritik sankul (cultural complex) and park in name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee would soon come up in Bateshwar. Also present on the occasion were cabinet minister Mahendra Singh, former minister Aridaman Singh, MP from Fatehpur Sikri Rajkumar Chahar and MLA from Bah Rani Pakshalika Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cm-pays-tribute-to-vajpayee-in-paternal-village-lays-foundation-for-new-projects-101640455587398.html

Unity is essential for us all.”“Today, when the country is taking inspiration from its struggle for independence, from its past, at such a time, ideals of our gurus become even more important,” Modi said. “Behind all the efforts taken by the country and its commitments are dreams that it has been waiting for to fulfil.”Every year, from December 23 to 25, the Sikh community in Gujarat celebrate the Gurpurab of Guru Nanak Dev at Gurudwara Lakhpat Sahib, where he had stayed during the course of his travels, and which has his relics, including wooden footwear and palkhi (cradle), as well as manuscripts and marking scripts of Gurmukhi.Meanwhile, Modi also donated ₹1,000 to the coffers of Bharatiya Janata Party, which launched a micro-donation drive on the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on December 25, which will continue till 11 February, the death anniversary of Bharatiya Jan Sangh leader Deen Dayal Upadhyay.“Our ideal of always putting Nation First and the culture of lifelong selfless service by our cadre will be further strengthened by your micro-donation,” the Prime Minister tweeted. “Help make BJP strong. Help make India strong.” The BJP has received over ₹7.85 billion in contributions from corporates, electoral trusts and individuals between 2019 and 2020, according to the latest contribution report submitted by the party to the Election Commission in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-stand-united-against-all-adversity-pm-modi-on-gurpurab-101640455408544.html

It has topped the other states (Group B) category in judiciary and public safety, environment and citizen-centric governance.In the Northeast and Hill States category, Mizoram, and Jammu and Kashmir have registered an overall increase of 10.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively over GGI 2019.Mizoram has performed strongly in commerce and industry, human resource development, public health and economic governance.Jammu and Kashmir has performed strongly in commerce and industry sector and has improved its scores in agriculture and allied sector, public infrastructure and utilities and judiciary and public safety sectors.The GGI 2021 said that in the union territories category, Delhi tops the composite rank registering a 14 per cent increase over the GGI 2019 indicators. Delhi has performed strongly in agriculture and allied sectors, commerce and industry, public infrastructure and utilities and social welfare and development.The GGI 2021 said that 20 states have improved their composite GGI scores over the GGI 2019 index scores. The sector-wise scores attained by the states and union territories indicates that strong performance in one or the other sector.Analysis of scoring also suggests that there is a very marginal difference among the states in their composite governance scores. This indicates that overall governance in the states of India is moving in the positive direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-launches-good-governance-index-2021-gujarat-tops-composite-ranking-101640445626513.html

25-12-2021||India||Support for anti-conversion bill in Upper House likely to be tougher for Karnataka BJP||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday said that the decision of not tabling the controversial anti-conversion bill was based on the lack of a clear majority in the upper house of the state legislature.“It is clear. We don’t have support in the upper house and there were three or four of our legislators who were not present,” Bommai said on Saturday.The statements come a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided against tabling the bill, titled The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Act, 2021, in the upper house, delaying a proposed legislation that is key to the saffron outfit’s core ideology to prevent any possible conversion from among the Hindus. The BJP had rushed through the bill in the lower house despite stiff opposition from the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S).The bill, which has sent ripples across the minority communities in the state, was discussed for barely a few hours before it was passed with a voice vote over the screaming and sloganeering by the Congress.While the BJP has a clear majority in the assembly, as it stands, it still has to depend on the JD(S) to make it past the halfway mark of 38 in the 75-seater house.At least two people aware of the developments said that the bill will now be passed in the joint session of the house, though it remains unclear when it will be held or how the party will muster the required numbers, considering that the BJP has far bigger problems with its leadership.As it stands, there are 32 BJP members in the house, 29 of the Congress and 12 of the JD(S).This will change after the newly elected members enter the house with BJP much closer to the halfway mark at 37 after the party won 11 seats in the December 10 MLC polls while the Congress will be at 26. The JD(S) has been reduced to 10. The crucial part will be which way the independent candidate, Lakhan Jarkiholi, will swing.“We will get the support of Lakhan Jarkiholi since two of his brothers (Balachandra and Ramesh) are legislators in our party,” said one BJP MLC, requesting not to be named.The vote on this bill could help Ramesh and Balachandra assuage some of the anger within their party, a section of which believes that they put the interests of their family before that of the party’s.Ramesh believes that he can get Lakhan into the BJP but has revived his earlier demand of being re-inducted into the cabinet.One brother of the influential and powerful sugar barons, Satish Jarkiholi who is a legislator with the Congress, might also be called in from within his own party to help Lakhan not cast his vote in favour of the BJP.The JD(S), who’s walking out in “protest” during the anti-cattle slaughter bill, had indirectly helped the BJP in February, has tried to be on neutral ground this time, blaming both national parties for drafting a bill that would impact its voter base or at least does not make any significant improvement to its poll prospects by denting its secular credentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/support-for-anti-conversion-bill-in-upper-house-likely-to-be-tougher-for-karnataka-bjp-101640445507831.html

25-12-2021||India||HT This Day: Dec 26, 1968 - Spacemen Racing Back Home||Apollo-8 astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders were set to celebrate a comparatively relaxed Christmas Day in space after success fully breaking free from the grip of lunar gravity following their spectacular whirl around the moon. With a Christmas Eve message of good will to the world, “Please be informed there is a Santa Claus,” the spacemen started the return journey of their 480,000-mile round trip by successfully firing a blast from their main rocket engine. There were six frightening minutes while Apollo control tried repeatedly to get voice contact with the spacecraft. For the astronauts, who became the first men to see the moon at close range, the rocket firing was crucial. Had there been a malfunction, they might have been stranded in space to die when their oxygen ran out. The rocket firing came at 11-40 a.m. IST and minutes later Apollo wheeled out from behind the moon homebound at about 6.000 miles per hour. “We have signal and there’s a little bit of a cheer going up from the flight controllers here,” mission control reported. The three-minute 18-second burn added enough speed to the 3.600 miles per hour Apollo-8 was travelling to carry it away from the moon’s primary gravitational influence, and send it into the pull of the earth. “This gives you the sensation that you’re climbing.” Apillo-8 reported when confirmation of a good rocket burn was passed up to the spaceship. If all goes well, they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii at 9.21 p.m. IST on Friday. As communications with the spacecraft were resumed and word was received of the successful firing, tension which had been building up in the flight control room in Houston was broken with a cheer.At the time the astronauts started their journey back, the moon was about 232,000 statute miles from the earth. However, the spacecraft will cover more than that distance, as it does not travel in a straight line. When voice contact with the spacecraft was re-established, there was a great deal of noise on the circuits which came through the Honeysuckle, Australia, receiving station. However, space officials said everything had been “very close to normal” and scientists at the centre were pleased with the burn. The first words uttered by the astronauts when they emerged from the communications blackout were: “Please be informed there is a Santa Claus.” Automatic telemetry contact was made just after the spacecraft cleared the dark side, but there were several minutes before the astronauts’ voices reported the results of the rocket burn. Flight controllers said they were satisfied the rocket firing would successfully bring the Apollo spacecraft back to earth on Friday as scheduled. If the crucial firing of the spacecraft engine as the craft sped above the dark side of the moon worried the astronauts, they showed no sign of concern. After a slight delay in restoring voice communications when the Apollo emerged from the moon’s far side, the first words, apparently Lovell’s, were not about the engine burn at all, but about Santa Claus. The Houston Space Centre said it seemed only two slight trajectory corrections would be necessary midway between the moon and the earth. The first is planned for 20.51 GMT (02.21 IST Thursday). This correction was to have been made at 09.09 GMT (14.39 IST) but was found not to be necessary at that stage. At 16.00 GMT (21.30 IST) today Apollo-8 was flying at 4,000 feet a second, 179,000 nautical miles from the earth. Some time after 18.00 GMT (23.30 IST) the spacecraft was expected to reach the noint where the earth’s pull will increase its speed. After his stint at the controls on the way back to earth, Anders -tired out from his extra work as the Apollo’s cameraman-took a sleeping pill and slept as his companions took over. Before he went to sleep one of the ground controllers radioed up to ask Barman to check whether Anders had hung up his socks for Father Christmas. Anders himself radioed back-to tell the ground control that he had put them beside his teddy bear. While he slept, Borman and Lovell received Christmas messages from their families. Mrs Borman sent a message to space to tell her husband that his two sons and the rest of the family were waiting eagerly for the Apollo’s return. Mrs Lovell reassured her husband that his presents were still round the Christmas Tree and that there was roast beef and Yorkshire pudding waiting for him when he returned to the house. From the spaceship, Lovell told the space centre that he and the others had not been able to find a chimney in the spacecraft and so they had not seen Father Christmas. Christmas message Earlier today as they prepared to return home, the astronauts sent a Christmas message to earth in which they quoted from the Book of Genesis and added: “And from the crew of the Apollo-8, we pause with good night, good luck, and Merry Christmas and God bless all of you-all of you on the good earth.” Mission controllers said that they were examining the taped record of the rocket burn before giving their final evaluation of its results. Conversations between ground and the Apollo crew were limited to exchanges of figures and technical information. Officials said preliminary estimates were that the burn lasted three minutes and 23 seconds, about six seconds longer than had been planned. One of the astronauts reported that it had been “a very, very nice ride,” and he expressed the crewmen’s thanks to everyone on the ground. Communications improved considerably as the spacecraft started back towards the earth. Observers at first thought they heard one of the astronauts saying the burn had lasted only two minutes, 23 seconds, but space officials said later that it actually had lasted three minutes, 23 seconds. A burn that was too short might have pushed the spacecraft into what is officially described as “an unstable orbit” and might have left them stranded. Borman, Lovell and Anders circled the moon 10 times in 20 hours and gazed down upon a bleak. colourless landscape of rugged mountains, crater-pitted plains and rugged highlands. Twice they shared their view with earthlings by beaming to earth dramatic pictures of the desolation as Apollo-8 flew just 112 km above the surface. They opened the telecast with a blurred picture looking across the lunar horizon at the earth. “The moon is a different thing to each of us.” commander Borman told the television audience. “My own impression is that it is a vast, forbidding expanse of nothing. It’s not a very inviting place to live or work.” Lovell said, “It makes you realize what you have back on earth,” which he termed “a grand oasis in the vastness of space.” Anders said he was impressed most by “lunar sunrises and sunsets.” Lot of bumbs While they reported the visible face of the moon to have areas which looked suitable for landing, Lovell described the back side as being “ all beat up -just a lot of bumps and holes.” The astronauts pointed out several craters near the Sea of Crisis, which they described as made of a “ dark level material with fresh bright impact areas toward the edge.” The camera showed the moon through the window of the spaceship as it passed its ninth and next-to-last orbit of the moon. The orbit had an apogee (high point) of 663 miles (about 95 km.) and a perigee (low point) of 58-9 miles (89 km.) above the lunar surface. At one point William Anders said he saw a dark area which “could possibly be an old lava flow. He described the moon as looking like “miles and miles of pumice stone.” The astronauts said the intensity of the sun’s reflection on the surface made it difficult to pick out features. But they approached the “terminator,” the line between dark and light on the moon where long shadows made the terrain easier to see. Borman. Lovell and Anders at 3-29 p.m. IST yesterday became the first human beings ever to see the moon at close range when their spacecraft swung into an orbit only some 60 nautical miles from the lunar surface. At that time the moon was more than 231.000 statute miles (nearly 370,000 kilometres) from earth. They gazed in astonishment at a sight never before seen by man - the backside of the moon that constantly hides itself from earth. The astronauts then zipped around to the front side to beam to earth dramatic pictures. During the 10 moon orbits Apollo-8 spacecraft astronauts were kept busy doing an almost non-stop series of navigational experiments, especially landmark tracking, taking photographs and carrying out the routine but necessary chores about the spacecraft. Air Force Col. Frank Borman remarked at one point that “as usual in the real world, the flight plan looks a lot fuller than it did in Florida.” Air Force Major William Anders particularly was kept on the hop taking photographs, “He is moving from one couch to another, he is using several kinds of cameras, changing lenses, and he is as busy as one man-one astronaut-could be,” space officials said. By it’s sixth revolution around the moon, the Apollo-8’s orbit had changed slightly to 62.3 by 59.8 nautical miles from the lunar surface, with a speed of 5,337 feet (1,626 metres) per second. Yesterday afternoon, Anders complained that the spacecraft’s side windows were so hazy “that when the sun shines on them…. they are real poor for any visual observation or photography.” Public Affairs Officer Paul Haney said that one of the few problems encountered on the Apollo.8 flight so far had been the fogging up of three of the spacecraft’s five windows. Ground tests conducted during the past few days had shown that a rubbery material used in the caulking of the fogged-up windows produced a certain amount of “outgassing” under simulated lunar orbital conditions. “A differently treated material used in the caulking of the other two windows did not produce any vapour,” he said. “Some changes will be made in subsequent spacecraft,” Mr Haney added. All spacecraft systems continued to be in good order. The three tired Apollo astronauts were given permission to modify their flight plan and take well-earned rest as they whirled towards the end of their 20-hour orbit of the moon. During the Apollo’s seventh revolution, Borman reported that he had a “tired crew” aboard after 14 hours of hectic activity as they circled the moon at a height of some 60 nautical miles. Borman asked for the flight plan to be modified so that Lovell and Anders, who have been kept on the hop peering through fogged-up windows to take sights and photographs, could get some extra sleep. Lovell’s voice had -earlier sounded tired as he talked to ground controllers. A few moments after being told he could stop work to take a rest, Borman reported “Lovell’s snoring already.” Meanwhile, the astronauts yesterday gave the world a final television close-up of the “vast, forbidding expanse of nothing” that is the moon and showed a shining earth, which they called “a grand oasis in the vastness of space,” a quarter-million miles away. The second and last telecast from Apollo-8’s lunar orbit opened with a view of the moon’s horizon, with a glowing disc-the earth-rising like a small sun. Frank Borman said the camera showed “the view of earth as we’ve been watching it for the past 15 hours.” Like guides taking an entire world on a celestial bus tour. the astronauts pointed out the colourfully-named lunar surface features. Sand pile William Anders also told ground controllers that the moon’s sunset would be the best time for a lunar touch down. And he advised against attempting a landing on the moon’s hidden face after spotting a crater which looked to have a volcanic origin.In one of the first descriptions of the dark side of the moon, Lovell told ground controllers: “It certainly looks like we picked a more interesting place on the moon to land in. The back side looks like a sand pile my kids have been playing in for a long time. It’s all beat up, no definition, just a lot of bumps and holes.” “The area we’re over right now gives some hint of possible volcanic action though I can’t eyeball it (see it clearly enough) at the moment to pin that down. There are some craters and build-ups that just definitely suggest volcanic activity.” Lovell added that planned landing triangles were “just right. I think, for landing conditions. The shadows aren’t too deep for you to get confused, the land has texture to it and enough shadows there should make everything stand out.” When told that London’s Flat Earth Society pooh-poohed the voyage, Borman said “the earth doesn’t look too flat from here.” The Apollo-8 crew will bring with them spectacular photographs of the moon-far better than any taken earlier by unmanned lunar probes, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman said today. The spokesman said the three Apollo astronauts will be bringing sharper, clearer pictures back with them, taken from better angles and of incomparably higher quality. The men’s direct statement on their own visual observations are expected to make a big contribution to scientists’ study of photographs and films taken during man’s first trip round the moon. The Apollo crewmen, who have seen the hidden side of the moon for the first time, may help scientists work out the beginnings of an answer to countless lunar mysteries, such as the existence of the craters which pit the surface, and the apparent formation of seas of dust despite the fact that no atmosphere exists on the moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-dec-26-1968-spacemen-racing-back-home-101640442506663.html

25-12-2021||India||'Maharashtra will face lockdown if...': Minister's warning amid Omicron rise||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said statewide lockdown will be imposed only if the demand for medical oxygen touches 800 metric tons per day. The state government does not want people to face more restrictions, the health minister said urging people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour strictly. Maharashtra has 108 cases of Omicron, the highest in the country, while the countrywide tally of Omicron has reached 415.On Saturday, Mumbai added 757 fresh Covid cases in a marked surge.The state government has already imposed some restrictions, including restrictions on any gathering of more than five persons between 9pm to 6am and a cap on the number of people attending public events in the state.Omicron cases were increasing "rapidly", but in general such patients were not ending up in ICU nor did they need supplementary oxygen, the health minister said, speaking to reporters in Jalna. "There will be statewide lockdown only if the demand for medical oxygen rises to 800 metric tons (per day). We do not want people to face more restrictions, therefore I am making an appeal to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Wearing a mask is very important,” he said.According to scientists who have been tracking Omicron cases it is unlikely that Omicron might lead to any breathing difficulties as the variant is believed to be multiplying in the throat. However, as the variant is spreading faster, it will eventually lead to pressure on the healthcare system, as seen in other countries.Seeing the surge of Omicron, experts have projected a third wave of the pandemic in the country at the beginning of 2022 -- in January and February. The severity of the projected wave is unlikely to be intense.As the Centre has urged all states and Union territories to be alert amid the festive season, the Mumbai civic authorities have already banned New Year celebration parties, gatherings in closed or open spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-will-face-lockdown-if-minister-s-warning-amid-omicron-rise-101640438074084.html

25-12-2021||India||Manish Tiwari attacks Harish Rawat on 'his master's voice' dig, recaps 2012||When Uttarakhand Congress leader Harish Rawat tweeted about 'tied hands' indicating helplessness in the party ahead of the election in 2022, senior Congress leader Manish Tewari took a dig at Rawat reminding him of his role in 'unsettling' the equation in the party in Assam and Punjab. A meeting between Rahul Gandhi and Harish Rawat on Friday in New Delhi settled the situation as the party decided that Harish Rawat will lead the party in the upcoming election. However, what remained ruffled is the air between Harish Rawat and Manish Tewari.Commenting on Manish Tiwari's dig, Harish Rawat said he must have heard 'his master's voice' hinting at Amarinder Singh's influence. Giving back, Manish Tewari tweeted, "For some people, it is always and only about themselves unfortunately whether 2012 or 2021. Their only master is their own personal ambition," Tewari said offering a recap of what happened. Through the news article, Tewari claimed that it was not Harish Rawat's first revolt against the Congress. He had erupted in 2012 as well being denied the CM post. For some people it is unfortunately only and only about themselves whether it is 2012 or 2021.Their only master is their own personal ambition. This report of 14 th March 2012 eloquently speaks for itself. https://t.co/7Ed2g8oM5gI rest my Case @harishrawatcmuk ji @ANI https://t.co/WlGNHwSYV4In cryptic tweets, Harish Rawat on Wednesday expressed displeasure over factionalism in the state unit of the party. "Isn't it strange, one has to swim in the sea in the form of forthcoming electoral battle, instead of cooperation, the organisational structure at most places is turning its face away or is playing a negative role," Rawat said. "There are many crocodiles of the ruling dispensation. On whose directions one has to swim, their nominees are tying my hands and feet," he added. As this triggered speculations that Congress's trusted aide Harish Rawat was apparently upset over the functioning of the party, former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh grabbed the opportunity and reminded Rawat that one reaps as he sows, referring to Rawat's role in Punjab Congress leading to Amarinder Singh's resignation from the CM post. Reacting to Amarinder Singh's comment, Rawat on Saturday said, "I accept his best wishes. I think somewhere he is still feeling that quitting Congress was a mistake. And Manish Tewari is just following his master's (Amarinder) voice, as Amarinder Singh is following his master's voice," Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manish-tiwari-attacks-harish-rawat-on-his-master-s-voice-dig-recaps-2012-101640434300056.html

Financial and political corruption is the second leading cause of worry among urban India, it further added.But, 70 per cent of urban Indians believe the country is moving in the right direction, Ipsos said about the findings of its latest survey.The countries included in the survey are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States.

The political front of the farmers in Punjab will be led by Balbir Singh Rajewal. Samyukt Kisan Morcha, however, clarified its stance on this and, distancing itself from the political outfit, said the name of SKM should not be used in the election campaign.Three farm bodies including BKU (Dakounda) and BKU (Lakhowal) will decide shortly whether to join the party. The new party will be contesting from all 117 seats, farmer leaders confirmed on Saturday. Rajewal said he was under tremendous pressure from the people of Punjab to contest the polls after the three contentious farm laws were withdrawn in a victory of the farmers. Punjab is facing a lot of problems such as drugs, unemployment and the migration of youth from the state which they want to address.The farm laws, the year-long protest against them and finally teh withdrawal of those laws in an announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the stage for the Assembly election in Punjab. Farmers' unions in their major decision to contest this crucial election may seek an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, it is being speculated. Any such alliance will be announced later, the farmer leaders said. Many farm unions, which were part of SKM, the umbrella organisation, decided to stay away from electoral politics. Kirti Kisan Union, Krantikari Kisan Union, BKU-Krantikari, Doaba Sangharsh Committee, BKU-Sidhupur, Kisan Sangharsh Committee and Jai Kisan Andolan are against joining the fray. The SKM said its main objective was to push for the withdrawal of the farm laws. Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a member of SKM's core committee, has also floated a political outfit, Samyukta Sangharsh Party, which will contest in the assembly elections.
25-12-2021||India||After Karnataka CM Bommai fuels exit rumour, BJP leaders say ‘conspiracy to create confusion’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday termed the speculations around Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s possible exit a “conspiracy to create confusion”. BJP Karnataka unit chief Nalin Kumar Kateel asserted that Bommai will remain the chief minister till the next state Assembly elections, calling the reports “a figment of imagination”, news agency PTI reported."Bommai is going to be the Chief Minister till the next election, which is 2023. There is no leadership change," Kateel told reporters in Bengaluru, as quoted by PTI.Bommai fuelled speculations of his early exit while delivering an emotional address in his home district of Haveri.“Nothing is permanent in this world. This life is also not forever. In such a situation these posts and positions are also not permanent; this is something we should always be aware of all the time,” Bommai said amid multiple reports suggesting a possible leadership change early next year.Citing people familiar with the development, HT reported that Bommai is likely to be replaced but there is no official confirmation as it would dent the party’s chances in the upcoming polls, including Zilla and taluka panchayat, and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (the city’s civic body)."This news (about Bommai's exit) is a figment of imagination. I feel this is a conspiracy to create confusion, problem in the state politics and to defame the BJP government," Kateel said, suspecting the involvement of Congress behind the rumours.Kateel also dismissed the rumour mills that claimed the Bommai was expected to go abroad for knee-related surgery and the change would happen around that time."He is not going abroad. There is nothing wrong with his health but only some leg related issues for which he is getting treatment. He is healthy. His leg related problem will be cured here only," Kateel said, as quoted by PTI.Union minister Pralhad Joshi also dismissed the reports, saying Basavaraj Bommai will remain Karnataka chief minister till 2023."There is no leadership change. I am always in touch with our national-level leaders regularly and I have a good relationship with them. If such was the case, then certainly I would have come to know. There is no such proposal.

25-12-2021||India||Why do vaccinated people too get Covid? Study breaks down how virus transmits||A new study has revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses an underground form of transmission mostly staying away from the immune system and spreading from cell to cell. The research paper, led by Shan-Lu Liu, a virology professor in the Department of Veterinary Biosciences at The Ohio State University, breaks down in detail the mechanism in which the virus is spreading.Simply put, the virus spreads from one cell to another as there is no immunity to prevent them there. They remain tucked within cell walls. Target cell becomes a donor cell and thus a wave is created, the research paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said.The researchers said that this cell-to-cell transmission is not sensitive to inhibition from antibodies generated either through vaccines or through the previous infection. "We were able to confirm cell-to-cell transmission is not sensitive to inhibition from antibodies from COVID patients or vaccinated individuals," Liu said. "Cell-to-cell transmission's resistance to antibody neutralization is probably something we should watch for as SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, including the most recent, Omicron. In this sense, developing effective antiviral drugs targeting other steps of viral infection is critical," Liu added.As the SARS virus is not new, the research paper compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV which was behind the SARS outbreak of 2003. It said that the previous version led to a much higher fatality rate and lasted only eight months, while this version is continuing the pandemic for almost two years now. And one thing that helps SARS-CoV-2 to escape antibodies is cell-to-cell transmission.With fresh cases of Covid rising in the world again, restrictions are back in place. Omicron, the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in South Africa on November 24, is the latest threat as it appears to be spreading faster than the previous variants.The emergence of Omicron reveals that vaccinated people are also getting infected by this variant. Even people who have received booster doses against Covid are not safe from the infection. WHO has emphasised that vaccines, booster doses are not the only answer to the pandemic, Covid-appropriate behaviour is||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-do-vaccinated-people-too-get-covid-study-breaks-down-how-virus-transmits-101640428895266.html

Dr Angelique Coetzee told news agency PTI that existing Covid-19 vaccines will greatly help reduce the spread of the Omicron variant, warning that unvaccinated individuals are at 100 per cent risk from the strain. She said that vaccinated individuals or those with natural immunity from the prior infection will spread the virus strain to fewer people but the unvaccinated people will potentially spread the virus 100 per cent."Existing vaccines would greatly help to reduce the spreading, as we know that you would spread only about 1/3 if vaccinated or had previous history of being infected by Covid, while unvaccinated people will potentially spread the virus 100 per cent," PTI quoted Coetzee as saying.Coetzee, who is also the chairperson of the South African Medical Association, rejected the expert opinions that the Covid-19 is heading towards an end with a comparatively weaker Omicron variant. She opined that it will be difficult for the ongoing pandemic to end soon, adding that it may become endemic soon, reported PTI."India will see a surge in Omicron-driven Covid-19 cases and simultaneously there will be a high-positivity rate. But hopefully the majority of the cases will be as mild as what we are seeing here in South Africa," she said, as quoted by PTI.Fresh research claims Omicron has cold-like symptoms, looks like parainfluenzaIndia has so far reported 415 confirmed cases of Omicron variant from 17 states and Union territories, with Maharashtra leading the tally. Several states have announced new measures to control the spread of the variant of concern, including night curfews.The South African expert said that Omicron attacks “warm bodies” and is also infecting children."... for now Omicron is not threatening but it is fast spreading with a high infectivity rate, but less severe cases in hospitals. The virus' sole purpose is to infect a warm body and to survive. And yes, children are also being infected by it, but they are recovering in an average of five-six days," she said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attacks-warm-bodies-infects-children-what-expert-has-to-say-on-omicron-101640424292498.html

25-12-2021||India||Jama Masjid needs special care||The iconic Jama Masjid is in urgent need of conservation as several portions of the Mughal-era monument has suffered serious structural damage including the main dome, minarets and the courtyard, the Shahi Imam of the mosque Syed Ahmed Bukhari has said. Bukhari said he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 6, to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to pitch in with specialists to conserve the seventeenth century building since the mosque is not among the ASI-protected monuments. The same letter was marked to the ASI (Delhi Circle). The Shahi Imam said as a stopgap arrangement the mosque management was forced to use regular building material to repair the structure, which the experts said, will alter the original structure. He said the mosque authorities had to use cement to repair the damage to the dome and the mezzanine floor to prevent seepage in November. Conservation experts say use of normal building material could alter the original structure, and added that lime mortar was used as plaster in the monuments built in the medieval period. This is why use of cement is discouraged, they said. Before the repairs were undertaken in November, Bukhari approached both the Prime Minister’s Office and ASI after a thunderstorm and heavy showers led to the collapse of a red sandstone slab from one of the mosque’s minarets. The heavy slab also damaged the mosque courtyard. The mosque’s dome and a mezzanine floor is also in dire need of repairs with deep cracks running between the slabs and the pillars supporting the terrace. Urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to inspect the monument and carry out necessary repairs, Bukhari said the central heritage body has been conserving the masjid under special arrangement. Bukhari had also written to the Prime Minister in 2017, following which the ASI was directed to undertake a survey of the damage and help with the conservation. Earlier this month, three Members of Parliament (MPs) raised the issue of conservation of the Jama Masjid in the House. Samajwadi Party’s Shafiqur Rahman Barq said that ASI was not carrying out repairs despite the mosque’s rapidly deteriorating condition. Kunwar Danish Ali of the Bahujan Samaj Party also raised the issue of the dilapidated condition of the Jama Masjid, and asked if the government will work towards saving the legacy and heritage of the mosque. Ali said that the mosque was visited by foreign heads of states and diplomats but it was not getting any attention from the ASI. He said the ASI manages repair and conservation of several monuments that were not under its ambit, and was doing the same for Jama Masjid, until three years ago. PV Abdul Wahab from the IUML (Indian Union Muslim League) also raised the issue. In response to Ali’s question, Union culture and tourism minister G Kishan Reddy said the government could take up a proposal for the mosque’s repair provided it came from the Delhi government. “The ASI protects over 4,000 monuments in the country. The Jama Masjid is not among these monuments, but if the state government gave us any proposal seeking ASI intervention for maintenance through the central government, we can take up the proposal,” said Reddy. Mughal emperor Shahjahan built the mosque in 1656. During the Lok Sabha proceedings on Monday, TMC MP Sajda Ahmed asked the culture minister if the government had conducted a survey to assess the damage and the scope of work at Jama Masjid. She also sought details about the funds that ASI had allocated for repairs if any. In a written response, tourism minister Reddy said that the ASI provided funds for the conservation of Jama Masjid as and when required and shared expenditure details on conservation of Jama Masjid between 2017-20.Bukhari said that Jawaharlal Nehru had given a go-ahead to repairs and conservation support at the mosque as a special case. “Prime Minister Nehru met my father, then Shahi Imam, along with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad who sought that work is carried out Jama Masjid as a special case. The practise of repairs by ASI is on then. I believe that if an accurate account of the long-term arrangement is shared with Prime Minister Modi, the central government will pitch in with support,” said Bukhari. AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, who is the chairman of the Delhi Waqf Board, also visited the mosque earlier this month, and promised to pitch in with help. Bukhari said while all help was welcome, the scope of work required at the mosque could only be taken up the ASI since the Waqf board might not have sufficient funds and expertise required for repairs. Historian and author Swapna Liddle said that the conservation of Jama Masjid needed to be a priority for all stakeholders since it was not always possible to reverse the damage sustained. “The priority should be to stop the mosque from deteriorating since damage can often be irreversible. If the stones fall down and collapse, the damage cannot be turned back. The first response should be to avoid such situations through comprehensive conservation support,” said Liddle.DN Dimri, former ASI joint director-general, said regular cement is not used for conserving monuments. Dimri said that as per the conservation principle, materials not used in the making of the monument are not used for conservation work. “As per the ASI’s conservation manual, cement is not allowed for conservation because these monuments demonstrate the use of lime mortar and not cement. The ASI has carried out repairs at Jama Masjid from time to time in the past as part of a special arrangement, but cement was never used,” said Dimri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jama-masjid-needs-special-care-101640422705556.html

He had very good technical skills and initial inquiry reveals that he went inside the washroom to assemble the bomb,” Chattopadhyay said. “We have strong leads that Pakistan-based, pro-Khalistani narco-terrorists are behind the blast,” he also said.Singh, who was killed in Thursday's blast which also resulted in injuries to six others, was dismissed from service in 2019 in connection with a drugs case and spent two years in jail. He was released in September this year. The blast took place near the washroom on the second floor of the court complex.The police chief also said Singh's possible motive was to create fear as the hearing in his drugs case was scheduled to take place the next day.Also Read | Pro-Khalistani radicals in Pak, Germany behind Ludhiana court blastThe December 23 blast took place at a time when Punjab is gearing up for the assembly elections which are most likely to be held in February-March.

He also listed the contributions of Sikh Gurus, which he said is not just limited to society and spirituality."If our nation, the contemplation of the nation, the faith and integrity of the nation is safe today, at its core is the great austerity of the Sikh Gurus," PM Modi said in his virtual address."Guru Tegh Bahadur's valour and his sacrifice against Aurangzeb teaches us how the country fights against terror and religious fanaticism. Similarly, the life of the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Sahib is also a living example of tenacity and sacrifice at every step," said PM Modi.Emphasising on the "Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat" mantra, the Prime Minister said, "From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kohima, the whole country is dreaming together, striving for their accomplishment together. Today, the goal of the country is the revival of a new and capable India," he further said.He also lauded the contributions made by gurdwaras during the difficult corona time. "The way our gurdwaras took up the responsibility of service in the difficult times of Corona, it is a symbol of Guru Saheb's grace and his ideals," said PM Modi.He also said that access to Kartarpur Gurdwara was made possible by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government."The countrymen had been wishing for easy access to Kartarpur Sahib for decades. In 2019, it was our government that completed its construction," he said."More recently, we have been successful in bringing the swaroops of the respected Guru Granth Sahib from Afghanistan to India. What can be a greater experience of Guru's grace than this?" said PM Modi."When I went to the US a few months ago, it returned more than 150 historical objects to India, which were taken from here. There is also a peshkabja or small sword, on which the name of Guru Hargobind ji is written in Persian. Our own government also got the good fortune to bring it back," he added.The Prime Minister also talked about the historical importance of Gurdwara Lakhpat Sahib."Gurdwara Lakhpat Sahib has been a witness to every movement of time. Today, as I connect with this holy place, I am reminded of how Lakhpat Sahib has seen storms in the past," said PM Modi.The gurdwara had suffered damages during the 2001 earthquake."Once upon a time, this place was a major centre for trade to other countries. After the 2001 earthquake, I had the privilege of serving this holy place by Guru's grace. I remember, that at that time, artisans from different parts of the country preserved the original glory of this place," he further said."Guruvani was inscribed on the walls here with the ancient writing style. This project was honoured by UNESCO," said the Prime Minister.Every year, from December 23 to December 25, Sikh Sangat of Gujarat celebrate the Gurpurab of Guru Nanak Dev Ji at Gurudwara Lakhpat Sahib.Guru Nanak Dev ji had stayed at Lakhpat during the course of his travels.

But some people did not like these laws which were a big reform brought about 70 years after Independence under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership," Tomar said.Also read | The repeal of farm laws"But the government is not disappointed. We moved a step back and we will move forward again because farmers are India's backbone. And if the backbone is strengthened the country will definitely get strong,” he added.Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a surprise announcement on November 19 said his government would withdraw the three laws, both Houses of Parliament passed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, on November 29 by voice vote to annul the laws enacted in September 2020 to liberalise the trade of farm produce.Before that, Tomar and other Union ministers talked to the protesting farmers and held several meetings to work a way out as thousands of farmers mainly from poll-bound from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh camped on the Delhi borders since November last year.According to the agitating farmers, who did not budge from their demands, the three farm laws would leave them at the mercy of large corporate firms even though the Centre tried to assure them.Also read | Farm laws repealed: First major victory of farmers’ protest, says SKMThe Union minister also said at the event the agriculture sector needs investment in a big way. Tomar said private investment flowed into other areas which created jobs and the contribution of these industries in the GDP rose."The agriculture sector, despite being so big, did not receive this kind of opportunity. Today this sector receives most of the investment through government programmes... Through government purchase (of farm produce), subsidy on fertilisers, seeds and pesticides and other policies," he said.Also read | Repeal of farm laws sans discussion shows govt is scared: Rahul GandhiHe also said the present investment in the sector benefits the traders and not farmers. "You don't find warehouses and cold storages in villages… Hence prime minister Modi has announced infrastructure investment of ₹1 lakh crore as well as investment in allied sectors like animal husbandry, food processing, fisheries, herbal farming, altogether adding up to ₹1.5 lakh crore," he said."There is still a lack of private investment in the agriculture sector," Tomar added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-repealed-farm-laws-union-minister-tomar-talks-about-govt-s-future-plans-101640417199967.html

25-12-2021||India||Pro-Khalistani radicals in Pak, Germany behind Ludhiana court blast||Investigations conducted by security agencies and the Punjab police into the Ludhiana session court blast on Thursday reveal a cross border conspiracy with the involvement of a Germany based pro-Khalistan terrorist and a Pakistan based radical with the intention of destabilising the poll-bound state and helping the fissiparous forces.According to top security officials in the know of the developments, Jaswinder Singh Multani, a Germany based pro-Khalistan terrorist, has played a crucial role in the sessions court blast on December 23. A native of village Mansoorpur in Hoshiarpur district of Punjab, Multani has been supplying weapons and explosives in India by using his network of Pakistan based smugglers to carry out terror strikes on the Indian mainland. Intelligence inputs indicate that the Pakistani ISI specifically tasked Multani along with Pakistan based ‘Category A’ wanted gangster cum Khalistani radical, Harvinder Singh @ Rinda Sandhu, to carry out terror attacks to destabilise Punjab in the run-up to the assembly elections.According to available inputs, Multani has been closely associated with the banned outfit Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) for promoting separatist activities and is said to be in constant touch with US-based SFJ president Avtar Singh Pannu and Harmeet Singh @ Harpreet @ Rana, who are pursuing separatist agenda of Khalistan through Sikh Referendum 2020. Multani is understood to be assisting the SFJ’s separatist campaign in Germany and recently come to notice of the law enforcement agencies for arranging consignments of weapons, explosives, hand grenades and ammunition from Pakistan, with the help of his Pakistan-based operatives cum arm smugglers. Multani is said to be planning to carry out terrorist activities in Punjab and other parts of India using explosives smuggled from across the border. It is learnt that Multani even targeted a key farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU-Rajewal, for the latter’s speech condemning the Khalistani forces’ attempt to infiltrate and derail the protest over farm laws. The Punjab police busted the involved terror module and recovered 8 country-made pistols along with 8 magazines and 7 cartridges from the module members.In August 2021, the Punjab police arrested Saroop Singh of Tarn Taran district, who was radicalised by Multani and had sent two high explosive hand grenades to him for creating mayhem in the district town. The involvement of Pakistan based Harvinder Sandhu aka Rinda was revealed during the June 2021 interrogation of a so-called Khalistan supporter Jagjit Singh, who was caught with 48 pistols, 99 magazines and 200 cartridges in the Khemkaran-Ajnala sector by Punjab Police. A hardcore criminal, Rinda, who originally hailed from Taran Taran, shifted to Nanded Sahib in Maharashtra and then moved to Pakistan. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2011 for the murder of a youth in Tarn Taran in 2008. In January 2014, he had attacked the officials of Patiala Central Jail. On April 8, 2016, he had fired eight bullets at the Students Organisation of India (SOI) president at the Student Centre in Punjab University, Chandigarh. He is also accused of killing Hoshiarpur sarpanch Satnam Singh outside a gurdwara in Sector 38 (west) Chandigarh in April 2017. It was a case of contract killing hired by a Hoshiarpur-based transporter to murder the sarpanch.In 2018, gangster Dilpreet Singh Dhahan alias Baba was arrested for a shooting attempt at Punjabi singer Parmish Verma. During police interrogation, Baba disclosed that Rinda, his associate, was in touch with the Pakistan based terrorist and Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) chief Wadhawa Singh Babbar.

25-12-2021||India||PM Modi extends Christmas greetings, recalls life and teachings of Jesus||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday extended his greetings to the nation on the occasion of Christmas and recalled the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Pointing out that the religious leader's preachings place the topmost emphasis on “service, kindness, and humility”, the Prime Minister wished his fellow Indians a healthy and prosperous life.“Christmas greetings to everyone! We recall the life and noble teachings of Jesus Christ, which placed topmost emphasis on service, kindness, and humility,” tweeted Prime Minister Modi. “May everyone be healthy and prosperous. May there be harmony all around.”Christmas is celebrated every year on December 25 and marks the birth of Jesus Christ. It is observed by the Christian community across the globe by singing carols and exchanging gifts, as the festival aims to spread the message of peace and prosperity.This year, too, Christmas is being widely celebrated across the country with much fervour, in accordance with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) guidelines.Midnight mass was held at several churches in Goa, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, West Bengal, and Karnataka following the Covid-19 protocols, reported ANI news agency.Only a limited number of people were allowed to attend the mass celebrations to curb the transmission of Covid-19 infection.The Christmas and holiday season in India is one to watch, especially amid rising concerns over the highly transmissible Omicron strain of SARS-CoV-2 and experts fearing that public places may turn into coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots.The Omicron variant has got medical experts and public health professionals across the world concerned over aspects such as its transmissibility, immune system evasion, and vaccine resistance, despite initial reports indicating that the variant causes a less severe disease than previous strains.Experts have already warned that the late November to early January period—the holidays— will be an especially crucial time for this new phase of the coronavirus pandemic driven by Omicron, and any unwary activity during the festive season might lead to a revamped wave of the infectious disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-extends-christmas-greetings-recalls-the-life-and-teachings-of-jesus-christ-101640399283509.html

Vajpayee, who was an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and later, the RSS-affiliated Jana Sangh, held several important portfolios throughout his political career, including the all-important minister of external affairs.In 1980, Vajpayee co-founded the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), along with close associate and, later, his deputy PM, Lal Krishna Advani. In 1996, he became the country's first PM from the BJP. However, his first term ended after just 16 days.Also Read | Vajpayee a symbol of peace, development and equalityThe BJP stalwart would go on to hold the post for a further two terms, from 1998-1999, and later, a full five-year stint from 1999-2004.

25-12-2021||India||Vajpayee a symbol of peace, development and equality||There are innumerable anecdotes that his friends, peers, colleagues and commentators cite about former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna late Atal Behari Vajpayee. Here’s one that I often feel strikingly encapsulates the person, his politics, and his life that was pillared on a nation-first principle, focusing on modernity, progress, and equality.Speaking at a meeting of the scheduled caste community, Atal ji had said: “Na hum Manuvaadi hain, na brahmanvadi hain, ham samvidhaanvadi hain, Isilye hum Ambedakaravadi hain”. Translated, this reads: “We are neither Manuvadi, nor Brahminical. We are Constitutionalists, and, that is why we follow the principles espoused by [BR] Ambedkar”. This, in many ways, neatly sums up Atal ji’s deep and abiding belief in the principles and practice of social egalitarianism.He was a quintessential personification of a modern-day democrat, one who practised what he championed, never hesitating to take up the cudgels to fiercely protect democratic values. His imprisonment during the dark days of Emergency is an example of this attribute.Atal ji was a deeply rooted organisation man too, someone who took immense pride in his identity with his political party. To save democracy, Jan Sangh had merged with the Janata Party in 1978, a step that bubbled with enormous hope and promise. Atal ji was deeply disappointed with the failure of this political experiment, which found expression in famous poem “Rah kaunsi jaoon main (Which way shall I go)”.But, like a true statesman and powered by his strong belief in his political vision, Atal ji wrote: “Geet Naya Gata Hoon”(I sing a new song)”, a deeply motivational poem that inspired the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980, offering a political alternative which has now evolved into the world’s biggest political party.His concluding remarks at the party’s Mumbai session were laced with hope and positivity that laid down the vision inspiring millions. He said “Andhera Chhatega, Sooraj Niklega, Kamal Khilega” meaning “The darkness will cease, the sun will rise, the lotus will bloom.” This was more than a metaphorical alliteration. This offered new hope to hundreds of millions in this country who sought an alternative to the dynasty-ruled Congress, which had by then come to be characterised by ugly syndicates, corrupt practices, and arbitrary administration.Atal ji dedicated his whole life to the country. For him, India was not just a piece of geographical expanse, it was an ever-evolving organic civilisation. The love for motherland found expression in his words and poetry. He famously wrote: “Yah vandan ki bhoomi hai, abhinandan ki bhoomi hai, yah tarpan kee bhoomi hai, yah arpan kee bhoomi hai | iska kankad-kankad shankar, isaka bindu-bindu gangaajal hai. ham jiyenge to iske liye, marenge to iske liye” Or, “this is the land of worship, this is the land of greetings, this is the land of offerings. Its pebbles symbolise Lord Shankar, Gangajal can be found in every point. We shall live and die for this motherland.”Atal ji symbolised development. The Golden Quadrilateral, the Pradhan Mantril Gram Sadak Yojana, and other such iconic projects, were conceptualised and executed during his tenure.Vajpayee’s unwavering and persistent focus on the nation’s territorial integrity shaped India’s foreign policy. He was always willing to give peace a chance, but not at cost of the nation’s security and territorial integrity, which to him was non-negotiable. His politics had deep philosophical underpinnings. He had immense faith in the power of society. He kept the nation’s interest paramount and rose above sectarian and political differences to solve complex problems. He was unafraid of taking a principled stand. On his birth anniversary today, let us rededicate ourselves to his vision to make India a self-reliant, safe, modern and progressive country.(Shiv Prakash is National Joint Secretary, Organisation, BJP.

25-12-2021||India||Delhi high court annuls 16-year marriage as wife conceals her mental health issues||New Delhi: Observing that it is not easy to live with a partner having mental health issues, the Delhi high court on Friday annulled the marriage between a couple after 16 years. It said the failure on the wife’s part to disclose her mental disorder before her wedding constituted a fraud on the husband.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while dealing with an appeal filed by the husband challenging a family court order rejecting his plea to abolish the marriage, said while it was true that the medical opinion in the case was not conclusive, the evidence of the doctors coupled with the medical documents suggested that wife was suffering from schizophrenia.“…It is not easy to live with a partner who has mental health issues, and such ailments come with their own challenges for the person facing the problem, and even more so for the spouse. There needs to be an understanding of the problems in a marriage, and communication between the partners– especially when one of the two partners in a marriage is facing challenges of their own,” the court said in a 24-page order.“The failure on the part of the respondent (wife) to disclose her mental disorder before her marriage with the appellant (husband) as alleged by him, constituted a fraud perpetrated upon him,” it added.It said the refusal by the wife to undergo medical examination by the medical board of experts lead to the inference that she was not prepared to face the board as that it could have exposed the condition of her mental well being and would have established the allegation made by the husband that she was suffering from schizophrenia.“Why else, such a spouse–who claims to be not suffering from any mental ailment who has preferred a petition to seek restitution of conjugal rights, and expresses her desire to live with the appellant husband, not undergo such medical examination?” the bench said in a 21-page judgment.The husband had contended that the marriage was the outcome of a calculated fraud that was perpetrated by the wife and her family members as they chose not to disclose a vital and crucial fact regarding her mental health.He had also claimed that the wife was, before the marriage, and during the days that she stayed with the husband, suffering from acute schizophrenia. He stated that the wife behaved in a very unusual manner after her marriage in the matrimonial home, as well as during their honeymoon while seeking annulment of the marriage.Allowing his plea, the court said that the husband’s life has been ruined and he has remained stuck in the relationship for 16 years without any resolution.“In the most important years of his life, when the appellant would have, otherwise, enjoyed marital and conjugal bliss and satisfaction, he has had to suffer due to the obstinacy displayed by not only the respondent, but even her father, who appears to have been calling the shots in relation to the matrimonial dispute raised by the appellant,” the court said.The judge also said that they are not medical professionals or experts and acquire limited knowledge based on the arguments of the parties, medical literature produced before them; testimonies of expert witnesses produced in court, and the submissions advanced before them.The court said that marriage is not made of only happy memories and good times, and two people in a marriage have to face challenges and weather the storm together. It also said that “treatment of any mental ailment requires acceptance of the same, not only by the family members but, most importantly, by the person suffering from the problem”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-annuls-16-year-marriage-as-wife-conceals-her-mental-health-issues-101640374701666.html
25-12-2021||India||Uttarakhand minister storms out of cabinet meet, BJP says he hasn’t resigned||Uttarakhand minister Harak Singh Rawat on Friday stormed out of a cabinet meeting reportedly upset over alleged “government inaction” in connection with a proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar, according to officials present at the meeting. He allegedly tendered his “oral resignation” as he walked out, it is learnt. However, cabinet minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal and BJP party state president Madan Kaushik, dismissed reports of Rawat’s resignation. Phone calls and texts to Rawat for comment went unanswered.“While the cabinet was discussing various proposals during the meeting, led by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, Rawat raised the issue of approving the proposed medical college in his constituency of Kotdwar…which led to an argument between the two,” an official who was present at the meeting said, requesting anonymity. “The argument heated up as Rawat alleged that development projects in his constituency are not being approved in conspiracy. He then stormed out of the meeting saying, ‘There is no use of being a minister, I am leaving the cabinet’,” said the official. At a press briefing after the meeting, Uniyal said, “I have no information about his resignation. But he was unhappy over an issue related to proposed medical college in his constituency as apart from being a minister, he is also an MLA.” Kaushik, while emphasising that Rawat has not resigned, said: “Nobody has resigned from the party. However, if Rawat may have some issues pertaining to his constituency, then party will speak to him and solve them.” Leader of opposition and senior Congress leader, Pritam Singh, said in a veiled reference: “In politics, doors are never closed permanently for anyone. However, having said that, welcoming any leader from the other party would be decided by leadership after proper analysis.” Rawat is considered to have played a key role in the rebellion of nine Congress MLAs in 2016 who switched to the BJP.

25-12-2021||India||MiG-21 crashes in Rajasthan, IAF pilot killed||A MiG-21 Bison of the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed in Rajasthan on Friday evening, killing the pilot, Wing Commander Harshit Sinha. This is the fifth crash involving a Bison jet this year.“This evening, around 8:30 pm, a MiG-21 aircraft of IAF met with a flying accident in the western sector during a training sortie...,” the IAF said in a statement.Later, in another tweet, the IAF confirmed the pilot’s death.“With deep sorrow, IAF conveys the sad demise of Wing Commander Harshit Sinha in the flying accident this evening and stands firmly with the family of the braveheart,” it said.The crash has once again turned the spotlight on India’s longest-serving fighter plane, its safety record and the IAF’s plans to replace the ageing jets with newer ones in the coming years.The Bison is the latest variant of Mig-21 in IAF service. IAF operates four squadrons of MiG-21 Bison aircraft — a squadron has 16 to 18 fighter jets. The last of these upgraded MiG-21s are set to be phased out in three to four years.The air force got its first single-engine MiG-21 in 1963, and it progressively inducted 874 variants of the Soviet-origin supersonic fighters to bolster its combat potential. Of the 874 MiG-21 variants inducted by the IAF, over 60% were licence-produced in India.More than 400 MiG-21s have been involved in accidents that have claimed the lives of more than 200 pilots during the last six decades, earning the fighters ominous epithets such as “Flying Coffin” and “Widow Maker”.Experts have said that more MiG-21s have crashed than any other fighter because they formed the bulk of the fighter aircraft in the IAF’s inventory for a long time.IAF had to keep its MiG-21 fleet flying longer than it would have liked because of delay in the induction of new fighters.The Bison was involved in IAF operations after the unprecedented, peacetime, cross-border strike against terror targets in Pakistan’s Balakot two years ago.Wing Commander (now Group Captain) Abhinandan Varthaman scripted military aviation history by downing a Pakistan Air Force F-16, seconds before his own MiG-21 Bison was hit by a missile forcing him to eject on February 27, 2019.
25-12-2021||India||Will make Punjab peaceful if AAP voted to power: Arvind Kejriwal||GURDASPUR: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will work on five points to make Punjab peaceful and rid it of drugs menace, party’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday, while alleging a conspiracy behind the recent cases of sacrilege and explosion in the poll-bound state. “Our first step will be to ensure corruption-free recruitment of police officers in the state… so that a peaceful atmosphere is created,” Kejriwal said while addressing a poll rally at Hanuman Chowk in Gurdaspur. His party’s second step, Kejriwal said, will be to order a thorough probe into all important cases, including Bargari sacrilege and bomb blasts. He added that his party would ensure that no sacrilege of any religion happen in future. The AAP chief said his third step would be to protect Punjab’s border with Pakistan. “We will protect the border so that no terrorist enters the state. We will also ensure that are no smuggling of drugs from across the border,” he said. “Our fourth step will be to provide high-tech technology to the border security force (BSF) and the Punjab police to tackle the threat of drones being used for smuggling of narcotics and weapons from across the border. During our government’s tenure, the BSF and police will not face any problem while gunning down the drones,” Kejriwal said. He said his fifth step would be to provide maximum security to all religious places. “We will make a separate police force to protect all gurdwaras, deras, temples and masjids of Punjab,” he said. Talking about the latest sacrilege incidents and the Ludhiana bomb blast, Kejriwal said, “I was saddened after hearing the news of Ludhiana bomb blast… Few days ago, there were cases of sacrilege. Such incidents before polls are being done under a conspiracy to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere in the state. It is the handiwork of a few people,” claimed Kejriwal. He also hit out at chief minister Charanjit Singh Channni-led Punjab government, calling it “weak”. “There is a weak government in Punjab. Their party leaders are fighting amongst themselves.” He added that Punjab needs an honest strong government which can act against those indulging in conspiracies. He also alleged the person who attempted sacrilege at the Golden Temple must have been sent by someone influential to foment tension and added that such incidents will “keep taking place until a strong government takes over”. The AAP chief also slammed the Congress on the drug menace in the state, saying the government, during the previous poll campaign, had promised to wipe out the mafia within a month of forming the government. “During five years, only one FIR is registered and CM Channi and (state Congress chief) Navjot Singh Sidhu are boasting about it,” he said, referring to the FIR registered by the Punjab police against former minister and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on the basis of a 2018 status report of a probe into the drug racket. “It is only a political stunt,” said Kejriwal. He said if his party’s government comes to the power in 2022, they will eradicate drugs in six months. “We have Kunwar Vijay Pratap like honest officers and we won’t be running a dramatic government.” He also spoke about his government’s development in Delhi. “In Delhi, government schools have become models. When our government was formed, the condition of government schools was deplorable. In five years, we worked hard to make government schools like private schools... If the people of Punjab want good schools, they should vote for AAP. The teachers of Punjab also want to change the atmosphere of Punjab schools, but the government is not supporting them.” Meanwhile, chief minister Channi dared the AAP chief to perform in Delhi before “promising moon” in Punjab. “The AAP chief is eyeing the wealth of Punjab due to which he is building castles in air to attract people,” Channi said, while addressing a gathering after dedicating a bridge from Talwara Jatta to Simbli Gujran to the people. He dared Kejriwal to announce cheap power and petrol to residents of Delhi on line of what the Punjab government has done. “The AAP leadership should understand one simple thing that proud Punjabis will not allow any outsider to rule them,” Channi said, adding his government is providing cheapest petrol and diesel in entire northern region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-make-punjab-peaceful-if-aap-voted-to-power-arvind-kejriwal-101640373983753.html
25-12-2021||India||Owaisi’s remarks trigger controversy; BJP compares him to Jinnah||New Delhi: AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi’s remarks at a poll rally cautioning the Uttar Pradesh Police triggered a controversy on Friday with the BJP comparing him to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, even though he clarified that the context of his remarks was deliberately edited out to misrepresent them.In a series of tweets, All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Owaisi shared a video clip which has been widely circulated on social media and said the remarks made by him were in the context of atrocities against Muslims by the state police, which has been edited out of the clip. In the video clip shared by him, Owaisi is heard saying that Yogi Adityanath will not always be the chief minister and Narendra Modi the prime minister. “We will not forget the injustice. We will remember this injustice. Allah will destroy you through his strength. Things will change. Who will come to save you then? When Yogi will return to his mutt and Modi will retreat to the mountains, then who will come?” he said. Owaisi said the edited one-minute clip of his 45-minute speech was being circulated to divert the attention from the alleged hate speeches made at a Dharma Sansad in Haridwar which he alleged as “genocidal meet”. “I did not incite violence or give threats. I talked about police atrocities.... I said we will remember these police atrocities. Is this objectionable? Why is it offensive to remember how police have treated Muslims in UP? I asked cops: who will come to save them when Modi-Yogi retire? Indeed, who will? Do they think they’ve lifetime immunity?” Owaisi tweeted while clarifying his position. Taking on Owaisi over his remarks, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi compared him to Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and said AIMIM leaders are used to making such mischievous remarks. “...soul of Jinnah resides in Owaisi,” Trivedi said, adding that the Hyderabad MP’s remarks are similar to that of Jinnah made in 1946, a year before partition, while talking about direct action. BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted, “Owaisi, like (Mughal emperor) Aurangzeb and Jinnah, is the face of civilisational battle that Sanatan Dharma has faced for millennia. Balance of power is the need of the hour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owaisis-remarks-trigger-controversy-bjp-compares-him-to-jinnah-101640373982410.html
25-12-2021||India||Uttarakhand CM orders inquiry into sacking of Dalit cook||Days after a controversy erupted over the sacking of a Dalit woman as a cook from a Champawat school, following protest by parents of “upper caste” students who refused to eat food prepared by her, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday ordered an inquiry in the incident.Dhami told deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Kumaon, Nilesh Anand Bharne, to go to the village and probe the matter personally, according to a government statement.The 32-year-old Sunita Devi joined as bhojanmata in a government inter college (GIC), Sukhidhang, in Champawat district on December 13. Secondary schools in several Indian states are referred to as inter colleges.Some 40 pupils of Class 6 to 8, of the total 66 pupils, belonging to the upper caste refused to eat the midday meals cooked by her and started bringing tiffin. The boycott sparked an inquiry and on Wednesday, the district authorities scrapped Devi’s appointment, saying norms were not followed while giving her the job.Parents of the upper caste children backed the boycott and alleged that Devi was chosen as the cook by overlooking a more deserving candidate, Pushpa Bhatt, a Brahmin. On Wednesday, they welcomed Devi’s removal and said the issue had been resolved.“We received 11 applications for a bhojanmata post. She was selected for the post on December 5... When the row of boycotting midday meals erupted, our senior officers held an inquiry and cancelled her appointment on December 21, saying due process was not followed,” said Prem Singh, principal, GIC, Sukhidhang.Asked what the due process was, he said the school did not take permission for her appointment from the district education officer.After her removal, Sunita Devi approached the revenue officer (tehsildar) in Tanakpur and the police outpost in Chalthi, and handed over a complaint alleging harassment by the parents of upper caste students, and termed her removal caste discrimination. Police are yet to register a case on her complaint. “I will apply again for the post when it is advertised in the future. I will try to get my job back and that will be a befitting reply to those who have harassed and insulted me,” she told HT.Sunita and her husband Prem Ram are labourers who earn their living by working in fields of other persons, mostly upper castes.Sunita has two sons — Neeraj, 13 and Paras, 10, who study in class 8 and 6, respectively, in the same college where she was appointed as bhojanmata. She manages her home on the widow pension of her mother-in-law Rukmani Devi. “...I was very happy with my new job as bhojanmata, thinking this will help my family’s financial income and we will see good days. But I was removed from the post within a week due to controversy created by supporters of an upper caste woman who had also applied for this post,” said Sunita Devi.Narendra Joshi, a villager and president of the parent teacher association, GIC, however, denied any discrimination.“In first meeting which was held on November 25 to select bhojanmata, Pushpa Bhatt was selected but in next meeting, held on December 5 Sunita was appointed... Our stand was only if Bhatt was selected then in next meeting why she was sidelined...,” said Joshi.Dalit rights activists described the incident as the worst form of discrimination. “She was removed because she was a Dalit and upper caste people had opposed her appointment,” Govind Baudh, president, Bhim Army, Kumoan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-orders-inquiry-into-sacking-of-dalit-cook-101640373921425.html
25-12-2021||India||Do people come to Bihar to drink, asks Nitish; rejects ideas to relax prohibition||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday rejected suggestions made from different quarters that the prohibition law should be relaxed for those coming to the state from outside. “They say we should at least exempt those coming from other states. Do people come to Bihar to drink? Many people are angry with me because I have brought in prohibition,” said Kumar while addressing people at Gopalganj on the second leg of his Samaj Sudhar Yatra. “Don’t call it a yatra. A yatra can end but a campaign cannot,” he reasoned. “A campaign has been started for drug de-addiction, eradication of dowry system and freedom from child marriage in the society. Travel is a part of social reform campaign. This social reform campaign will continue. Social reform campaign will continue in every city, village and town,” he added. There have been fresh demands for exempting ‘outsiders’ like in Gujarat, another dry state, in the aftermath of a police overkill to enforce the ban on liquor. He also turned down suggestions that an exception be made on medical grounds for certified alcoholics, asserting that people spoiled their health by drinking and not by being prevented from doing so. Kumar’s firmness towards prohibition comes after the state was rattled by a series of hooch tragedies in November leading to the death of over 40 people at several districts including Gopalganj. The CM said that both consuming and doing business of alcohol is a crime. “If you drink alcohol, you will die and if you sell it, you will be punished,” he warned. Kumar, who handed over a cheque to the Jeevika group, said that the role of Jeevika Didis is very important in the campaign, because alcohol was banned only on the demand of women. Despite prohibition, some people are making a mess, but only women can raise their voices against those people. In addition to prohibition, Kumar also appealed to people to eradicate other social evils like child marriage and dowry. 
25-12-2021||India||Rawat gets his way, will lead Uttarakhand poll campaign||Harish Rawat’s position as the face of the Congress in Uttarakhand ahead of polls in the hill state was reiterated, the former chief minister said Friday after a four-hour-long meeting with the party’s central leadership that was also attended by Rahul Gandhi.The move appeared to quell his rebellion, which first surfaced in a series of Twitter posts two days ago, at least for now.“I will lead as the campaign committee chairman and everyone will support me,’’ Rawat told reporters in the Capital. In other words, people aware of the details said, the upcoming elections in Uttarakhand will be fought under him. The party, however, did not go as far as naming Rawat as the chief ministerial candidate at a time when the Congress is attempting to wrest power back from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“After elections, the legislature party will sit and decide who will lead them. In Uttarakhand, we will follow that,’’ Rawat said, adding that he was no longer thinking of either retirement or quitting the party. “Kadam, kadam badhaye ja, Congress ke geet gaye ja (Let’s move forward step by step, let’s sing for the Congress party),’’ Rawat added.His words were in sharp contrast to a Twitter thread on Wednesday that suggested the Congress was heading to an internal political crisis in yet another state.“Isn’t it strange, one has to swim in the sea in the form of forthcoming electoral battle... instead of cooperation, the organisational structure at most places is turning its face away or is playing a negative role... There are many crocodiles... On whose directions one has to swim, their nominees are tying my hands and feet,” Rawat wrote on Wednesday. The twitter thread went on to say that he was contemplating retirement.In the meeting on Friday, which was primarily chaired by the party’s organisational general secretary KC Venugopal with Rahul Gandhi dropping in towards the end, the Congress leadership tried to assuage Rawat’s feelings of being left out of decision making. “Even though he is the head of the campaign committee, he felt that he wasn’t getting his way. So we tried to speak to both sides and get them to listen to each other, to keep the other side in the loop,’’ said a person who attended the meeting, asking not to be named.The other attendees to the meeting, which comes just two months before the state elections included the AICC in charge of the state Devendra Yadav, the state congress chief Ganesh Godiyal, and legislature party leader Pritam Singh, among others.“There is no doubt that he is the face of the Congress in the state but the Congress president will decide who will be chief minister. Harish Rawat is happy with that,’’ said a second leader aware of the details.The Congress is looking to dislodge the BJP from power in the hill state, which Rawat served as CM between 2014 and 2017.The BJP is roiled by troubles of its own, and has changed its chief minister three times in the last year. The BJP has 55 sitting MLAs and the Congress 12 in the state assembly.Rawat served as chief minister of Uttarakhand between 2014 and 2017, and the party sees 2022 as a big opportunity since the BJP is roiled by troubles of its own. The ruling party in the state has changed its chief minister three times in the last year. In the 70-member assembly, the BJP has 55 members and the Congress has only 12.People aware of the matter said that there is a section of the party which feels Rawat, at 73, should step aside and make way for a new leadership. Gandhi was said to be keen on an alternative face, like the his pick in Punjab, Dalit leader Charanjit Singh Channi who replaced former CM Captain Amarinder Singh after his public spat with the party’s state unit head Navjot Singh Sidhu.It was significant, therefore, that the party’s Dalit leader in Uttarakhand, Yashpal Arya, who recently rejoined the Congress from the BJP, also attended Friday’s meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawat-gets-his-way-will-lead-uttarakhand-poll-campaign-101640373502248.html
25-12-2021||India||There were no illegal immigrants among those evicted in Assam’s Darrang: Report||Three months after a violent eviction drive at Dhalpur in Darrang district of Assam in which two civilians were killed, an independent study on the incident has claimed that the evicted families were not illegal immigrants or land grabbers, as alleged by the state’s BJP-led government. The study, ‘Dhalpur-The Truth Behind’ by Guwahati-based Centre for Minority Studies, Research and Development (CMSRD) was carried out by 14 members who stayed in the area for 15 days and interacted with 517 of the 963 evicted families. The ruling BJP responded to the report saying CMSRD should approach the court if it has issues with the eviction drive. On September 23, two civilians were killed in clashes between evicted families and police and 18 other people including policemen were injured during the eviction drive. The state government had evicted the area to make way for an agricultural project for indigenous people. The government had alleged that those evicted -- Bengali-speaking Muslims a majority among them -- are illegal immigrants who had forcibly occupied government land as well as land of indigenous people and also settled on grazing land. The CMSRD report however stated that of the 517 families surveyed 514 had their National Register of Citizens (NRC) legacy data preserved with them. Names of only 3 heads of families were found to be ‘doubtful voters (D-Voters). The NRC was updated in Assam to identify illegal immigrants (people who entered the state after March 1971 when Bangladesh came into being). Of the 32 million applicants, 1.9 million were excluded from the final list released in August 2019. “Since all the surveyed families have legacy data prior to 1971 they can’t be termed as either suspected Bangladeshi or people of Bangladesh origin since Bangaldesh came into existence on March 24, 1971,” said Zamser Ali, general secretary of CMSRD. The survey found that of the 3,094 persons in 517 families, names of 1998 were included in the final NRC and the rest were excluded. The survey mentions that while all families have legacy data prior to 1971, some families were left out of the NRC because of “ambiguity of NRC officials”. The report also denied allegations of land grabbing by the evicted families. It stated that of the 517 families, 134 were living in inherited land, 34 families had occupied ‘abandoned land’ (low lying areas near the river), 62 families were landless and 129 families paid their land revenue for some time. The allegation of grabbing grazing land was also denied by the report by mentioning that the villages of Dhalpur which had been evicted and nearby villages were not marked as protected grazing reserve (PGR) or village grazing reserve (VGR) in the census reports of 1971, 1991 and 2011. “The narratives of BJP-RSS and its allied organisations..is not only a distortion of facts about Dhalpur and its people, but a completely false and imaginary propaganda campaign,” the report stated. “It’s wrong to blame the BJP or RSS for the eviction drive. It was carried out by the government with permission from the court. If CMSRD has any issues they should approach the court,” said BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami.The report stated that evicted families of Dhalpur had migrated to the area over the past several decades from Darrang, Kamrup, Goalpara and Nagaon districts due to erosion of their villages because of floods. It claimed that the evicted families who were residing in temporary shelters following the drive were not provided with basic amenities like food, drinking water and medicines. Following the Dhalpur eviction, the Assam government ordered a judicial inquiry on violent eviction drive. Leader of opposition in state assembly Debabrata Sakia filed a petition in Gauhati High Court alleging use of excessive force by the state agencies during the drive. Last month, the Assam government in an affidavit filed in reply to the petition maintained that the evicted families were encroachers and refuted claims that they were victims of floods or erosion.
25-12-2021||India||Beyond the News: Is Rawat reading from Sidhu’s Punjab playbook in Uttarakhand?||Poll-bound Uttarakhand is the new epicentre of tremors in the earthquake prone Congress. Rocking the party’s applecart there is former chief minister Harish Rawat, the AICC’s erstwhile points person in Punjab who let Navjot Sidhu swashbuckle his way through against Captain Amarinder Singh. The result: Singh has floated his own party, and joined the BJP for the upcoming elections.In a series of emotive tweets directed at the central leadership and its emissaries in the state, Rawat seemed to take a leaf out of the Sidhu playbook on how to arm-twist a weakened high command. The inspiration apparently is the former cricketer showing himself as the de facto CM, at the expense of the de jure appointee, Charanjit Singh Channi.The party in Punjab has had to give in to Sidhu’s choices in the appointments of the advocate general and the police chief. Its acquiescence of silence is evident also in his comments after the public lynching of suspects in recent cases of alleged sacrilege, where he called for those that commit sacrilege to be hanged publicly.In their anxiety to keep Sidhu in the party fold, the central leadership ignored his irrepressible, insubordinate ways. The dangerous precedent they set in the process caused a near-total dilution of the party writ. Little wonder then that Rawat, the Punjab referee, is seeking to be similarly audacious in Uttarakhand.But why is he upset? From what one learns, his crib is no different from that of Sidhu’s. They both want to be declared the CM face in the run up to the polls. Doing that in Punjab would be suicidal, the incumbent being a Dalit whose promotion has fetched the Congress the traction it needs among the 32% Scheduled Caste electorate.The other tussle, which could soon come to a head, is about the selection of candidates. Their shared quest to be CM can only be realised through majority support in new legislature parties. The exercise will be akin to walking on eggshells in Punjab with multiple Congress factions led by Sidhu, Channi, home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa and senior leaders Pratap Bajwa and Sunil Jakhar.In relative terms, ticket distribution could be simpler in Uttarakhand which currently has two factions, one led by Rawat and the other by Congress legislature party leader Pritam Singh. There is resistance from these groups --eyeing a lion’s share of seats -- to the return of Congressmen who defected to the BJP after the 2017 debacle.In those polls, the Congress made Rawat its CM face, projecting him as the electorate’s choice: “Sabki chahat Harish Rawat.” The outcome: he failed to enter the assembly from the Kichha and Haridwar rural seats he contested; the Congress tally sank from 31 to 11 in the house of 70.The Congress denouement was a repeat of sorts of the BJP’s 2012 defeat when voters dumped the latter’s “Khanduri hai zaroori” pitch, defeating the party and the venerated former Union minister BC Khanduri in the constituency from where he fought. The Congress won without naming its CM, opening post-election the doors for Vijay Bahuguna, whom Rawat later replaced in the coveted office.Superstitious though it seems, such past experiences, including the late ND Tiwari’s failed 2007 bid as the Congress’s CM candidate, make many unaligned leaders want the party enter the fray without naming anybody as CM. Opinion is divided, however, over Rawat’s barely concealed push-back against accepting the post-2017 deserters in the party. Among such former Congressmen are Vijay Bahuguna, Harak Singh Rawat, Satpal Maharaj, and Yashpal Arya. Only the last named has since returned.Rawat’s refrain that those who left the party must pay for their mahapaap (sin), was met with a biting rebuttal from Harak Singh, his bête noire for many years. He tauntingly reminded the former CM that people punished him in 2017 when he couldn’t win either of the two seats he contested.To be fair, Rawat could have had valid reasons to go public with his grievances. Congress apparatchiks assigned to states often tend to play favourites or obediently follow the high command’s directives without factoring in the downsides. That ironically happened on Rawat’s watch in Punjab. The boot now is on the other foot.The big imponderable is whether Rawat will be reined in or allowed to replicate Punjab in the hilly state-- where the Congress’s poll prospects are rated higher.For starters, he has been placated rather than disciplined by getting named the Congress’s campaign panel head after a meeting on Friday with Rahul Gandhi. Count that with the leg-up he managed earlier in the middle of the Punjab imbroglio by having his man Ganesh Godiyal appointed as Congress’s state unit chief, one is tempted to conclude that Rawat is the Congress in his state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beyond-the-news-is-rawat-reading-from-sidhu-s-punjab-playbook-in-uttarakhand-101640373387475.html

The public of our country and even history is witness to the level of noise and indiscipline the Opposition has made a kind of practice to bring to the sittings of the House.”The senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader accused the Opposition of trying to “use every means to not let the House proceedings carry on. It was painful when some members of the Opposition reduced the temple of democracy to a theatre of street fight.”On Thursday, senior Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Jairam Ramesh had said that Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu used to “adjourn the House under pressure of the government”.On Friday, Joshi said that senior Congress leaders such as Ramesh tried to create an “opposite narrative” by “casting aspersions on the functioning of a constitutional authority, the chairman of the Rajya Sabha” and said the Congress leader by doing so did a “disfavour not only to the truth, but to democracy itself”.Minutes later, Ramesh retorted, “I hope the mention of my name in Shri Prahlad Joshi’s statement defending an unconstitutional and illegal suspension of 12 MPs is not a prelude to my suspension for the forthcoming budget session. This regime is capable of anything and most of all is simply not interested in any meaningful discussion on pressing national issues.”“And as far as Joshi’s accusation is concerned, I have always believed respect has to commanded, not demanded,” he added.Joshi said a “deeply pained” chairman “reached out to the Opposition to break the stalemate”.The minister accused the Opposition of “coming back in multiple voices which were unclear and contradictory at the same time”.“Duplicitousness was obvious beneath some weak conciliatory overtures. When the chairman reached out in a concrete manner, the response proved that the intention beneath the conciliatory talk was that the House does not run,” the minister said.Union minister and leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, said the Opposition should introspect on the “uncivilised” behaviour of MPs who “attacked marshals, including women, in Parliament”.“Opposition must introspect on uncivilised behaviour of MPs who attacked marshals, including women in Parliament, & their unregretful, totally obstructive response to honest, sincere efforts of Govt. & Chairman Shri @MVenkaiahNaidu ji to resolve the issue,” Goyal tweeted.Hitting out at the opposition parties, Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who is also the minister for petroleum, said, “The Opposition didn’t allow Parliament to work. There were several issues which had to be discussed such as price rise and the government was ready to discuss them. But they didn’t let the discussion happen.”Taking a dig at the Congress, BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said, “They neither know how to run a government nor act like a responsible Opposition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-opposition-exchange-barbs-over-disruptions-during-winter-session-of-parliament-101640373386477.html

Bundles of currency were wrapped in paper bound in plastic covers secured with brown tape. Another picture showed income tax officials surrounded by piles of cash, and three currency counting machines in the room.The raids on multiple premises in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Mumbai began on Thursday at a factory owned by Ms Trimurti Fragrances, which manufactures the Shikhar brand of paan masala in Kanpur. The raids extended to offices and warehouses owned by Ganpati Road Carriers, also in Kanpur, following which the action shifted to Piyush Jain, a supplier of compounds for Shikhar.“Based on intelligence inputs, the residential premises of partners of Ms Odochem Industries supplying perfumery compounds was also searched,” said a GST department’s statement.“During the search proceedings at the residential premises, huge amounts of cash, wrapped in paper and plastic have been found. The process to count the cash has been initiated with the help of State Bank of India (Kanpur) officials, which may continue till December 24 evening,” the statement said.“The total amount is expected to be in excess of ₹150 crore,” it further said.GST officials said the money was linked to the dispatch of goods through fake invoices and without generating e-way bills by the transporter who generated multiple invoices in the name of non-existent firms. All the invoices were below ₹50,000 for one truckload to avoid generation of bills.At least 200 fake invoices used for transportation of goods without payment of GST had been recovered from the warehouse of the transporter, said the DGGI.A DGGI team from Ahmedabad zone took Jain’s two sons, Pratyush Jain and Molu Jain, to their ancestral house in Chipatta locality in Kannauj later in the day. The house was sealed on Thursday as Jain refused to be present when asked to come for the search, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-recovers-record-rs-150-crore-cash-from-up-businessman-101640372241853.html

25-12-2021||India||Decision on UP elections after review next week: CEC||The election commission would examine the Allahabad high court’s observation to postpone Uttar Pradesh assembly polls after analysing the situation in the state, chief election commissioner of India Sushil Chandra said on Friday.“The Commission will visit Uttar Pradesh next week during which it will analyse the situation there followed by necessary actions on the same,” Chandra said, while addressing a press conference here.The Allahabad high court on Thursday urged the election commission to consider postponing the polls in Uttar Pradesh considering the increasing threat of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. In case the elections could not be postponed, the high court requested the poll body to stop political rallies, which witness large gatherings, and to direct the political parties to campaign through Doordarshan and print media instead.Assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa, are scheduled for early next year. Chandra, along with election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anoop Chandra Pandey, was in Uttarakhand for a two-day visit to review preparedness for the elections to 70-member legislative assembly.The CEC, citing the Covid-19 precautions, said the commission has identified various grounds and buildings where the candidates could hold their election rallies. “To ensure that social distancing is maintained in the rallies amid Covid-19 scare, the commission has identified 601 grounds and 277 buildings across Uttarakhand for holding rallies. Their details would soon be put online so that the candidates can book them as per their requirement,” Chandra said, adding the venues would be given on first come first serve basis. Chandra also announced that the commission has decided to increase voting period by one hour in Uttarakhand, considering the difficult terrain in the hill state. “Under a move which would be commenced from Uttarakhand, the ECI has decided to increase the voting period by one hour due to the difficult terrain in many areas of the state posing difficulty for the voters to reach the polling booths. Under this the new voting period would be from 8am to 6pm instead of 8am-5pm,” Chandra said, after concluding the two-day visit to Himalayan state.The CEC said candidates that have criminal background “will have to reveal details about the ongoing criminal cases against them before the public”.“Those candidates would have to get the details of their cases published thrice in newspapers. They will also have to share the details on news channels. Besides, the onus will also be on the political parties to do the same exercise for their candidates having criminal background. They will have to inform the voters, the reason behind fielding a candidate with criminal background so that they know what sort of candidates are contesting before exercising their franchise,” said Chandra. “Social media will also be strictly monitored to check posts related to hate speech or any sort of discrimination, if any, so that proper action can be taken by the commission.” The poll body has also decided to take strict measures to stop liquor, drugs or freebies being offered to the voters to influence them, which “vitiates the election process”, the CEC said. He added that the commission would monitor all airports, airstrips and intra-and-inter-state crossings to curb such activities.“Expenditure observers will also be appointed in the state during elections to monitor the expenditure by various candidates on poll campaign,” Chandra said. The commission will also make arrangements to ensure each polling booth has a reduced capacity of 1,200 voters instead of 1,500 at present, the CEC said. “This has been done to ensure proper social distancing during the voting. Due to this move the ECI will set up 623 more polling booths taking the total polling booths in the state to 11,447. With the total 81.43 lakh (roughly 8.14 million) registered voters in state, on an average, there would be at least 700 voters at each polling booth,” said Chandra. Uttarakhand will also have 100 polling booths managed completely by women while five polling booths will be managed by differently abled officials, Chandra said. “Of the total 81.43 lakh voters, 66,648 are differently abled, 1.43 lakh are above 80 years of age and 93,935 voters are servicemen,” Chandra said.“Among them, the ones who are 80 plus, would be given a facility to cast their vote through ballot paper at their home only, for which the electoral officer would go to their places. The political parties will be informed about it and proper videography will be done to ensure the secrecy and transparency of the whole process. Similarly, the servicemen voters would also be able to cast their votes through ballots,” Chandra said, adding that the “Commission will take all necessary steps to ensure an unbiased, transparent, free and fair elections”. The CEC on Thursday had met representatives of different political parties in Uttarakhand, the state’s chief secretary and director general of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-on-up-elections-after-review-next-weekcec-101640371882728.html
25-12-2021||India||5 arrested for attempt to extort ₹1 crore from MoS Mishra: Police||Five people were arrested in Delhi and Noida for allegedly trying to extort at least a crore from Union minister of state Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni on Friday, Delhi Police said. The accused – four of whom were arrested from Noida and one from Delhi – allegedly made at least four to five voice over internet protocol (VoIP) calls to the minister last week, they added.According to police, Mishra in his complaint on December 17 alleged that he received around four to five calls from unidentified people who claimed to have “incriminating” videos related to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case in which his son, Ashish, is facing murder charge along with 12 others.Ashish is the main accused in the incident in which an SUV allegedly rammed into four farmers and a journalist in Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. In the ensuing violence, two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and the driver of the SUV were killed.“The minister informed police that the five men were blackmailing him. Following his complaint, a case was registered at North Avenue police station,” an officer said, seeking anonymity. The officer added that they have approached Uttar Pradesh Police to check the criminal record of the four accused from Noida. Police, however, said they are yet to recover any videos related to the incident from the five accused. Another officer, on condition of anonymity, said all the accused were adults. While two of them were students of Class 12, the other two worked in call centres. The fifth accused ran a call centre in Noida.Those arrested were Amit Kumar, Ashwani, Amit Majhi, Kabir Verma and Nishant. All the accused in 21 and 26 age group. Kumar and Verma are the mastermind behind the calls, police said. HT tried to contact the minister for a comment but could not get one immediately.

25-12-2021||India||Kapurthala case not of sacrilege: Channi||There is no evidence that a man who was lynched by a mob for allegedly trying to desecrate a Sikh flag at a gurdwara in Kapurthala earlier this week had attempted to commit sacrilege, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said on Friday.The caretaker of the gurdwara has now been arrested on the charge of murder, and nearly 100 unidentified people have also been booked in the case, government officials said.The man, yet to be indentified but said to be in his twenties, was beaten to death at the gurdwara in Nizampur village of the district on December 19. Gurdwara caretaker, Amarjit Singh, alleged that he saw the victim “disrespecting” the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag.Doctors who conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased found 30 injuries on his body, including multiple stab wounds.The incident, which came a day after a man was killed over a sacrilege bid at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, sparked strong outrage in the state -- both from people who were angered by the man’s alleged sacrilege attempt, and by those who stressed that politicians across party lines were not criticising his public lynching.Punjab goes to the polls early next year, and sacrilege has been a burning issue in the state ever since a series of incidents alleging disrespect to the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, were reported in the state in 2015.Channi said the investigation has revealed the story behind the case was different from what was being propagated earlier. “We did not find any sacrilege attempt or any evidence to back it. One person ran the gurdwara. This thing has moved to murder and an inquiry is on,” the CM said.Jalandhar range inspector general of police Gurinder Singh Dhillon and Kapurthala senior superintendent of police Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh briefed reporters after the gurdwara caretaker’s arrest. Calling it a “well-planned conspiracy”, Dhillon confirmed that there was “no visible sign of sacrilege till now”.“The youth was brutally murdered as part of a well-planned conspiracy which we are not able to detect yet. Amarjit planned everything and gathered his associates [for the lynching]. Many of them have not been identified yet,” he said.“There are videos and photographs (of the day of the incident). Since an SHO was present (police reached the gurdwara when the victim was being beaten up), he will be able to identify them during investigation and due course of law will follow,” said Dhillon.A pistol, from which two shots were fired on Friday with the intent to kill the man, has also been recovered, he said, adding that at least 25 people in the mob that thrashed the victim were armed.Section 302 (murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and relevant sections of the Arms Act have been added in the first information report (FIR), Dhillon said, adding that a medical board has taken the victim’s samples for DNA testing to ascertain his identity.Police initially filed a case against the deceased under Section 295-A (hurting religious sentiments) based on the complaint filed by the gurdwara caretaker.Police suspect that the victim came to the gurdwara with the intention of committing theft, said the official said.The man was cremated on Thursday eveningafter nobody came to claim the victim’s body, said senior medical officer (SMO) Narinder Singh.Giving more details about the accused, the Jalandhar IGP said that Amarjit Singh came to Kapurthala in 2008.He was earlier booked in a car theft case in 2016, but the police failed to establish his role and subsequently filed a closure report which was accepted by the court in 2019, Dhillon said.Amarjit’s claim that the man attempted sacrilege was found to be contradictory after a video surfaced on social media on Sunday, where some Sikh leaders were questioning the deceased and Amarjit admitted that the deceased did not commit sacrilege with the Guru Granth Sahib. In another video, he was heard alleging that the deceased was sent “by someone from Delhi and was given money for executing the desecration”. HT has seen both the videos.With PTI inputs
25-12-2021||India||Variant watch: UK govt study backs lower Omicron severity risk||The government of UK has now corroborated what three studies found last week: the Omicron variant is significantly less likely to send people to the hospital. In its latest technical briefing on Sars-CoV-2 variants, released late on Thursday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there was a 50-70% reduced risk of hospital admission for Omicron infections compared to the Delta variant. In an accompanying risk assessment that UKHSA released, it said the reduction in risk “is likely to be partly a reduction in intrinsic severity of the virus and partly to protection provided by prior infection”. “We cannot confidently quantify the relative contributions of these two factors at present. Even at the reduced hospitalisation risk observed, the combined growth advantage and immune evasion properties of Omicron have the potential to lead to very high numbers of admissions to hospital,” it added, reiterating a warning that experts all over the world have said.But the findings are now consistent in four studies, and they indeed offer hope for some cautious optimism. The first study was from South Africa, where government experts found an up to 70% lower risk of hospitalisation for people with Omicron variant compared to those who had a Delta infection. The second study was by the University of Edinburgh, which had a wide range indicating significant uncertainty in its findings, but the risk of hospitalisation among Omicron infections was reduced by at least 48% and up to 81%. The third study was by the Imperial College of London, which found a 45-50% reduction of risk on average (including people with vaccines and past infection). Crucially, this study estimated the intrinsic severity (relevant for unvaccinated, previously uninfected people) could be 0-30% lower.UKHSA, as the others, said the estimates were still preliminary. “These analyses are preliminary because of the small numbers of Omicron cases currently in hospital and the limited spread of Omicron into older age groups as yet. There is insufficient data to comment on severity of illness once in hospital or mortality,” the risk assessment document said.More insight into vaccine hit...A crucial new detail that the UKHSA report adds to the understanding of the Omicron variant is that vaccine boosters (the UK uses mRNA doses for boosters) begin to wane from one month onwards and show as low as 30-50% efficacy from 10 weeks after the third doses. “This waning is faster for Omicron than for Delta infections,” the technical briefing document said. But it added that protection against severe disease and death is likely to continue. “There are insufficient severe cases of Omicron as yet to analyse vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, but this is expected to be better sustained, for both primary and booster doses,” it said.Experts told HT on Thursday that vaccine efficacy against severe disease is likely to be helped by how vaccines train what is known as the cellular immunity. T cells, part of this immunity, retain a more durable ability to find and kill cells infected with Sars-CoV-2, even if it is of the Omicron variety. The other component seen as key is what is known as humoral immunity, which has antibodies. These antibodies bind to the virus before they infect cells. Lab studies earlier this month discovered that Omicron has heavily mutated in regions that antibodies typically bind to, but not in regions that T cells recognise to destroy them. Thus raising the theoretical hope that even if an infection is not prevented, which is the job antibodies, an Omicron disease will mostly remain mild or asymptomatic – as has been reported anecdotally....and into reinfections ratesAs reported in the other studies, and expected since the new variant is more resistant to antibodies that will also include those from a past infection, Omicron is more likely to cause a reinfection than other variants. “The population reinfection rate has increased sharply and disproportionately to the number of first infections. 9.5% of Omicron infections have been identified to have previous confirmed infections, which is likely to be a substantial underestimate of the proportion of reinfections. The first infections of the individuals with Omicron reinfections occurred in both the Alpha and Delta waves and are likely to have been undetected if in the first wave,” the technical briefing document said.Here, too, the risk of hospital admission in people who had a prior infection is likely to be lower than their chances of being infected in the first place. The UKHSA report pointed to the relevant finding by the Imperial College researchers, who concluded “the reduced risk of hospitalisation in those previously infected estimated as 55 to 70%”

Relatives of the man who was attacked have accused police personnel of helping the assailants and handing the couple over to the attackers.“As of now, we are not in a position to confirm or deny that the couple was abducted from outside the police station. Also, the allegations of the man’s family that the police deliberately handed over the couple’s custody to the woman’s family members is a matter of probe. The couple had arrived at the Rajouri Garden station on December 22 and filed an application for police protection. What happened thereafter is being probed,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Gautam.Two police personnel, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), were suspended on Friday after the initial inquiry suggested some lapses on their part while handling the matter. Two women from the woman’s family, including her grandmother, were arrested on Friday. At least 10 others, including her parents, are still absconding, the officers said.The victim, whose identity is being protected due to the nature of the attack, has been admitted to the AIIMS Trauma Centre. Both the victim and the accused, however, belong to the Sansi tribe and there is no caste or religious angle to the hate crime, police said.“They should have killed my son if they really wanted to punish him for marrying their daughter. Leaving him alive to spend his entire life with this shame is a trauma that my son may not be able to face. How will he show his face in society? I fear he will kill himself to avoid the humiliations and social stigma,” said the man’s mother.A readymade garment hawker by profession, the man lives with his mother and four brothers at their home in TC Camp, Raghubir Nagar, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Rajouri Garden police station.On December 11, at around 7.30am, the man left home, the family said. Around 7pm on December 22, one of brothers of the victim received a call from the police, summoning the family after informing him that the man was there with his newly wedded wife. By the time the victim’s family reached the police station, the couple had left.“The police personnel told us that they allowed the couple to leave as they were adults and were eligible for the marriage without their families’ wishes. The two had told them that they tied the knot at a temple in Jaipur, where they spent 10 days. At that time, the police did not tell us that the woman’s family members took them both from the police station,” said the victim’s mother.Around 11pm the same night, the victim’s brother was called by someone from the woman’s family, asking them to take him back from their residence in Sagarpur in south-west Delhi.One of the siblings who reached the spot found the victim lying in a drain next to the woman’s house, with his private parts severed and injury marks all over his body.Additional DCP Gautam said the victim’s family did not call the police even after finding him in a seriously injured condition. The police were informed by Safdarjung hospital authorities on December 23, a day after the crime.“At least a dozen family members were involved in the crime. We registered a case and arrested the woman’s grandmother and aunt as they were also involved. Raids are being conducted to nab other absconding family members,” said Gautam, adding that action will be taken if any police personnel of the police station were found at fault in handling the entire matter.
25-12-2021||India||China sending Tibetan kids for training, indoctrination: Intel||Chinese authorities have begun sending Tibetan children to special camps to be indoctrinated in a Sinicised worldview and given basic military training in order to prepare them to be inducted into militias amid the standoff with India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Though most of the Tibetan children at these camps are teens, there are reports that some as young as eight or nine years have been sent to the indoctrination facilities, people familiar with the matter said, citing intelligence reports and intercepts from Indian security agencies.The indoctrination is also aimed at overcoming resistance within the local population to the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) efforts to recruit more Tibetans, the people added.Earlier this month, the Tibet Action Institute issued a report that said Chinese authorities in Tibet have set up a wide network of boarding schools for Tibetan children to separate them from parents, and reduce their exposure to their own language and culture. The report estimated that up to 900,000 Tibetan children aged six to 18, and an unknown number of four- and five-year-olds, are in the state-run schools.“The schools function as sites for remoulding children into Chinese nationals loyal to the CCP. Removed from their families and communities, students must study primarily in Chinese, are barred from practising their religion, and are subjected to political indoctrination,” the report said.The reports from Indian security agencies suggest children are being sent to special camps to indoctrinate them with a Sinicised worldview that disregards Tibetan Buddhist values and prepares them to be soldiers, the people said.Recent reports have pinpointed at least two camps where Tibetan children aged nine to 14 years are being provided basic military training and indoctrination in order to prepare them for induction into militias. Some 400 Tibetan children were imparted basic military training, including handling weapons, at Nyingchi training camp, located in an area opposite India’s Arunachal Pradesh state, the people said.Almost 200 Tibetan youth, mostly below the age for recruitment into the military, were shifted from a training camp in Shiquanhe to Gar Gunsa in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) in November, the people added.The people pointed out that the move to send children to camps where they are given military training contravenes international conventions against the recruitment of children in war zones or into militias.These conventions include the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, or the child soldier treaty, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2000, the Paris Principles on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict 2007 and instructions passed by Unicef, all of which state that no one below the age of 18 can be recruited into any form of military organisation.As first reported by Hindustan Times in June, China’s military has raised new militias comprising Tibetan youths in the strategic Chumbi Valley in TAR as part of enhanced efforts to recruit more Tibetans. Since last year, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has held recruitment drives across TAR to rope in more locals and there are also plans to raise a Special Tibetan Army Unit.Newly recruited Tibetan youth have now been deployed along the LAC in areas such as Demchok, Chepzi and Galwan Nala, the people said.The people said that Chinese authorities are attempting to recruit more Tibetans in order to offset the disadvantages of posting ethnic Han soldiers at high altitudes, especially in areas under the Western Theatre Command, which is the main PLA formation responsible for the border with India.The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy also concluded in a recent report that Chinese authorities now believe the first responder troops at high altitudes need to be Tibetan, who can function effectively in areas with low oxygen. “In turn, that means not only recruiting Tibetans willing and able to confront the Tibetans of the Indo-Tibetan Border Force, but also ensuring the loyalty of their Tibetan families and communities,” the report said.There have been numerous reports of PLA officers and troops being affected due to prolonged exposure to high altitude, the harsh terrain and adverse weather conditions during the standoff with India that began in May 2020. There have also been reports of Chinese troops suffering from psychological and severe health issues. Despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides have been unable to agree on disengagement at several friction points in Ladakh sector.
25-12-2021||India||70% Omicron cases are asymptomatic: Govt||A government analysis of 183 of the 358 known Omicron variant Covid-19 cases in India found that 70% of the infected are asymptomatic and the rest have mild symptoms, health ministry officials said on Friday.A little over 90% of the cases for whom vaccination status was known had taken a full course of their shots, and 61% of the cases were in men, the analysis showed. Taken together, the trends fit findings in other countries – some of which the Union health ministry cited – of the variant causing a significant number of breakthrough infections after vaccination, but mostly manifesting in a mild or asymptomatic manner.“Regarding infection with Omicron, it does not necessarily lead to severe symptomatic clinical disease. In India, about a third of all detected cases were mildly symptomatic and the rest were asymptomatic; therefore, the treatment for Omicron-infected symptomatic individuals remains the same. It does not change from that for Delta or Alpha or even Beta,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“The predominant strain in India is Delta; including in recently identified clusters. Therefore, we need to continue with the same strategy of Covid-appropriate behaviour and ramping up the vaccination,” Bhargava added.The 358 positive Omicron cases have been reported from 17 States and Union Territories so far, according to the health ministry data. Of this number, 114 have recovered.To be sure, the large share of vaccinated people among confirmed Omicron infections is because of a testing bias -- testing, even of asymptomatic cases and genome sequencing is targeted at international travellers, most of whom are vaccinated since countries generally seek proof of vaccination or impose strict quarantine rules on foreign arrivals.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who opened the briefing, said that of the 183 Omicron positive cases analysed, 121 had a foreign travel history and 44, with no travel history, were close contacts.“Gender wise, 39% of these analysed omicron positive cases were women and 61% were men,” said Bhushan.“Seven people were unvaccinated, and two were partially vaccinated. Sixteen people were ineligible for vaccination. Vaccination status of 73 persons is unknown,” he added.The Union government has not identified any community transmission case of Omicron variant infection yet, although the government has begun efforts to send more random samples for genome sequencing, which determines the variant.Globally, 108 countries have reported 151,368 Omicron cases and there have been 26 deaths, the data released by Bhushan said. India has not reported any deaths in this category yet.Experts said while India needs to worry because even a small percentage of infections could mean large numbers getting infected, there are tools that can be relied on to fight the variant.“We have tools that we did not have earlier such as drugs and vaccines that can be quickly updated if needed,” said Gagandeep Kang, one of the country’s top vaccine experts and senior faculty, Christian Medical College, Vellore.At the briefing, Bhushan elaborated on the pre-emptive preparations that have been made. “Based on experience of the first and second Covid surge that the country saw, there are more than 1.8 million (1,810,083) isolation beds ready as of now; almost 500,000 oxygen supported beds; nearly 140,000 ICU beds; 24,057 paediatric ICU beds; and 64,796 non-ICU paediatric beds. Apart from this, with the help of emergency Covid response package-II that has a sum of ₹23,123 crore, states are preparing 96,913 additional oxygen supported beds, 20,475 ICU beds, and 9,574 paediatric ICU beds,” said Bhushan.The official added that one of the specific focus areas of preparations was supply of medical oxygen in hospitals to treat critically ill patients that government is focusing on. “Medical oxygen supply is another important issue even though in the global experience so far, and South Africa in particular, Omicron positive cases have not required additional medical oxygen support. However, we need to be vigilant, and proactive; therefore, we have made appropriate arrangements,” said Bhushan.“During the first Covid wave, total medical oxygen requirement in a day shot up to 1,000 metric tonne; in the second wave it rose to 10,000 metric tonne, which was a ten-fold increase in demand. And because of the collective efforts of the Union government and the state governments, we were able to address that. Today, we have created a capacity of 18,800 metric tonne of medical oxygen per day,” he added.Bhushan also said the country is recording a steady increase in vaccination numbers, another crucial tool in the fight against Covid-19. So far, 89% of the adult population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and 61% is fully vaccinated.But, there are still at least 11 states that have vaccinated fewer number of beneficiaries than the national average, for both first and the second dose.“It is a significant achievement that 89% of the adult population has received at least one vaccine dose; and 61% is fully protected — they have received both the doses. Nineteen states have first dose coverage of at least 90% of their eligible population, which is more than the national average. However, the cause for concern for us are the 11 states and Union territories where the first and second dose coverage is less than the national average. We have engaged with these states on a continuous basis; and last such review was yesterday (Thursday) wherein it was discussed how to increase the coverage,” said the health secretary.On introducing booster dose, and starting vaccination in children, the health ministry reiterated its stand that it will go by the opinion of technical experts based on scientific evidence.“In Parliament, and outside of it, government of India has clearly articulated the position that we would be governed by science and scientific evidence on deciding on the need and timing for an additional dose and for lowering the age of vaccination. Our stand remains the same,” said Bhushan, while adding that a booster was not a silver bullet for the pandemic.“We are reviewing all scientific data from across the world as well as from India, which includes T-cell response, antibody response with a particular vaccine, with another vaccine, and how long it persists, and how long it persists after infection. Taking all those into consideration, we are deliberating and we shall be formulating our policy,” said Bhargava, who is one of the experts on the technical committee.
25-12-2021||India||Om Birla expresses concern over ruckus in Parliament, state assemblies||Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Friday expressed concern over “continuous ruckus” and “pre-planned disruptions” during proceedings in Parliament and state assemblies.“The way in which dignity and decency are decreasing inside Houses is a cause of worry. We all need to collectively think about this. We need to make the assemblies the places for discussions and debates,” he said while addressing the Assam legislative assembly during a day-long visit.There should be agreements and disagreements, but the expectations of the public should be reflected in the Houses, Birla said, adding that elected representatives should also articulate the ideologies they represent.“Obstructing proceedings in a pre-planned manner and not allowing the House to function is not part of our democratic traditions. It is my appeal to you to make the state assemblies centres of good debate and discussions, but not turn them into centres of ruckus.” The speaker said he has raised the issue in Lok Sabha and discussed it with leaders of all parties.Birla also launched the Assam Legislative Assembly Digital TV at a programme in the central hall of the legislature.Addressing legislators, Birla said that governments come and go, but the responsibility of strengthening and upholding the traditions of democracy lies with them. He also urged elected representatives to set a good precedent in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies so that it percolates down to panchayats and municipalities. “On the 75th anniversary of our Independence, we need to make efforts to uphold the dignity of our democracy with high-level discussions and debates. I am hopeful we will all work collectively towards that goal.”Stating that pluralism and diversity give strength to India’s democracy, Birla added that despite diverse cultures, languages, food habits and dress, democracy has kept Indians united.“Citizens have been kept at the centre of our election process. Today, we can take pride that elections in our democracy are impartial and unquestionable. That is why after 17 general elections and over 300 assembly polls, the smooth transfer of power has been the strength of our democracy,” he said.“We have seen that in some democracies across the world, smooth transfer of power does not always happen. It is the strength of our constitution due to which we can say with pride that we believe in governments elected by the people,” the speaker added.
