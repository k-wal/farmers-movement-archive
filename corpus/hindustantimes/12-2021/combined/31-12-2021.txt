31-12-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah says SP, Congress, BSP were against Ram temple construction in the past||Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday played the temple and development card while attacking the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at two public meetings in Ayodhya and Sant Kabir Nagar districts of Uttar Pradesh.Accusing the three parties of having made efforts in the past to prevent construction of the Ram temple, the Union home minister asked the gathering at Government Inter College Ground in Ayodhya to question former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav “what was the need to open fire on kar sevaks in Ayodhya?” The firing took place during the tenure of Akhilesh’s father Mulayam Singh Yadav as the UP chief minister in 1990.Amit Shah, who is on a whirlwind tour of Uttar Pradesh for 2022 assembly polls, also said, “Since ages, a large number of people have sacrificed their lives for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. But the temple never came up. Now, a magnificent Ram temple is being constructed at the birthplace of Lord Ram.”“Many efforts were made by the Congress, the SP and the BSP during their tenures to prevent the construction of the Ram temple. Do you remember who shot at the kar sevaks? They were thrashed badly, killed and thrown in the Sarayu river,” Shah said. “What was the need to open fire on the kar sevaks in Ayodhya? Ask Akhilesh when he comes here to seek votes,” Amit Shah further said as the crowd responded with applause. Continuing his attack, the Union home minister said: “Why did Ram Lalla have to stay in a tent for so many years? Who stopped Ram Navami celebrations and Deepotsav in Ayodhya?” Challenging SP, BSP and the Congress, Amit Shah stated that no one can stop the construction of Ram temple now. Making a similar pitch at a rally in Khalilabad (Sant Kabir Nagar), he said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has no power to stop construction of the temple as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid the foundation of the Ram temple on August 5, 2020.In a few months, a grand temple will come up at the birthplace of Lord Ram, Amit Shah asserted.Staying on the temple theme, Union home minister also said at Sant Kabir Nagar that Prime Minister Narendra Modi constructed the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor in Varanasi for the rejuvenation of the Kashi Vishwanath temple that was lying neglected since Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s rule. The restoration and beautification of the Vindhyavasini temple has been also completed at Mirzapur, he further said.At the Ayodhya rally, Shah also attacked the Samajwadi Party over income tax raids in Kannauj district which is famous for perfumes. “The smell of corruption shows us how deep the roots of the SP’s sins are. When those roots are being attacked, why do you feel sick, Akhilesh Yadav?” said Shah. “Earlier, there was mafia raj in Uttar Pradesh. But today they are surrendering before police,” he said, adding that the Yogi government had freed the state from the clutches of the mafia. “There used to be three Ps at the time of SP government. Parivarwad (nepotism), Pakshpat (favouritism) and Palayan (exodus). However, the BJP government works on three Vs of Vikas (development), Vyapar (business) and saanskrtik Viraasat (cultural heritage),” the Union home minister said. Amit Shah also listed development projects of the Yogi Adityanath government, including five expressways, the Kushinagar international airport, AIIMS at Gorakhpur, the Ayodhya airport project and the under renovation Ayodhya railway station among others. He announced that a university in the name of Lord Ram would be constructed in Ayodhya. Waterways from Varanasi to Haldia through the Ganga has been completed and the DPR (detailed project report) for the Metro service in Gorakhpur is ready, he further said.Women and girls are safe in UP under the BJP government, Amit Shah said later at Sant Kabir Nagar.“People should give their blessings to the BJP in the 2022 assembly elections to make UP the number one state in the country,” he said.Farmers in East UP, known as the sugar bowl of the state, were at the receiving end under bua-babua (Mayawati- Akhilesh) governments, he claimed.In contrast, under the Modi and Yogi governments, the modernisation of 20 sugar mills was done, the rate of sugarcane and the price of sugar were increased, Amit Shah said.A total of ₹1.48 lakh crore payment has been made to sugarcane farmers and the loans of 86 lakh farmers were waived, he said. The home minister also said UP leads the country in Covid vaccination. (Uttar Pradesh is the first state in the country to administer 20 crore or 200 million Covid vaccine doses).Invoking Sant Kabir and Gautam Buddha, Shah said the massive crowd indicates the BJP will bag above 300 seats in the 2022 UP assembly elections.“I was associated with three elections in UP — 2014 (Lok Sabha), 2017 (assembly) and 2019 (Lok Sabha). In all the three elections, the voters in UP gave big mandate to the BJP,” he said.The Yogi Adityanath government has taken UP on the path of development and ended goondaraj in UP, he said. Earlier, the terrorists used to cross the border and kill jawans, but the Congress government that was in power did nothing, the Union home minister said, adding the Modi government gave a befitting reply to the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks by launching surgical and airstrikes across the LoC and the Pakistan border.Reacting to Amit Shah’s remarks, former UP minister Pawan Pandey, who had won the Ayodhya assembly seat for the SP in the 2012 polls, said, “In 2012, the Samajwadi Party won the elections, including the Ayodhya seat. This time also, the SP will win the state and Ayodhya as the people of the state and the temple town have made up their mind. And given the scenario, the entire BJP is rattled at the way Samajwadi Party is winning peoples’ support. This scare and frustration are making their top leaders make absurd statements and speeches.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-says-sp-congress-bsp-were-against-ram-temple-construction-in-the-past-101640971190652.html

Muslims gathered at seven sites, including Udyog Vihar, and offered namaz peacefully,” he said.On December 10, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said offering namaz at public places cannot be tolerated, even as the district administration withdrew permission for Friday namaz at 20 designated sites amid protests by members of Hindu outfits who parked vehicles and organised programmes to prevent Muslims from offering namaz.
31-12-2021||Lucknow||Cong accuses Shah of misleading UP people||The Congress has accused Union home minister Amit Shah of misleading the people of state at the public rallies being organised “using the government funds in Uttar Pradesh”. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu said Shah and chief minister Yogi Adityanath were not focusing on the issues concerning the people and were discussing issues that had nothing to do with UP’s development instead. He said the people of state had made up their mind to vote out the BJP under Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s leadership.Lallu said Shah was speaking about nepotism, unfairness and migration though the BJP was going to allot 30 percent party tickets to family members of senior BJP leaders in the 2022 UP ass​embly elections. He said the Congress on the other hand had decided to allocate 40 percent tickets to women in Uttar Pradesh.He said the BJP led regime had led to rising unemployment and the youth would be compelled to migrate if the BJP formed government for one more time in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-accuses-shah-of-misleading-up-people-101640971131006.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Two held in Delhi for impersonating policemen, robbing foreign national||Two men were arrested for allegedly impersonating policemen and robbing a 73-year-old Australian woman of ₹2,000 on the pretext of Covid-19 guideline violations in south Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin area on December 29, police said on Friday. The stolen ₹2,000 was recovered from the arrested men, identified as Vakil, 30, and Badrinath, 28, both from Madhya Pradesh, they said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Surendra Choudhary said that the two suspects were chased and arrested by a team of the Hazrat Nizamuddin police station that was patrolling the neighbourhood where the alleged impersonation and robbery took place. The crime took place outside the rented flat of the elderly Australian national.The foreigner whose name was withheld by the police is a retired Australian government official and is currently associated with a Delhi-based non-governmental organisation (NGO). The additional DCP said that on December 29, the patrolling team was near the gurdwara when they heard a woman screaming “chor-chor (thieves)”. The four team members rushed towards her and saw two men, dressed as policemen, fleeing the scene. They chased and caught the duo and began questioning them. At the same time, an elderly woman, who identified herself as an Australian citizen, arrived and alleged that the two “policemen” had robbed her of ₹2,000.“The foreigner told our staff that she was standing near the staircase of her rented house when the duo came and asked her to pay ₹2,000 as Covid challan for not wearing a mask. When she refused, the two forcibly took ₹2,000 from her and fled after pushing her. A case was registered and the two suspects were arrested,” said Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-held-in-delhi-for-impersonating-policemen-robbing-foreign-national-101640971128792.html

31-12-2021||Delhi||Nearly 700 red zones in Delhi sealed in 10 days to curb Covid spread||As Covid-19 cases increase in the national capital, authorities have sealed nearly 700 hot spots between December 20 and 30, showed data from Delhi’s district administrations.As on December 30, Delhi had 849 micro containment zones, up from 176 on December 20, according to the data.Also Read | Positivity rate up to 2.44%, city adds 1796 new casesContainment zones are sealed premises or areas that are essentially under a hard lockdown for a certain period, and are placed under increased surveillance by district teams. Essential goods are delivered to doorsteps, and these areas can be de-notified only if no new cases are added for 14 days.Delhi’s South district, comprising Saket, Hauz Khas, and Mehrauli, among other areas, has 402 containment zones — the highest among the city’s 11 revenue districts. The West district, comprising Patel Nagar, Punjabi Bagh, Rajouri Garden, and other areas, follows the South district with 108 containment zones. The New Delhi district, comprising Chankyapuri, Vasant Vihar, and Delhi Cantonment areas, has 86 containment zones, and the North district, comprising Narela, Model Town, and Alipur and other areas, has 70 containment zones.A South district official, requesting anonymity, said the number of containment zones is higher in the district because district authorities are trying to contain as many positive cases as possible to check further spread of the coronavirus. “Many containment zones have only one Covid-19 patient,” said the official.To be sure, all of the sealed zones in Delhi encompass no more than a few flats, in accordance with the state’s micro containment zone policy, as compared to the early days of the pandemic, when entire areas or lanes were shut.Densely populated districts have very few containment zones. The North-East district, one of the city’s most densely populated districts comprising Karawal Nagar, Yamuna Vihar, Seelampur, and other areas, had zero containment zones on December 30.A North-East district official said the district isolated Covid-19 cases, and there was not even a single cluster with three cases (needed to create a containment zone). “But we still created 20 containment zones, and as of December 31, the district has 20 containment zones. The containment zones work as a deterrent against home isolation violations,” said the official, adding that North East has one of the lowest caseloads.The East district, which has Gandhi Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Preet Vihar and other areas under it, has 11 containment zones and Shahdara has 32 containment zones. The Central district, which is also densely populated, has only 18 containment zones.A North district administration official said containment zones are created by sealing a particular area such as a flat, house, or floor after a patient tests positive for Covid-19 and is found fit enough to stay in home isolation. “The assessment is done by district health officials. In many cases, containment zones have been created even where only one person tested positive. Containment zones are created on a micro-scale to ensure that there is minimum inconvenience to those living nearby,” said the official, seeking anonymity.“Civil defence volunteers are deployed to check on violations in the sealed area. The district health teams get in touch with the patient and trace and test his/her contacts. In some cases, we have traced and tested up to 40 contacts. Most patients in containment zones right now are asymptomatic and are recovering in home isolation,” a health department official said on condition of anonymity.According to experts, during the first wave that swept through the Capital in March-April 2020, the first containment zones were created in Delhi’s overpopulated districts, but during the pandemic’s later waves, these areas reported fewer cases as well as a comparatively lower number of containment zones.Delhi’s first containment zone was carved out in Shahdara on March 26, 2020.Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the districts reporting a low number of Covid-19 cases right now had reported a high number during the first wave. “The first containment zone in Delhi was created in Shahdara, followed by the East district. These are densely populated areas where infection spread quickly, and people developed antibodies against coronavirus. Evidence has emerged that people who recover from mild Covid-19 develop antibodies which may last a lifetime,” Dr Rai told HT.Dr Rai added that a large number of people were infected with the coronavirus and recovered without even realising they were infected, and that ultimately shielded them against Covid-19. He said this was the reason behind these districts reporting a lower number of cases even during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nearly-700-red-zones-in-delhi-sealed-in-10-days-to-curb-covid-spread-101640969448480.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Covid curbs and Metro woes: 50% capacity makes Delhiites find alternatives||New DelhiAs per the list of curbs in Delhi, which is under yellow alert, only 50% capacity is allowed in the Delhi Metro. And this has sent the regular metro commuters in a tizzy. Anticipating longer queues, Delhi-NCR residents say they had begun finding their way around, to ditch the extended commuting hours, as soon as the news came in. Curfew lead winter breakRupali Sagar, a Rohini-based dancer-choreographer who takes the metro almost everyday to reach her studio in Paschim Vihar, has now planned to give her students some time off. “Almost everyone in my dance class takes the metro, including me. In fact, I even take the metro to provide lessons to a few of my students at their homes. We have tight rehearsal schedules, but considering the now long queues that will be at metro stations, I’ve decided to give a winter vacation to all my students. Studentsbhi khush aur mujhe bhi Metro board karne ke liye battlefield jaisa experience nahi karna padega because the rush is going to get insane for sure,” says Sagar. Buffer time is a painA regular at the library at his college campus, Utkarsh Bhardawaj, a student of Ambedkar University, is now ruing about leaving his place early, to be able to reach in time. “The day the curbs were announced, there was a huge queue outside the Kashmere Gate Metro Station, which is the nearest to my university. Some of the entry points to check in were also closed. If this continues, it will add 30 to 60 minutes to my travel time, each side. So earlier if I was usually studying till 8.30pm, now I can’t wait that longer and risk getting stuck due to the curfew. I’m going to leave home early, to avoid the rush and subsequent delay,” he says. Husband to the rescue!Yashvi Sharma, who works with a city-based NGO, travels from Vaishali to Saket everyday via metro. But now, she plans to ditch the train. “I’ve started ditching the metro because it’s a big trouble for me to reach to work in time if only 50% passengers will be allowed at a time... Some days I could take a cab but not always because it will be an added expense to my budget. And before I enter or exit the metro, I’ll be asking my husband to pick and drop me. In fact, in a positive sense, this curfew curb will give us some quality time together, and our own version of a long drive,” adds Sharma. Carpooling, all the wayRaghu Kumar, a businessman who rides the metro daily from west Delhi to Chandni Chowk (Old Delhi), has identified a neighbour who can drop him near his shop. He says, “It’s necessary to have curbs, to stop a third wave from coming. In fact, this will make metro travel much safer now! But since it’ll be operational at half the capacity, it’s going to be a task waiting in serpentine queues outside the metro gates in dilli ki sardi. And I have to be home early, but I know I’d be stuck if I take the metro. So I’ve been using the charm to convince one of my friends, who takes his car to the market. For now he has agreed to tag along me, but this can’t be a long term arrangement. We’re desperately waiting for everything to get back to normal.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-curbs-and-metro-woes-50-capacity-makes-delhiites-find-alternates-101640969336122.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Chain-link fencing replaces barbed wires in Delhi’s Sanjay Van||The barbed-wire fencing around Sanjay Van has been replaced with chain link fencing by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to prevent animals from getting injured and facilitate free movement of wildlife in the premises. In 2019, activists had filed a complaint with the forest department about animals, such as nilgai, getting stuck in the barbed wires, causing them to get grievously injured or die in the process. In an order issued by the forest department dated December 27, 2021, the deputy conservator of forest (headquarters) said the deputy conservator of forest (south) took cognisance of the issue after complaints as well as the petition filed in the Delhi high court regarding animals getting injured due to the barbed wires were received by them. “A team comprising of officials from DDA, south forest division, and the horticulture department was constituted for the purpose of ascertaining and identifying the areas surrounded by barbed wire interrupting free movement of wildlife within the premises of Sanjay Van. In this regard, a field inspection was carried out and in light of this inspection, all barbed wire fencing has been removed from the said premises,” said the order.The order says chain-link fencing has been used in the plantation areas. However, all the barricading, which was restricting access to the water body earlier, has now been removed. Verhaen Khanna, founder of the NGO New Delhi Nature Society (NDNS), who had filed the complaint in 2019, said while removal of the barbed wire fencing was a welcome move, all fencing inside the premises should be removed completely, as even the current system of fencing will restrict animals’ access to the forested area. He also said the DDA, which installed the barbed wire fencing in 2019, was let off without being penalized, despite provisions in the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which mentions ‘hunting’ as capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring and trapping any wild animal or attempting to do so. “The problem with the previous fencing was that animals were getting stuck or were getting injured while trying to get through it. This new fencing will not harm them but restrict their access to the area. There was no fencing at Sanjay Van before 2019 and the same needs to be restored,” he said.A senior forest official on condition of the anonymity said the decision was taken to ensure animals could move more freely. “The new fencing has only been installed around plantation areas, to protect them from being trampled over. All other fencing has been removed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chainlink-fencing-replaces-barbed-wires-in-delhi-s-sanjay-van-101640968969016.html
31-12-2021||Lucknow||UP chief secretary orders special statewide drive to catch abandoned cattle||Chief secretary DS Mishra on Friday directed district magistrates to launch a statewide drive from January 1 to 10 to catch abandoned cattle and put them safely in cow protection centres. Holding a meeting here, he said there were reports that abandoned cattle were harassing farmers by damaging their crops in some districts. He asked DMs to launch a special drive to catch such cattle besides encouraging more people to adopt cattle under the government scheme. Mishra also suggested that a competition must be started between village pradhans and kshetra panchayat heads with a view to freeing village panchayats from abandoned cattle. He said pradhans and block chiefs found doing good work would be rewarded. He asked DMs to personally monitor arrangements with regard to fodder, water etc in the cow protection centres. Aspirational districts Reviewing the progress of transformation of eight aspirational districts (Baharaich, Balrampur, Chandauli, Chitrakoot, Fatehapur, Shrawasti, Siddharthnagar and Sonbhadra) in the state, the CS said the DMs concerned should organise field visits to obtain public feedback in these districts. He said the schemes related to health and nutrition should be implemented effectively to improve overall developmental ranking of these aspirational districts. Covid-19 Taking note of an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in some districts, Mishra directed officials to step up the vaccination pace and activate vigilance committees. He said people whose second dose of vaccine was overdue must be contacted through the integrated command centre and asked to take the shot immediately. The CS also asked officials to create awareness among people through public address system and strictly enforce Covid-19 protocol in crowded places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-chief-secretary-orders-special-statewide-drive-to-catch-abandoned-cattle-101640968848504.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: North civic body seals four liquor outlets over ‘violation’||The latest action taken report released by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday shows that four more liquor shops have been sealed by the civic body citing violations related to unified building bye-laws and illegal constructions. The total number of liquor shops sealed by the north MCD now stands at nine while closure notices have been issued to 12 more units. Leader of the house in the north MCD Chhail Bihari Goswami said the shops, which have been sealed, are located in Jharoda, Phool Bagh in Ibrahimpur, Nathupura, DR Chamber commercial complex, Naraina Vihar Local Shopping Complex, main Bawana Road, Rohini Sector 17, Mangolpuri and Jwalapuri market in Paschim Vihar. “The units have been sealed for violating municipal norms with regard to building byelaws. The drive against liquor shops will continue in January,” said Goswami. The north MCD’s action taken report further states that in the case of the 12 shops which have been served sealing notices, either the deputy commissioner has granted time to the shop owners to close the establishment or action is pending in some cases due to non-availability of police force. From last month, the BJP led municipal bodies are carrying out verification drives to check for violations at the liquor shops that have been opened after the Delhi government rolled out its new excise policy on November 17 last year. All the three municipal corporations have also passed resolutions against the new liquor policy in December urging the Delhi government to take a look at the policy again and cancel licences for operating liquor shops in residential areas. Mayor of east Delhi municipality Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said so far, the civic body has sealed eight liquor shops while show cause notices have been issued to 70 units. “Our teams are checking the violations related to the Master Plan of Delhi 2021. Any property found violating the building byelaws is being sealed” he added. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has so far sealed four liquor outlets in Kakrola, Nangli, Sakrawati and Rajapuri areas, all of which fall under the Najafgarh zone, said an SDMC official. The three civic bodies have sealed total 21 units so far.With municipal elections in Delhi just months away, the BJP led municipal functionaries are trading barbs with the AAP government over the new excise policy. The Aam Admi Party, which is the leader of the opposition in the MCDs, have maintained it is a tactic used by the BJP to divert attention from issues such as corruption and misgovernance. The BJP’s Delhi unit has said it will hold protests across the city on January 3 if the new excise policy is not withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-north-civic-body-seals-four-liquor-outlets-over-violation-101640968728502.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal govt’s objections made GST Council defer hike on textiles: Sisodia||The GST (goods and services tax) Council meeting, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Friday deferred its decision to hike the tax on textiles from 5% to 12%, following objections from states and officials from the industry. The GST rate hike on textiles was to come into effect from 1 January.Soon after the Union government deferred the proposed hike on textiles, the Delhi government came out with a statement saying that the objections raised by the Kejriwal government against the proposed hike played a key role. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had demanded the rollback of the proposed hike, throwing their weight behind the lakhs of small traders who have been protesting against the increase in tax rates on textiles. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Central government should pay special attention to the textile industry, which is one of the important pillars of the Indian economy. “Four crore people of the country are employed in this industry. This way, the industry is running 4 crore families. There are huge job opportunities in this industry. Food, clothes and shelter are the basic needs of every human being. Therefore,... the Niti Aayog should make a policy for the textile industry by taking the common man into consideration,” said Sisodia. “The Kejriwal government will oppose every decision that is not in the welfare of the common man... the proposed hike in GST of textiles will directly impact the common man...Currently, a 5% tax is charged for a piece of cloth worth ₹1,000...the government had announced to raise it to 12% in the coming year. This would have disrupted the budget of a common man,” added Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-govt-s-objections-made-gst-council-defer-hike-on-textiles-sisodia-101640968308583.html

In the fifth meeting of the expenditure and finance committee chaired by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on December 22, the public works department (PWD) put up a proposal for installation of 600 LED screens at various locations in the city in phases at an estimated budget of ₹475.78 crore, shows government documents seen by HT. “The PWD submitted that the proposal is for installation of 600 LED screens for displaying graphics films, pollution data, social messages and information on government policies and other relevant information, such as awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic and Covid appropriate behavior,” said a senior government official aware of the matter. The LED screens will be installed at prominent locations on PWD roads more than 80ft wide, road intersections and T-points of roads with right of way above 80 feet or more, and entry and exit points of Metro stations having more footfall. “More priority will be given to roads which are between 100ft and 200ft and roads having heavy traffic volume and more footfall,” said the official. Four models – portrait screen with unipole structure, landscape screen with single display, tri-side display and cluster monitors in rectangular shape – will be used for fixing the LED screens. A command and control centre will be set up to run all the screens individually, in clusters or all at a time. “The data for display will be received at the central control room. After processing the same, the information will be displayed with the help of cloud services and global system for mobile communications network,” said the official.The cost component includes cost of LED screens, pole structure, comprehensive maintenance of LED screens and pole structures for seven years, and data consumption charges, electricity and rental charges of internet lease line. The pre-construction works have to be completed in three months and total nine months have been given to put in place the LED screens. The project has to be completed at the sanctioned cost and within the stipulated period and no cost escalation will be considered in future, said the official. According to the official, work is being carried out on priority basis to complete the project on time. “The tender for the project will be issued after obtaining the necessary routine approval from higher authorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-install-600-led-screens-in-prominent-locations-by-2022-101640968008397.html

Like the first blush of spring, the first fall of snow, the first words uttered by a baby, the first notes of an exquisite raga, or the first night for the newly wedded, may it be a portent of good things to come.So, first, put your best foot forward.

The group would distribute free milk to men to give them a message to stop drinking – ‘D for Dudh and not Daru’.Around 15 volunteers from the Samiti were standing at entry points of some areas in Ambernath and Badlapur, carrying a container of milk and urging men to get one glass of milk instead of drinking alcohol on the day.Shyam Jadhav, one of the Samiti members, said, “People celebrate on December 31 just to drink alcohol. It is a day of alcohol-drinking in the country instead of ushering in the New Year in a healthy way. Several families suffer because of the drinking habits of men. We have seen and read about accidents and untoward incidents on New Year’s Eve because of the inebriated state of the people. Therefore, to start the New Year with a good habit, we try to convince them to start the day by drinking milk instead of alcohol in the New Year. We are giving milk to every man who passes by the area.”The group distributed more than 100 glasses of milk on December 31 evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drink-doodh-not-daru-for-new-year-ngo-s-plea-to-stop-drinking-alcohol-101640966748486.html

31-12-2021||Mumbai||Demand for Covid self-test kits shoot up in Mumbai||Mumbai The rapidly increasing cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai have led to an increase in the demand for self-testing kits. Chemists in the city said the demand has started over the past week after a lull of several months. “Since the past four days, we have sold 50 to 60 kits every day,” said Jayantilal Dagha, owner of the Mahavir Medical in Chakala. “Before that, we were selling about three-to-four. Many corporate offices have mandated these tests for the employees who are coming to work. There has been a lot of demand from nearby offices,” he said. The self-testing kits available in the market are rapid antigen kits that give out the result in less than 30 minutes. Rapid antigen tests have higher chances of false-negative results. Thus, doctors warn that a negative result from a self-test should not be considered confirmatory, and a RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test should be undertaken. However, a positive result could be considered as a confirmation of Covid-19. The self-test kits, available over the counter in chemist shops, contain a sterile swab, disposable bag, a prefilled extraction tube and a test card. The suspected patients are required to insert the swab stick in both their nostrils, then dip the swab into the extraction tube and put a few drops of the liquid from the tube onto the test card. The test provides a negative or a positive result with the help of the control lines on the test card. As many as seven self-test kits have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research including Coviself by Mylab, CoviFind by Meril Diagnostics, PanBio by Abbott among others. The cost of these kits ranges between ₹250 to ₹350. “We had stocked CoviFind and Coviself for some time now, but there was hardly any demand for them. Suddenly, in the past 10 days, the demand has increased,” said Kamlesh Bhatia, owner of Bhatia Medical in Santacruz. “We are selling five to 10 kits every day,” he said. According to Hakim Kapasi, a member of the Andheri Chemist Association, most of the pharmacies did not stock the self-test kits because of lack of demand. “Now, everyone is calling for stocks,” he said. The companies have also seen a surge in demand. “Due to the increase in Covid-19 cases, we have witnessed a 200% jump in sales of our self-test kit, CoviSelf, in December compared to November,” said Hasmukh Rawal, founder and managing director of Mylab Discovery Solutions. “Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh are the top states where the demand for our kits is high,” he said. Infectious disease expert Dr Anita Mathew from Mulund’s Fortis Hospital said that self-test kits are a great tool if used judiciously and responsibly. “A positive self-test can help in immediately alerting the patients, but people who do self-tests should declare their positive results, follow isolation protocol and behave responsibly. The problem arises when many don’t follow these steps,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/demand-for-covid-self-test-kits-shoot-up-in-mumbai-101640963688043.html
31-12-2021||Ranchi||J’khand sees sharp spike, MP, MLA test positive||The Jharkhand government on Friday urged people to observe New Year celebrations at home, amid the exponential rise in fresh Covid-19 cases over the past one week, which includes an MP and an MLA among those infected. The government, though, has decided not to impose any restrictions in festivities and other economic activities for now. “We are not imposing any restrictions but we urge people not to got out and celebrate New Year at home as the number of Covid cases has started increasing. We have also directed deputy commissioners of districts to ensure testing at picnic spots and ensure people wear masks,” state’s health minister Banna Gupta told reporters after attending a review meeting on Covid preparations chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren. Though no confirmed case of the new variant Omicron has officially been reported in Jharkhand, the state has recorded 1,119 cases in four days from December 27. Within a week, fresh Covid cases have been recorded from across 18 of the 24 districts in the state. As per the latest medical bulletin, 482 cases was reported in the state on December 30 alone, of which 246 were reported in state capital Ranchi alone. In its latest communique on Wednesday, union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had also directed the state government to take all necessary action to contain the virus spread in Ranchi, officials said. On Friday, two elected representatives, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and Barkagaon MLA Amba Prasad, confirmed they had tested positive for Sars-Cov2 “After cough and cold, I got myself tested. I have tested positive for Covid-19 and have isolated myself in home isolation. Request all who came in contact to get themselves tested,” Seth, a BJP MP, said in a tweet. Prasad, a Congress MLA, said she was presently in home isolation with “mild symptoms”. On preparations to contain the possible third wave of coronavirus, health minister Gupta said direction has been given to increase testing. “We have set a target of conducting 1 lakh tests daily. Directions have also been given to check the status of hospital beds and status oxygen plants. We are also aiming to complete first dose of vaccine for all by January 15,” said Gupta. The health minister said a meeting of the state disaster management committee is likely to be held next week to review the situation and take decisions on restrictions as required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-sees-sharp-spike-mp-mla-test-positive-101640963330793.html
31-12-2021||Patna||26-yr-old Patna resident is Bihar’s first Omicron case||A 26-year-old resident of Patna’s Kidwaipuri locality has tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the first case in the state of the fast-spreading variant in the country, health officials said. He had visited the national capital last week to meet a relative, who came from abroad, said officials. The relative had tested positive for Covid-19 a day after the youth returned to Patna. He is presently under home isolation and the area has been declared a containment zone, said officials. Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday said that Omicron infection has started in the state and has asked people to be careful and follow Covid-19 norms. “At present, Bihar does not have an Omicron test facility. The report comes from Delhi,” Kumar said. “There will be a meeting on conducting of genome sequencing for Omicron test in Patna.”Covid-19 cases have shown a spike in Bihar over the last few days.The state reported 132 cases on Thursday, of which 60 were from Patna and 46 from Gaya, taking the total number of active cases to 333. Patna topped with 158 active cases, Gaya 92 and Munger 21. The state had reported 77 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday and 44 on Tuesday. “The Covid-19 cases in the state are increasing at 1.6 times a day over the last couple of days and we have to be careful,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar. “We have activated our Covid control room in each of the 38 districts. We have sufficient number of general and oxygen beds in our Covid care centres dedicated hospitals,” Singh said. The state has a total bed capacity of 19,383 for Covid-19 patients, of which 5,527 beds were with empanelled private hospitals. The remaining were in state-run facilities, said an official. As on Thursday, a total of 28 Covid beds were occupied in the state. As many as 305 Covid-19 patients were under home isolation. The state has also scaled up its oxygen capacity to 448 metric tonnes, said Kumar Ravi, officer on special duty in the health department. Of this, 140 metric tonnes were to be generated through 121 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants across the 38 districts of the state and 308 metric tonnes of oxygen through cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks at 10 state-managed medical college hospitals. 
31-12-2021||Patna||Looking ahead: Amid political flux, Bihar hopes for better education, health care||Bihar will hope for a turnaround in its fortunes after a difficult 2021 when it had to struggle with the double whammy of second wave of Covid-19 pandemic with huge migration and annual scourge of floods, which took a heavy toll on a state that has perennially remained at the bottom of development ladder on virtually all important indices despite its consistent 10% growth story.Though Bihar’s progress over the last 16 years cannot be dismissed — it has far better road connectivity, round-the-clock power supply and significantly higher per capita power consumption and infrastructure growth — but it is mostly in the context of where the state stood prior to 2005. Political perception With his party JD(U) becoming a junior partner for the first time in the ruling alliance in Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar’s status has certainly taken a hit. Despite still heading the NDA government, Kumar is showing apparent discomfort, especially in the face of an increasingly assertive RJD combine as the Opposition and a strangely cold ally BJP. Kumar has once again begun raising the “special status” demand for the state, to which BJP appears cold this time, while RJD has been playing it up. In fact, RJD leader Manoj Jha even moved a suspension of business notice in the Rajya Sabha to discuss the issue. Another thorny issue testing the alliance will be caste-based census. To further test the alliance will be the five Rajya Sabha vacancies — two each of BJP and JD-U and one of RJD — and 24 seats of the Legislative Council to be filled from the local bodies. According to social analyst DM Diwakar, contrasting signals may be part of politics, but they don’t augur well for governance. “Bihar would hope for greater clarity in the new year. A large number of positions in the boards and corporations lying vacant also don’t send right signals,” he says. “The alliance is strong and delivering. Partners may have their own issues, but there are no differences,” said BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal.Prohibition Liquor ban has been a major challenge for the government from the day it was imposed on April 5, 2016. The challenge has only grown over the years with continued smuggling of liquor and increased availability of narcotics substances despite prohibition being the prime agenda. The year 2021 saw opposition and the ruling alliance partners equally critical of it and demanding review. On December 28, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana waded in, calling the prohibition law an example of “lack of foresight” in drafting legislation, which leads to mounting court cases,which is a statistical fact. “Prohibition in theory and liquor smuggling in practice to encourage a parallel economy cannot go together. The government must make a realistic assessment in the wake of CJI’s observation,” said RJD MP Manoj Jha. Health care concerns While 2021 exposed Bihar’s health infrastructure, with even old medical college hospitals not having proper arrangement for oxygen supplies, 2022 begins with another scare and growing number of cases. How the government deals with the potential third wave will be keenly watched. Though Bihar has been doing well on vaccination front, rapid improvement in heath infrastructure that the government has claimed will be put to test. “The government is fully prepared for third wave, should it come. We are already taking precautionary measures,” said health minister Mangal Pandey. Educational scenarioBihar did well in the school education sector in the beginning in improving access and virtually ending gender disparity with the much talked about cycle scheme for girls. School infrastructure also improved. The quality of education, however, has remained poor with lack of teachers in various subjects and erratic schooling. Poor intake in seriously understaffed and struggling higher education made it a vicious cycle that the state is finding hard to move out from, resulting in huge migration of students. Now Bihar has a number of premier national institutions of higher learning, but the state needs to have its own colleges and universities in order. At present, none is in the top 100 of the NIRF ranking. The frequent row over corruption at the top in academic institutions has only made things worse. The year 2021 saw, for the first time, a vigilance raid on a serving vice chancellor and state education department staying away from Raj Bhawan function. Hopefully, higher education will turn a new leaf with both the Raj Bhawan and the government working together for a common cause. Also, huge vacancy of teachers and school heads will also be filled in 2022 and recruitment of assistant professors in colleges will pick up pace. “The appointment letters of elementary school teachers shall be issued on February 25, 2022 after proper verification of documents. Camps to be held in block and district headquarters,” said additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar. CM as ChancellorThe new year will see the setting up of three new universities in which the CM will be chancellor, contrary to the tradition of Governor as the ex official chancellor of state universities. The new institutions with CM as the chancellor are Bihar Health Sciences University, Bihar Sports University and Bihar Engineering University. All three may see appointment of vice chancellors soon. Earlier, engineering and medical institutions were part of the Aryabhatt Knowledge University, but in the changed set-up, with CM at the helm, one should hope for the better. Bihar has already been late in setting up engineering colleges. Though the government has started quite a few, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has extended the ban on new engineering colleges till 2024 due to low enrolments, falling demand and quality concerns. Bihar will need to improve the existing ones. “The three new institutions will be functional in 2022,” said a senior education department official. Vacancies in HCAfter a long wait, the Patna High Court got eight judges, while four were transferred to the state and one was transferred out. However, the court is still barely near the halfway mark of its sanctioned strength of 53 judges. Add to it the mounting load of cases due to prohibition and disruption due to pandemic and the scenario demands the HC to function in full strength. It was after a long wait that Patna HC got so many judges, as its strength at one point had dropped to one-third, and one would hope the same tempo of appointments to continue in the new year. “The year 2021 saw several judges being appointed and we hope more will come in 2022. Pending cases are a genuine concern,” said former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay.Unemployment Bihar has huge demographic dividend, but in the absence of quality education and employment opportunities, it threatens to become a demographic disaster. According to 2018 report of the sample registration system (SRS), the working age population (15-59 years) increased from 57.2% to 59.7% between 2013 and 2018, but due to lack of opportunities, the state continues to witness increased migration. Unemployment was a big poll issue in the 2020 Assembly elections and it will remain a big challenge for the state devoid of big industries and companies. The SRS report says Bihar is the youngest state with 57.2% population below 25 years of age. “Making the youth employable is the key to state’s fortunes. Else, it could turn out to be counter-productive,” said DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

MD drugs weighing 2.5 kg worth ₹2.53 crore was seized by the accused. Police Commissioner Bipin Kumar Singh informed the media on Friday that the police also raided the factory in Poynad, which was started by the accused to make MD. The factory was then sealed by the police.Among those arrested in the operation, Kalim Rafiq Khamkar (39), Zaki Afroz Pittu (33) and Subhash Raghupati Patil (40) have been identified. Senior police inspector Shatrughn Mali of unit 3 had received information about an accused coming to Nere village of Panvel to deliver drugs on Thursday evening. Crime branch unit 3, Anti-Narcotics Cell and Human Trafficking Cell jointly set a trap and arrested Khamkar. The police found MD powder weighing 1.1 kg in a plastic bag in his car and hence seized the car and the drugs and also arrested him. He was later interrogated by the police, who informed that he had started a factory in Poynad area of Alibag Taluka in Raigad with the help of two other accomplices to manufacture MD powder. On the basis of this information, the police raided the factory at Poynad and found MD powder weighing 500 grams each in the possession of Pittu and Patil. Also, 500 grams of MD powder was found in the dryer machine of the factory. Therefore, the police confiscated the MD powder as well as the machinery used for making the drug and sealed the factory.“The accused Patil, who was arrested in the case, had studied BSc Chemistry and was working in a chemical company. It was there that he learned about making drugs. Investigations have revealed that he started an MD powder factory at Poynad with the help of his accomplices, around two months ago after he quit his job at a chemical company a year and a half ago,” Mali said. “This is the first time that a factory manufacturing MD drugs has been seized that too just before the New Year eve,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cops-seize-md-worth-2-53-cr-ahead-of-new-year-festivities-101640962967946.html
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Thane traffic cops use Google Maps to deal with traffic crisis in quick time||In order to respond better and faster to traffic-related crisis in Thane city, the Thane Traffic Police have started using Google Maps to track the traffic situation in real time. The initiative, which was started in October 2021, has drastically reduced police’s response time, leading to fewer and shorter traffic jams.According to Thane Traffic Police officers, the initiative was started after lengthy brainstorming sessions following a spate of traffic jams observed in the monsoon. Crucial roads like Ghodbunder Road and the Mumbra Bypass witnessed heavy traffic congestion almost every day due to multiple reasons. These included frequent breaking down of vehicles, accidents, terrible road conditions and double parking on busy roads. Thane Guardian Minister, Eknath Shinde, had announced a slew of measures at the time including parking lots for heavy vehicles during the hours that they are prohibited.Officials said that one of the ideas discussed during this time was the possible use of Google Maps, which shows traffic conditions on the roads in real time. The website shows roads in various colours depending on how heavy the traffic is, with the red colour signifying the heaviest and slowest moving traffic on the road.“In October 2021, we set up a video wall of four 55-inch screens in our control room in Thane, where we started tracking traffic in the city 24/7. Every time the website showed a road highlighted in red, we would contact the nearest beat marshals via the wireless radio system and instruct them to visit the spot to find out the reason behind the traffic jam,” DCP (Traffic), Balasaheb Patil, Thane City, said.The police found that traffic jams were mainly caused by three reasons; arguments between motorists, accidents and vehicle breakdown. Over the next three months, the police observed that all these three issues could be addressed better if their personnel got to the spot faster.“In cases of arguments, most motorists quickly go their separate ways as soon as they see a policeman approaching. In cases of accidents, we were able to quickly provide medical help to the injured and take action against the offender. In instances of vehicles breaking down, the lighter ones could be pushed aside manually, which is the case most of the time, and cranes could be quickly called for where the vehicles are heavier. In all such cases, getting to the spot fast automatically helps resolve the situation speedily,” Patil said.He added that three months down the line, the initiative has shown tremendous results. “Earlier, we had to wait for someone to inform us either by calling the control room or telling one of our personnel on the streets. By using Google Maps, we no longer have to wait for someone to tell us about a traffic jam. Our response time, which earlier used to be an hour or more, has now dropped down to ten minutes in most cases. Consequently, traffic jams, too, have become shorter in duration, with many of them being nipped in the bud before they could become worse,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-traffic-cops-use-google-maps-to-deal-with-traffic-crisis-in-quick-time-101640962493517.html

31-12-2021||Mumbai||Sessions court rejects Kangana Ranaut’s plea for transfer of Akhtar’s complaint against her||Mumbai: A sessions court in Dindoshi on Friday dismissed an appeal by actor Kangana Ranaut against an order by an additional chief metropolitan magistrate refusing to entertain her plea for transfer of lyricist Javed Akhtar’s defamation proceedings against her to another court.Akhtar filed the defamation complaint against Ranaut last November for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against him in a television interview in 2020 in the context of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Kangana had called Akhtar, part of a certain gang of Bollywood. Ranaut had moved the transfer plea alleging that she did not have faith in the 10th court. She stated that the court was insisting on her personal appearance without any sufficient reason and order which could have justified her compelling appearance in the case, involving a bailable, non-cognizable and compoundable offence. “This court is threatening the accused on every date of issuing an arrest warrant without giving any sufficient cause,” said her application.Kangana’s application called the order ‘grossly erroneous’ and sought that the court set it aside and direct the transfer of the proceedings to any other court. The defamation proceedings are on in an Andheri magistrate court. The plea had been rejected with the court finding that the Andheri magistrate had acted judiciously and was not biased as alleged. It had called the actor’s allegations vague and held that she failed to make a concrete case to show that her apprehension is reasonable.Advocate Jay Bharadwaj who had argued for Akhtar had opposed the revision petition and had said the CMM court orders had been passed after considering all the facts and circumstances which did not warrant any interference. The actress has altogether wilfully absented herself on 11 hearings before the magistrate court out of which six hearings were regular hearings where exemption applications were moved and allowed and five hearings pertained to the period when Covid-19 SOPs exempted the personal appearance of the parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sessions-court-rejects-kangana-ranaut-s-plea-for-transfer-of-akhtar-s-complaint-against-her-101640961587916.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||A moderate but skewed recovery||The year 2020 was perhaps the worst ever for the Indian economy. Thanks to a 68-day nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020 onwards, imposed to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, economic activity went into a tailspin. India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) suffered an annual contraction of 24.4% and 7.4% in the quarters ending June and September 2020. Annual contraction in 2020-21 GDP was the largest ever: 7.3%. The large-scale disruption (and its favourable base effect in the subsequent year) made sure that unless there was yet another catastrophic event, growth rates would increase drastically in 2021, especially from the June quarter onwards. The second wave of Covid-19 — it peaked on May 9 in terms of seven-day average of daily new cases — was the kind of the catastrophe even statisticians discount in their calculations. While the second wave was far more severe in terms of infections and deaths, the economy was spared to some extent because there was no national lockdown. This made sure that the second wave’s disruption and sequential recovery, as tracked by some high-frequency indicators, was better than what was seen in the first wave. This is one of the biggest reasons why headline growth numbers are not expected to be good. However, a simple comparison of GDP growth rates — Reserve Bank of India’s projection of a 9.5% growth in 2021-22 over a 7.3% contraction in 2020-21—can give a misleading picture of recovery. An example makes this clear. If India’s GDP was 100 in 2019-20, it fell to 92.7 in 2020-21 and is expected to rise to 101.5 in 2021-22. The recovery is not as good as it sounds. Even if the Indian economy had grown at 4% per year — this was the growth rate in 2019-20 and the lowest since 2008-09 — in 2020-21 and 2021-22, GDP in the latter year would be 108.2. A higher GDP translates into higher per capita incomes for the population. That the Indian economy has strayed from its long-term growth trajectory because of the pandemic’s impact — the International Monetary Fund (IMF) slashing India’s potential growth rate from 6.25% to 6% is the most important institutional recognition of this fact — is just one part of the story. What is more important, and is still not properly understood due to the lack of adequate data at the moment, is the difference in how the pandemic affected the rich and the poor, both at the level of firms and households. Anecdotal accounts offer what can be described as circumstantial evidence. Corporate profits, for example, have been rising at a fast pace even as inflation is chipping away at real wages. This suggests that the poor have suffered far more than the rich because of the pandemic’s disruption. A direct reflection of this can be seen in different metrics of economic sentiment. RBI’s consumer confidence index is still far below pre-pandemic levels, while the Price-to-Earnings (PE) multiple for BSE continues to be at high levels. In fact, there is growing consensus (to be sure, there are differing views too) on the fact that even if there is no disruptive third wave — the exact threat assessment from the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is still being understood at the time of writing this piece — it is the pandemic’s distributive impact which might have most important consequences for the economy’s long-term prospects. It is the non-rich who spend a greater part of their incomes or what is called marginal propensity to consume by economists. That RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held in December 2021 has not made upward revisions to its growth forecasts for quarters ending December 2021 and March 2022 despite a higher-than-expected GDP growth in the September 2021 quarter supports this line of argument. What has muddied economic waters even more in 2021 is the multifaceted impact of inflation. First there is the “terms of trade” or relative price effect in India. Non-food inflation has been rising at a much faster rate than food inflation. This means that prices of receivables for farmers are increasingly lagging behind the prices of payables. This is bound to put a squeeze on their purchasing power, and hence the rural component of aggregate demand. It needs to be remembered that agriculture was the only sector which escaped a contraction in 2020-21, thereby providing a critical cushion to the economy. Agriculture growth might still be high in 2021-22 but with “terms of trade” worsening, the demand cushion might not be the same. In 2021, there was also lingering uncertainty in international commodity markets because of pandemic-related concerns. Demand outlook for a whole lot of commodities; crude petroleum being the most important, can change drastically depending on the state of the pandemic in the world. And nobody knows at the moment with a reasonable degree of confidence what the latter is going to be. Brent crude prices have fluctuated widely in 2021 from a low of US$ 50.37 on January 4 to a high of US$85.76 on October 20 before falling to US$ 71.52 on December 20. Uncertainty about petroleum prices also means that the tension between fiscal prudence and inflation/demand will not end in 2021. The central government has made large windfall gains in petroleum taxes both in 2020 and 2021, and this has been accompanied with a sharp spike in fuel inflation. The year 2021 also saw a supply-side aspect to the inflationary uncertainty, largely on account of disruption in global value chains. Not only did it lead to rise in prices; most white goods and automobiles have become significantly more expensive, there is also a supply constraint in the literal sense of the term. This has emerged as an important headwind even for demand from the rich. Unless the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus leads to a sharp spike in the caseload trajectory, 2022 will not have any surprises on the economic front. To be sure, there is a possibility of downward revision in the GDP numbers for 2020-21 as informal sector numbers are incorporated. What needs to be observed though is whether or not the gap in momentum of recovery between the have and have-nots reduces. If that does not happen soon, there is a real possibility that the formal sector could lose growth momentum as well, especially when pent-up demand component of the rich has dissipated.

They are already going to schools and if we make arrangements for them to get vaccinated there, they would be spared of going anywhere else,” Abhijit Bangar, NMMC commissioner, said.Even those who have dropped out of school or have never gone to school can also visit the nearest school for the vaccination, Bangar added.“We are also planning to have a jumbo facility for the purpose of vaccination for this age group,” Bangar said.During the third wave, treating patients below 18 years was said to be a major challenge as none from that age group was vaccinated. “We have good coverage of vaccination. More than 85% are completely vaccinated. Moreover, we are having door-to-door as well as mobile vaccinations at markets and railway stations in order to vaccinate the maximum population. We have enough doses to vaccinate everyone including the 15-18 years age group. Besides, we have 110 centres ready wherein vaccination drives are already happening,” Bangar said.An estimated 72,000 children are eligible for vaccination between 15 and 18 years.Till now, 12,26,410 have taken their first dose while 9,63,666 have taken their second. In the age group of 18 to 45 years, 8,20,190 have got their first dose while 6,14,306 have got their second. A total of 9,225 have got vaccinated via mobile vaccination programme that includes 2,108 who got the first dose and 7,117 got their second.Through ‘har ghar dastak’ programme, 51,241 got vaccinated including 17,584 who received the first dose and 33,657 received second. A total of 15,320 have got vaccinated through the railway station vaccination programme including 3,517 who received the first dose and 1,17,567 who received the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-gearing-up-to-vaccinate-15-18-yrs-age-group-against-covid-101640958587616.html

After technical analysis of those details, we finally caught Singh on Thursday morning. With his arrest, four crimes registered in our jurisdiction have been detected so far.”Another senior officer said, “Apart from Navi Mumbai, Singh was operating at a few places in Mumbai such as Chembur, Mankhurd and Govandi. So, his arrest will help us solve more crimes in the next few days.”The police booked the accused under section 379 (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code. He was produced before the judicial court and has been remanded to police custody for two days. 
31-12-2021||Mumbai||From 5 to 500 Covid vaccination centres, Thane district has come a long way||Started with five vaccination centres, Thane district caters to more than 500 centres daily within a year.A year ago, when the vaccination drive began, hardly 2,300 people were vaccinated on the first day. Now, more than 50,000 are being vaccinated daily. From facing hesitancy, reluctance and strong opposition in rural parts of the district to get vaccinated to reaching a phase where there was shortage of doses, from seeing serpentine queues outside vaccination centres to reaching a phase where officials had to introduce mobile vaccination centres and other special facilities, Thane district has seen a tumultuous year with regards to vaccination.Overall, the district has managed to complete administering around 1.09 crore doses. This includes 62.41 lakh first dose and 45.56 lakh second dose of vaccination. From among these, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) was among the first to complete 100% first dose vaccination and has also managed to vaccinate more than 85% of its target population with the second dose of the vaccine.Meanwhile, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has managed to vaccinate only 75% with the first jab and 50% of its target population is fully vaccinated. The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) isn’t far behind with 73% completing the first dose and 61%, the second dose from among the target population. “In the beginning, rural areas showed much reluctance with rumours floating around on social media and lack of awareness. Hardly any came forward to get vaccinated. Moreover, when a few got fever post vaccination, the fear among the villagers increased. We indulged in various awareness programmes by roping in local NGOs and Asha workers to educate about vaccination,” said Manish Renge, health officer, Thane Zilla Parishad.Now, there are school students who are involved in educating their families. The Zilla Parishad is using children to make an emotional appeal to get vaccinated. Similarly, in TMC, certain densely-populated areas like Lokmanya Savarkar Nagar, Kalwa and Mumbra areas saw a very few getting jabbed.“We set up mass vaccination drives in these areas and conducted door-to-door surveys to understand the number of people who have not been vaccinated. We are also addressing those who have taken the first dose to also take the second dose of vaccination. Although they are due, many are ignorant about getting a second jab,” said Dr Prasad Patil, immunization officer, TMC.Meanwhile, NMMC is preparing to complete 100% vaccination within a month. “In the last one year, we saw a few months of extreme hesitancy and some months with lack of doses. Both were not permanent phases and now again we are noticing a rise in the number of people coming forward to get vaccinated. Every time the cases increase, more and more people step forward and get vaccinated. We are presently providing vaccination in markets and railway stations as well,” said Abhijit Bangar, NMMC commissioner.Ganesh Doiphode, in-charge of KDMC vaccination, said, “Our complete effort is to fully vaccinate the citizens. Compared to earlier days, now we have around 54 centres after having started with only four. Also, the door-to-door survey initiated by us is helping in finding people who have not taken a single dose. There are those who refuse to get jabbed, which our team is tackling through continuous follow-ups.”In May and June, with the lack of vaccine doses, there were serpentine queues to get vaccinated. Now, with ample doses in hand, there are hardly a few who visit the vaccination centres.“This is the reason we are going to the remote hamlets and providing vaccination. Our team visited a remote village in Shahapur district, and many civic bodies have also conducted camps within their jurisdiction to reach out to the locals,” said a medical officer from Thane district.“The district overall has managed to complete 85% vaccination. We still have to cater to the tribal pockets in the district. There are many initiatives taken like providing vaccination during holidays and in the evenings as well to cater to the rural areas. Compared to the initial phase of vaccination around seven months ago, we have sufficient vaccine doses with us and accessibility for the locals to vaccination centres has increased. Earlier, when only an online booking facility was available, it was not easy for the rural population to follow the processes. Hence, many from urban areas came to the rural pockets to get vaccinated. There was a fight among locals and outsiders. However, with more than 500 vaccination centres and mobile units, we have managed to come a long way. Now, the focus is on the remote, rural population within the district,” said Rajesh Narvekar, Collector, Thane district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/from-5-to-500-covid-vaccination-centres-thane-district-has-come-a-long-way-101640958528372.html
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Commuters urge Central Railway to run more trains on Nerul, Belapur, Kharkopar line||The residents of Ulwe and its peripheries are inconvenienced as the Central Railway (CR) has not been running sufficient trains on the Nerul-Belapur-Kharkopar line.The trains on this line ferry the commuters to Nerul and Belapur stations alternately and thereby give access to trains on the harbour line (Panvel-CSMT). However, the CR is running very few trains on that line.Presently, the first train leaves Kharkopar for Nerul at 6.30am and then there is no train for the next one hour and fifteen minutes. The second train leaves Kharkopar for Belapur at 7.45am while the third train leaves Kharkopar again for Nerul at 8.25am after a 40-minute gap.Shruti Mane, a 31-year-old resident of Ulwe, said, “I have to reach my office at BKC every day at 8.30am and I travel up to Kurla station by train. The first train is too early for me, but I also cannot reach the office on time by boarding the second train. So, I take the first train and thus end up wasting around half-an-hour daily. I know many others from my neighbourhood who are facing the same issue.”Vikash Puri, 45, another Ulwe resident, said, “In the evenings, one train leaves Belapur for Kharkopar at 7.57pm. After that, the next train leaves for Kharkopar from Nerul at 8.55pm. Therefore, for most of the time, we have to travel in autos by paying exorbitant fares. Taking our inconveniences into consideration, the CR should run a few more trains here.”Bhakti Dave, president of Panvel Pravashi Sangha, said, “As per the norms, trains on any line should be available for every four minutes. We understand that CR too has limitations. But a gap of one hour and fifteen minutes is too long. They should think of increasing the number of trains as early as possible.”Shivaji Sutar, chief PRO of CR however, said that they don’t have any plan to increase the number of trains on that line for now.“On December 1, we revised the time table and increased the number of trains on that line during peak hours. Now in the peak hours, the trains are available every half-an-hour. But we don’t have any plan to provide more trains in the mornings, evenings or during the day,” he said.Sutar also refused to explain the reason behind not providing more trains during those hours.The Nerul-Belapur-Kharkopar line is the first phase of the Nerul-Belapur-Uran Corridor.

They collected ₹21.03Cr fine from the violators in the entire year, a senior officer said.According to the police, a total of 1,72,605 motorists were penalised for over-speeding alone while 83,315 others were penalised for violating the other norms such as lane-cutting, not wearing seat-belts, talking on mobile phones while driving among others.Subhash Pujari, assistant inspector from the State Highway Traffic said, “Our officials were deployed on both Mumbai-bound and Pune-bound carriageways of the Expressway from time to time and they checked if any motorist had flouted the norms. Whenever they spotted someone over-speeding, cutting the lanes, or talking on phones, they stopped him or her and penalised them on the spot.”Lane-cutting has been identified as one of the main causes of accidents on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway.“The Expressway has three lanes on each side of the divider. The first lane (the one adjacent to the divider) is for overtaking. The second lane is for light vehicles and the third lane is for buses and other heavy vehicles. However, most of the motorists do not follow the rules. They randomly enter the unauthorised lanes and end up hitting vehicles moving ahead of them,” Pujari said.“Our main objective behind conducting such drives was to bring discipline to the movement of the vehicles on the road. Most of the accidents on this road occur because of human errors and overtaking is one of them,” he added.“The Expressway has dividers, guide boards for motorists and there is no mistake in its construction. Analysing some of the recent accidents, we have understood that speeding and overtaking are the reasons behind a majority of the accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to take such requisite measures to curb the menace,” another police officer said.
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane wins round one against Sena, says will work to oust MVA||Mumbai After winning a prestigious battle against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the elections to the Sindhudurg district cooperative bank, union minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narayan Rane said that they would now work on ousting the MVA from power in the state. “Now, we are not in power in the state. This has eluded us by a whisker. Maharashtra needs a good chief minister and a good government. Today, there is no chief minister. Hence, a developed state is heading towards anarchy,” charged Rane, while launching a broadside at his bete noire and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Rane’s younger son Nitesh, who is a BJP MLA from Kankavali, had been booked in an attempt to murder case after the assault on Santosh Parab, who was among those leading the charge of the MVA in the district bank polls. A local court had rejected his anticipatory bail plea on Thursday and Nitesh is still missing. Nitesh had faced flak from the Shiv Sena after he had mimicked the sound of a cat when environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is Thackeray’s son, was entering the state legislature building during the recently concluded winter session. Speaking to reporters on Friday at Kankavali in Sindhudurg district after the results were announced, Rane, who is the union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises, attacked the state government and said that the law enforcement machinery and the police were used in an attempt to secure a victory. Polling for the district central co-operative bank was held on Thursday, and on Friday, the BJP won 11 of the 19 seats. Shiv Sena leader Satish Sawant, who was the outgoing chairman of the bank, polled the same number of votes as his BJP rival Vitthal Desai. Desai was declared the victor after a draw of lots. The polls had an electoral college of 900, including voters representing co-operative bodies, urban credit groups, fishermen credit groups, and salaried employee credit groups, and also individuals. Meanwhile, the Rane camp was also jolted after BJP district president Rajan Teli lost to Sushant Naik, the younger brother of Shiv Sena MLA from Kudal, Vaibhav Naik. In 2014, Vaibhav Naik had emerged as a giant killer by defeating Rane senior, who was then in the Congress and a minister in the Prithviraj Chavan cabinet. Shiv Sena leader and former minister Deepak Kesarkar acknowledged their loss. “A victory is a victory, and a defeat is a defeat,” said Kesarkar, who is an MLA from Sawantwadi, adding that the BJP had marshalled its resources to influence voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/narayan-rane-wins-round-one-against-sena-says-will-work-to-oust-mva-101640957567459.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Channi calls BJP real enemy of Punjab||RAMPURA (BATHINDA): Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday called the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) the “real enemy of Punjab” indicating political discomfort among the Congress leadership after several politicians are joining the saffron party ahead of the Punjab assembly polls.At an election rally in Rampura Phul segment, Channi gave a call to Congress workers to get united to take on the BJP strongly. It was probably the first occasion in the last few weeks when the CM spoke against the BJP.After the repeal of the contentious farm laws, the Punjab Congress leadership has been focusing attacks on the principal opposition the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the traditional rival Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) as the BJP was not seen as a formidable front in the state.“Punjabis should remember the BJP-led Union government’s role in introducing the black farm laws,” the CM said.Channi also targeted former CM Captain Amarinder Singh for partnering with the BJP. “They (BJP and Capt) worked against the interests of Punjabis and it must not be forgotten,” said the CM.Channi projects himself as CM face A day after head of the Congress’s campaign committee Sunil Jakhar said that the party would contest the next elections without any CM face, Channi appealed for support to hold the top post for the next five years.Channi urged people to vote for the Congress in the forthcoming elections to mark their approval of his three-month stint as the CM.“AAP leaders from Delhi are appealing for a chance to rule in Punjab. You tested Akalis and Captain as well. Now, people should audit the performance of my government’s tenure and cast vote for inclusive development and welfare,” said the CM.Channi backed incumbent Congress legislator from Rampura Phul Gurpreet Singh Kangar, who was dropped as a cabinet minister in September after Captain’s exit, as the Congress nominee from the segment.“Kangar was always a key supporter of Amarinder whereas I was among the opponents of the ex-CM. A capable leader like Kangar deserves to represent the constituency again. He should be elected again to make position stronger for governance term for five full years,” the CM appealed at the event.CM faces protestAuthorities faced an embarrassing situation after a section of gathering, including women, protested near the place where Channi addressed the gathering. Police had a tough time controlling the protesters demanding job regularisation.After arriving at the venue, Channi immediately ordered the police to remove barricades and allow people to sit in the space secured for security near the stage. Soon a large number of people reached and started raising slogans as the CM began his address.Infuriated, the CM ordered the police to remove the protesters from the rally area.“I will not tolerate obstructionists. My government cannot be held to ransom and such organisations cannot gain my sympathy. We have assured governance in a fair and transparent manner and there is no space for such an attitude,” he said.The CM announced ₹10 crore grant for the overall development of Rampura Phul constituency. He also announced upgrade of the civil hospital and opening a trauma centre. He laid the foundation stone for two ITIs and a flyover between the railway station and Geeta Bhawan road. Channi also dedicated a new building of Veterinary Science College constructed at a cost of ₹105 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-calls-bjp-real-enemy-of-punjab-101640953486984.html
31-12-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Of dusk, baked potatoes and rest||I had been starting to wonder if we would have a winter but then a deluge in early December changed everything. Everything, including the prospects of a good harvest for winter crops. The week after the deluge saw chilled winter weather with mist-shrouded mornings, smoky days with occasional weak sunshine, and grey foggy evenings. It’s still like that to an extent. The temperature is too hot for my liking but this is as close to a proper winter as we can get in Pune nowayears. Especially the smoky dusk. I have just finished cooking dinner, sort of. There was a bunch of Dill leaves (Shepu) which was kind of getting ready to go from green to yellow sitting in the refrigerator. Usually we make Aloo-Shepu but it seemed too much to have potato again. So, I pan-fried some boneless chicken breasts with red chilly seeds, Dill leaves, salt and fresh Himalayan garlic from Uttarakhand. I plan to serve slices of the chicken with butter rice. Butter rice is great by itself with lemon and green chilly. All habits from childhood. There is something about dusk that makes me peaceful. It’s the relative stillness I guess. Even on regular days, with the shrill cacophony of city traffic, the intensity of an urban life, and the never-ending deadlines of the digital age, I like taking a walk every evening on the terrace to block out everything and just focus on the natural phenomenon of the sunset, watching wisps of smoke rise from households in nearby slums as folks start preparing their dinner. Watching dusk is also a childhood habit like many things - tranquil and chaotic - are with me. From my annual visits to Varanasi, Delhi or Shimla, I remember the smell of coal on the mud oonoon (Bengali for choolah, the traditional clay-stove) as my grandmother baked rotis and finished making the Daal and vegetables for dinner. My Kaka (uncle) used to deep-fry tiny fish in a massive kadhai on another oonoon. She used to cook in the open courtyard just before dusk set. I used to sit and watch and wait with my younger siblings. Most of them were too young then to have a memory of those evenings. We used to wait because she used to bake little baby potatoes in the ashes underneath the main fire. And once they were done, she would take them out, dust them thoroughly, sprinkle with salt, gesture us to stay quiet (since her children-my father and uncles and aunts-also loved the little potatoes), and then hand over five each to us. It was a thrill! I still recall, clearly, the smell of the coal-baked potatoes and the peace of the setting sun, a gentle breeze always at hand to temper even the most sizzling of Indian summer days or spice up the coldest of winter days. Immediately thereafter, we would wash our hands, feet, and face at the chou-baachchaa (a rustic water trough) and then follow her into the living room for the evening prayers, which is always at Sondhe (Sandhya or dusk). The family would sing bhajans accompanied by harmonium and cymbals and tiny prayer bells and then off to dinner. Dinner was always a lively affair around the choolah. We would sit on aasans (cloth mats) placed on the red brick floor. The warmth from the oonoon was supplemented by a small wood-fire and the solitary halogen lamp on the verandah. There would be recounting of the day’s work and activities, with adults reporting to my grandma and kids chattering. Bad reports were always reprimanded, good results were always rewarded with gudh (jaggery) or coconut naadoo (a small laddoo). After dinner, lights off and bed time stories and eventual sleep, with my grandma always placing her cool palm on my forehead (she always said my head was hotter than most people!), soothing the day’s fatigue off the brow and recounting a story about her childhood and her household and bringing up the children and the earlier, impoverished days. Stories and experiences I never forget because it is the story of many Indian families. Some have taken a generation to move towards relative middle-class stability. Some take two. Some stay in poverty. But we are always moving forward, inch by inch, in adversity and in good times, always under the same sun. Standing here today, listening to the chatter from the tents and tarpaulin covered hutments below, I am doing what I have always done: watching the sky change as the sun sets. The birds do not chirp in the immediate aftermath of dusk because dusk is a reminder to wind down and to rest and restore the natural balance of our systems. On the other hand, dusk is the dawn for nocturnal beings. Bats are heading out from their dwellings. Soon, the other night creatures will begin their day. The city sounds are now intruding upon my reverie. Lights are on. Traffic is snaking it’s way along roads, bylanes and the distant highway - I can make out from the headlights and horns. It’s going to be a cool night. And maybe we will have another beautiful misty morning tomorrow. If I take a broader perspective, winter dusk is quite like the year-end. As the year winds down, there is a nostalgia of the days gone by and a rising anticipation of the year to dawn. There is a stillness in time as I consider (within a few minutes) the year gone by. And that reflection evokes some emotion (satisfaction, remorse, anxiety, elation, joy) and after giving it due thought, I make peace with the year, remind myself that tomorrow is a new day, a new year and that I have the chance to do things differently or stay steady, generally to live another day, plan another year. It’s odd that the last day of the year should have such significance, when in all reality it’s just another dusk giving way to just another night which in turn will merge into just another morning. There is something about the year-end that makes me peaceful. It’s the relative stillness I guess.

31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana court blast: Woman cop who was bomber's aide suspended from duties||The senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Punjab's Khanna city on Friday suspended a woman cop, who was in a relationship with alleged bomber of Ludhiana court blast case Gagandeep Singh.The woman cop was posted as a constable in the office of superintendent of police (SP) in Khanna. She is currently being questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) as well as the Punjab Police in connection with the blast.Investigation has so far found that Singh was a former policeman, who was dismissed from duty in 2019 after being held in a drug peddling case and later sent to jail for two years. At the time of his dismissal, he was posted as a head constable at a police station in Khanna. He was released from prison in September this year.Meanwhile, a money trail has been discovered in Singh's bank account in which it was being credited with ₹3 lakh in the second week of December, in instalments. The bank employee with whom Singh, who was at the time of the blast a cloth trader, in touch, has also been questioned. The woman cop, however, has maintained that she didn't hand him the money.Notably, the blast took place on December 23 at the Ludhiana district court complex, situated close to the police commissionerate office. In the incident, Singh died while five others were injured. The bomb went off near the washroom of the building's second floor, which comprises eight courtrooms.Punjab police chief Siddharth Chattopadhyay said that Singh, who have “very good technical skills”, had assembled the bomb inside the washroom. He added that the alleged bomber met some people, including Khalistani elements and drug smugglers, during his time at the prison.“We have strong leads that Pakistan-based, pro-Khalistani narco-terrorists are behind the blast,” Chattopadhyay said last Saturday.The NIA on Thursday lodged a first information report (FIR) against Jaswinder Singh Multani, a member of the banned Khalistani outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) and the prime suspect in the blast case, along with some others, as part of the investigation into a larger conspiracy for attacks in Indian cities, Hindustan Times reported earlier in the day.He was detained by German authorities in Erfurt in the central part of the European country earlier this week on India's request. Multani, 45, has been charged with criminal conspiracy, carrying out war against India, and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the FIR.It is suspected that the explosion was carried out at Multani's behest, who allegedly made arrangements for the logistics remotely using his contacts in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-court-blast-woman-cop-who-was-bomber-s-aide-suspended-from-duties-101640940514209.html
31-12-2021||Mumbai||‘Covid cases likely to cross single-day peak during 2nd wave in Mumbai’||New Covid-19 cases in Mumbai are likely to cross the single-day peak of 11,206 during the second wave of the pandemic this summer, the city’s civic body has said based on growing infections since December 22. The city’s Covid-19 Task Force has alerted the state and civic health authorities to expect a “very large” third wave driven by the Omicron variant of the disease.“The Omicron variant is on its way to becoming the predominant strain in Mumbai, and perhaps the rest of the state,” said Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force. “Given the nature of this variant, we are heading for a very large third wave.” He added the exponential doubling rate of cases is an indicator of the large third wave.On Thursday, Maharashtra recorded 5,368 Covid-19 cases, a 38% jump from Wednesday’s 3,900. Mumbai reported 3,555 cases on Thursday, a 45% jump from the previous day. The city also accounted for 66% of the state’s cases.The state’s Omicron case count has touched 450, of which 198 cases were detected on Thursday. While a majority of the Omicron patients have a history of international travel or are contacts of travellers, some have no travel history. Joshi said this suggests that the variant is in the phase of community transmission.Also Read | Maharashtra announces fresh curbs after massive spike in new Covid cases, 450 Omicron infectionsMunicipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they were anticipating a larger third wave. “However, we also anticipate that the rate of hospitalisation will be low.” He added they were on alert.The state health department has stuck to the third wave projections drawn in July, which estimated that Maharashtra was likely to see 1.25 million active cases during the peak of the third wave. This is 1.5 times more than the active caseload of nearly 700,000 during the second wave.“Back then, we anticipated 65% of the patients will require home isolation, while 35% will need hospitalisation. However, the Omicron variant suggests that the percentage of hospitalisation could be much lower,” said Satish Pawar, additional director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra. “All districts have been asked to prepare for an active caseload of 1.5 times more than the second wave. We believe that these estimates will apply for the current scenario as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-cases-likely-to-cross-single-day-peak-during-2nd-wave-in-mumbai-101640946646415.html

31-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Cantt board to fine people feeding monkeys||The Delhi cantonment board (DCB) issued an order on Thursday stating that people feeding monkeys near human habitation will be fined. The warning added that the incidents of man-monkey conflict are on the increase in various parts of Delhi. “The public is hereby warned not to feed monkeys in human habitation particularly in residential colonies and in the vicinity of religious places. Anyone found feeding the monkeys in human habitation will be challaned or fined in accordance with existing municipal laws,” the order issued by the officer-in-charge (OIC) sanitation Delhi Cantonment Board Gyanendra Singh stated. Till now, no such restriction on feeding the simians has been imposed by any of the other four local bodies of the city. On Thursday, Singh confirmed to HT that the order has been issued and fines up to ₹5000 can be issued. “We are empowered to issue fines up to ₹5000 as per the Cantonment regulations 2006,” he added. The Cantonment comprises an area of approximately 10,521 acres. It also covers residential areas and markets such as Sadar Bazar, Shastri Bazar, Nangal Raya, Mehram Nagar, and Naraina village besides ridge areas.Officials from the veterinary departments of the municipal corporations stated that they have not issued any such orders. A senior veterinary department official from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said that the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act does not have any provision for fining people for feeding monkeys or dogs. “A meeting was held last month by the chief wildlife warden with all the stakeholder departments where the issue of monkeys was discussed. It was stated that fines may be issued but we don’t have any bylaws to support such fines,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Having relocated more than 21,000 monkeys to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary over the last decade, Delhi still does not have any official count of monkeys in open areas or sanctuaries. The SDMC official said that the project has only led to an increase in the man-monkey conflict in South Delhi areas as monkeys from all over Delhi are relocated to Asola Bhatti, which has no natural food source or boundary to prevent the entry of monkeys into residential areas.Ved Pal, councillor from Aya Nagar ward, which is located right next to the relocation area,, said that the whole region has been facing an increasing number of monkey attacks over the last 10 years. “There is no natural food source in the sanctuary so monkeys enter kitchens. There have been complaints from several schools about attacks during lunchtime. The water tankers on several houses have been damaged. On roads along Asola you can see groups of hundreds of monkeys,” he added. The impacted region with increased conflict includes Aya Nagar, Tughlaqabad extension, Jaunapur, Fatehpur Beri, Asola, Dera Mandi and Bhati. Poonam Bhati, who represents Tughlaqabad extension ward, echoed similar concerns about the rising monkey attacks in the area.The relocation of captured monkeys to the Bhati mines area started in 2007 after a Delhi high court order. In 2007, deputy mayor SS Bajwa died of head injuries after falling from the terrace of his house, following an attack by monkeys. The official relocation data for 2021 presented by municipal commissioners in November shows that the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has managed to catch and relocate 45 monkeys to Asola Bhatti while the North MCD relocated 58 monkeys and the SDMC shifted 336 monkeys. An SDMC veterinary department official said that around 50-60% simians were caught from areas around the Radha Soami Satsang Beas ashram when a Covid treatment centre was being operated at the site. The civic body offers a compensation of ₹2400 per monkey to monkey catchers for this job. “Despite providing the highest rates in the country, monkey catchers have been reluctant to work in Delhi due to fear of legal cases being filed against them. The pandemic has further worsened the situation. There are only three monkey catchers currently working with us,” the official said.Over the last few years, Delhi has witnessed a growing monkey menace, while the forest department under the Delhi government and the municipal corporation’s veterinary department continue fighting regarding jurisdiction over the matter. “Several communications from the ministry of environment forest and climate change (animal welfare division) clearly states that monkeys are not stray animals and catching, trapping or controlling the population of monkeys can only be done by the forest department. If we catch monkeys, we will be breaking the law,” a senior veterinary department official said. A senior official from the forest department said the Delhi high court order of 2019 makes it clear the responsibility to capture monkeys lies with the corporations, not the forest department. “We have been asked to take care of the animals being shifted to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary and each month, over ₹8 lakh is spent on their food. The high court made it clear corporations will be the ones transporting the monkeys there,” he said. During May-June earlier this year, several cut-outs of langoors were placed in the Covid centre to scare away the rhesus monkeys. This temporary solution also exposed the administrative failure in tackling Delhi’s simian menace. Ved Pal argued that the money spent on feeding monkeys could have been used to create a zone with natural fruit trees. “The area would be able to naturally sustain the monkey population and the annual expenditure on feeding may be saved,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cantt-board-to-fine-people-feeding-monkeys-101640899121693.html

31-12-2021||Chandigarh||SIT report giving clean chit to security forces in Hyderpora encounter wrong: Farooq||National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Thursday said that the SIT report giving clean chit to security forces was wrong and civilians were killed by police during Hyderpora encounter. The police had on Wednesday warned political leaders against casting doubts upon the evidence obtained by the SIT in the Hyderpora encounter case. “The police’s report is wrong. The police had tried to save themselves. They (civilians) were killed by the police,” Farooq told reporters on the sidelines of a function. A judicial probe should be announced to bring out the truth of the Hyderpora encounter, he added.“The police should not work like this wherein they cause pain to the hearts of people,” the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said. Soon after SIT head DIG Sujit Kumar on Tuesday indicated no wrongdoing on part of the security forces in the Hyderpora encounter, almost all top leaders of mainstream political parties had questioned the probe by SIT. Even the families of civilians termed the investigation fabricated. Three civilians were killed in the encounter at Srinagar’s Hyderpora.Asked about the delimitation commission’s draft report, Abdullah said the NC has framed a response to the report and will submit it soon.“We have framed a response to the delimitation panel’s report, which will be submitted to the commission. It will be made public soon,” the MP from Srinagar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sit-report-giving-clean-chit-to-security-forces-in-hyderpora-encounter-wrong-farooq-101640897681479.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi demands GST hike rollback on textiles||The Delhi government has demanded that the proposed hike in the goods and service tax slab on textile and footwear items be rolled back, as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said the state will raise the matter in the GST Council meeting scheduled on Friday. He ,added that under chief minister Arvind Kejriwal the Delhi government has been in favour of keeping tax rates low. Informing the public about Delhi Government’s stance on the tax hike, Shri Manish Sisodia tweeted, “Textile traders are opposing the increase in GST rates from 5% to 12%. Their demand is justified. The Aam Aadmi Party and the Delhi government under the leadership of Shri Arvind Kejriwal have always been in favour of keeping the tax rates on the low. In the meeting of the GST council to be held tomorrow, I will raise the demand for keeping the tax on clothes low.” “Despite the backbreaking inflation in the country, the central government has proposed a humongous tax hike on textiles under the new GST regime. The Centre has proposed to shoot up GST rates to 12% from the current rates of 5% in a complete disregard of the common man’s woes. The Delhi Government has always stood for the rights of the poor and underprivileged and has decided to protest against the hike and demand the rollback of the proposal in the GST council meeting,” Sisodia stated on Thursday. Chamber of Trader and Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal on said hundreds of cloth shops in Delhi remained closed on Thursday in protest against the GST increase on textile. “All business organizations strongly opposed the increase in the rate of GST on clothes. Shops in big markets like Chandni Chowk, Gandhi Nagar, Karol Bagh and other markets remained closed. The traders have warned the central government that if this hike is not withdrawn in Friday’s GST council meeting, the traders of Delhi will go on an indefinite strike,” said Goyal. Ramesh Ahuja, a Karol Bagh cloth trader, due to this the clothes will become very expensive and the general public will also have to bear the burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-demands-gst-hike-rollback-on-textiles-101640897621568.html

31-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A butter coffee stall in old Delhi||Some cities never sleep. Like New York. Like Old Delhi. Any person living in, say, the Walled City’s Chitli Qabar Chowk will tell you that the sounds of their streets never disappear completely. Not at 11 pm, not at 1 am, not at 5 in the morning.The renewed restrictions due to the ongoing pandemic have (once again) severally restricted that carefree timelessness—this week a daily night curfew has been imposed between 10pm and 5am due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant. As a result, one of the losses the citizens face is that they can no longer amble to Chitli Qabar in icy midnight for Mohammed Moinuddin’s butter coffee.This quiet, unassuming man has been serving his signature winter brew for more than a decade. The pavement stall is right in the heart of the congested chowk, serving from 5pm to as late as 2am (in the pre-pandemic era).Blended with butter, the coffee fills up the body with so much heat that “you feel bulletproof from thandi,” says Mr Moinuddin solemnly. The only substantial piece of equipment in his makeshift café is an espresso machine that produces froth with great fury. The rest of the paraphernalia consists of a pan of hot milk (already mixed with Nescafé coffee powder), a tin of cocoa powder and slabs of yellow Amul butter. All that Mr Moinuddin have to do is to drop the butter slabs into a jug of coffee milk, which he steams up with his espresso machine.”Served in thick paper glasses, the steaming hot drink tastes… well, buttery. This being Old Delhi, it’s very milky and sugary. And since Amul butter happens to be a principal ingredient, the coffee is a bit salty—like the Tibetan tea.Till late into the night, the all-men customers huddle around Mr Moinuddin’s stall, gossiping over repeat glasses of the butter coffee. These days, because of the restrictions, Mr Moinuddin says he is obliged to wrap up his evening’s buisness as early as 8pm. Meanwhile, it is 5.15 pm right now and his stall is a mess, marooned in watery chaos (see photo). “The MCD people are repairing the underground water pipes,” he says, exasperatedly.Half an hour later, the street regains some order. Mr Moinuddin is ready to serve his delicious drink (19 rupees per serving). Alas, the customary thrill is missing. Blame not the earnest man. The true pleasure of butter coffee lies in consuming it during the bone-chilling midnights. That is no longer possible, so one must learn to partake, without ifs and buts, of whatever remains of the pre-coronavirus joys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-butter-coffee-stall-in-old-delhi-101640897271202.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Obituary: Justice NK Sodhi, a gentle legal giant||Chief justice NK Sodhi is no more. Son of illustrious late Justice HR Sodhi, he was a legal doyen in his own right. Graduating law from Panjab University in 1965, his professional expertise as a court counsel, led him to elevation to the Bench in 1991. He donned the esteemed positions of Chief Justice at Kerala and Karnataka high court. Upon superannuation in 2005, he held office for six years at Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai. He mastered a new subject and in 2013, authored ‘Report of High Level Committee to Review SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations’, a subject alien to him. His return to Chandigarh in 2011 saw him turning a new leaf and getting actively involved as an arbitrator. Working and learning never stopped.My fond association with Justice Sodhi began in the corridors of the high court in 1986. As a sought-after senior counsel in labour and company matters, he was ever available for guidance, tips of court craft and assistance to fledgling lawyers like myself. He was enriched as a walking encyclopedia in his law specialization. His multifarious legal personality knew no bounds. He remained the editor of ‘High Court Indian Law Reports’ for over 10 years and taught as a part-timer at the law department of Panjab University for 13 years, teaching tax and labour laws. He is affectionately remembered in the local legal fraternity, academic, practicing and on the Bench. His instant Punjabi and English wit, humour, vibrant and jovial personality connected him to all. He made friends with all. Numerous petitions challenging reduction of disability pension by controller, defense accounts of personnel, boarded out of defence service, led to the first-ever Defense Pension Adalat in 1999 at Chandigarh, under the able control of Justice NK Sodhi. As the central government’s standing counsel, I worked closely with him. I learnt amiable traits. Impressionable prints were ingrained. Spot redressal of grievances at the high court resolved a huge number of cases. The then defence minister George Fernandes lauded the project. Court etiquettes, politeness, punctuality, courtesies, cordiality and warmth, his court management was perfection. Patient hearing, compliance of court procedures, fairness and affording equal treatment to members of the Bar were his cherished traits. His fond habit of repeating his observations eloquently, gave you reaction time to respond with clarity. His mannerisms of court craft as a Judge were ingenious. A stickler of honesty and integrity, full of candor, his virtues were an epitome to emulate. Retirement did not end his zest and zeal to keep working. A gentleman of good tastes, he ensured bending the elbow on home visits. His recent past saw him battling with leukemia and frequent hospitalisations at PGI. Regardless, his willpower to keep going never ended. My frequent messages to him to join in webinars or discussions were very politely responded, expressing indisposition. I reciprocated with cheerful ‘get-well soon’ greetings and happy messages, pretending ignorance. The morale had to be kept high. I always wished to keep him updated with whatever I did, which he cherished. He often articulated praise on the writings of my son Ankit, which I shared with him. His ailment was never in the way.Steadfast on his values and principles, he was what a Judge ought to be. He lived his life, with his rules and ethics, and stood them till the end, never influenced by fear or favour. His smiling face, a cheery hello, always drew me to him. Adieu Judge. Rest in peace.(The writer is a Chandigarh-based practising lawyer)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/obituary-justice-nk-sodhi-a-gentle-legal-giant-101640897381594.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Raise import duty on apples: Jai Ram to Centre||Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday asked the central government to raise import duty on apples. Thakur met Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi and raised issues related to Himachal Pradesh. While participating in the pre-budget consultation meeting presided over by Sitharaman at Vigyan Bhawan, Thakur said the finance ministry was continuously providing financial assistance to the state. He said that interest-free loan of ₹400 crore was sanctioned for the development of infrastructure in the state during this financial year and additional ₹600 crore may be provided in the form of special assistance. Raising the issue of import duty on apples, Thakur emphasised the need to increase the same from 50% to 100% to protect Himachali apple and livelihood of 2.5 lakh families. He said that apple was the main horticultural crop of the state which was also the primary source of livelihood of a large number of population. However, due to a large influx of imported apples in the national market, prices of Himachal apple had fallen sharply, leading to revenue losses of the horticulturists of the state, he said. Therefore, import duty should be increased and apples should be excluded from the list of fruits and other commodities brought under the open general licence, he added. The HP chief minister said that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had found a site suitable for the construction of the greenfield airport in Mandi and had also accorded its final technical go-ahead. Therefore, this project may be included in the upcoming Union budget, he added. Thakur said the modes of rail and air connectivity were limited in the state and three existing airports of Shimla, Kullu and Kangra had small runways, making them suitable only for operating small planes and therefore Mandi airport was the need of the hour. He also demanded the extension of goods and services tax (GST) compensation facility for next three years. He said that Himachal was a hilly state having tough topographical conditions. The state is receiving GST compensation and revenue deficit grant (RDG) as a part of the central assistance and out of this, GST compensation is effective only till June 2022. Moreover, RDG will also be reduced in the coming years as per the recommendations of the 15th finance commission, which will adversely affect the finances of the state government, he said. The chief minister urged to extend the industrial development policy 2017 for the next five years in order to boost the economic growth in the state. Thakur said after the global investors’ meet in 2019, many industrial units had shown interest in setting up plants in the state and the investment of approximately ₹97,000 crore was expected. The industrial development policy being implemented by the ministry of commerce and industry would be effective only till March 31, 2022, which should be extended further so as to promote industrial development in the state, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/raise-import-duty-on-apples-jai-ram-to-centre-101640897141619.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||HP health department reviews vaccination drive prep for teens||Himachal Pradesh’s health department on Thursday reviewed the preparation for vaccination drive for teenagers between 15 and 18 years of age beginning on January 3. Secretary, health, Amitabh Awasthi chaired the meeting of the state task force committee for Covid vaccination in Shimla wherein he reviewed the preparation for vaccination of those in the 15 to 18 years age group and precautionary dose for people above 60 years with comorbidities. The secretary said as per the decision of the ministry of health and family welfare, Covid vaccination of children in the age group of 15 to 18 years would start from January 3, 2022. He said there are 3,57,450 beneficiaries in classes 9 to 12, who would be vaccinated in 2,797 government schools of the state. The beneficiaries of this group would be given Covaxin, he added. The eligible children of this age group can book appointments by self-registration through an existing account on CoWIN or by creating a new account through a mobile number. Online or on-site (walk-in) appointments can also be booked at the nearest government high school and senior secondary school. The precautionary dose for health care workers (HCWs), front-line workers (FLWs) and 60 years and above population with comorbidities, who have received two doses, would be provided from January 10, 2022. The prioritisation and sequencing of precautionary dose would be on completion of nine months (that is 39 weeks) from the date of administration of the second dose. As many as 96,200 eligible people would be vaccinated with precautionary dose, including 32,663 HCWs, 61,431 FLWs and 10,530 of those above 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-health-department-reviews-vaccination-drive-prep-for-teens-101640896841576.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Road crashes claimed 92 lives in Chandigarh this year||With no vehicular restrictions this year, road fatalities in Chandigarh went up by 77% as compared to the last year, data compiled by the traffic police shows. Against 53 fatalities in 50 road mishaps in 2020, the city recorded 94 deaths in 92 mishaps till December 29, 2021. The numbers, however, are lower than the pre-Covid times. Two-wheelers most vulnerableAs per the data, two-wheelers continued to be the most vulnerable, accounting for 41.48% of the total fatalities recorded in 2021. Last year, two-wheeler fatalities stood at 44%. The number of pedestrian deaths also increased from 12 in 2020 to 24 in 2021 (see box).Of the 92 fatal accidents, 51 were caused by speeding, 18 by rash and negligent driving while three were caused by driving on the wrong side. In 10 fatal incidents, it was found that the accused were under the influence of liquor and in 10 other cases, the fatal accident was caused due to the accused jumping traffic lights.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, road safety) Jaswinder Singh said, “People who speed also tend to jump traffic signals especially at night which is dangerous.” Senior superintendent of police (SSP, traffic) Manisha Choudary said, “The number of fatalities, although higher than 2020 is lower than previous years and through awareness, better enforcement and engineering initiatives, we will bring down the number further in the coming year.”She added, “To check fatal accidents, we are in the process of installing rotaries at some lightpoints and will set up a Chandigarh Road Safety Society to help in designing better road infrastructure. We will also be soon launching an iRAD app to scientifically record and analyse the causes of accidents. For effective enforcement, we are purchasing three more speed radar guns with night vision to capture speeding at night. Night nakas are also being deployed to deter the traffic violations on accident-prone stretches.”Need to further bring down average speedPunjab traffic advisor Navdeep Asija said, “Comparing 2021’s data with 2020 is not fair. If we look at the numbers in 2019 and 2021, we see that fatalities have reduced by 10, which is a good achievement. Chandigarh usually sees around 100 fatal accidents. To bring the fatalities down further, police need to check speeding more effectively. In Chandigarh, the speed differential or the average speed on a road is too high at night as compared to the day which leads to many fatal accidents. This differential must be reduced to 5%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/road-crashes-claimed-92-lives-in-chandigarh-this-year-101640896721539.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Fresh cloud of uncertainty surrounds reopening of colleges surge in Covid cases||Amid the spike in Covid-19 cases across Delhi, there is renewed uncertainty over the fate of colleges and universities with students fearing that they might have to continue with online classes next year as well. Most colleges and universities have remained closed since March 2020, when the pandemic first began. Even though some universities such as Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Delhi University (DU) reopened in a phased manner earlier in the year for certain sections of students, the majority of courses continued to be taught online. While some institutes planned to resume physical classes in January, others planned to take a call on reopening after assessing the Covid-19 situation. The recent uptick in cases has dashed the hopes of students, who said that another lockdown would give university administrations a reason to put the reopening plans on the back burner. In mid-November, IIT Delhi officials shared plans of resuming offline classes from January. Sources at the institute, however, said that the status quo on online classes would continue in the light of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Most activities at the institute were being carried out in online mode, said an official familiar with the matter, who did not wish to be quoted. At Delhi University, the spike in Covid-19 case dampened the hope of students who have been protesting for the past 52 days to press for the reopening of the university. Abhigyan (known by his first name), president, AISA Delhi, one of the student organisations participating in the stir, said that while things seemed uncertain amid the evolving Covid-19 situation, students wanted the university to reopen since online classes were not sustainable for a long time. “We have been protesting for the reopening of the university for the past 52 days now. With cases surging once again, there is uncertainty, but the university has to come up with some solution. A permanent closure and suspension of classes is not the way out. The student community is well aware that another lockdown and restrictions mean another stretch of online education. They are still in favour of the reopening and the administration must come up with a solution,” said Abhigyan. DU registrar Vikas Gupta said that the university had only resumed practical and project activities for students this year, which were being conducted at a small scale. Gupta said that the university would comply with DDMA norms and, considering the prevailing Covid-19 situation, the university was not expected to reopen anytime soon. “Until now, we were calling only half the students for limited practical or project activity. If the cases increase in the next few days, we will stop practical sessions as well. We are going by the DDMA guidelines. Looking at the prevailing Covid-19 situation, reopening the university is out of the question since we cannot endanger the lives of students,” said Gupta. JNU, which reopened for third-year PhD scholars, in September has also issued fresh restrictions in line with the yellow alert of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). The university has issued directions for the closing of the central library on Wednesday and other offline academic activities on campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fresh-cloud-of-uncertainty-surrounds-reopening-of-colleges-surge-in-covid-cases-101640896661569.html

Though Covid and its variants, the most recent being Omicron, continue to cast a long shadow over the world, the drop in cases, widespread vaccination, and lack of night curfew, have encouraged hoteliers, and residents to hold mega celebrations, after two years of virus-induced hardships. Hoteliers and restauranters, whose business had taken a hit last year due to a 9.30pm curfew on New Year's eve, say they are receiving a good response this year with most of the 250 hotels, and restaurants in the city already reserved for parties. Punjab Hotel and Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh said, “The public is eager to hold celebrations after two years of Covid curbs, which is also good for business. Famous singers will be performing at different bars and clubs, which will boost footfall, as people from other districts, and Chandigarh, are sure to visit the city.” Elite clubs such as the Sutlej club, Lodhi club will be holding grand celebrations for their members. Popular haunts of the city folk, including Sarabha Nagar, Model Town, Gol Market, and Dugri, are also expected to be flooded with revellers. Restauranter and Sarabha Nagar Main Market Traders Association chairperson Wangjenn Chiu said, “Going by the footfall we received on Christmas, it stands to reason that people will throng the markets on New Year Eve as well. However, the public should continue to take precautions, least there is a spike in cases.” Several residents are also organising a New Year’s bash at their homes, and farmhouse, while others plan to ring in the New Year in Chandigarh or Himachal Pradesh.A Model Town Extension, Block B, resident Tarandeep Singh said, “Usually, we ring in the New Year in Shimla or Chandigarh, but this year we will be inviting our friends and family to our house. Fortunately, fewer Covid cases are being reported. However, we must remain cautious.” Seeing the celebration as a chance for the hospitality sector to recover, Owner of Bistro 226, Civil Lines, Sukhkaran Gill said, “The hospitality sector has suffered many setbacks over the last two years. We are expecting a good response this year.” Only fully vaxxed persons to be allowed in parties: Hotel association With the spectre of Covid still looming large, only vaccinated persons will be allowed to enter the premises of hotels and restaurants.

This will be the senate’s first meeting in two years.The BoF had in January 2020 decided that no secretariat pay will be given to employees, after receiving a letter from the Punjab government, with directions for the same. The recommendations of BoF were approved by the syndicate in January last year and will now be taken up for final approval in the senate.The board had also decided to allow the varsity employees to use any airline while travelling for official purposes, as long as they are not utilising funds from the central government. It had also approved that while claiming leave travel concession (LTC), air travel through private airlines (economy class) will be permitted, with the rider that the reimbursement of air fare will be limited up to Air India’s fare for equivalent class.Roster for constituent collegesThe senate in its upcoming meeting will take a final call on the reservation roster for the recruitment of assistant professors at its constituent colleges. The syndicate had last year approved the recommendations of a varsity panel that was constituted to prepare the roster in consonance with the directions of the University Grants Commission (UGC). The draft roster prepared by the varsity was approved by the panel in its meeting on January 29 in 2020.

However, the benefit of the same is not being given to faculty of the dental institute, they said. The HC, in its order in June 2019, had directed PU and the Dental Council of India (DCI) to decide on a promotion policy. The varsity had also submitted the committee’s report with HC.
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Kejriwal invokes pledge to keep his flock together ahead of mayoral poll||With fears of horse-trading hanging over the election of Chandigarh municipal corporation mayor, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal got the party’s 14 councillors to take the pledge of loyalty in public here on Thursday.Addressing AAP workers at the Vijay Yatra (victory procession), after his party won 14 of the 35 seats in its maiden Chandigarh MC election, Kejriwal said, “The trust shown by people should not be broken.”Kejriwal read out the pledge as the councillors followed him in reciting it, “Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) party is like my mother. Chandigarh is my family. I will not break the trust the residents of Chandigarh have placed in me and my party. I will never leave AAP. I will never be a traitor to my party and my Chandigarh family. If I do, then Chandigarh residents shouldn’t vote for me ever.” In the pledge, he further asked the councillors to commit that they would work with honesty, not accept any bribe and not allow anybody else to do wrong things.In the newly elected MC house, the debutant AAP became the single-largest party, but failed to get clear majority. AAP has 14 votes, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 13, Congress 8 and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) 1. AAP, BJP and Congress -all have stated they would put up their candidates for the mayor’s post.Only a day after the election results were announced, AAP had alleged that BJP leaders were trying to purchase their councillors to change sides during the mayoral elections. It had put its councillors under surveillance. Responding to these allegations, both BJP and Congress had made counter-allegations of horse-trading on AAP.Tells councillors to restore city’s gloryStating that politics is only during the elections, and now such difference should be forgotten, Kejriwal, said, “All workers and councillors should ensure that from whichever party people come to you, there should be no discrimination. Don’t discriminate against those from the BJP, SAD or the Congress. All of them are our own people. Work more for people from other parties so that they vote for us next time,” he said, urging them to work towards restoring Chandigarh’s “glory as City Beautiful”.On the party’s victory in MC elections, Kejriwal, said, “Our workers have to work so hard that people vote for the AAP across the country.”Kejriwal said that the people of Chandigarh have cast their vote after seeing the Delhi model of AAP. Applying the Delhi model in Chandigarh will also make it the most beautiful city. Kejriwal was accompanied by Punjab AAP chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, Chandigarh unit leaders Chander Mukhi Sharma and Pardeep Chhabra besides the 14 councillors on the truck from Sector 22, one of the oldest sectors in the heart of Chandigarh. The procession started from Sector 22 Aroma light-point and ended at the Sector 23 light-point.

He said the party leadership was standing by Mann.Sidhu said he would drive out mafia gangs that have taken over the state and bring a new Punjab model. Attacking Bikram Singh Majithia, he said, “Majithia is hiding out of the fear of the police. I will not sit idle till he is punished.”He said there was a need to implement a cooperative policy to uplift the living standards of farmers. “Under the new Punjab model, cold stores would be set up all over Punjab. Every labourer in the state would be registered so that money could be credited directly to his account and the contractor could enter into any contract. No labourer would be allowed to take wages below ₹350,” Sidhu said.“We have to abolish such a system where workers are not given enough wages and establish panchayati raj,” he said.Harry Mann attacked senior Congress leader Lal Singh for involving in “deceitful deeds in connivance with Akali leader Prem Singh Chandumajra” to defeat him in the upcoming elections.“Lal Singh is plotting to divide the Congress in Sanaur so as to assure the victory of Chandumajra’s son from the Akali Dal, who in return assisted Lal Singh’s son to win in Samana,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-pledges-support-to-harry-mann-says-won-t-sit-idle-till-bikram-majithia-is-punished-101640894442622.html

However, Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu was quick to slam the allegations as baseless. He said the entire process of procurement is online and transparent and closely monitored by the Centre. If there would have been any discrepancy, the Central agencies should have taken cognisance of it long ago.

31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Once Hindu dominated, BJP’s pan-Punjab makeover has no dearth of Sikh faces||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has suddenly started expanding its wings, thanks to “poaching” done by the party to become a pan-Punjab party.Once Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced repealing of the laws on November 19, the situation has suddenly changed so much so that the party which till now in Punjab was considered only Hindu dominated is now trying to occupy the political centre stage in the state for the assembly polls with no dearth of Sikh faces being brought from other parties.It all started with a coup of sorts when senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and a popular Sikh face from Delhi Manjinder Singh Sirsa joined the party along with Parminder Singh Brar. This was followed by the induction of senior Congress leader and former minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi into the party fold about a week ago. Two sitting Congress MLAs, Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Balwinder Ladi, also joined the party in Delhi. This is besides several other prominent Sikh faces, including former MLAs and MPs.According to information procured from state BJP headquarters, three sitting MLAs, eight former MLAs and several prominent young faces, especially from the Akali Dal, have joined the party.The party has already announced an alliance with the Punjab Lok Congress of Capt Amarinder Singh and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. Unlike in the past when it had an alliance with the SAD and had virtually left the entire “political Sikh space” to that party, the BJP this time wants to engage very much itself in that space as well and as a major and as a dominant partner.That is the reason the BJP is “poaching” on the prominent Sikh faces in the Congress and is encouraging them to join the party instead of the Punjab Lok Congress.In this expansion plan, according to information, Sirsa is playing a key role for the party with most of the joinings of Sikh faces going to his credit.The entire planning for this expansion plan is being run from the national capital.“The BJP is sensing is a chance in Punjab and that is why senior party leaders are directly overseeing the developments and are personally giving confidence to the leaders coming from other parties,” a senior leader said.If reports doing rounds in public space are to be believed, some more Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Akali leaders, including some MLAs, are likely to join the party in the coming days.The recent joining of Sikh faces has made the BJP visible in those areas as well where it is not even having a proper organisational set-up.“Punjab is a top priority state in our scheme of things and is as important as any other state, like UP or Haryana, and that is the reason we are using all our energies and resources to involve and engage every section of society with the party,” state general secretary, BJP, Subhash Sharma said.He denied any poaching and claimed that leaders are themselves coming to join the party. “The BJP looks like a credible option. The party was not focusing exclusively on a single section of the population, but the entire state and its people,” he claimed.This is for the first time in its recent electoral history that the BJP will be contesting these elections as a dominant political party. For the last few decades, it had restricted itself to 23 assemblies and three parliamentary constituencies only.The party is likely to graduate this time to somewhere between 60 to 70 seats all over the state spread evenly across the three regions of Malwa, Majha and Doaba and from both urban as well as rural segments.

Slamming the municipal corporation for failing to keep a check on the quality of material, shopkeepers on the Dugri main road complained that the road material had started peeling off a day after the road was carpeted in cold weather conditions during the night. Meanwhile, RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal has submitted a complaint with the chief secretary and state vigilance department seeking a probe into the matter, after the road material at recently carpeted Pakhowal Road started wearing off on Thursday.While the civic body is in-charge of construction work on Dugri Road, the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) has built the Pakhowal Road. Slamming authorities for not keeping a check on quality, residents demanded that action be taken against the contractors and the officials concerned, who have failed to perform their duty.A shopkeeper, Sanjay Lalit, said, “We have been raising hue and cry over the potholed roads for a long time, and the main road had been repaired after six long years, only for the material to wear way in no time. The project cost around ₹4 crore and it is a shame that the authorities did not check the quality of work. The money has been wasted and residents have not gotten any relief.”Lalit suspects that carpeting the road in the cold was responsible for the quick wearing away. Locals have also flagged poor quality road construction work at Old GT Road, Kitchlu Nagar, and Model Town-Jawaddi Road among other areas.Sabharwal says that hard-earned money of the public is wasted in the crores when authorities pay no mind to the quality of work taking place. Several complaints have been submitted by residents from different areas of the city, but to no avail. “The vigilance department should conduct an inquiry into the matter. The contractor should not be paid until the authorities are satisfied with the work. Action should be taken against the officials concerned, who have failed at their duty,” he said. LIT superintending engineer Buta Ram said that after receiving the complaint a team had sent to inspect Pakhowal Road. “If any anomalies are found in the construction work, required action will be taken against the contractor,” he said.Despite attempts to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he remained unavailable for comment. Earlier, Sabharwal said that a third party had been appointed to check the quality of developmental works. Further, directions have already been issued to the officials at the bridges and roads department of the municipal corporation to stop payment to the contractor, if the quality of work is not up to the mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-roads-wearing-away-within-days-of-construction-vigilance-probe-sought-101640894382846.html

Under the Yellow Alert of the Covid graded response action plan, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday enforced a range of restrictions in view of a spike in Covid cases. According to the alert, only 50% seating is allowed both Metro and public buses. No standing passengers are allowed. The restriction has severely limited the carrying capacity of the two modes of public transport. Additional deputy commissioner of police, south district, Mandava Harsha Vardhan said window panes of six DTC buses were damaged in two separate incidents. “Legal action is being taken in these cases,” he added. Five buses were damaged in Badarpur and one in Sangam Vihar, he added. The first incident was reported at about 8.15am, when the police received multiple phone calls about a traffic jam near Jamia Hamdard on south Delhi’s Mehrauli Badarpur Road. When the police reached the spot, they found that some bus commuters were instigating others to sit on the road as bus drivers and marshals were not allowing more than 17 passengers in each bus in line with the Covid-related curbs ordered by the government, a police officer aware of the case said.“The police tried to convince the agitated public to allow the traffic to pass by, but in vain. After some time, they went on a rampage, and damaged window panes of five buses,” the additional commissioner said, adding that the police did not use any force to disperse the crowd. “In the process one police person also sustained injury,” the officer said.The district police received a second report of passengers creating a ruckus at 10,30am, in Sangam Vihar, about 3km from the spot where the first incident was reported. Police officers said some commuters were angry over not being allowed to board the buses. The additional commissioner said a group of men blocked the road and broke the window panes of a DTC bus around 10.30 am. “Police dispersed the crowd and a case was registered at Sangam Vihar police station,” he said.Four men and two women were arrested under relevant IPC sections, and one juvenile was apprehended, in the two cases, Benita Mary Jaiker, DCP (south) said.Police said all those detained were workers at factories. There were a few passengers in one of the buses, but were quickly evacuated and moved to safety. None of them was injured, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unhappy-over-long-waits-restrictions-commuters-vandalise-buses-in-delhi-101640894381462.html

31-12-2021||Delhi||Multiplex body meets Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia over closure of cinema halls||A delegation of the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) on Thursday met deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and sought his intervention in reopening cinema halls in the capital that were recently shut amid the uptick in Covid cases. The cinema body is a consortium of more than 11 multiplex chains and represents around 80% of the multiplex industry of India. Under the yellow alert of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to tackle Covid-19, the Delhi government has shut down cinema halls and multiplexes. Most cinema halls reopened only in August after a punishing wave of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Business, meanwhile, began only last month, they said. When the cinemas were ordered shut, Hindi movie 83, starring Ranveer Singh, and Hollywood’s Spiderman - No Way Home -- dubbed the first blockbuster of the Covid era -- were running at the movie halls.While highlighting the adverse financial situation that the film and cinema industry had been facing since the beginning of the pandemic due to multiple shutdowns, the delegation said that the Delhi government’s decision had brought fresh uncertainty for cinema hall owners. Citing the cancellation of the release of an upcoming Hindi film, Jersey, the delegation urged Sisodia to treat cinemas at par with other industries and allow them to reopen with protocols. “We fully appreciate the challenges at the government’s end in these tough times, however, instead of closing the cinemas, we would urge the Delhi government to consider introducing ‘double vaccination requirement’ to enter cinemas, as is the case in some other states. Alternatively, the seating capacity restriction of 50% can be reintroduced at cinemas,” said Ajay Bijli, chairman, PVR Limited, who led the delegation. The delegation also shared a research report outlining the low covid transmission risk in cinemas across the globe.“Cinemas have already demonstrated an ability to operate safely for the public and employees via the usage of enhanced ventilation systems, enhanced hygiene, and other safety protocols. Not a single outbreak of Covid-19 anywhere around the world has been traced to a cinema,” MAI said in a written statement issued on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/multiplex-body-meets-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-over-closure-of-cinema-halls-101640894081176.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Garment traders say increased GST will lead to 20% increase in prices||Ludhiana City traders on Thursday voiced their unhappiness with the union government decision to increase the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on fabrics, garments and hosiery—between 5 to 12%—from January 1, saying that the move will lead to a near-20% hike in the prices of the finished goods.Fearing losses, the hosiery traders complained that the industry is already going through a slump due to the pandemic and the central government’s move will further affect business.They added that the customers, especially the ones belonging to the low income group, will also be impacted before demanding that the government reconsider its stance.The traders in the hosiery hub of the state criticised the central government’s indifferent attitude, saying that their representatives have forwarded multiple messages but have received no response.Punjab Cloth Merchants Association (PCMA) president Sonu Nilibar said, “On an average the prices of garments including ‘Saree’ will be increased by around 20% and the GST rate of thread/fabric/garments has been increased by 7%. The purchasing capacity of the customers has already been reduced during the pandemic due to financial constraints and the government has put an additional burden.”The traders further accused the government of ignoring the needs of the textile sector, which is the second largest employment generator in the country, to benefit the big corporate houses.Akalgarh Market Garment Association president Manpreet Singh Bunty said, “The prices of garments will increase at least by 20 percent and with the prevailing financial condition in the market, the trade will be badly impacted. The government is only concerned about the big houses and small traders and the public has been completely ignored.”The hosiery traders, meanwhile, stated that the move has hit the sector even harder as they were suffering in terms of sales during the winter season.Knitwear and Textile Club president Vinod Thapar said, “The market is already moving through a slump this winter and this can be judged from the fact that many companies have already announced sales. The increase in prices of the products will further reduce the margin for the manufacturers, as the customer will not pay higher and the manufacturer will have to bear the losses from his own pocket. The government should reconsider the decision.”Thapar added that the central government’s move is also expected to increase the cases of bogus billing. Traders pin hopes from GST council meetPCMA president Nilibar said garment traders across the country had high hopes that the government will slash the tax rate during the GST council meeting scheduled to be held under chairmanship of union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-garment-traders-say-increased-gst-will-lead-to-20-increase-in-prices-101640894021272.html

Cold wave conditions are expected to persist in Delhi for the next two days as well,” said RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD. The IMD declares a coldwave in the plains, when the minimum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more below the normal mark, or when it drops below the 4-degree mark. On Thursday, the minimum temperature at Safdarjung (3.4 degrees) Ayanagar (3.8 degrees) and Narela (3.2 degrees) were all classified as cold wave.

IMD forecast shows the minimum could drop below the 3-degree mark in parts of Delhi on Friday. “The next two days will have minimum hovering around 3 to 4 degrees Celsius. Some parts may even record a minimum below 3 degrees,” said Jenamani.

31-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt imposes fines worth ₹3.46 crore for Covid protocol violations in 4 days||The Delhi government imposed fines worth ₹3.46 crore in the last four days against people violating Covid-19 protocol, officials said. Meanwhile, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday asked districts to strengthen the crackdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Seelampur, on Thursday ordered the closure of several markets in the area due to large-scale violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “The Seelampur Fruit Market, Seelampur Police Station Road Market, C, D, & F block markets and Nehru Market have been closed from 4pm Thursday to 10pm Friday. Penal action under appropriate laws will be initiated against any shopkeeper found violating the closure order,” said a district official, requesting anonymity. “Three shops found violating the odd-even operational curbs imposed by the DDMA were sealed in Narela market,” said another official. Traders from these markets refused to comment on the action taken against them. According to official documents seen by HT, fines totalling ₹89,67,800 were imposed in 4,589 cases of violations, which include not wearing masks, not following social distancing, spitting in public places and consuming liquor, gutkha and tobacco in public places on December 29. For similar violations on December 28, fines totalling ₹8,63,370 were imposed, and fines totalling ₹81,51,900 were imposed on December 27.The number of total violations under which fines have been imposed has grown in the last three days. On December 27, there were 4,122 cases of violations, 4,392 on December 28 and 4,585 on December 29.On December 26, 4,425 cases of violations were reported.A North district official, who did not want to be named, said presidents and members of various market associations have been informed of the curbs. “The Station House Officers (SHOs) concerned of the police stations have been directed to ensure compliance. We are regularly making announcements in markets regarding the observance of Covid-appropriate behaviour and compliance of curbs imposed by the DDMA, such as the operation of shops on odd-even basis and night curfew. The enforcement teams are inspecting the area and challans are being issued as and when required,” said the official. Several district authorities have formed multiple flying squads to raid crowded hotspots such as restaurants, bars, markets, interstate bus terminals and malls. They are vigilant, especially during the night to ensure restaurants, hotels, and other places do not violate the DDMA ban on gatherings ahead of the New Year. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said the authorities should strictly enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour because the Omicron variant is highly transmissible “People, especially those with co-morbidities or those who are immunosuppressed or unimmunised, should avoid public places. However, this variant is not severe and may not have serious consequences. Panic and fear should be strictly avoided,” Dr Kishore said. Chamber of Trade & Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal said all markets must stick to the curbs imposed by the authorities because laxity in compliance can only lead to more cases of Covid-19 and further spread will badly affect traders. “The authorities should understand that shopkeepers do not have the power to enforce Covid-19 protocols on people outside their shops. The authorities should enforce Covid-19 protocols outside the shops. All shops must implement the ‘No Mask No Entry’ directive,” said Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-imposes-fines-worth-3-46-crore-for-covid-protocol-violations-in-four-days-101640893722620.html

Delhi saw its cleanest year last year due to Covid-19 induced lockdowns bringing activities to a halt in 2020, the agency said. Safar’s analysis also showed that there were 12 severe air days this year – when the PM 2.5 concentration was over 250 micrograms per cubic metre for a 24-hour period, with another 77 very poor days recorded, when the PM 2.5 concentration was between 121 and 250 micrograms per cubic metre. According to CPCB AQI data, Delhi recorded 18 severe air days (AQI between 401-500) only between November 1-December 30.Gufran Beig, founder project director at Safar, said the trend over the last four years shows that Delhi has had a relatively cleaner year as compared to 2018 and 2019, with 2020 being an exception due to the lockdown. “Data from the last four year shows 2020 is the cleanest year, but we also had a national lockdown in place for long durations. After last year, 2021 has been the cleanest in terms of good and satisfactory days. This year, the good air spell mostly came during the monsoon period, when rains kept Delhi’s air quality in check. We also saw a good prolonged spell of satisfactory air in summer,” said Beig. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said long-term trend for Delhi over the last five years has shown an increase in the number of good, satisfactory and moderate days, but Delhi is still unable to get rid of winter smog. “We are still recording similar number of severe air days, which build up during November and December. This shows that the background emissions are fairly high, and as soon as the wind speeds or temperatures drop, we see an episodic event in winters. This requires greater action to tackle sources of pollution not just in Delhi but in the 24 districts of NCR,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-met-national-pm2-5-standards-for-only-half-of-2021-101640893481440.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab education dept announces plan to set up guidance cells in government schools||Ludhiana With an aim to provide impetus to students with regard to their academic and psychological growth, the Punjab Education Department on Thursday announced the setting up of guidance cells at the government schools across the state.Chairing a meeting with the deputy district education officers in the state and a school government school principals from districts including Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Kapurthala and Moga, SCERT Punjab assistant director Jyoti Soni directed schools to form guidance committees.The committees are expected to include at least four members including the school head boy and head girl, a representative from the teachers and the principal. Soni said, “Students may not feel comfortable in sharing their problems with the teachers directly and thus the head girl and head boy of a school can play an important role in counselling”. The state had earlier earmarked ₹3,000 per school for a special counselling corner, which would have career brochures or information boards.The Education Department is expected to grant a separate ₹1,000 to all secondary and government high schools in the state, an official said.Trained teachers to be guidance counsellorsA total of 3,636 trained teachers have been deputed as guidance counsellors in various schools.“Our teachers were trained by professional counselors from Chandigarh. We also have a website pertaining to guidance counseling and career counseling. The aim behind this initiative is to heal the mental health of the students,” an official said.Soni said the aim behind this initiative was to reach out to students that are unable to perform due to poor mental health.“Students in the state reach us at our online portal and we make them in touch with our counsellors. At times students have some family issues which affect their growth. Moreover, we aim to make them aware about the prevailing career opportunities after their schooling and thus schools have been instructed to have such guidance corners”, Soni said.Schools equipped with computersNearly 1800 schools across the state have also been equipped with computers for the counsellors.“Guidance counsellors need to be equipped as they can save the data and the history of the students in the computers. Department aims to leave no stone unturned to raise the education standards in the government schools. Along with the career opportunities, counsellors also counsel students pertaining to gender sensitivity, teacher-students relationship, family environment and interpersonal skills,” the official added.DEO secondary Lakhvir Singh Samra said the state is leading in terms of providing career guidance in schools and is putting up sincere efforts to redress problems of students with regard to their health and educational careers.
31-12-2021||Delhi||Omicron has spread in the community: Delhi health minister Satyender Jain||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has spread in the community, state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday, adding that most patients have had only minor symptoms, while none have so far needed oxygen support.Addressing a press briefing, Jain said more than half the positive samples analysed are of the Omicron variant, according to the latest genome sequencing report, which includes patients with no travel history. “The variant is gradually spreading in the community and its proportion will increase in the coming days,” said Jain.“None of the hospitalised patients have required oxygen at present and most patients have only had minor symptoms. However, the most serious problem is that it is spreading much faster than the Delta variant,” he added. “There are around 200 [Omicron] patients hospitalised in Delhi, of which 115 people were tested positive at the airport have isolated in hospital. Out of these 200, 102 are from Delhi and the other 98 are from outside the city,” said Jain. Jain said that since the hospital occupancy is still low and most Omicron infections mild, the government will not issue a Level 2 [amber] alert under its Graded Covid-19 Response Action Plan for now.“A decision on imposing more curbs will be taken at a DDMA [Delhi Disaster Management Authority] meeting after monitoring the Covid-19 situation,” said Jain. The first phase of curbs under the action plan – the yellow alert - was triggered on Tuesday, putting in place a night curfew from 10pm-5am, shutting schools, colleges, movie theatres and gyms, apart from curbs on public transit. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said “People must observe Covid-appropriate behaviour and people with co-morbid conditions and immunosuppressed patients must strictly follow all Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/omicron-has-spread-in-the-community-delhi-health-minister-satyender-jain-101640893062523.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana residents spar with authorities over choked sewer line||Ludhiana: High drama unfolded in Manjit Nagar of Ward Number 47 on Thursday after residents objected to the inauguration of a project to lay sewer lines and reconstruct streets by councillor Priya Kaira’s husband Nirmal Kaira and Congress leader Kamaljit Karwal. Demanding resolution of the choked sewer lines at the main road, the residents said that they would not allow the civic body to take up construction work of streets. Residents engaged in heated arguments with Kaira. The inauguration ceremony was eventually completed, but the residents refused to budge from their stand saying they would not allow the authorities to commence work.One of the residents, Navjot Singh, said, “The sewer line at the main road remains choked, due to which the sewer in the streets also get choked and unhygienic conditions have been prevailing in the streets for a long time. We are not against construction of streets, but we demand that the MC should first resolve the issue of choked sewer lines at the main road. Otherwise, there will be no use of installing interlocking tiles and unhygienic conditions will continue to prevail in the area.” Nirmal Kaira, meanwhile, refuted by saying the issue of choked sewer lines is being faced only in one of the streets of the neighbourhood. “The project to install new sewer lines on the main road is also in the pipeline and on Thursday, we visited the area to commence the work to install interlocking tiles in streets. The residents have been assured the issue of sewer lines will also be resolved and a few faulty private connections might also be the reason behind the problem,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-residents-spar-with-authorities-over-choked-sewer-line-101640893061287.html

The man, identified as Shahrukh (known by his first name) , was taken by local residents to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Shahdara, R Sathiyasundaram said the police control room (PCR) was informed about the incident at 5pm.

A case under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC, and sections of the Arms Act was registered at the Seema Puri police station.“The police team gathered footage from the CCTVs installed in the vicinity and identified the accused as Zuber, 30, Zafar, 20 and Aditya,18-- all residents of Seemapuri,” the DCP said. They are all known by their first names only.“Teams were formed, multiple raids were conducted and two suspects, Aditya and Zuber were arrested on Thursday. The third accused, Zafar, is absconding,” the DCP said.Officers associated with the investigation in the case said it was a case of personal enmity since Shahrukh was allegedly having an affair with the sister of Zuber. The officer added that woman was married, and Zuber had earlier warned Shahrukh to keep away from his sister. When the latter did not relent, the suspect planned to kill him. On Wednesday evening, they reached the ration wali gali, where Shahrukh lived, around 5pm.“As soon as they spotted Shahrukh, they started beating him even as no local resident intervened. Soon, one of them picked up a metal chair and hit Shahrukh several times on his head.When Shahrukh fell on the road, Zafar and Zuber pinned him down, and Aditya stabbed him with a knife, first in the back and then a couple of times in the abdomen,” the investigator said. Police said Shahrukh was listed as a ‘bad character’ in Seema Puri police station, a term used by the police to denote that an individual has been accused of multiple crimes and needs to be kept under surveillance. Police said that Shahrukh was externed on January 3, 2020 for a period of two years. “More than 40 cases of mostly pickpocketing at Metro stations were registered against him in Delhi and several cases were registered in UP as well.

The operations, which were scheduled to resume on December 15 after the government agreed to farmers’ demands, were stalled after Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU- Kadian) and Kirti Kisan Union members refused to lift the sit-in protest until the hiked toll prices were rolled back. Kirti Kisan Union (KKU) leader Santokh Singh Sekhon said the agitation was lifted after toll authorities agreed to the majority of their demands. “The company agreed to increase the wages of around 200 employees by 10%. They will remove speed breakers that were causing damage to tractor-trollies and heavily loaded trucks. A towing vehicle, and an ambulance will be deployed round-the-clock. They will also streamline the process to avail a monthly pass,” he said. The farmers, however, were not able to get the hike in toll prices and the scrapping of the multiple-visit systrem revoked. Sekhon said, “These issues are pending and will be worked out following a meeting with the surface transport ministry.”A toll plaza official, Shiv Raj, said the discussion was held in an amicable environment, after which protesting farmers agreed to vacate the toll plaza.NHAI project director Virendra Singh said, “We explained to the union leaders that the prices had not been increased, rather they have been adjusted as per the wholesale price index (WPI). An advertisement in this regard was also published in leading daily newspapers in September.”The National Highway Authority of India earns around ₹50 lakh a day from the Ladhowal Toll Plaza alone, and has suffered a loss of around ₹200 crore over the last 15 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-call-off-sit-in-ladhowal-toll-plaza-operations-resume-after-15-months-101640892822105.html

Accompanied by policemen, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, who was arrested earlier in the day for staging a protest against the BJP government in the state over the incident, went to the girl’s house and met her family members. Later, he told reporters that he got the girl to speak to Priyanka Gandhi.Priyanka said the district administration should ensure the arrest of the accused in 24 hours or else the Congress would launch a major agitation. She said the party workers staged a demonstration in Amethi on Thursday demanding security to the victim and that the accused be tried in a fast track court. Led by Lallu, Congress workers in large numbers started the protest demonstration from the Ramlila Maidan in Amethi, which ended at the Rajiv Gandhi tri-section, where the protesters sat on a dharna. They also raised slogans against the BJP government in the state and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The police subsequently arrested Lallu. Amethi superintendent of police (SP) Dinesh Singh said the state Congress chief was held for staging a protest without permission and squatting on the road. Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ termed the Amethi incident shameful and questioned the silence of union minister Smriti Irani who is Amethi MP. She said the incident was an outcome of anti-Dalit and anti-women policies being pursued by the BJP government. She alleged that state government was making attempts to protect the accused responsible for the incident. “Crime against Dalits and women has gone up during the tenure of BJP government in the state,” said PL Punia, former chairperson of National Commission for Scheduled Castes.Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari demanded an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others for the incident.

31-12-2021||Gurugram||Notices issued to four illegal colonies in Farrukhnagar, cease work order given||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Thursday issued fresh notices to four illegal colonies being developed in the district, taking the total number of such colonies in Gurugram’s Farrukhnagar to 11, said officials.The enforcement wing of the DTCP also issued notices to commercial establishments being run in residential houses in the Vatika India Next colony, and asked the owners to cease such operations at the earliest. A survey on commercial activities in Sushant Lok has been completed and required action will be initiated in coming weeks, it said.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the department has served notices to the colonisers of four new illegal localities in Farrukhnagar. “Earlier, we issued notices to seven illegal colonies... and recently, the enforcement team served notices to four new localities there. A comprehensive demolition drive is being planned in the area, and we will stop establishment of these illegal colonies at the initial stage itself,” said Bhath, adding that these colonies were being developed on nearly 20 acres.According to the officials, the DTCP is planning to carry out the demolition drive by January 15, 2022.The DTCP officials also said that demolition drives were halted due to recent court orders on ban on construction and demolition activities, but they will resume taking action against the violators from January next year. Bhath also said that it was decided during the recent task force meeting, a monthly conference chaired by the deputy commissioner, that illegal colonies will now be identified at the initial stage and development will be halted there at the earliest. “The enforcement teams will continuously patrol around the outskirts of the city and identify such colonies at the initial stage itself,” Bhath said.In another development, the enforcement wing of the DTCP also issued notices to six establishments for running commercial activities in blocks H and F of the Vatika India Next colony. “People are running clinics, saloons and beauty parlours without taking permission from the department. They are violating the rules. The property owners were served notices, and action will be taken after they submit their replies,” Bhath added. The DTCP officials said that action against commercial activities in Sushan Lok will also be carried out as the officials have completed the survey.“We sealed several properties in the Sushant Lok area after we got complaints of commercial activities being carried out in the residential area. The sealing drive against such commercial establishments will continue in the coming weeks,” Bhat said. 
31-12-2021||Gurugram||Nearly 450 ‘essential’ vehicles of Gurugram civic body to get GPS trackers||Nearly 450 essential vehicles of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will soon be fitted with a global positioning system (GPS) tracking system and monitored at its control room in Sector 39, which opened earlier this month, said officials on Thursday.A GPS tracking unit is a navigation device, normally on a vehicle, asset, person or animal, which uses the GPS to determine its movement and determine its location. GPS trackers connect to a series of satellites for the location determination.The MCG has nearly 350 vehicles involved in garbage collection, 80 tractors for construction and demolition (C&D) waste collection and 13 mechanised sweeping machines -- each of which will be tracked through the control room from January 2022.Officials of the civic body said that the process of fitting GPS machines will be completed by January next year, and linked to the Sector 39 control room.“Work on fitting the GPS machines to the nearly 450 MCG vehicles has started. The process will be completed by next month. With this, we will be able to have a constant supervision on all the essential vehicles and ensure that those ply at their designated sites. This will enable the MCG to serve the residents in a better manner,” said Sunder Sheoran, executive engineer, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) of MCG.The MCG officials said that the move will not only help them to keep 24x7 track of the vehicles, but also ensure that issues like non-collection of garbage among others are being minimised.“We have been getting a lot of complaints from residents, who often complain that garbage is not being collected from their houses regularly. With the new GPS machines and the Swachh Nagar app, we will have a complete control over the situation, and we will be able to ensure an upgraded door-to-door collection of garbage,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.In the Swachh Nagar app, garbage collectors scan QR codes installed outside people’s houses or on the floors of buildings. Details such as the time when the waste was lifted, or if the house owners were not present at that time are being sent to the residents and senior MCG officials for better management.In October, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja directed the MCG officials to set up the control room -- the first one -- for monitoring its essential vehicles. The control room will also monitor illegal waste dumping at unauthorised sites, to curb such activities. Strict action will be taken against violators and they will have to pay fines too, said the officials.The MCG officials also said that the purpose of monitoring mechanised sweeping machines is to ensure that the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures are adhered to. Each mechanised sweeping machine operates during an eight-hour shift, over a pre-decided 14 kilometres stretch and disperses over 16,000 litres of treated water.“Since all the routes are pre-decided, the responsibility of the control room will be to ensure that the sweeping machines are being run on requisite routes, failing which senior MCG officials will take action against the violators,” said a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity.
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Omicron is fast replacing Delta: experts||Mumbai: The new, highly mutated Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 is fast replacing the Delta variant in Mumbai health experts said as the city recorded 3,555 fresh cases on Thursday. Traits in the emerging third wave including mild infections with lower hospitalization rates and a high proportion of breakthrough (post-vaccination) infections are all indicators of the widespread nature of Omicron, members of the state Covid task force said. “The nature of the current surge is a clear indicator that the Omicron variant is replacing Delta,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. “This is a natural progression of a virus, with newer variants dominating the older ones.” The confirmation of the Omicron variant is done through genome sequencing. So far, more than 130 confirmed cases of the variant have been detected in Mumbai, while 450 cases have been detected in the state. However, not all samples of swabs collected around the city — or state — are sent for genome sequencing, thus it is difficult to gauge the real spread of the variant. The city’s first wave was driven by the original Wuhan virus. The second wave, much more devastating than the first, was driven by the Delta variant. While many other variants have been in circulation, the emergence of Omicron is a cause for concern because of its high transmissibility and immune escaping capabilities. “Similar to what other countries have experienced, the disease spectrum in the cases that we are seeing is mild. Many patients are coming with breakthrough infections. All these signs tell us that a lot of Omicron is in circulation and we are likely to see a huge number of cases in the third wave,” said Dr Tanu Singhal, an infectious disease expert from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. Experts said the third wave is likely to have a greater number of cases, but is unlikely to see severe disease and mortality. “Since Omicron causes milder disease and with prior protection that we have from vaccinations and infections, the fresh wave is less likely to strain hospitals,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. The best strategy to tackle the Omicron outbreak is to create hurdles in its spread, he said. “We have to create a bumpy road for Omicron by wearing masks, avoiding crowds, vaccinating and following other such measures. This will help in spreading out the cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/omicron-is-fast-replacing-delta-experts-101640891865450.html

If people have problems with an event, they should talk about it and resolve the issue.’’The chief minister was addressing a press conference at Haryana Bhawan in New Delhi.On Saturday (December 25), the group, ‘Dharam Jagriti Mission’, disrupted the event organised at the school to celebrate Christmas, said residents on condition of anonymity. A video shared on social media showed some people chanting Jai Shri Ram at the Christmas event, as a man snatched the microphone from a woman singing a devotional song.RP Pandey, president of Dharam Jagriti Mission, had said, “Some women had reached out to residents and invited them for the Christmas programme. Through songs and prayer, they promote their religion and pollute the minds of children about sanatan dharma.” He alleged that the programme was an “attempt to lure the poor and convert them to Christianity”.The event was organised in his “personal capacity” by a local resident, who is a member of the ‘House of Hope’, the pastor of the organisation said, asking not to be named. “We were present when this unfortunate incident took place. They started shouting slogans and stopped the event... We are not going to file any complaint,” the pastor said, also requesting that the name of the school is not revealed.Police have made no arrests yet, saying no complaint was made. “Police have not received any complaint from any group,” said inspector Shailender Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Pataudi police station.The local administration is yet to respond to the matter.The incident came on the heels of regular disruption of Friday prayers by Muslims by Hindu groups in Gurugram.Hindu right-wing groups have been protesting against Friday namaz in open public spaces in Gurugram for the last three years. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims. However, in November, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing groups and locals continued to protest and disrupt prayers. Muslims, however, have maintained that they were forced to use public spaces because of the inadequate number of mosques in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hindu-group-disrupting-christmas-event-in-pataudi-was-unfortunate-haryana-cm-101640891861051.html

31-12-2021||Mumbai||45% of Omicron cases in Maharashtra from those sans international travel history||Mumbai: Nearly 45% of the 450 Omicron cases detected in Maharashtra are from those without any international travel history. Based on the data, health experts now worry that Covid-19’s new variant is in a higher transmission phase. Of the 450 Omicron cases detected till Thursday, 206 did not have any travel history. State health officials said that of the 206 patients, the genome sequencing reports of 38 patients were declared on Wednesday and 168 patients on Thursday. Infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal said that a considerable number of cases could go untested as the Omicron infection is mild. The genome sequencing of samples from Maharashtra is being carried out at various laboratories including the National Institute of Virology in Pune, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and Kasturba Hospital’s laboratory in Mumbai. In addition to collecting samples of international travellers and their contacts for genome sequencing, the civic body in Mumbai also began community surveillance from December 21 in various wards. From this surveillance, 375 samples were sent for genome sequencing at the Kasturba Hospital’s laboratory and of them, 141 or nearly 38% have been detected with the Omicron variant. The 141 cases were detected in 22 of the city’s 24 wards. Of these 89 patients were male and 52 were female. The most number of cases- 21- have been detected from the K-West ward, followed by D ward (11 cases), H west and F North (10 each) and G South and M West (8 each). An official said that the findings indicate the community spread of the variant, but they would wait for at least two more rounds of genome sequencing from the community surveillance, to confirm it. State’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi however confirmed that the omicron variant is in the community outbreak phase and the third wave is being driven by this highly mutated variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/45-of-omicron-cases-in-maharashtra-from-those-sans-international-travel-history-101640891681517.html
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Resident doctors to intensify strike amidst Omicron spurt||Mumbai: As part of their ongoing protest against the delay in NEET-PG counselling, resident doctors from KEM Hospital, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital (LTMG) and JJ Hospital on Thursday withdrew their emergency services. This was done to show solidarity with the doctors who were attacked and then arrested in Delhi for participating in the protest. Nearly 1000 resident doctors from the three hospitals participated in the strike by terminating the Outpatient Department (OPD) services, Intensive Care Unit and emergency department. They however continued to work in the Covid-19 wards. The strike at LTMG Hospital began at 2 pm on Thursday and 5 pm at KEM Hospital. Resident doctors have been protesting against the delay in PG admissions for the past several weeks. A member of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said they have been working with the two-thirds workforce at the moment and new admissions will ensure 45,000 more doctors enter the healthcare sector, which is very important considering the ongoing pandemic. In addition to the PG issue, the resident doctors were also agitated about the arrests of doctors in Delhi for participating in a peaceful protest. The protesting doctors have highlighted both these issues in their letters to the authorities including their respective deans and the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). Among those detained in Delhi included two Mumbai doctors - Pravin Dhage, general secretary of MARD and Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice-president of MARD- who had gone to Delhi on Monday to participate in the protest. The doctors plan to intensity their strike further from Friday, with more colleges expected to join. Mangesh Bansode, vice president of MARD said that a total of 6000 doctors from 18 medical colleges all over Maharashtra will be on strike from Friday. “The protest will continue until the last date of NEET-PG counselling is released,” he said. Around 400 resident doctors from BYL Nair hospital in Mumbai Central also plan to withdraw their services from Friday. Hospital authorities have called in senior doctors and faculty members to take charge during the ongoing protest. “If the strike continues, the hospital will assign senior doctors and hospital faculty members to attend the patients from Friday. All the elective surgeries will be postponed,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of LTMG Hospital. KEM Hospital’s dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said that he is trying to convince the resident doctors to return to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-to-intensify-strike-amidst-omicron-spurt-101640891441722.html
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Sanjay Raut criticises PM Modi for not wearing mask||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena has fired a fresh salvo at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not observing Covid protocol.Raut, who was seen without a mask at an event in Nashik, said that he was merely emulating Modi. “Our Prime Minister asks everyone to use masks, but does not wear one himself. So, we listen to the Prime Minister and do not use one,” said Raut, adding that Modi was not seen wearing a mask at public events and international engagements. By contrast, his party president and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray always masked himself in public, Raut stressed. In the same breath, Raut said that Covid-19 and Omicron cases are rising steadily and that this has led to restrictions being imposed at night. He said that if similar restrictions are imposed during the day, it would affect the economic cycle of the state.Raut also agreed with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar’s statement that the BJP had made overtures to him to form a government in Maharashtra in 2019 and added that the BJP was ‘desperate’ to be in power. The Shiv Sena leader said that they were in the loop about these developments and “at that time, there were no secrets between us.” “There was transparency even in (deputy chief minister) Ajit Pawar’s (early morning) swearing in (with former chief minister and incumbent leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis),” Raut said, while refusing to elaborate further.Reacting to Raut’s comments, BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar lambasted him for seeking publicity through his statements. “He is just interested in seeking publicity,” said the BJP MLA.Sharad Pawar on Wednesday in Pune said that he was approached by PM Modi for an alliance in Maharashtra in 2019 and that he clearly told the Prime Minister that it was not possible. “It was his (Narendra Modi’s) wish that we (NCP and BJP) should come together. However, I went to his office and told him it was not possible. I told him that I do not want to keep him in the dark. Our stand is different,” Pawar recalled during an event organised by Marathi daily newspaper Loksatta in Pune.When asked about the Prime Minister’s reaction to his response, the NCP chief said that PM Modi asked him to “think over it”. “He (Prime Minister) might have thought that by forming this alliance, they could have formed a stable government in Maharashtra,” Pawar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sanjay-raut-criticises-pm-modi-for-not-wearing-mask-101640891322373.html
31-12-2021||Noida||Noida: Farmers to continue protest against authority if all demands not met||The agitation of the farmers, who have been protesting against the Noida authority to press their demands for better compensation and additional benefits in lieu of the land they have given for development, entered the 121st day on Thursday, with farmers reiterating that they will not call off their agitation till all their demands are met.Top officials are having detailed discussions with the farmers to pursue them to end the agitation, which has disrupted work at the authority’s main administrative building in Noida’s Sector 6, the spot where the farmers have stayed put since September 1 to compel the authority to accept their demands.A series of discussions ensued between the officials of the Noida authority and the farmers from Thursday morning to evening. The authority agreed on some of the demands but refused proposals, such as hiked compensation and residential plots in addition to what the farmers have already been given. Farmers have demanded 64% more compensation for their land, settlement of Abadi land, residential plots, unregulated development of buildings in villages, leaseback of land to farmers among other issues.“So far, the authority has not accepted all our demands. If they do not accept all our demands, we will not end our agitation and continue to protest come what may,” said Sukhbir Yadav, founder president of Bharatiya Kisan Parishad who is leading the protest.Farmers from 80 villages are extending their support to the agitation and attending the protest in large numbers.At least 12 farmers have launched a fast unto death at the Sector 6 protest ground and have refused to end the fast till all the issues are resolved.“The authority should accept all demands because most of the farmers in 80 villages, who gave their land for development of the city, are in a serious economic crisis because. Their means of livelihood are limited with the authority not giving us plots and not settling the Abadi issue,” said Rinku Chauhan, a farmer from Nagli Wazidpur.The authority is ready to settle the Abadi issue as per the demands of the farmers, letting farmers build houses as per their needs without building regulations but are not agreeing to the demand of additional compensation.“Our negotiations are in the final stage and we hope the protest will end tomorrow (Friday),” said Praveen Mishra, additional CEO of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-farmers-to-continue-protest-against-authority-if-all-demands-not-met-101640891320922.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana told to check pollution in river Yamuna||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has directed Haryana to take immediate steps to stop untreated industrial and domestic effluent being discharged into river Yamuna.The directions were issued under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. As per the letter (HT has a copy of which) the CPCB chairman has directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to ensure 100% treatment of sewage and industrial effluents by providing adequate infrastructure in a time-bound manner in compliance with the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and submit the compliance report.The state was also told to enhance monitoring frequency of drains, river Yamuna, industries, sewage treatment plants (STPs), common effluent treatment plants (CETPs), and strict enforcement of discharge norms should be initiated against the violators under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.The state was also directed to carry out random inspections of polluting industries in the catchment area of river Yamuna and identify violating industries to impose environmental compensation.“The criminal proceedings also be initiated against such violators with an effective surveillance and directions should be issued to all district magistrates to prevent unauthorised disposal of septic tank waste in drains and river Yamuna,” reads the letter.It emphasised that all authorities of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh should coordinate with each other to resolve the spike in ammoniacal nitrogen and phosphate surfactants in Yamuna.The untreated effluent being discharged into Yamuna from Karnal’s Indri block is a major source of pollution in the river water. As per reports, around 70 million litre untreated effluent is coming from the industrial city of Yamunanagar and mixes in Yamuna near Nabipur village via Dhanaura escape canal.Even as the issue was highlighted in almost all monthly meetings of the River Rejuvenation Committee, as of now, there is nothing visible on ground to check the flow of toxic water into the river.The status report of the implementation of river action plans submitted in the monthly meeting on November 2, highlighted that the sewage generation in the industrial cities is much higher than the quantum of sewage reaching up to STPs, “as in Yamunanagar 29.30 MLD sewage was generated but the actual discharge reaching the STPs was 43.70 MLD. And in Panipat, the actual discharge reaching to the STPs was 42MLD against the 81.80 MLD sewage generated”.“Also, of total 59 STPs in the Yamuna catchment, only six STPs have been upgraded and rest do not meet the prescribed standards. Only 21 STPs are complying even though the deadlines for most STPs have already expired,” reads the report.HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “We have issued strict directions to all departments and officials concerned for compliance.”He said almost all the points (focused in the letter) are included in the river action plans that are being implemented and getting reviewed at the state-level. He said the action taken report will soon be submitted to the CPCB.

Mishra worked as secretary, union ministry of housing and urban affairs and was repatriated to state cadre for appointment as UP’s chief secretary on Wednesday. He was due to retire on December 31, 2021 and has been given one year’s extension now. Tiwari, who has been empanelled for deputation to the Centre, has been placed on the waiting list. “Uttar Pradesh is going to have elections. After coming from New Delhi, my first meeting was with the Election Commission of India. The ECI has expressed concern in view of the prevailing situation on the Covid front. I have assured the ECI of free, fair and peaceful election,” said Mishra while speaking to media persons after assuming charge as the new chief secretary. Mishra said he would work to achieve 100 percent vaccination and ensure that the Covid curfew was implemented and all the Covid protocols were followed. Replying to a question, he said the SMART Cities mission was being implemented in 10 cities of the state and his endeavour would be to turn the same into a movement. “We will convert the mission to a movement,” said Mishra. “There has been a wave of change in the past seven years and Uttar Pradesh too has moved forward. For me this responsibility is service. I am thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath for giving me this opportunity to serve again in the state where I was born and brought up,” he said. Mishra spoke about the work he did as union secretary, housing and urban affairs and said he would promote affordable rental housing scheme in the state.

31-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC to take up construction of Dahisar-Bhayander Link road from MMRDA after a 5-year hiatus||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is all set to take up the construction of the much anticipated Dahisar-Bhayander Link Road from next year, after a five year long hiatus.At present there is no direct motorable road between Dahisar and Mira Road and Bhayander and commuters traveling in this route have to take a 10-km long traverse through the Western Express Highway (WEH). The project was proposed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) back in 2016. However, in the last five years the project didn’t see the light of the day. The Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC) had also written to this agency back in March 2018, urging them to initiate construction work.Meanwhile, considering the delay, the responsibility of this project was transferred to the BMC on December 16. According to the preliminary proposal of this project, the road will be 45-metre wide and of the total 4.5 km stretch, 1.5-km will be within the BMC area and 3-km will be within the jurisdiction of the MBMC.The cost of the project has been pegged at ₹3,096 crores. The BMC also stated that after the completion of this project the money spent on the construction in the MBMC area will be reimbursed to the BMC by the MMRDA.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects) said that fresh tenders will be floated in 2022 and the construction works will start by June next year.“We are eyeing a four year long deadline for this project. This road will be a missing link between the two cities and will ease commute time by a significant margin and will benefit more than ten lakh commutters that travel to and fro from Mira-Bhayander to Mumbai daily. This link road will also decongest the traffic at the WEH,” Velrasu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-take-up-construction-of-dahisar-bhayander-link-road-from-mmrda-after-a-5-year-hiatus-101640891140976.html
31-12-2021||Noida||Noida restaurants demand increased operating hours for New Year’s eve||After the election commission announced an extra hour for polling during the Uttar Pradesh elections early next year, the hospitality industry has demanded the same treatment for restaurants.Owners of several restaurants in Noida said night curfews imposed by various states lead to restaurants suffering the heaviest losses. They said that if extra time can be given for polling, similar logic should work for restaurants.“Just as cases started to increase, a night curfew was imposed. The food and beverage (F&B) sector, especially restaurants, are worst-affected, as most of our business comes from dinner meals, which reduces considerably if people have to leave by 10pm or 11pm. Shops can still work as they shut before the night curfew, but we face heavy losses. If extending timing while ensuring social distancing works for elections, it is only fair to allow the same for restaurants too,” said Varun Khera, head of the Noida chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI).Restaurant owners also said that it is easier to ensure social distancing and follow other guidelines at restaurants than at an election rally or in queues for polling. “The F&B industry just recovered and learned how to deal with Covid-19. We comply with Covid-19 guidelines, but are still at the mercy of the government whereas this is not applicable to elections. That is just not fair. The government also needs to think about the economic aspects of such measures,” said Mainak Aggarwal, director, Feast & Fizzy Hospitality Pvt Ltd.There are around 700 dine-in restaurants in Noida and Greater Noida. Owners said that they had only started seeing better business in the past three months. But the night curbs have spoiled all business that the restaurants could have seen during the Christmas and New Year’s festivities.“I appreciate the decisions the government has taken to reduce infections, but if an extension of just two hours on New Year’s Eve can bring happiness to people who want to celebrate outside, we expect them to allow it, just like an exception for the election process. We are still complying with all the guidelines issued by the government and expect a small extension,” said Ajeet Sharma, owner, Time Machine, Noida.Meanwhile, Noida traders have started promoting policies such as “no mask, no sale” and “no vaccine, no sale” in market areas. Trader organisations have asked shop owners to ensure that all customers wear masks at all times in the market. “We have also asked store owners to ask their customers to get their vaccine doses at the earliest. Some shops have already made it a policy to ensure that only those with masks enter shops and some others also give a mask to those who are not wearing one. Traders now realise that following Covid-19 protocols is extremely essential for safety as well as to ensure that there is no more lockdown that can hamper business,” said SK Jain, convener, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), and president of Sector 18 market association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-restaurants-demand-increased-operating-hours-for-new-year-s-eve-101640891081041.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana gets its own genome lab to detect Omicron variant||The Haryana health department will now be able to do in-house whole genome sequencing (WGS) for detecting coronavirus variants including Omicron in infected individuals.State health minister Anil Vij said the central government’s department of biotechnology has approved a genome sequencing lab to be set up at Rohtak’s Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU).Vij said the lab has got the certificate to operate and will soon carry out the work of WGS. The lab has been set up at MDU, Rohtak by NGO Path, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation of United States, for research in genomics.“The lab will help in faster detection of Omicron variant of coronavirus and reducing dependency on the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi,” Vij said.The minister, who held a review meeting of the health department, said Covid vaccination for children in the age group of 15 to 18 years will start from January 3. Booster doses of vaccine for healthcare and frontline workers and precaution doses for people above 60 years of age with co-morbidities will start from January 10, which will be available to the beneficiaries after completion of nine months or 39 weeks from the date of the second dose.Health officials said 15.40 lakh children will be vaccinated in Haryana. These children will be given a dose of Covaxin and for this, registration and appointment will be made through CoWin.It was informed in the meeting that self-registration can be done through existing account on CoWin or by creating a new account through a unique mobile number. In addition, appointments can be booked online or onsite (walk-in).It was informed in the meeting that the total number of healthcare and frontline workers in Haryana is about five lakh, of which, healthcare workers are around 2.50 lakh and frontline workers around 2.50 lakh. The number of people with co-morbidities above 60 years of age is about 5.78 lakh.‘Curbs necessary’Vij said in view of increase in coronavirus cases, he has written to the chief secretary seeking a ban on all kinds of rallies, processions, marches and gatherings. He said it is necessary to put curbs to stop crowding at public places.Former minister asks state govt to ramp up medical infrastructureMeanwhile, former Haryana minister Sampat Singh has asked the state government to immediately ramp up medical infrastructure in government hospitals to combat the impending third wave of coronavirus pandemic due to the spread of the Omicron variant.In a statement, he said the government should arrange for adequate medical and paramedical staff in all government medical facilities in rural and urban areas.Most hospitals and health centres lack ample staff and equipment including medicines, he said, adding that the government should allocate special budget to the health department to prepare for facing the third wave of the pandemic.“No posts should be vacant and all arrangements should be made to meet any eventuality,” he said.Recalling the situation during the first two waves, he said the government was caught on the wrong foot as it had failed to create adequate infrastructure in time.“The state faced an acute shortage of beds, ICUs, medicines and oxygen supplies. Doctors and paramedics were hurriedly transferred from rural health centres to cities leaving the rural population to fend for themselves. This should not be repeated,” the former minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-gets-its-own-genome-lab-to-detect-omicron-variant-101640890961973.html
31-12-2021||Noida||Another sarus crane dies in Dhanauri wetlands, third fatality in a week||An adult sarus crane was found dead at Dhanauri wetlands in Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday evening, five days after a bird of the same breed was found dead and another found unconscious on December 25.  Dhanauri wetland is a major habitat for sarus crane in Dankaur, Gautam Buddh Nagar. Sarus crane is a vulnerable species listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). District forest officer P K Srivastava said, “We received a call from a local who found the body of the adult sarus crane at Dhanauri on Wednesday evening. Forest rangers took the bird to the veterinary hospital in Dankaur, where it was declared dead on arrival. A post mortem of the bird is being conducted to find out the cause of death.” On December 25, a five-month-old sarus crane was found dead and another found unconscious at the Dhanauri wetlands. While the sarus crane which was alive was given due treatment, it died later in the hospital, taking the death toll to two.“Their post-mortem reports revealed Salmonella infection (bacterial infection) as the cause of death. The chicks found dead showed symptoms of puffed feathers, swollen eyelids and lethargy. The adult sarus found dead on Wednesday could be their parent. More details will be clear once all the post-mortem reports are available, after which the forest department will take necessary action,” said Srivastava.Anand Arya, a Noida-based birder who was among the first ones to have found the wetland in 2014 and initiated the legal battle for its recognition, said the wetland needs immediate conservation.“The death of the birds is very alarming and hints to food poisoning or pesticide poisoning. If the site had been recognised as a Ramsar site, the wetland would have been more protected and such incidents could have been avoided,” said Arya. Ramsar sites are the wetlands of international importance.He added, “The forest department is yet to submit an application proposing Dhanauri as a Ramsar site and it has been delayed by over seven years. So far, they did not even submit the detailed study to the Ramsar secretariat to make a case for it.” To this, Srivastava said, “Applying for Ramsar Site recognition is a lengthy process and requires a lot of paperwork as well as ground work. The forest department is working on the same and status of the proposal will be shared soon”.The official count of sarus crane at the 101-hectare Dhanauri wetland is 120. The sarus crane has also been recognised as the state bird of Uttar Pradesh.Other than Dhanauri, the sarus cranes are found in various small fields and marshes of the district , such as like Khodna Khurd, Ishapur, Dhanauri, Rawani Bujurg, Parsaul and Nagla Bhatona.
31-12-2021||Mumbai||13 months on, MVA govt. awaits Governor’s decision on appointment of 12 MLCs||MUMBAI: Twelve seats of the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) have been lying vacant for the last 17 months. Despite over a year having passed since the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government recommended 12 names to be appointed as MLCs on the vacant seats, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is yet to take a decision on these recommendations.It was on November 6, 2020 that the state government approved 12 names and sent it to the governor for appointment. The 12 names included: Vijay Karanjkar, Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi from the Shiv Sena; Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Yashpal Bhinge and Anand Shinde from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and Rajni Patil, Sachin Sawant, Anniruddha Vankar and Muzaffar Hussain from the Congress.Out of the 78 members of the state legislative council, 12 are nominated by the governor on the recommendation of the state government. These members are expected to be from different fields such as the arts, literature, sports, cooperation and social service.Koshyari’s indecision has led to major friction between Raj Bhavan and the tripartite MVA government with Koshyari and the MVA leaders engaged in a war of words on several occasions. The matter was followed up by the state government when three months ago on September 1, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray led a three-member delegation to meet Koshyari and formally request him to take a decision. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who was part of the delegation along with state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat told reporters outside Raj Bhavan after their meeting with Koshyari, “We requested the governor to see if the decision is taken early as it would be helpful for the government when it comes to the functioning of the state legislature. We said it was our request that he accept the recommendation even though it was his right to take a decision.”In July, the state government submitted an affidavit before the Bombay high court (HC) stating that the power of the governor to make these nominations does not fall in the category of discretionary powers conferred on the occupant of the top constitutional office. “It has been specifically submitted in the said communication (recommendation of 12 names as MLCs) that in the larger public interest and from the point of view of a healthy democracy as also the rich traditions that are meticulously observed in this regard, it is necessary to fill in these 12 vacant positions at the earliest,” the affidavit said. “The governor was requested to complete the process of nominating the 12 persons as MLCs at the earliest and at the most within 15 days,” the affidavit added. Significantly, the Bombay HC observed that the governor was constitutionally obligated to either accept or reject the proposal sent by the state government for appointing 12 legislators within a reasonable time.It’s been four months since the HC made this observation on August 13 while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the delay in making the appointments.Constitutional experts are of the opinion that the appointments should have been made soon after the recommendations were made as it is binding on the governor to accept the advice of the council of ministers according to the constitution. They are also of the view that the President can be approached for the governor’s removal over dereliction of constitutional duties.According to Ulhas Bapat, a constitutional expert, the position of the council of ministers and the governor is very clear in the constitution. Just like Article 74 of the constitution under which the advice of the Prime Minister is binding on the President, the advice of the chief minister is also binding on the governor under Article 163 of the constitution. The only difference in the case of the governor is of discretionary powers provided to the governor but they too are for implementing the constitutional duties and not for personal discretion.“For instance, the governor has been given special responsibilities by the constitution which are specified between articles 371 and 371H where the chief minister’s advice is not binding on him. Except these, in all the remaining matters, the chief minister’s advice is binding on the governor. Thus, the appointment is purely the right of the state government and should have been made with immediate effect,” Bapat told Hindustan Times.On his part, Sudhir Mungantiwar, former finance minister and senior BJP leader defended Koshyari’s stand saying that it is not binding on the governor to clear the appointments in the specific time period. Also, the Bombay high court did not direct Koshyari to take a decision in a specific time frame. “The high court did not prescribe any time frame as it is not in their jurisdiction to direct the governor to take the decision in a limited time. There are thousands of cases where the Bombay high court issues directives to the state government but they are not followed by the state government for years,” he commented.Meanwhile, a query sent to the governor’s secretary Santosh Kumar and public relations office (PRO) on November 30 is yet to receive any response. They were asked if the governor has raised any query, which is not addressed by the state government leading to the delay.
31-12-2021||Gurugram||Long queues continue outside Metro stations in Gurugram for second day in a row||Long queues were witnessed outside Metro stations in Gurugram on Thursday for the second consecutive day, as the Delhi Metro functioned “at less than 10% of its capacity”.A statement released by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday reads, “With the new Covid guidelines in place, the permitted capacity is down to 200 passengers for an eight-coach Metro train from 2,400 passengers in general. This comprises approximately 50 seating passengers and 250 standing passengers per coach. With the present restrictions of 50% seating and no standing, each Metro coach can now accommodate nearly 25 passengers. This is less than 10% of a Metro train’s normal carrying capacity.”According to figures, a Metro train has a carrying capacity of 8.33% now.The statement Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communications, DMRC, reads, “Therefore, people must travel only if absolutely essential. Also, keep extra time in your commute by the Metro as the entry point has to be regulated to ensure compliance with the guidelines, which is resulting in queues outside stations.” On Thursday, long queues were witnessed during office hours outside the Huda City Centre Metro station in the morning and in the evening. Other Metro stations like Iffco Chowk and Guru Dronacharya among others did not witness long queues, and the movement of commuters was normal even with 50% of the gates being functional. Seema, a commuter waiting at the Huda City Centre Metro station, said on Thursday evening, “With the new restrictions, the wait before travelling has increased by at least half an hour. If the restrictions are in place, the authorities must also ensure that people standing in queues maintain social distancing, but that is not happening. Norms are only being followed inside the trains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/long-queues-continue-outside-metro-stations-in-gurugram-for-second-day-in-a-row-101640890782697.html

31-12-2021||Noida||38 fresh Covid cases emerge in Noida, 80% more cases than a day before||Noida reported 38 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, an 80% jump from the 21 cases reported a day ago on Wednesday. This is also the highest daily count of cases in the past seven months. The last time the daily caseload crossed 30 in Gautam Budh Nagar district was June 7 when 34 cases were recorded on a single day. While the absolute number of total cases is not high compared to the total population, the number of cases increased from single digits to over 30 every day in less than a month. According to the health department, the maximum number of cases was reported from the urban areas of Bisrakh, followed by Dankaur. Dadri and Jewar areas reported very few cases. With around 3,500 tests being conducted in the district, the daily positivity rate in the district crossed 1%.Around 61,000 tests have been conducted in Noida so far this month. The number of active cases in the district is now 135--the highest in Uttar Pradesh. While 134 patients are in home isolation, one patient is admitted at the Noida Covid Hospital. So far, 200 cases have been added to the tally in December. This is already three times the number of cases reported last month--61-- and the highest monthly count in the last six months.There were around 640 cases reported in the district in June, the number reduced to around 165 in July. The number of cases reduced steadily until November, when they started picking up again.The 38 cases added on Thursday included one woman who travelled from the United Kingdom. Her samples were collected on December 27, eight days after her travel,and they tested positive. However, she was tested again on Thursday, and had recovered by then. Health officials have asked her to stay in home isolation for the next seven days, after which she will be tested again. Health officials said that all arrangements to tackle the rise in cases are in place. “The number of cases is going to increase further as data across the state shows. The third wave of the pandemic is here. However, we are not worried as all our arrangements are already in place and need to be reactivated as the demand for health infrastructure increases. We upgraded all our smaller centres as well with medical kits and increased testing. Since most of our population is fully vaccinated, the infections are also mild and very few need hospitalisation,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer. The state reviewed the Covid-19 preparations of all districts through a video conference on Thursday and asked them to prepare a list of all available hospitals with oxygen beds. The districts have to fill a Google sheet with details of all hospitals as well as sample collection centres and their operation timings. The data is also supposed to be uploaded on the ‘Mera Covid Kendra’ app. The state has also asked districts to ensure that all oxygen plants are functional and can run for at least 4-6 hours at a time. Districts have to also distribute about 50 medical kits to all nigrani samitis and smaller healthcare centres as per demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/38-fresh-covid-cases-emerge-in-noida-80-more-cases-than-a-day-before-101640890720910.html

31-12-2021||Mumbai||BMC completes 2km of tunnel boring for coastal road project||MUMBAI The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday said that it has completed 2km of tunnel boring for its ambitious Mumbai Coastal Road Project (MCRP) on December 29. The 10.58 km long coastal road originates near the Princess Street flyover at Marine Drive and will connect to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL) at Worli. As part of this project, the BMC is constructing two 2.7 km long underground tunnels that will run parallely between Priyadarshini Park (PDP) and Girgaon Chowpatty. The tunnels will run 75 metre below the surface at Malabar Hill and 25 metre below the surface at Girgaon.For carrying out the boring of these tunnels, the BMC has procured the largest tunnel boring machine (TBM) of the country which has a diameter of 12.2 metre and named it Mavala. The boring for the first tunnel began on January 11 this year and on December 29 the BMC completed boring of 2km of the first tunnel. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Vijay Nighot, chief engineer of the project, said that boring of the remaining 70 metre will be finished within the first week of January.Earlier on September 4, 2021, the BMC finished boring the first 1km of this tunnel. “It took us nearly eight months to bore the first 1km while the remaining 1km was completed within just four months. The second phase of work started after monsoon and the second wave had also receded by that time due to which the pace of the project picked up,” said Nighot.After boring of the first tunnel gets completed, the tunnel will be taken out at the Girgaon end. Thereafter, digging of the second tunnel will start parallel from there which will be taken out at PDP. Nighot added that boring for the second tunnel will start in March 2022 and end by December 2022.“The second tunnel will be dug in the same manner as the first one. It usually takes eight to nine months to finish the entire digging. Due to the restrictions imposed following the second wave in early 2021, the deadline got delayed by a few months,” Nighot said.The entire MCRP is divided into four packages and the tunneling works fall under the fourth package. Each of the tunnels will have four lane roads that will enable traffic movement from both ways. Nighot said that preparations for construction of roads inside the tunnels have already been done simultaneously with the boring process.The BMC in a statement released on Thursday also said that 50% of the entire MCRP project has been completed, including the reclamation works. The construction works for this project started in 2018 and a 48-month deadline was set up back then. But owing to the pandemic and various other legal issues, the project got delayed and the current deadline of the project is December 2023. The budget for this project including the construction works has been pegged at ₹12,950 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-completes-2km-of-tunnel-boring-for-coastal-road-project-101640890660898.html
31-12-2021||Kolkata||Bengal may register up to 35,000 Covid-19 cases daily: Experts||KOLKATA: West Bengal may face community transmission of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Covid-19 in coming weeks and the daily count of cases may hit 30,000-35,000 during the peak of a possible third wave, doctors of the state health department warned after a meeting on Wednesday. “Omicron cases are not fatal but are spreading fast and Covid-19 cases have shot up, particularly in and around Kolkata. There is no need to panic. We are reviewing the situation. I would request every citizen to wear a mask, sanitise and maintain social distance,” said Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal. At Wednesday’s meeting, attended by bureaucrats and senior doctors of the state health department, evidence of “local transmission” of Omicron in the state was cited. Five more Omicron cases were reported on Thursday, raisiing the total Omicron cases in West Bengal to 16.“A few persons were found positive for Omicron without any travel or contact history, suggesting community transmission,” said a doctor who attended the meeting. The daily count of cases shot up to 4,157 when the peak of the first wave hit the state in late October 2020. The second wave was worse, as the daily count touched 20,846 in mid-May. “As the Omicron variant spreads 3-5 times faster, cases may increase manifold in the next one week. This time, we may expect 30,000-35,000 cases every day in the coming weeks. Hopefully the surge would not persist beyond April 22,” a doctor was quoted as saying at the meeting. Also Read | Mamata mulls shutting schools, colleges as Covid-19 cases rise in BengalBanerjee on Wednesday hinted the government may reintroduce containment zones in Kolkata, reduce the number of local trains, restart work from home and close down schools and colleges to check the spread. “The maximum number of Covid-19 cases is being detected among passengers coming from the UK. If there is one Omciron case in the flight, there are chances of spread to other passengers. We are reviewing the situation. We have to check what the civil aviation ministry is doing. The Centre should take a decision,” she said. She added the running of local trains was also being reviewed. The government has tightened surveillance of international fliers landing in Kolkata. Fresh guidelines have been issued on contact tracing and re-testing of international travellers coming to Kolkata. “While passengers need to undergo RT-PCR tests after landing at the Kolkata airport, the contact tracing cell of each district and the civic body in Kolkata will contact and remind each passenger for re-test on the 8th day. There would be follow-ups. If the passenger is found to be positive, the samples would be sent for genome sequencing. Home isolation of 14 days would be advised if found to be negative,” said an official.As many as 752 cases of Covid-19 were reported on Tuesday. The daily count crossed the 1000-mark a day later. The daily count has doubled over the last two weeks. The maximum number of cases, around 380, was reported from Kolkata on Tuesday.The government relaxed the night curfew from December 24 to January 1 in view of the Christmas and New Year celebrations. It is also gearing up for the Ganga Sagar Mela, which is scheduled to begin on January 14. Millions of pilgrims from across India would take the holy dip at the confluence of the River Ganges and Bay of Bengal on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on January 15. “We cannot stop any pilgrim from coming to the Mela,” said Banerjee. In view of rising concerns over the Omicron variant, the Centre has sent special multi-disciplinary teams to 10 states and Union territories, including West Bengal, which are either reporting a higher number of infections or have a low pace of vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-may-register-up-to-35-000-covid-19-cases-daily-experts-101640890480969.html
31-12-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad breathed better air than last two years, shows govt data||Ghaziabad experienced better air this year, when the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) came into effect, compared to the last two years as data from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) shows that the city fared better in several parameters which measure the amount of pollutants in the air. The Grap is generally put into effect from October 15 every year to tackle the rise in air pollution levels with the help of pollution abatement measures. It is generally in place till the February of next year. According to official records of the UPPCB, which has measured the data for the first 75 days of the Grap from October 15 to December 28, the average air quality index (AQI) in the city stood at 346 in 2019, 351 in 2020 and 323 this year. The average PM2.5 levels in the city for the corresponding period was 233 in 2019, 234 in 2020 and 202 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) this year. Though the PM2.5 levels were lower this year, it was still thrice the standard limit of 60mpcm. Official data showed that the average PM10 levels stood at 344 mpcm till December 28 this year compared to 384 mpcm last year and 346 mpcm in 2019. The standard limit for PM10 is 100mpcm. “The city has fared better in several air quality parameters this year though the AQI remained in the ‘severe’ category for 10 days during the post-Diwali period. The better performance of the city in the air quality parameters is the result of meteorological conditions as well as local enforcement. We have been able to reduce instances of garbage burning and stubble burning this year while projects, such as the Delhi Meerut Expressway, which increased pollution levels, has also got completed,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. “Water sprinkling and mechanised road sweeping was also doubled post Diwali and repair of broken and dusty roads were also expedited,” he added. Despite the better air quality records, the AQI of Ghaziabad has been oscillating from ‘severe’ to ‘poor’ category since October 26, when the city witnessed its last ‘moderate’ air. On Thursday too, the city experienced ‘poor’ air with an AQI reading of 268 according to the AQI index released by the Central Pollution Control Board. The AQI for Greater Noida was 166 in the ‘moderate’ category while Noida too was in the ‘poor’ zone with an AQI of 222. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe.’ However, environmentalists said the data was not indicative of the action being taken at the ground level to curb pollution in Ghaziabad. “The sting in enforcement is lacking while the figures itself indicate that average PM10 and PM2.5 levels are already three times higher than the standard limits. A slight dip in levels does not indicate that city has become pollution-free. Further, during a major part of the Grap period, residents had to breathe ‘severe’ to ‘poor’ air, thus impacting their health. So, there is hardly any improvement even if there is a marginal decline in air quality parameters,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. According to officials, Ghaziabad is listed among the 16 ‘non-attainment cities’ in Uttar Pradesh, with high levels of air pollution. Cities are declared ‘non-attainment’ if they do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter (PM10) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a period of five years.
31-12-2021||Delhi||North Delhi’s TB hospital building in dangerous state: Atishi||After conducting a surprise inspection at Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis Hospital on Thursday, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation (North MCD) of “playing with the lives of Delhiites” and “providing treatment to patients in the dangerous building of the hospital”.Refuting the allegations, the North MCD and the BJP said that only the building’s front portion has recently been declared dangerous, while three-fourths of the building that houses the hospital’s wards are safe and habitable.After the inspection, the AAP legislator said that the hospital’s building can collapse at any time and take numerous lives. “The BJP leaders have such a lust for money that they have left patients to die while being fully aware of the North MCD hospital’s fatal conditions. Everyone can see that the North MCD has itself written in front of the building ‘This building is hazardous, do not proceed ahead’. The structure is in a dangerous condition and has been designated as such. Though the building is on the verge of collapse, patients are being kept in this very building. Even the wards of the hospital are in a horrible state. If it is any indication, the BJP leaders are not only corrupt, but they also do not regret abandoning the people of Delhi,” she said.Atishi also said that only patients in a poor economic situation prefer to go to this hospital. “What if this building comes crashing down? And, we don’t forget that only poor people, the ones who cannot afford to go to private hospitals, visit the state-run hospitals nowadays. I’d like to ask BJP leaders why they despise the people of Delhi so much,” she said.Refuting the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, said that this was nothing more than AAP’s petty politics to malign the image of Rajan Babu TB Hospital that has won accolades for serving TB patients not only of Delhi but across North India.“In her video statement, the AAP MLA tried to portray that wards of North MCD’s Rajan Babu TB Hospital are being run from a dangerous building. Contrary to that, only the front portion of a building, which is actually a covered verandah, has recently been declared dangerous. The remaining three-fourths of the building that houses wards are safe and habitable,” he said.Echoing Kapoor’s views, Jogi Ram Jain, the chairman of the standing committee of North MCD, said that the areas shown in the video issued by Atishi, also show that the wards have a well-maintained structure. “It is a mere political stunt to hog headlines as the patients’ attendants interviewed by her in the video also expressed satisfaction over the treatment being provided at the hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-delhi-s-tb-hospital-building-in-dangerous-state-atishi-101640890422086.html

31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Another jolt for Punjab Cong, Lalli Majithia quits as Pungrain chief||Amritsar: In another jolt to the Congress in the Majha belt of Punjab, senior party leader Sukhjinder Raj Singh, alias Lalli Majithia, who fought three assembly elections against Shiromani Akali Dal’s Bikram Singh Majithia, on Thursday resigned from the post of the chairman-cum-director, Punjab State Grains Procurement Corporation Limited (Pungrain). He sent his resignation letter to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and later said that he has been upset over the Punjab government’s working on two major issues — sacrilege and drugs. He said the registration of a first information report (FIR) against Bikram Singh Majithia was merely an eyewash. “Has he gone underground? The government is deliberately not arresting him,” Lalli Majithia alleged. In the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections, he said he would consider resigning from the Congress at an “appropriate time” and joining another party in the coming days. It is learnt that he is likely to join the BJP. Political analysts observe that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) might also try to bring Lalli into its fold.Lali had given tough fight to Bikram Majithia during the last 2017 elections. A veteran Congress leader, Lalli, has been vocal against Bikram Majithia for his alleged involvement in drug smuggling.In June, former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, in a move to counter the Majha brigade, appointed Lalli as the chairman of Pungrain. The post had fallen vacant after the death of former chief secretary YS Ratra in April. The Majha brigade, comprising cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa along with some MLAs, had joined hands with the dissidents against Captain.Lalli resignation comes just two days after Congress sitting MLAs Fateh Jung Bajwa from Qadian and Balwinder Singh Laddi from Shri Hargobindpur (reserved) joined the BJP in Delhi. Fateh Jung is the younger brother of former Punjab Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa. Laddi also belongs to the Bajwa camp. Last week, former minister and four-time Guru Har Sahai MLA Rana Gurmeet Sodhi joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/another-jolt-for-punjab-cong-lalli-majithia-quits-as-pungrain-chief-101640890362125.html
31-12-2021||Gurugram||No celebrations allowed after 11pm on December 31 amid rise in coronavirus cases||Gurugram, which was scheduled to host a large number of parties, will ring in the New Year in a toned down manner due to the surge in Covid-19 cases and the increasing spread of the new Omicron variant. Most pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants cancelled their events and refunded their table booking after a guideline implementing a curfew from 11pm to 5am was issued by the state on December 24.Gurugram reported 180 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, said health officials, taking the tally to 660 active cases.The police department said that around 4,000 policemen will be deployed across Gurugram on Friday night to maintain law and order.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said police will strictly implement curfew between 11pm and 5am due to the rise in Covid-19 cases and that all establishments organising parties on New Year’s Eve have been instructed to comply. “We have informed all establishments to cancel their programmes and ensure they follow all Covid-19 protocols. People can celebrate at home with precautions. Residents can party outdoors with a limited number of people, but have to wind up before 11pm. Strict action will be taken against anyone caught outside after 11pm,” he said.Rao said they have urged the public to remain at home and to not violate the orders issued by the state. With the current situation the cases might go up and there could be a possibility of a complete lockdown, he said.More than 60 barricades have been set up across the city and teams have been formed to keep a check on the vehicular movements. There will be maximum deployment of police at Sirhaul border as that is the most common route between Delhi and Gurugram. Police said Delhi residents would be travelling to Gurugram to attend parties, and with the curfew measures in place, they could try to reach in the early evening, which could result in traffic congestion.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said that their focus is to keep people safe and to ensure they are not gathering in large numbers. “Our teams are deployed near all establishments where the footfall is high during celebration times. There is a cap on gatherings and all outlets have to ensure social distancing and not to allow anyone who is not fully vaccinated,” he said.Yadav said teams are deployed at popular hotspots on Golf Course Road, Sohna Road, Golf Course Extension Road, MG Road, Sector 29 and at all borders connecting to Delhi.The owners of these establishments said that they support the initiative of the government and will follow all the directions.Varun Duggal, head of Alliances at Massive Restaurants Pvt. Ltd, said that the safety of their customers is more important than business. “We are happy to close on time and reserve limited seats for our customers. All our staff have been vaccinated and we are following all directions issued by the health department,” he said.Ashish Dev Kapoor, founder, Whisky Samba, said it is a good decision for all and they are happy to follow all guidelines that have been issued by the government. “We are taking care of all precautionary measures at all our outlets to ensure people are safe and enjoy, while maintaining social distance,” he said.Chirag Gehlot, one of the members of Central Park Resort, said that they have cancelled the New Year’s Eve event. “We will be hosting residents at the club and will take the last order at 10pm so that the staff can also reach home before 11pm,” he said.

31-12-2021||Noida||Noida: 18, including five women, arrested for CTET exam fraud||The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Thursday arrested 18 people, including five women, from a hotel in Noida’s Sector 71 for their alleged involvement in leaking solved question papers of the Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET). Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Noida, said a police team was patrolling Sector 58 early Thursday morning when they spotted a Maruti Suzuki Eeco in Noida’s Sector 60. “The police team checked the vehicle and found five men in the car. The police also found some women’s purses in the vehicle. The car occupants said the purses belonged to some women, who were putting up at a guest house in Noida’s Sector 71,” he said. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) of Noida, said the police team suspected foul play and conducted a search at the guest house. “The police found 19 people, including five women there. We recovered three laptops, one keyboard, one printer, 20 mobile phones, 50 admit cards of CBSE’s CTET exams--which were scheduled on December 30, ₹36,000 in cash, five cars-- a Mahindra Fortuner, Maruti Swift Dzire, Mahindra XUV 500, Maruti Suzuki Baleno and a Maruti Suzuki Eeco,” said Singh.The suspects were identified as Rajesh Kumar (35) from Jagatpuri in New Delhi; Bhavani Sharma (45), (retired constable from CRPF) from Rajasthan; Shiv Ram Singh (32), (serving head constable in CRPF); Vikas (30), (assistant sub-inspector in Delhi police), from Haryana, Sunil Kumar (30), from Palwal in Haryana and others. A suspect, identified as Ravi, managed to escape from the spot. “Ravi fled with a pen drive which had the question paper. We have launched a search to arrest him,” said Singh. Police said on Thursday, the CBSE had organised CTET examinations at Mathura, Moradabad, Gurugram and other cities. “There was no exam centre in Noida. However, these suspects had gathered in Noida to exchange the solved paper and then appear in the exam,” said Singh. Police said during interrogation, the suspects revealed they were involved in such activities for the last five years. “They used to charge ₹2.5-3 lakh per candidate to share the solved papers. We will write to the CBSE to probe the matter,” said Singh. Police said two other suspects--Vinay Dhaiya and Ankit Kumar of Sonipat, who are the masterminds of the racket--are on the run. Rama Sharma, a spokesperson of CBSE, did not respond to calls and messages for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-18-including-five-women-arrested-for-ctet-exam-fraud-101640890123012.html
31-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sahitya Akademi Award to Khalid Hussain brings cheer in Punjabi circles||CHANDIGARH: “I have been writing for the past 50 years and my stories have been widely read and translated but this recognition, even if it took a long time to come, has brought me happiness,” Khalid Hussain, 77, told HT on the phone from Jammu. As the news of the award spread on Thursday, the Punjabi literati warmed up sharing joy over this well-deserved award that took away the December chill. He has been given the award for his collection of stories: “Sullan da Saalan”, which takes its title from a “kafi” by the Sufi poet Shah Husain.Hailing the genre of Hussain, poet and prose writer Manmohan, who wrote the introduction to the award-winning book, says: “He is a rare writer who can travel with ease from the realistic to the surrealistic. His understanding of the undivided Punjab before Partition is unparalleled. Each story in this book is a work of art.” Leading Punjabi short fiction writer Gurmeet Karyalvi says: “It is heart-warming that the Punjabi writing from Jammu and Kashmir has been given recognition by the Sahitya Akademi. Hussain has been translating the travails of the people of Jammu and Kashmir into Punjabi language with great finesse.” Hussain has borne the trial of communal politics on his body and soul. Born in 1944 in Ramnagar, a Dogri speaking area of Udhampur, he fled with his mother and father’s sister in the communal carnage in which seven male members of the family, including his grandfather, father, uncles two older brothers, were killed. The next seven years were spent in refugee camps in Jammu and Srinagar where his mother made meagre earning tailoring clothes like so many other widows of Partition.When asked why he chose to write in Punjabi and not Dogri, Hussain says: “We settled in the Ustad Mohalla in old Jammu city living among petty artisans who were all Punjabi speaking. I took my characters and the language from my surroundings although later I also wrote in Urdu.” An author of six collections of short stories, besides an autobiography, a satisfying moment came for him when celebrated poet late Ali Sardar Jafri translated his story “Baide di Lanka”, on the theme of the great divide, into Urdu and published it in the magazine “Guftagu”.

31-12-2021||Noida||UP govt rolls out guidelines for vaccinating children aged 15-18 from January 3||The Uttar Pradesh government has issued guidelines for vaccination of children aged 15-18 years from January 3 and also for senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline workers, who will be administered the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine from January 10 onwards. The government has also set targets for vaccinating beneficiaries in different groups. While Gautam Budh Nagar has a target of vaccinating 115,592 children, Ghaziabad would be vaccinating 234,488 beneficiaries in the 15-18 years cohort. According to the state guidelines, children will be administered only Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as it is the only vaccine with Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for the 15-18 years age-group and recommended by ‘Covid -19 Working Group’ of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunization. According to a report from the Union health ministry, states have been advised to form two separate vaccination teams at every vaccination centre to avoid confusion in administration of the right vaccine and ensure orientation of vaccinators on jabbing the eligible children. “To avoid the mixing up of vaccines during administration, separate CVCs (covid vaccination centres), separate session sites, separate queue (if at same session where adult vaccination is ongoing) and separate vaccination team (if at same session site) are to be strived for,” said the health ministry. Children taking the shot will have to remain under observation for half an hour to monitor adverse effects, the same as all eligible people. They will be given the second dose after 28 days.“Beneficiaries falling under the 15-18 years age group can register online through an existing account on the CoWlN portal or can register by creating a new account by using a unique mobile number. The facility for online registration will be made available from January 1. The walk-in facility and the on the spot registration at the vaccination centres will also be facilitated for such beneficiaries,” said Dr Sunil Tyagi, additional chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. “We have about 250 teams involved in the vaccination process and 50-75 teams will be there exclusively for vaccinating children in schools,” said Tyagi. In Uttar Pradesh, 1,4014,000 children in the 15-18 years category have been identified, who are eligible to take the vaccine. In fact, Uttar Pradesh has the maximum share of such beneficiaries of the total 74,057,000 children identified across the country.  “We have planned to open vaccination camps in schools for children as it will be easily accessible to them. Once majority of the children get the vaccine doses in schools, those who have been left out of the vaccination programme can visit the dedicated inoculation centres to take the jab. We are hoping our teams will be able to vaccinate maximum beneficiaries in the 15-18 years age group in two weeks,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. “We are chalking out a strategy to enhance the vaccination programme that will be undertaken from January onwards. We will dedicate counters at our vaccination centres, which will be exclusively for children. We are also trying to identify areas, where a large number of beneficiaries reside. We may come up with additional vaccination centres in such areas,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. For those who are aged over 60+ and have comorbidities, the government has set a target of vaccinating 39,660 people in Gautam Budh Nagar and 68,815 in Ghaziabad. Around 3,754,400 such beneficiaries have been identified in UP, the state with the maximum share of people aged over 60+ and having comorbidities of the total 27,514,000 such beneficiaries identified across the country.According to the state guidelines, all persons aged 60 years and above with co-morbidities and who have completed two doses of Covid vaccine should take the doctor’s advice before taking the third precaution dose. It also said that prioritisation and sequencing of this precaution dose would be based on completion of nine months (39 weeks) from the date of administration of second dose. The ministry in this regard has already said all those who are 60 years and above will not be required to produce/submit any certificate from the doctor at the time of administration of the precautionary dose but are expected to take the doctor’s advice before deciding to avail the third dose.The ministry of health and family welfare has already asked the poll-bound states to maximise vaccination in a week or fortnight and also mentioned that personnel to be deployed on election duty will be treated as front line workers as they are at a higher risk of contracting the infection. Uttar Pradesh is set to go for the assembly elections in a couple of months.

31-12-2021||Noida||Kennel owners attack man when asked to return 2 dogs, arrested||A dog kennel owner and his brother were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly attacking a 36-year-old man, when the latter asked for the two dogs he had given for boarding service three years ago in Greater Noida. The suspects have been identified as Nazim Ali (25) and his brother Nadim (23). Punit Kailash, a resident of Senior Citizen Society in Beta 2 area, said in his complaint that he had given his two dogs, of the Dobermann breed, to Nazim for boarding service in December 2018. “Back then, I was doing night shift at my office and it was difficult for me to look after the dogs. I had given the dogs for boarding for a month and paid ₹5,000. However, after a month, Nazim’s phone number was not reachable and he had also changed his address,” said Kailash. The complainant said after a lot of search, he recently got to know that Nazim was running his kennel in Gamma – 2 area in Greater Noida. “I visited his kennel and enquired about my dogs. He said that there was no such dog. This led to an argument and Nazim and his family members attacked me,” said Kailash. He was taken to a hospital for the injuries he sustained on his left eye and received five stitches on his head. Anil Kumar, station house officer of Beta 2 police station, said a case was been registered against Nazim, his brother Nadim, and their sister and mother under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “The two brothers were arrested and sent to judicial custody. The two said dogs have not been found at the boarding centre. We are investigating the matter,” said Kumar. Aman Chaudhury (19), who works with Nazim, said Kailash had come to the boarding centre with some people and created a ruckus. “He had allegedly given the two dogs three years ago and never enquired about them. Sometimes, the boarding centre gives dogs for adoption if the owner fail to turn up and claim the dogs. Nazim’s family members had come to rescue him as Kailash and his men were beating him, and this led to an unpleasant incident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/kennel-owners-attack-man-when-asked-to-return-2-dogs-arrested-101640889580666.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Deputy CM Sisodia demands funds for MCDs in next Union Budget||Like funds are allocated for other corporations in the country, the Central government should also provide the municipal corporations of Delhi with requisite funds, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said Thursday during the annual meeting of chief ministers to discuss Union Budget 2022-2023 with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The three municipal corporations of the Capital, especially the East MCD and North MCD are fund-starved and find it difficult to even give salaries to their employees on time. The fund crunch also takes a toll on their performance, particularly in cleaning the city, Sisodia said.“Due to the Covid-induced lockdown, the economic system of all states, including Delhi, has been impacted, so the Central government should pursue GST compensation. Also, for the last 21 years, Delhi has been getting only ₹325 crore out of the Central tax, now it is necessary that the Central government increase the amount. Twenty-one years ago from today, Central assistance used to be 5.14% of Delhi’s budget, which has now come down to 0.9 %,” Sisodia said. He appealed to the Centre to increase Delhi’s Central assistance to ₹2,020 crore in the next budget. “Normal Central assistance to Delhi, which was ₹370 crore in 2000-01, has been raised to only ₹626 crore in 2020-21. However, the expenditure of Delhi has increased more than nine times--from ₹7,200 crore in 2000-01 to ₹69,000 crore in 2021-22. The government of Delhi has incurred expenditure on various Covid-19-related urgent and emergent activities, which are still continuing in view of the prevailing pandemic of Covid-19. Thus, an increase in central assistance is required now,” said Sisodia. Sisodia said that the Delhi government has written a separate letter to home minister Amit Shah requesting to provide Delhi with Central assistance of ₹1,925 crore. “There are discrepancies in the allocation of funds to Delhi, which should be removed by the Central government. Before 2015, a sub-group of chief ministers was formed, it was decided that the Centre would give full money to Union Territories under a scheme of the Central government. But during implementation, Delhi is not given the 100% amount,” said Sisodia. Sisodia added that Delhi’s contribution to the country’s GDP is 4.4%, despite the fact that Delhiites constitute only 1.49% of the country’s population. “The per capita income of Delhi is three times the national average. Delhi’s per capita income is ₹3,54,004, which is about three times higher than the national average of ₹1,28,829 for 2020-21,” said Sisodia. The Fifteenth Finance Commission allocated grant-in-aid of ₹ 4,36,361 crore for local bodies for 2021-2026. “But Delhi’s local bodies were omitted from this, on the principle that only states are covered under the award scheme. The omission of Delhi’s local bodies by the Union Finance Commission on technical grounds does not help the constitutional mandate of strengthening local bodies,” said Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deputy-cm-sisodia-demands-funds-for-mcds-in-next-union-budget-101640889523922.html
31-12-2021||Delhi||Sensational killings, street crime kept Delhi on edge in 2021||Even as the national Capital endured a punishing wave of Covid-19 infection in 2021, cases of crime grew steadily recording a surge over the incidents reported last year with sensational murders and street criminals keeping the city on the edge, according to the Delhi Police data between January 1 and November 30.If the involvement of Olympic medal winner Sushil Kumar in the murder of a fellow wrestler at a city stadium exposed the dark nexus between sportspersons and property dealers, the killing of gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi inside a courtroom reminded the Capital how organised crime remained a persistent challenge for the security agencies.The city also saw desperate snatchers murdering their victims as the crime, one of the parameters of how safe the streets are for the citizens, rose to 7,645 between January 1 and November 30, compared to 6,434 incidents during the corresponding period last year, showed police data. Cases of vehicle theft, another most frequent crime in the capital, went up again after recording a rare dip last year since 2011, the data showed. A senior Delhi Police officer who asked not to be named said it would not be fair to compare the crime data from 2020 and 2021, because last year, the city was under a strict lockdown. “Besides ease in lockdown restrictions, proactive registration of cases has also been one of the reasons behind the rise in the number of crime cases,” the official said.Crimes against womenAccording to the police data, Delhi reported 1,721 rape cases this year till November 30, compared to 1,448 last year. The number of harassment cases, categorised under ‘eve teasing’ in police records, also surged to 2,193 from 1,824 last year. Among the most shocking rape cases this year was that of a Dalit minor girl who was gang-raped and murdered at a crematorium in west Delhi’s cantonment area on August 1 by four people when she had gone to fetch water from an electric cooler. Cases pertaining to persecution of women within the confines of their house also grew as incidents registered under sections pertaining to cruelty by husband recorded a hike -- from 2,052 last year to 3,221 this year, the data shows. Cases of dowry deaths went up from 96 to 116. Snatching and robberySnatching, considered as a gateway crime, continued to be one of the most frequent in the city with 7,645 cases being reported till November 30, over 6,434 last year. Desperate criminals, many of whom don’t even have a police record, targeted people, mostly women, on two-wheelers taking away gold jewellery and mobile phones. Two incidents, however, underline the limits to which such criminals are ready to go now. The first of these was reported on February, in which a woman was stabbed to death in a lane, just metres away from her house in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar even as she held her two-year-old daughter in her arms, and trying to resist two snatchers. The second was reported last week from south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar where a group of at least eight robbed two men in a lane, and beat them brutally with stones leading to the death of one of the victims. As the victim laid lifeless, the robbers took Rs3,000 from his pocket, and walked away. Vehicle theftDelhi is among the cities reporting highest cases of vehicle thefts. 2021 was no different. According to the police data, cases of vehicle thefts increased from 29,353 last year to 31,434 this year (till November 30). Records of vehicles stolen and later traced by police this year showed how far the racket has taken root. Stolen vehicles and thieves were traced as far back as Nagaland, Sikkim and Kashmir. To be sure, vehicle theft is one crime that has seen a continuous increase in Delhi since 2011. But it recorded a dip last year with cases going down to 35,019 from 46,725 in 2019.Murder/attempted murderOn November 3, a 26-year-old man allegedly tied up a 23-year-old woman, a neighbour, and threw acid on her in outer Delhi’s Bawana. The woman succumbed to her injuries two weeks later. Then, on July 7, Kitty Kumaramanglam, the wife of former Union minister PR Kumaramangalam was murdered at her Vasant Vihar house by a man who ironed clothes at lane near her house. But, the incident that even shocked the police force was the murder of gangster Gogi who was shot dead inside a courtroom during the presence of a magistrate by two assailants belonging to a rival gang. The same court was again rocked by another sensational crime when a DRDO scientist managed to take an improvised explosive device inside the court premises and exploded it in an attempt to kill a lawyer who lived in his neighbourhood. The two incidents raised serious questions over the security at districts courts in the capital, and led the police to take urgent measures to enhance security. Police speakThe Delhi Police said any comparison with a year when a nationwide lockdown and rampant restrictions on movement of people were imposed due to a pandemic is bound to be unfair. “It will erroneous comparison. If it is any indication, this year’s crime figures may have followed the trend shown in the second half of last year when there was a sharp increase in crime figures as compared to the first half. Hence there is a need to correctly analyse and interpret crime data to get the actual trends,” said Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police’s spokesperson. “Increase in the number of crimes is also to prompt and unbiased registration of cases, and a higher conversion of PCR calls into FIRs. More reporting of crime also reflects increase in the trust that the citizens have in the police that the offences will get registered and solved. This year, we have taken stern action against street crimes as a result of which arrests of criminals has also gone up by 20%. This goes a long way in reducing crime on ground,” he said. “Moreover, with dedicated investigation wings in all police stations now, investigation of crimes will get a boost to further push the conviction rates up which is a big deterrent of crime as well as a marker of justice delivery. Delhi Police is geared up for this,” he said.Rajinder Singh, former Delhi Police officer, who played a vital role in cracking the 2016 gang rape case, said 2020 and 2021 were quite different years when comes to crime in the city. “In 2020, everyone was confined at their homes due to the Covid lockdown for most part of the year, and it affected everyone, including those who committed crimes. Thus, as soon as restrictions were relaxed, the number of street crimes rose sharply as well as that of cyber frauds since people were mostly transacting their businesses online. Besides this, people who were released on parole to decongest prisons, also got involved in various cases,” he said.The Delhi Police also launched several area-specific operations to curb incidents of crime. In the outer north district, police launched the ‘hawk-eye’ operation in which the cops dressed casually and posed as street to catch street criminals. In the northwest district, police launched operation ‘Tejaswini’ to curb crime against women, and in Dwarka district, the police carried out operation ‘Varchasv’, in which the boots on the ground were increased to send a message to the criminals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sensational-killings-street-crime-kept-delhi-on-edge-in-2021-101640889400852.html

The mob battled police in the hallways and delayed the certification of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory for hours. Five people died and more than 700 people were charged in the attack.

A path of diplomacy in which Russia would use existing channels of diplomacy to resolve its issues with Ukraine.“The other is a path that’s more focused on deterrence, including serious costs and consequences should Russia choose to proceed with a further invasion of Ukraine,” the official said, adding, “And those costs include economic costs, include adjustments and augmentations of Nato force posture in Allied countries, and include additional assistance to Ukraine to enable it to further defend itself and its territory, as we’ve laid out previously.”The American leader also made clear on the call that all his actions on this issue will be taken in consultation with allies and partners on the principle of “nothing about you without you”.  “No conversations about issues that are of ultimate concern to our partners and allies without the full consultation and participation of our partners and allies,” the official said.This was the second call between the two leaders in a month and came amid rising tensions between the two countries over Russian military buildup along the border with Ukraine, which has raised the spectre of another invasion, similar to the amassing of troops that preceded the 2014 annexation of Crimea.Even as the two leaders exchanged warnings, they expressed hope and willingness to continue diplomacy between the two countries. President Biden also expressed support for diplomacy, starting early next year with the bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue, at Nato through the Nato-Russia Council, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,” Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-exchange-warnings-in-phone-call-over-ukraine-101640956487439.html

However, it warned that “given Omicron is more transmissible, we expect an increase in hospitalizations”.That result was based on comparison of 6,314 cases caused by Omicron against those caused by the Delta variant. According to the study “Omicron appears to be the first dominant variant to demonstrate a decline in disease severity,” as per the newswire Canadian Press.Those hopeful findings came as Canada was trying to cope with an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. The country reported 39,818 new infections on Thursday, according to CTV News.In attempting to deal with the spike, Canada’s worst hit province Quebec announced reimposition of an overnight curfew that will come into place on New Year’s Eve, thereby barring any celebratory gatherings.As Quebec officials forecast even higher numbers going ahead, it also closed down dining in restaurants.At the same time, noting that Omicron posed a lower risk, Ontario relaxed isolation norms for those infected. Those infected but previously vaccinated or children under 12 will be required to isolate for just five days from the onset of symptoms, according to a release from the provincial Government. This decision, it noted, was “based on growing evidence that generally healthy people with Covid-19 are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop”/However, unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or immunocompromised individuals will be required to isolate for 10 days.In a statement released on Thursday, Canada’s chief public health pfficer Dr Theresa Tam said that during the latest seven-day period from December 23 to 29, an average of 25,332 new cases were reported daily across Canada, an increase of 141% compared to the previous week. As of December 29, 2021, there have been over 34,000 cases of the Omicron variant reported in 12 provinces and territories; however, Tam added, “these cases likely represent just the tip of the iceberg”.

And whatever the challenges that fate continues to throw in our way and whatever the anxieties we may have about the weeks and months ahead, particularly about Omicron and the growing numbers in hospitals… we can say one thing with certainty – our position this December the 31st is incomparably better than last year,” said Johnson.“And as I speak tonight on New Year’s Eve, we’ve met our target, we’ve doubled the speed of the booster roll out. And it’s precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all,” he said, urging caution with New Year’s Eve celebrations.Addressing the minority who are opposed to vaccines, he said people who think the disease can’t hurt them should look at those going into hospital now, “that could be you”.“So, make it your New Year’s resolution – far easier than losing weight or keeping a diary – find a walk-in centre or make an online appointment. Get that jab and do something that will make 2022 a happy New Year for us all,” he added.On November 30, the British government announced plans to offer all adults the chance to get their top-up booster jab by the end of January 2022. This target was brought forward earlier this month through the "Get Boosted Now" campaign, aiming to offer all adults a top-up booster by the New Year in response to the surging Omicron variant.Since then, the National Health Service (NHS) in England said it has broken record after record – including the highest number of vaccinations ever recorded in a single day: 830,000 top-ups reported on December 18.This was also the day the UK hit over 1 million vaccinations in total, including first, second, third and booster doses – jumping from 928,000 the previous day.“Our world-leading vaccination programme has meant tens of millions of people have been able to see their loved ones this Christmas knowing they have the protection of the booster,” said UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid.“I am delighted to confirm we have hit our target of offering a COVID-19 booster to all adults by the New Year. I am incredibly proud of the work the NHS has done to accelerate the programme and offer my thanks to the frontline staff, volunteers, Armed Forces and British public who have made it possible for us to meet this commitment,” he said.The dose interval between the second dose and booster dose was reduced from six months to three months on the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – with bookings made available one month in advance.“I am hugely grateful for the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff and volunteers this year, who have gone above and beyond to roll out the NHS vaccination programme and who, in just over 12 months, have administered more than 110 million life-saving COVID-19 jabs,” said Dr Emily Lawson, the head of the NHS COVID-19 vaccination programme.The NHS notes the UK’s booster programme is one of the fastest in the world, as the second country in Europe after Iceland and third in the world for the number of boosters per 100 people in the total population. In all, 33.5 million top-up jabs have been administered in the UK, as well as 51.7 million first and 47.4 million second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-lauds-uk-s-booster-vaccine-triumph-in-new-year-s-message-101640953523504.html
31-12-2021||World||Chinese reliance on Middle East oil increases: Report||China's reliance on Middle East oil increases despite its efforts to get to an "ecological civilization" that relies less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy.As the world's largest oil importer seeks to become greener and more self-reliant, one might expect a shift in its attention and capital. The reality, however, is not that simple, according to Asia Times.Since China became a net importer of oil in 1993, the Middle East has emerged as an increasingly important source of this critical commodity. By the time China surpassed the US as the largest importer of crude oil in 2017, almost half its supply originated from the conflict-ridden Middle-East region.Despite, China's years-long efforts to ramp up local production and diversify its acquisition, its dependency on the Middle East for crude oil remains intact. In 2020, China imported crude oil that totalled roughly USD 176 billion. Almost half (47 per cent) of these official imports came from Middle Eastern countries, according to Asia Times.Further, Saudi Arabia emerged as China's largest crude oil supplier and was still maintaining its leading position as of October 2021. The USD 28.1 billion worth of oil exported from the Kingdom to China in 2020 accounted for 15.9 per cent of China's total crude oil imports.Iraq found itself in third place, shipping USD 19.2 billion (10.9 per cent) worth to the mainland over 2020. Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were also among China's top 10 suppliers, exporting USD 12,8 billion (7.3 per cent), USD 9.7 billion (5.5 per cent), and USD 9 billion (5.1 per cent), respectively.Considering China's dependence on foreign suppliers for oil remains in excess of 70 per cent, Chinese fears of such disruptions to the energy supply chain will only grow.By 2060, China will need to protect the sea lines of communication to ensure the integrity of its oil and gas supply chains. This reality increases the possibility that Beijing will seek to establish more military outposts to enhance its naval power projection capabilities, according to Asia Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-reliance-on-middle-east-oil-increases-report-101640951076257.html

Operations of the company remain unaffected and it will fully cooperate, the statement said.The alleged pyramid scheme reportedly started in 2013 and has entangled "many individuals" and a considerable amount of money. A 17-person task force was set up to dig into the case, wrote UDN.The high-profile couple has built a business empire in China with a total value estimated at over NT$150 billion (US$5.4 billion). They are known to be fond of flaunting their wealth and displaying affection towards each other publicly, with Zhang reportedly having boasted about her house being "inundated with money."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usd-94-million-assets-frozen-of-taiwanese-pair-for-alleged-pyramid-scheme-101640943483204.html

But about an hour and a half into the flight, Fotieo started to feel a sore throat."The wheels started turning in my brain and I thought, 'OK, I'm going to just go take a test.' It was going to make me feel better," Fotieo said. "Immediately, it came back positive."Fotieo is fully vaccinated and has received the booster. She tests consistently since she works with an unvaccinated population. When she got her results in the aeroplane bathroom, over the Atlantic Ocean, she said she started to panic."The first flight attendant I ran into was Rocky. I was hysterical, I was crying," Fotieo said. "I was nervous for my family who I just had dinner with. I was nervous for the other people on the plane. I was nervous for myself."The flight attendant Fotieo ran into helped calm her down, the report added. "Of course, it's a stress factor when something like this comes up, but that's part of our job," the flight attendant told CNN.The flight attendant said she did what she could to try to rearrange seats so Fotieo could be seated in a spot alone, but the flight was full."When she came back and told me she couldn't find enough seating, I opted to stay in the bathroom because I did not want to be around others on the flight," Fotieo said.A note was then put on the bathroom door saying it was out of service, and that was Fotieo's new seat for the remainder of the flight.CNN contacted Icelandair on Thursday for comment but has yet to hear back. Policies vary among airlines as to how to handle a Covid-positive passenger. This comes just weeks after the US and other countries have made travel restrictions amid the spread of the Omicron variant.Once the plane touched down in Iceland, Fotieo and her family were the last ones off the flight.Since her brother and father didn't have any symptoms, they were free to take their connecting flight to Switzerland. Fotieo was given both a rapid and PCR test at the airport, both of which were positive, she said.She was then shuttled to a hotel where she began her 10 days of quarantine, the report added.Doctors checked in on her three times a day, she was given meals and medication was readily available. "Honestly it has been an easy experience," Fotieo said. "It's partially due to the flight attendant and the breed of Icelandic people. Everyone here is so kind."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/testing-positive-for-covid-19-mid-flight-us-woman-is-isolated-for-5-hours-101640936567734.html
31-12-2021||World||South Korea's discredited ex-president Park freed after about 5 years in prison||Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was released from prison on Friday nearly five years after being convicted of corruption, fuelling debate over whether she would play any role ahead of a March presidential election.Park, 69, was the country's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also led to the imprisonment of the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung and Lotte.South Korea's top court in January upheld a 20-year prison sentence imposed after Park was found guilty of colluding with a friend, who is also in jail, to receive tens of billions of won from the companies, mostly to fund her friend's family and non-profit foundations.President Moon Jae-in granted a special pardon to Park last week, citing her deteriorating health and expressing hope to "overcome unfortunate past history and promote national unity".Broadcasters showed Park leaving a Seoul hospital, where she had stayed since last month for medical treatment after correction officials delivered a letter of pardon at midnight.She did not comment but her lawyer has said Park, the daughter of a former military ruler, had offered an apology for causing public concern and thanked Moon for making a "tough decision".Park's release comes as her old party, the main opposition conservative People Power Party, and Moon's Democratic Party are in a tight presidential race.Her imprisonment divided the country, with right-wing, pro-Park groups staging weekly rallies to denounce Moon and his policies and call for Park's release, until COVID-19 distancing rules stifled the rallies last year.Hundreds of Park's supporters braved freezing temperatures to flock to the hospital where she was staying late on Thursday to celebrate her release, with more than 1,000 bouquets of flowers arriving.About 200 people held a protest in downtown Seoul against her release, the Yonhap news agency reported.It was not clear if Park would resume any political activity but she said in a memoir released on Thursday that her conviction was politically motivated and she expressed hopes to "meet the people again one day".People Power's presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who investigated the Park scandal as prosecutor-general, said on Friday he had done his job as a public servant, adding he would like to visit Park when her health improved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-discredited-ex-president-park-freed-after-about-5-years-in-prison-101640935047345.html

While the case load pales in comparison with many outbreaks overseas, China has insisted on stamping out infections quickly, especially ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February."With the arrival of the New Year and the Lunar New Year, the number of people returning home from abroad will increase and the movement of people within China will rise," He Qinghua, an official at the National Health Commission, said on Wednesday."Coupled with the emergence of new variants such as Omicron, these scenarios will increase the risk of the epidemic spreading," He said.The popular Happy Valley amusement park in Beijing has cancelled an event to ring in the new year, while the Happy Valley park in the eastern city of Nanjing has dropped a drone show and fireworks from its line-up of celebrations for New Year's Eve.In the financial hub Shanghai, the Great World amusement park said it will not organise special events such as stage performances, while no count-down will take place in core districts along Huangpu river.The central city of Wuhan, where COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, will not hold any large-scale gatherings during New Year's Eve at certain public venues, including at Guanggu, one of the world's longest pedestrian shopping streets.Several Buddhist bell-ringing ceremonies in the eastern cities of Nanjing, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang to celebrate the new year have also been scrapped.The northern province of Hebei, which will host some events for the Winter Olympics, said it urges residents not to travel unnecessarily during the New Year and Lunar New Year period.Shanxi province, also in the north, advised residents not to head to other provinces for tourism, while the northwestern region of Ningxia said people have been encouraged not to leave the region unnecessarily.As of Dec. 30, mainland China had 102,083 confirmed symptomatic cases, including both local and imported ones, with the death toll at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-cities-go-on-covid-alert-as-new-year-holiday-looms-101640931077877.html

He said 82 were missing and 1,147 injured.More than 530,000 houses were damaged, a third of which were totally wrecked, while damage to infrastructure and agriculture was estimated at 23.4 billion pesos ($459 million), Jalad said.The typhoon affected nearly 4.5 million people, including about 500,000 sheltering in evacuation centres, government data showed. It made landfall as a category 5 typhoon on Dec. 16, and left a trail of destruction in the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, and Surigao del Norte, including the holiday island of Siargao, and the Dinagat Islands.In central Philippine provinces, disaster and government officials have been grappling with inadequate relief supplies for thousands of residents still without power and water."It caused massive destruction and it was like a bomb was dropped in northern Bohol," Anthony Damalerio, chief of Bohol province's disaster agency, told Reuters.A popular dive spot, Bohol reported 109 deaths and is seeking shelter kits, food and water, Damalerio said."Our problem is shelter, those who lost roofs, especially now that this is rainy season in the province," Surigao del Norte Governor Francisco Matugas told ANC news channel.Rai's swath of destruction revived memories of typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, which killed 6,300 people in the Philippines in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-over-400-people-dead-thousands-injured-82-missing-says-philippines-disaster-agency-101640928177369.html

31-12-2021||World||South Korea extends social distancing rules amid Omicron threat||South Korea says it'll extend the toughest social distancing rules for another two weeks to try to lower critical cases and guard against the omicron variant.The government said Friday the current restrictions such as a four-person limit on private gatherings and a 9 pm curfew on restaurants and cafes will continue until Jan. 16.Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol says South Korea's daily caseload has recently dropped to the 5,000s from the previous 8,000s thanks to the current distancing guidelines enforced two weeks ago.But he says the number of critically or seriously ill patients remains above 1,000. Kwon says the omicron variant also continues to spread throughout South Korea and that it's difficult to prevent it from becoming the dominant strain in South Korea.On Friday, South Korea added 4,875 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the national tally to 630,838. Health authorities said they've also confirmed 269 new cases of the omicron variant, taking the country's total to 894.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-extends-social-distancing-rules-amid-omicron-threat-101640927608007.html
31-12-2021||World||UK meets vaccine booster target as Covid-19 cases rise||Boris Johnson’s government said every adult in England has had the chance to receive a Covid-19 vaccine booster, the critical part of its strategy for tackling the fast-spreading omicron variant.More than 28.1 million people in England have now had their top-up doses, the Department of Health said in a statement Friday, or about seven of 10 eligible adults. The UK’s other devolved nations make their own health policy.Johnson has repeatedly pointed to the vaccine rollout as the rationale for not imposing tougher pandemic restrictions to slow the tide of omicron cases.“It’s precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all,” Johnson said in his New Year’s message. But his strategy to get through the latest virus wave with an accelerated inoculation program combined with home testing is coming under growing pressure, amid a widespread shortage of testing kits and as the soaring caseload starts to test the resilience of the health service.A total of 11,452 people were in the hospital in England with Covid-19 as of Thursday, according to the latest NHS England figures, far short of the peak of more than 34,000 in January. Still, daily admissions are also rising with 2,082 on Dec. 28 -- the most since Feb. 3.‘War Footing’The National Health Service is “on a war footing,” Stephen Powis, its national medical director, said in a statement Thursday announcing the construction of temporary structures at eight hospitals to care for more patients.The move, described as precautionary, is reminiscent of the so-called Nightingale hospitals set up during the first Covid-19 wave in 2020 that were later closed because they were little-used.There is growing evidence that omicron is causing less serious disease than earlier coronavirus variants including the previously dominant delta. Yet some scientists are worried that the sheer number of Covid-19 cases could strain the NHS, even if the proportion of people needing treatment is smaller.Johnson has said about 90% of people hospitalized with Covid-19 haven’t had vaccine boosters, and on Friday he urged holdouts to come forward. Booster Drive“I want to speak directly to all those who have yet to get fully vaccinated,” he said. “The people who think the disease can’t hurt them -- look at the people going into hospital now, that could be you.”The UK recorded 189,213 confirmed Covid cases on Thursday, breaking the record for a second day, fueled by the spread of omicron. A further 332 more deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also recorded, the highest daily total since March, though NHS England said that includes a “backlog” of fatalities not reported over the holiday period.That is also piling pressure on the other plank of Johnson’s Covid strategy: encouraging people to use home testing kits to avoid spreading the virus. With demand surging, they have been repeatedly unavailable to order on the NHS website while pharmacies have complained of “inconsistent” supplies.Under new pandemic rules in England, people can use the tests to end their self-isolation, increasing demand. Businesses have started to voice concern about the impact on supply chains due to staff absences, which are also increasingly serious in the health service.On Thursday, Southern Railway announced it is suspending services to the busy London Victoria station until Jan. 10 because so many employees are isolating due to coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-meets-vaccine-booster-target-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101640919796589.html
31-12-2021||World||Pediatric hospitalisations in US on record high due to Omicron variant||New pediatric Covid hospitalizations have hit a record-high in the United States, as children are increasingly swept up in Omicron's lightning spread.While experts are concerned, and stress the need to step up vaccination among kids, early indications suggest that the new variant's rate of severe disease could in fact be lower, and its extreme contagiousness is behind the rapid rise.The raw data might also be muddied by coincidental infections that aren't the main cause of a hospital admission.Numbers spikingAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, almost 199,000 children were reported infected with Covid-19 in the week ending December 23, the last week for which data is currently available, and a 50 percent rise on figures earlier in the month.The seven-day-average of Covid hospital admissions for people aged 0-17 was 378 in the week ending December 28, a 66.1 percent increase on the prior week and the highest ever figure, surpassing the previous peak seen during the Delta wave on September 1, per official data.The only other age group where hospitalizations have hit a new peak are 18-29 year olds.The rates of severe illness remain however much lower in absolute terms compared to older age groups.There have been 803 deaths of people aged 0-18 from Covid in the US, out of more than 820,000, since the pandemic began.Early research out of Hong Kong based on lab testing of tissue samples has shown Omicron replicates up to 70 times faster in the bronchi, the airways leading into the lungs, compared to Delta, which may help explain its extreme spread throughout the population."I think at this point, it's a numbers game," Jim Versalovic, a pathologist and immunologist at Texas Children's Hospital, the largest children's hospital in the United States, told AFP."Based on what we've gathered today, Omicron is not causing more severe infections, but is infecting many more children. And hence we are seeing more children hospitalized with Covid," he added.If anything, there appears to be a greater proportion of mild pediatric cases linked to Omicron -- which is similar to what has been seen in adults, he added.Its relative mildness could be explained by the same Hong Kong study that showed Omicron replicated 10 times slower in the lungs compared to Delta, and a hamster study from the University of Tokyo has borne this out.But "even if you have a small percentage of kids that would have severe disease, a small percentage of a large number is a large number," Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Northwell Health hospital system in New York told AFP.As to why the rate of cases, and thus hospitalizations, are rising faster in younger age groups compared to older, there are several potential factors at play.President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci told reporters this week that "many children are hospitalized with Covid as opposed to because of Covid."In other words, since hospitals are routinely Covid testing everyone admitted, they are picking up coincidental coronavirus infections.The vaccination rate is also lowest among children aged 5-11, who were the last group to become eligible, in November.According to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 15 percent of this group is fully vaccinated, compared to 84 percent of people aged 12 and over.Vaccination strongly recommendedThe take home message for parents, according to Versalovic, is "there's no time to waste in getting a vaccine" -- and that goes for the whole family, including adults, who could spread to their kids, added Bernstein.In fact, the hospitalized adolescents Versalovic's hospital has seen are "almost exclusively unvaccinated."The case for vaccinating young children was strengthened by a new CDC report out Thursday that found serious side effects were exceedingly rare in 5-11 year olds. Feared cases of heart inflammation occurred even less frequently than in males aged 12-29.Only infants aged 0-5 remain ineligible for vaccines, with expectations for authorization in the coming months.Versalovic added there was also cause for hope that the spike might recede very quickly in the coming weeks, as was seen in southern Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pediatric-hospitalisations-in-us-on-record-high-due-to-omicron-variant-101640916193393.html
31-12-2021||World||Decision to flee Kabul made in 'minutes': Ex-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani||Former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani on Thursday described fleeing the Taliban's victory march on Kabul, saying the decision had been taken in "minutes" and that he did not know he was leaving the country until he was taking off.Ghani told BBC's Radio 4 "Today" programme that on the morning of August 15, 2021, the day the Islamists took control of the capital and his own government fell apart, he had "no inkling" that it would be his last day in Afghanistan.But by that afternoon security at the presidential palace had "collapsed," he said."If I take a stand they will all be killed, and they were not capable of defending me," Ghani said in the interview, conducted by former UK chief of defence staff, General Nick Carter.His national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, was "literally terrified," Ghani said. "He did not give me more than two minutes."He said his instructions had originally been to fly by helicopter to southeastern Khost city.But Khost had fallen in the Islamists' lightning offensive which saw provincial capitals topple around the country in the days ahead of the withdrawal of international forces, set for the end of August.The eastern city of Jalalabad, on the border with Pakistan, had also fallen, he said."I did not know where we will go," Ghani said."Only when we took off did it become clear that we were leaving."Ghani has been in the United Arab Emirates ever since.He has been highly criticised in Afghanistan for leaving, with Afghans now trapped under the Taliban's harsh rule accusing him of abandoning them -- and of taking millions of dollars in cash, a claim he "categorically" denied again on Thursday.The former World Bank official has released several previous statements on his departure, admitting that he owed the Afghan people an explanation. Thursday was his first interview.He said again that his first concern had been to prevent brutal street fighting in the capital, already packed with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence elsewhere in the country.And he said his decision to leave was "the hardest thing"."I had to sacrifice myself in order to save Kabul and to expose the situation for what it is: a violent coup, not a political agreement."But even if he'd stayed, he said, he could not have changed the outcome, which has seen the Taliban establish their new regime as the country faces one of the worst humanitarian crises in history."Unfortunately I was painted in total black," he said. "It became an American issue. Not an Afghan issue.""My life work has been destroyed, my values have been trampled on and I've been made a scapegoat," he said.Afghans had "rightly" blamed him, he said. "I completely understand that anger, because I share that anger."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decision-to-flee-kabul-made-in-minutes-ex-afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-101640917906198.html

There's a potential of 210 homes lost in Old Town Superior," Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle told a news conference."I'd like to emphasize that due to the magnitude and intensity of this fire and its presence in such a heavily populated area, we would not be surprised if there are injuries or fatalities."Thousands of people have been told to flee the fast-moving fire, which is thought to have begun when powerlines were toppled by gusting winds.The 20,000-strong town of Louisville, along with the 13,000 residents of Superior, have been told to get out, with the National Weather Service describing the situation as "life-threatening."Wind gusts of over 100 miles (160 kilometres) an hour have been reported in some places, fanning the flames and complicating firefighting efforts."Prayers for thousands of families evacuating from the fires in Superior and Boulder County," Colorado Governor Jared Polis tweeted."Fast winds are spreading flames quickly and all aircraft are grounded."Like much of the American West, Colorado is in the grip of a years-long drought that has left the area parched and vulnerable to wildfire.Although fires are a natural part of the climate cycle, and help to clear dead brush and reduce disease in vegetation, their scale and intensity is increasing.Scientists say a warming climate, chiefly caused by human activities like the unchecked burning of fossil fuels, is altering weather patterns.This prolongs droughts in some areas and provokes unseasonally large storms in other places, phenomena that are expected to get worse as worldwide average temperatures continue to climb.Daniel Swain, a meteorolgist at the University of California, tweeted that it was "hard to believe" these fires were taking hold in December, usually a quieter time for blazes."But take a record warm & dry fall, only 1 inch of snow so far this season, & add an extreme (100mph ) downslope windstorm...and extremely fast moving/dangerous fires are the result."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colorado-wildfires-thousands-evacuated-as-officials-fear-several-houses-lost-101640916054311.html
31-12-2021||World||South Africa lifts night-time curfew as it says Covid-19 4th wave peaks||South Africa has lifted a midnight to 4 a.m. curfew on people's movement with immediate effect, believing the country has passed the peak of its fourth Covid-19 wave driven by the Omicron variant, a government statement said on Thursday.The country made the changes based on the trajectory of the pandemic, levels of vaccination in the country and available capacity in the health sector, according to a press release issued by Mondli Gungubele, a minister in the presidency.South Africa is currently at the lowest of its five-stage Covid-19 alert levels."All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level," a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said.Data from the Department of Health showed a 29.7% decrease in the number of new cases detected in the week ending Dec. 25 compared to the number of cases found in the previous week, at 127,753, the government said.South Africa, with close to 3.5 million infections and 91,000 deaths, has been the worst-hit country in Africa during the pandemic on both counts.Besides lifting the restrictions on public movement, the government said gatherings will be restricted to no more than 1,000 people indoors, and no more than 2,000 people outdoors.It also ruled that alcohol shops with licenses to operate beyond 11 p.m. (2100GMT) may revert back to full license conditions, a welcome boon for traders and businesses hard hit by the pandemic and looking to recover during the festive season."While the Omicron variant is highly transmissible, there has been lower rates of hospitalisation than in previous waves," cabinet said, adding that the wearing of masks in public places remained mandatory. Failure to wear a mask in South Africa when required remains a criminal offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-lifts-night-time-curfew-as-it-says-covid-19-4th-wave-peaks-101640915265091.html
31-12-2021||World||Amid Omicron surge, Israel approves fourth Covid-19 booster jab||Israel on Thursday approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable people, becoming one of the first countries to do so, amid a surge in Covid in cases driven by the Omicron variant.The approval came as another anti-Covid weapon arrived in the country: the first shipment of Pfizer's anti-Covid pills."Today I approved giving the fourth vaccine for immunocompromised people," health ministry director-general Nachman Ash told reporters."I did this in light of studies that show the benefit of the vaccine, including the fourth vaccine, to this population, and in light of the fear they are more vulnerable in this outbreak of Omicron."Health authorities reported on Thursday more than 4,000 new cases, a high not seen since September.Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said Israel was in "a fifth wave", with most cases probably related to the Omicron variant.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel, which was among the first countries in the world to offer a third shot to the general public, would be a trailblazer for the fourth jab."Israel will lead the way in administering a fourth vaccine to the Israeli people," he said.Some 4.2 million people out of a population of 9.4 Israelis have gotten three shots of coronavirus vaccine.Also on Thursday, an Israeli El Al flight from Belgium landed in Tel Aviv carrying a shipment of Pfizer's anti-Covid pill, Paxlovid.Bennett hailed this as an "important addition to the arsenal in the war against the pandemic"."Thanks to our rapid action, the drugs have arrived in Israel quickly and will assist us in getting past the peak of the coming Omicron wave," he said.- 'Reduce risk' - Ran Balicer, chairman of Israel's national expert panel on Covid-19, said the Pfizer drugs could "dramatically reduce risk of severe illness, potentially thus also reducing the overall hospital burden".He said the medications were critical, "in addition to vaccines and masks".The US Food and Drug Administration last week authorised Pfizer's Paxlovid pill for high-risk people aged 12 and up.In trials, the treatment has been shown to reduce Covid hospitalisations and deaths by 88 percent among at-risk people.The oral treatments block the virus' ability to replicate and should withstand variants, experts say.Until now, the main treatments for Covid have been synthetic antibodies or Gilead's antiviral remdesivir, which are administered by infusion.The United States has paid $5.3 billion for 10 million courses of Pfizer's new treatment, as well as $2.2 billion for treatment from rival Merck, whose pill appears to be less effective.The European Union's drug regulator has also allowed member states to use Pfizer's Covid medications ahead of formal approval as an emergency measure.Ash approved the booster after Israel's Sheba Medical Centre launched a clinical trial Monday, giving 150 staff members a fourth jab to test the benefit of a wider national rollout of additional doses.He also announced new health regulations, requiring people to wear masks at outdoor gatherings of more than 50 people.Israeli health authorities have shied away from sweeping social distancing guidelines and lockdowns seen in the earlier days of the pandemic.The government has also not blocked large gatherings for New Year's Eve.Horowitz said, however on Thursday, "every person must take personal responsibility"."We will not station an inspector and we won't send a police officer to every person."Last week Chile announced it would offer a fourth shot to at-risk people beginning in February. Health authorities in the United Kingdom and Germany have also said they are considering fourth doses.dac/hkbPFIZERGILEAD SCIENCES||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-omicron-surge-israel-approves-fourth-covid-19-booster-jab-101640915532436.html

From Greece to Mexico, from Barcelona to Bali and across swathes of Europe, authorities have cancelled or curtailed public gatherings.In France, wearing masks outdoors will be compulsory while walking the streets of Paris from Friday for everyone over the age of 11. Nightclubs have been closed until well into January.In Spain, public festivities have been cancelled across most regions and in the biggest cities except Madrid, where a stripped-down gathering is scheduled with the crowd limited to 7,000 people compared to 18,000 in 2019.On Thursday, Britain’s National Health Service announced that it would start opening temporary field hospitals to contain a possible overspill of inpatients. The number of patients occupying beds in English hospitals rose to 11,452, official data from NHS England showed on Thursday, up by 990 from a day earlier.Indonesia, which has reported more than 4.2 million confirmed cases, warned that foreign travellers may be deported from the resort island of Bali if they are caught violating Covid rules.Bali has barred carnivals, fireworks and gatherings of more than 50 people over the Christmas and New Year period.Mexico City has also cancelled its massive New Year’s Eve celebrations as a preventative measure after a rise in Covid cases.In Saudi Arabia, authorities reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, after recording the highest number of infections in months.“I am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Russia is bracing itself for another Covid-19 wave early next year, three sources in political circles told Reuters. “There is the expectation of a new wave in January-February,” said a source close to the Kremlin, adding that daily infections of more than 50,000 were possible.J&J booster effectiveA booster dose of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid vaccine was 84% effective at preventing hospitalisation in South African health care workers who became infected as the Omicron variant spread, researchers said on Thursday. The real-world study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was based on a second dose of the J&J vaccine administered to 69,092 workers between November 15 and December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-braces-for-virus-surge-in-new-year-101640903968129.html
31-12-2021||India||The year ahead: Discontent brewing in Telangana Cong, PCC working president to be summoned before disciplinary panel||HyderabadDiscontent is brewing within the Telangana Congress over the style of functioning of Pradesh Congress Committee president A Revanth Reddy, who is allegedly taking unilateral decisions without consulting senior leaders in the party.A recent letter written by PCC working president and senior lawmaker from Sangareddy assembly constituency T Jayaprakash Reddy alias Jagga Reddy to AICC president Sonia Gandhi lodging a serious complaint against Revanth Reddy created tremors in the party.Taking serious exception to Jagga Reddy’s letter, the PCC chief referred it to the party’s disciplinary committee to take appropriate action. The committee headed by former minister G Chinna Reddy met on Friday decided to seek an explanation from the Sangareddy MLA.“The committee felt that Jagga Reddy has violated party discipline. If there are any differences within the party, they should be discussed in the party forums and resolve them. Leaking the party’s internal issues to the media is a breach of discipline,” Chinna Reddy said.He said the MLA would be summoned before the disciplinary committee shortly to seek his explanation in person. “Since he is a PCC working president and also an MLA, it is for the high command to take appropriate action,” he said.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi on Monday, Jagga Reddy requested that the high command replace Revanth Reddy with a new PCC chief, as the latter was taking unilateral decisions without taking senior leaders into confidence.He pointed out that the PCC chief suddenly announced that he would conduct “Rachabanda” (public forum) near chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s farmhouse at Erravelli village in Siddipet district on Sunday last, without intimating anybody in the party.“I am the only Congress MLA from the erstwhile Medak district (of which Siddipet is a part), but I was not given any information about the programme. Even another senior leader from the district and present PCC working president J Geetha Reddy was also not intimated about the programme,” Jagga Reddy complained.He alleged that Revanth Reddy was not functioning along party lines and was instead using such programmes only for personal image building.The PCC working president also alleged that Revanth Reddy had not made any effort in the recently held by-election to Huzurabad assembly constituency. “The Congress candidate got only 3,000 votes against its vote bank of more than 40,000. This has to be taken very seriously and assessed,” he pointed out.Similarly, in the recent elections held for 12 Local Bodies’ MLC seats, it was most unfortunate that the TPCC president decided not to contest the elections, the MLA said. “Revanth Reddy does not have a grip at the grassroots levels and does not possess any experience to go into the village level, mandal level and work for the Congress,” he said.Former Rajya Sabha member V Hanumantha Rao also found fault with the PCC president for taking unilateral decisions without consulting senior leaders. “Revanth Reddy should have spoken to Jagga Reddy before taking up the Rachabanda programme,” he said.Another senior Congress leader and former minister, who preferred anonymity, said not just Jagga Reddy, several others had written to the high command complaining against the monarchic style of functioning of the PCC chief.Meanwhile, the PCC chief was kept under house arrest at his Jubilee Hills residence, for the second time in a week, for trying to stage a Rachabanda programme on paddy procurement issue at Bhupalpalli town in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district.The police surrounded his house at Jubilee Hills in the early hours and did not allow him to come out saying that there was no permission for the programme. “Telangana under dictator rule. Police personnel deployed again at my house restricting visiting farmers. Is this Afghanistan or North Korea?,” Reddy posted on Twitter.Speaking to reporters later, the PCC chief criticised that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had time to attend marriages and call on the families of the deceased party leaders, but he had no time for the farmers in distress. “When we want to console them, we are kept under house arrest,” he said.

Talking to newsmen in the state capital the minister said out of 107, 29 persons came from United Arab Emirates, 23 from the United Kingdom and others from different countries. Seven persons contracted the new variant through contact. She said maximum number of cases were reported from Ernakulam 37 followed by Thiruvananthapuram district 26. One person also recovered from the infection she said adding all tests were held at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the state capital. The minister asked people to be vigilant and exercise utmost caution during the New Year and other festivities. “There is no need of any panic. But we have to be extremely careful. We have to be vigilant and follow Covid-appropriate behvavior,” she said. New cases were reported a day after the state announced night curfew for four days, Dec 30 to Jan 2. People close to the government said the curbs are likely to be extended if the state reports more such cases. The state detected the first case of the new variant on Dec 7 and cases crossed 100 in less than a month. Experts said Omicron cases are likely to peak in the state in two months. The government said it has taken enough precautions to meet the exigency. The minister said the state will start vaccination to children below 18 from Jan 3 and all arrangements have been done in this regard. At least 98 per cent of eligible population in the state received the first dose of vaccine and 77 per cent received both and experts said good vaccination rate will help contain the new threat of Omicron but they warned it is too early to lower guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/44-more-omicron-cases-detected-in-kerala-total-107-101640972808988.html
31-12-2021||India||Chennai research scholar stabbed to death; 2 held, say police||Chennai: An argument among three research scholars quickly escalated into a dramatic murder in Tamil Nadu’s Chengalpattu district close to Chennai. A day after the crime, police have remanded J Desapriya, 26 and S Arun Pandian, 27 on charges of murdering K Senthil, 43.Police said that Desapriya was in a consensual relationship with Senthil who was still married. “Desapriya wanted to marry Senthil but he had not agreed to leave his wife and remarry her,” said a senior police official of Chengalpattu district which adjoins Chennai. The deceased had been married for about nine years and didn’t have children. “She called him on Thursday to meet near her college. It seemed like an attempt to convince him and her friend Arun also joined her. There seems to have been a sudden provocation and Arun took out a knife and slit the throat of Senthil and stabbed him four times.” The crime took place 2-km from the Kelambakkam police station on a road over a subway around 1.30 on Thursday afternoon.Senthil bled out and died on the spot due to multiple injuries. The by-standers caught hold of the duo, informed the police and handed them over. A complaint was filed by the victim Senthil’s family members. Though Despriya had not stabbed him, she and her friend Arun have been booked under section 302 (punishment for whoever commits murder). “It doesn’t seem like a planned murder,” the officer quoted above said. “It’s more of a case of being spurned. We are still investigating the case.”Desapriya is currently a research assistant in the Physics department of a prominent college in Chennai. The other accused Arun has completed his MS in Physics but his current designation is unknown. Desapriya met Senthil while they studied for their Ph D together in an educational institute in Chennai, said police. A similar murder had taken place in the outskirts of Chennai in September when a 20-year-old woman was stabbed to death by a man at the Tambaram railway station, more than 30-km away from Chennai. Police had said that the crime was a result of an ‘estranged love’. After stabbing her in the neck, the man Ramachandran attempted to kill himself by slitting his throat but he survived. The status of the case is not known. In 2016, in another sensational case at Chennai’s busy Nungambakkam railway station, a 24-year-old techie S Swathi was murdered by P Ramkumar who was spurned that she had rejected his advances. He had stalked her for a few months before the crime. Ramkumar was arrested from his native in Tirunelveli district and the case was closed after he died by suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-research-scholar-stabbed-to-death-2-held-saypolice-101640972750382.html
31-12-2021||India||Tamil Nadu laboratory recognised to conduct genome sequencing||Chennai: The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) has recognised Tamil Nadu’s State Public Health Laboratory to conduct whole genome sequencing, which means the state will no longer have to send samples to labs in Pune, Bengaluru or Hyderabad to confirm variants, such as Delta and Omicron. INSACOG is a consortium of 38 laboratories established jointly by the union ministry of health, the department of biotechnology (DBT), Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to assess variants in Covid-19 patients. “Tamil Nadu is the first state to receive this recognition,” said state health minister M Subramanian. “The recognition would fasten the process of identifying variants and it can help in better prevention and containment measures.” This comes days after the state on Monday had urged the central team of experts, who were in Tamil Nadu to inspect the pandemic control measures, to stress on the union government for permission for Tamil Nadu to declare Omicron cases through this lab. At that time the health minister pointed out delays in declaring Omicron cases as the state had to wait for confirmation from one of these labs. By the time the confirmation came the patients were already being discharged, the minister had said. Tamil Nadu has already been detecting S-drop, a marker for Omicron, at 12 labs across the state. The State Public Health Laboratory is located at the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) campus in Chennai. It is an initiative of the DMK government which assumed office in May this year and announced setting up of the lab in July. Chief Minister M K Stalin inaugurated the laboratory set up at a cost of ₹4 crore in September. Since the Covid-19 second wave driven by the Delta variant peaked in Tamil Nadu between May and June, the state began the exercise to identify the variants which were circulating and causing rapid transmission. Cases have been rising in Tamil Nadu in the past week in the light of the Omicron variant of concern, which studies indicate spreads faster, promoting the Greater Chennai Corporation to bring back containment zones and opening Covid Care Centres. As of December 31, the state has a total of 46 Omicron cases. 32 of these patients have been discharged and 12 are under treatment. Only three of these Omicron cases are not linked to international travellers. S gene drop has been detected in 141 international travellers. Tamil Nadu as of Thursday registered 890 new cases of people infected with Covid-19 taking the total to 27,46,890.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-laboratory-recognised-to-conduct-genome-sequencing-101640972749008.html
31-12-2021||India||The year ahead: Andhra...||HyderabadWhile Omicron, new variant of Coronavirus, is a matter of concern for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, both the two Telugu states are likely to witness interesting developments in the new year 2022.In Andhra Pradesh, the uncertainty over the capital city might end at least in the second half of 2022. The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government is planning to reintroduce a revised legislation on three capital cities during the budget session in February and March. Since the ruling YSR Congress now has absolute majority in the state legislative council, the passage of the new bill would be smooth.However, the petitions filed by Amaravati farmers and opposition parties are pending before the high court, pending the passage of the revised legislation in the assembly. The high court might take up fresh hearing on the revised laws and continue hearing. In all probability, there would be some clarity on whether the capital would remain at Amaravati or three capitals would be formed for the state.Another major development that is expected to happen is the judgement by the Central Bureau of Investigation court into the alleged quid pro quo and disproportionate assets case of Jagan Mohan Reddy. In case of a verdict against the chief minister, there will be a major political turmoil in the state.In that event, Jagan might have to step down from the chief minister post and hand over the reins to another senior member of the party or his wife Y S Bharati. In case he gets any temporary relief by moving the high court or Supreme Court, he might continue as the chief minister. In any case, it will be a major political setback for him.The coming year might also witness realignment of political forces in Andhra Pradesh. The Telugu Desam Party might enter into an alliance with parties like Jana Sena and the Left parties to launch a broadside against the ruling YSRCP.The Centre might complete the process of privatization of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant in the next few months and this is expected to trigger widespread unrest among the workers of the steel plant and also an agitation form the people in general.

The raids conducted ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, scheduled for early next year, took a political colour when Jain was linked with the Samajwadi Party.Denying Jain’s link with his party, Yadav on December 29 said the BJP got its own businessman raided by mistake, as his name is similar to SP MLC Pushparaj Jain.Sitharaman, however, said the rumour that raids were mistakenly conducted on a wrong person would have gained credence only if nothing would have been found from Peeyush Jain. “They went to the right house, they searched the right place, and after the search it was proved that the information was correct,” she said.

With hotels, pubs and restaurants advancing their closing time to suit the night curfew, professional DJs, who usually work in different pubs and clubs, have been booked for private parties as there is no restriction on them.Bengaluru city police imposed additional restrictions in view of the new year celebrations on Friday. As per the revised order, prohibitory orders will be in place from 6 pm on Friday till 5 am on Saturday.While there are no changes to restrictions imposed earlier, including night curfew, the revised order has been issued to ensure that no more than four persons gather at public places such as main roads, open areas, parks, grounds etc. to celebrate New Year.Rakesh Mishra, a city-based lawyer, said he was planning to stay in Bengaluru for the new year, but with all the restrictions, he decided to book a resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru. “As per the current guidelines, the restaurants and pubs have to close by 10 pm, which mean the last order would be around 9 pm. So, my family and friends have booked the resort and since it’s a private property our celebrations can go late into the night,” he said.Kuttan Nair, who runs a travel agency, said they have got more bookings for travel this year. “A lot of people is moving out of the city. We had to scramble to get vehicles due to last-minute bookings and due to restrictions, the number of vehicles is high too. People want personal vehicles instead of tempos and other larger vehicles,” he said.For those staying back in the city, house parties and barbeques are the name of the game. “We used to party at a club generally. Last year, we couldn’t do it. So, this year, we are going to a friend’s farmhouse for a party,” said Krishnan R, a city-based IT employee. According to him, due to high traffic getting out of the city was difficult.For the owners of pubs and restaurants, it was another bad year for business. According to establishment owners, government order has forced them to cancel several bookings that have been made weeks in advance. Amit Roy, a member of the National Restaurant Association of India and who runs restaurants like Watson’s and Slug in Bengaluru, said advance paid and travel tickets booked for artists are proving to be an additional cost to already suffering without bookings.“The industry creates so many jobs and we employ more people during the festive season. We are going to lose all that money now. Even though we have been generating revenue for the government, but now they are ignoring us,” said Roy.The excise department, which collects levies on the sale of Indian made liquor (IML) and beer, breached the targets by ₹1,547 crore keeping up its performance despite the pandemic in 2021. The Yediyurappa regime revised its revenue targets from IML and beer in May after the state underwent a spell of lockdown that was imposed to curb the spread of the infection. While the government fixed a target of ₹22,700 crore, the excise department has mopped up ₹23,131 crore as of March 31.“The government has got its revenues as spirits are sold in several places and the budget targets are achieved. But those who are dependent on alcohol licence and even veg restaurants... What should they do and how to recover losses? We were not given any concessions in anything?” Govindraj Hegde, president of the Karnataka Wine Merchants Association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-restrictions-push-revellers-outside-bengaluru-101640972389143.html

31-12-2021||India||Bengaluru looks forward to better infrastructure and policing||Another year, marred by the pandemic, is coming to an end. For India’s IT capital and its citizen, the year 2022 was to be a sign of a positive change, but with Omicron Covid variant is causing yet another spike in the city. Concerns are mounting as whether the city will see another lockdown and if businesses will get time to recover the losses.The hopes for the next year are, however, not limited to recovering from the pandemic. The city’s infrastructure, better policing and a new way of living are among the thoughts on top of people’s minds. So, here is what Bengaluru looks forward to in 2022.Recovery from pandemic As Bengaluru steps into 2022, the biggest hope remains for a recovery from the pandemic. Due to Omicron, Bengaluru has already witnessed two major spikes in number of Covid-19 cases in December. In the second wave, close to 1 out of 10 patients have died out of the hospital. In comparison, during the first wave of the coronavirus, only 3 per died outside of a hospital. In the first wave of the virus, 6,551 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in the two months, while in the second wave 14,167 deaths were reported, which made 2021 one of the deadliest. As Bengaluru enters 2022 with a fear of another wave of Covid-19, the biggest hope for the year is to not repeat the tragedy of the second wave.Better infrastructure A crackdown by the Karnataka High Court following the death of a 19-year-old medical student in May and hearings of Public Interest Litigations have revealed that there are at least 5,435 potholes, bad roads or bad footpaths in Bengaluru. Another study showed that at least 2,000 km of roads in the city are damaged or have potholes that have cost many lives over the years.The year 2021 was also the year, where after getting pulled up by the high court, the state government began fixing Bengaluru’s bad roads on a war-footing. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai also claimed that in 2022, most of the potholes in Bengaluru will be taken care of. How realistic is the promising still remains a difficult question, but Bengalureans will be entering 2022, with the hopes of seeing better infrastructure in the city.Humane policing In 2021, Karnataka witnessed several instances of human rights violations at the hands of police. On the last of December, a policeman was suspended for attacking a tribal man on his wedding day. In September, the criminal investigation department (CID) arrested a police sub-inspector for allegedly forcing a Dalit man to drink urine, while the latter was in custody in May. On December 8, a police sub-inspector was suspended after he had allegedly manhandled a young man and forced him to drink urine in Bengaluru. Sub-inspector Harish KN was suspended after a departmental inquiry. Activists in the city have been claiming that these attacks were just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Bengaluru’s policing problem. A new year brings the hope that the men in Khaki will change for the better in 2022.A new lifestyle The Covid-19 pandemic too is an opportunity for such a change, say experts. Mohandas Pai, former director of Infosys, said one of the first changes the city will see is the way it works and work from home is here to stay, at least in a hybrid model.The pandemic forced companies to rethink the way they operate. In the future, the idea of having a large office with all employees in one place will be obsolete. From an employee point of view, people are thinking of the quality of life, especially by wasting time travelling large distances within the city. A hybrid model which involves work from home and having small hubs across the city will be the way forward. Many are already doing it,” he said.V Ravichandar, a civic expert, said the city should and will have a “5 km city” in the coming days. “The work from home culture will enable people to work and live in a 5km radius. Such a system will make Bengaluru a pandemic proof city to some extent. One thing this pandemic has taught us is that cases happen in bubbles and travel results in the spread,” he said.Even though the pandemic has been one of the difficult phases of last year, at least some are hoping that Bengaluru will learn a good lesson from this bad phase.
31-12-2021||India||Covid committee asks Bengaluru civic body to prepare plan for 3rd Covid wave||The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19 has asked the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to formulate a comprehensive action plan to tackle a third wave of Covid-19 with the city and Karnataka reporting a rise in cases, mostly driven by the new variant Omicron, officials familiar with the matter said on Friday. The TAC met on Wednesday to discuss a strategy to contain a surge in Covid infections in the coming days.The state on Friday reported 832 new Covid-19 cases and 8 deaths. The state also reported 23 more Omicron variant cases, health minister K Sudhakar said on Friday. This takes the state’s Omicron tally to 66.“From the previous experience of the two waves in Karnataka, the case surge in Bengaluru/Karnataka was preceded by a surge in Mumbai/Maharashtra,” the TAC report pointed out. Officials in the know the developments said recommendations from TAC include ramping up medical facilities at hospitals across the city, reactivating Covid Care Centres (CCCs) and increasing testing in the city. The TAC report said that since the Omicron variant is found to be less deadly, focus should be on creating CCCs, which would cater to patients who require observation than treatment. “We are currently isolating Omicron patients at hospitals, even if they are showing mild symptoms. In case the cases increase, having a larger CCC network would help decongest hospitals by taking in patients with mild symptoms,” said a TAC member who didn’t want to be named. He said that the recommendation to increase CCCs was given since during the second wave several patients with mild symptoms had occupied hospital beds resulting in a scarcity. “Apart from that we have recommended that home isolation should be avoided as much as possible, since Omicron variant is highly contagious,” he added. The report has also asked for a triage system, which would identity who should be allotted hospital beds and who would be kept in CCCs. “We have recommended that no walk-in patients should be allowed at the hospital and the admissions should go through the government,” he added. KV Trilok Chandra, BBMP special commissioner (health), said the BBMP was planning to set up one CCC in every assembly constituency. “A system of physical triaging and tele-triaging is already functional. We also send mobile triaging teams to every ward,” he said. Meanwhile, the R0 for Covid-19 of Karnataka and Bengaluru has crossed the value of 1, indicating that the virus is spreading. R0 or reproduction number indicates the rate of spread. Bengaluru’s reproduction number rose from 1.02 on December 22 to 1.11 as of Monday, according to calculations of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) in Chennai.In view of the rising numbers, the Karnataka government on Friday revised the timings of the prohibitory order within the limits of the Bengaluru City Commissionerate. “The prohibitory order within the limits of Bengaluru City Commissionerate shall remain with revised timings, that is, from 6 pm on December 31 to 5 am on January 1, 2022,” the order read. The gathering of five or more persons in public places for the celebrations of New Year in any form is prohibited in Bengaluru. However, in-house celebrations in residential complexes and private clubs may be held for their members without organising any special events. “Hotels, malls, restaurants, clubs or any similar establishment shall not organize any special DJ, events or shows in the city. However, they may carry out their regular business activities following Covid-19 protocols,” the order said.

The surge occurred owing to multiple states, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra adding fresh cases. Meanwhile, Bihar detected its first Omicron case after a 26-year-old man, who recently visited Delhi after returning to India.Maharashtra and Delhi, which are the leading contributors in the countrywide tally with 454 and 320 Omicron cases, respectively, have been consistently witnessing an upward swing in single-day Covid-19 infections as well. Both the regions maintained the trend on Friday as well after recorded a massive jump of 8,067 and 1,796 cases in the last 24 hours.Mumbai is the most-hit city of Maharashtra due to Covid-19 as it logged 5,428 infections in the last 24 hours, up from 3,671 on the previous day. Delhi's 1,726 cases, on the other hand, is the highest since May 22, while its 2.44% positivity rate is the highest since May 24 when it was 2.52%.As far as other states are concerned, Tamil Nadu reported the biggest spike in Omicron cases during the day with 74 fresh infections, taking the state tally to 120. Kerala also reported 44 new cases to take its count to 109 while Karnataka and Gujarat logged 23 and 16 fresh infections, respectively.Also Read | These states in India have confirmed cases of Omicron Covid variant. Full listOwing to massive surge in Omicron cases, Tamil Nadu government announced restrictions till January 10. According to the curbs, mall, theatres, beauty parlours, amusement parks and metro, will function at 50% capacity. Offline classes of students from classes 1 to 8 have been suspended till the said date, while the same for remaining classes will be conducted following all Covid-19 protocols.Meanwhile, Maharashtra government that already announced a slew of curbs, including prohibiting gathering of more than five people between 9pm and 6am, imposed fresh restrictions. As per these, attendees at social, political and religious events have been capped at 50 while those at funerals have been restricted at 20.Mumbai Police extended the Section 144 across the city till January 15 from January 7.Several other states such as Punjab and Rajasthan have banned entry to public places to those unvaccinated from January 15 and January 31 onwards, respectively.Also Read | India's Covid vaccination coverage exceeds 145 crore, Mandaviya says 'ending year on great note'The Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Friday wrote to all states and UTs, asking them to augment testing for Covid-19.

31-12-2021||India||Minorities helped Congress win civic polls: Karnataka CM||Hours after the Congress overtook the BJP in the urban local body (ULB) election results in Karnataka, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai was in a defensive mood on Friday claiming a high number of minorities in these 58 ULBs had resulted in the BJP not getting as many seats as expected.“If you look at the numbers, our performance has increased in this election compared to last time, though it should have been higher. Further, in these areas, the minorities are in large numbers. We have not won these areas in the past, minorities are around 65% in these areas,” Bommai told reporters.Party insiders said despite his defence, it is the chief minister, who is feeling the pressure of the UBL election results. In all three elections held in Karnataka since Bommai took charge as chief minister in July, the BJP’s performance has been poor. In three municipal corporations in September, the BJP won the Belagavi corporation but failed to get the numbers in Hubbali-Dharwad and Kalaburagi.In the bypolls to two assembly seats in November Srinivas Mane, the Congress candidate, won after he secured 87,490 votes and 50.95% of the vote, defeating Shivaraj Sajjanar of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who secured 80,117 votes.Soon after this, the chief minister, who earlier claimed that the bypoll will be an indicator of the 2023 polls in the state, walked back his earlier statement. “These elections are fought on that particular time and issues so it doesn’t give a verdict to the entire thing. I have taken this election setback very seriously,” Bommai said.Even in the MLC elections, the BJP fell short of the majority and stood tied with the Congress, winning 11 seats. “The poor performance in the election always trumps anything he does has the Chief Minister. Even though he is defending the party’s performance in UBL elections, he is certainly under pressure to prove himself,” said a BJP legislator, who had served as minister earlier.Even in the UBL elections, Bommai suffered a personal setback. The saffron party lost both ULBs in Haveri, Bommai’s hometown, to the Congress. In the 23-seat town municipal council of Bankapur in Shiggaon, Haveri, (Bommai’s home constituency) the Congress won 14 seats while BJP only managed to win seven seats. “When the chief minister is not able to ensure victory in the bypoll and UBL elections in his own constituency and district, there are bound to be questioned in the future,” added the BJP leader.For Congress, on the other hand, victories in recent times have been a morale boost. KPCC president DK Shivakumar said the BJP’s claims that they have done well are “laughable”.“The BJP is in power in the state and they are not able to win more seats than the Opposition in the ULB election. This only means that people are against the BJP. There is no question about it,” Shivakumar told HT.He said the Congress has managed to win ULBs seats that were either produced a hung verdict or favoured the BJP in previous elections. “Out vote share in the election was 42.06% and the BJP’s vote share was 36%. This tells the reality on the ground,” he added.The Congress secured 202 out of the 441 seats in town municipal councils while the BJP won 176 and JD(S) won 21, less than the 43 seats won by independents and other candidates. In the 577 seats in town panchayats too, the Congress held the upper hand, clinching 237 seats. The BJP won 191 while the JD(S) won just 12.In terms of capturing the local bodies through the majority, the Congress secured a majority in 20 ULBs while the BJP won 15 and the JD(S) has just won one ULB at Bidadi. The rest of the ULBs have thrown mixed results with no party being able to get a majority. In three ULBs, the support of JD(S) is crucial for either the BJP or the Congress to secure a majority.

The appointment comes nearly seven months after Jitin Prasada quit the post and the party.The development comes at a time when the Congress is on the backfoot in West Bengal and its relations with the ruling All IndaTrinamool Congress are strained.Chellakumar is already the party’s in-charge for Odisha.A communication from Congress general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal said, “Hon’ble Congress president Sonia Gandhi has appointed Chellakumar as AICC in-charge of West Bengal and Andaman & Nicobar islands for an interim period, with immediate effect.”Prasada quit the Congress in June, a month after the Congress drew a blank in the Bengal assembly elections. It had contested the polls in alliance with the CPI(M)-led Left parties.“The delay in appointing an AICC in-charge for the Congress was plausible as there were no elections round the corner,” said a senior leader.Chellakumar’s entry in Bengal also comes at a point when the Congress’ larger goal of an united Opposition is facing issues from the Trinamool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-appoints-in-charge-for-west-bengal-101640971429198.html
31-12-2021||India||Five charts that capture 2021 for India||2022 begins today. What did the last year bring for India? Here are five charts which capture the most important events in the year that was. Pandemic: The deadly second wave India imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world when the pandemic broke out in 2020. The lockdown did delay the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the country. Daily new cases did not cross 5,000 until May 17, two weeks after lockdowns were being eased. The first wave of the pandemic, seen in terms of seven-day average of daily new cases peaked on September 16, 2020, when the average was 93,617. By February 11, daily new cases had come down to just 10,988. This created a sense of complacency, which would prove to be extremely costly months later. The second wave of Covid-19 – if one defines it as a consistent daily increase in 7-day rolling averages for two weeks – started around February 28. The numbers increased rapidly. By April 7, seven-day average of daily new cases had crossed the 93,617 figure, the peak seen during the first wave of the pandemic. The peak came on May 9, when the seven-day average of daily new cases was 391,819. The rapid surge in infections tested and led to a near-collapse of India’s medical infrastructure, seen in reports of not just a shortage of hospital beds but also things like medical oxygen. To be sure, both the number of infections and deaths – at 1.38% India’s case fatality rate is among the lowest – are likely to underestimates. Various reports of rapid spike in death registrations during the peak of the pandemic underline the argument about undercounting of deaths during the pandemic. Chart: Seven-day average of daily new cases Policy: 841 million vaccinated people and counting If there is one policy achievement the Indian State should take credit for in 2021, it is the country’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. The achievement was not without initial hurdles, even hiccups. The world’s first fully-tested Covid-19 public vaccine was administered on December 8 in the United Kingdom. India started vaccinations on January 16. India opened its vaccination programme for the general population on March 1. It would take another 61 days before the programme was opened for all adults on May 1. The progress was slow initially, and there were experiments with a decentralised versus centralised approach to vaccination initially. It was only from August that the pace of the programme reached its current level. While it seems unlikely that the country will achieve full vaccination of all adults by the end of 2021 – 841 million or 89.5% adults have received at least one dose by December 28 -- the progress so far is far from insignificant, especially in keeping with the global vaccine inequality between rich and poor nations. It is on the basis of this success that India has announced the administering of booster doses and vaccines for children in 2022. Chart: Cumulative share of partially and fully vaccinated adults Pain: Largest ever economic contraction in India’s history India’s GDP suffered a contraction of 7.3% in 2020-21. This is the largest ever economic contraction in Independent India and the first instance of a contraction because of the non-farm economy; agriculture was the only sector which actually recorded positive growth. The contraction was largely a result of the 68-day long hard lockdown which threw economic activity off the rails in the first half of the fiscal year. Quarter-wise GDP numbers show this clearly. GDP suffered a contraction of 24.4% and 7.4% in the quarters ending June and September 2020. The economy was inching back to normalcy with a growth of 0.46% and 1.64% in the quarters ending December 2020 and March 2021, before the second wave disrupted the momentum once again. India’s GDP is expected to cross pre-pandemic levels in 2021-22 with a growth of 9.5% (RBI’s projections), but indicators such as Consumer Confidence Surveys clearly show that a large share of the country’s population is still scarred by the pandemic’s economic disruption. Chart: Annual GDP growth rate India Politics: The BJP’s loss in BengalThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) created history when it came back with an even bigger majority in the 2019 general elections. The state which played a crucial role in the BJP achieving this feat was West Bengal. The arithmetic speaks for itself. The BJP’s seat tally went up from 282 to 303 between 2014 and 2019, an increase of 21. West Bengal accounted for 16 of these additional seats in 2019. The West Bengal success for the BJP was also a debacle for the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC). As the assembly elections came closer, the TMC seemed to be besieged, with large-scale defections to the BJP of which Suvendu Adhikari was the most prized catch. A BJP victory in West Bengal was not just about capturing a large state with 42 Lok Sabha seats. It was also about conquering the last eastern frontier which has eluded India’s dominant political hegemon so far. This was not to be. When the results were announced, the TMC seemed to have more than compensated for its 2019 debacle. It won a bigger majority than it had in 2016, gaining 4.6 percentage points in vote share from its 2019 performance. 2021 West Bengal results will have a significant bearing on both the BJP’s and its opposition’s politics in the run-up to 2024.Chart: Seat share and vote share of BJP and TMC in 2019 and 2021 Perseverance: India’s best ever Olympics The pandemic delayed the Tokyo Olympics, which were originally scheduled for 2020. It also meant that our athletes were blocked access to their regular training facilities. When the Olympics did happen in 2021, they proved to be India’s best ever, not just in terms of the overall medals tally, but also the number of sports where Indians were able to prove themselves to be the best in the world. Tokyo 2021 also saw India break its jinx in track and field, with Neeaj Chopra winning no less than a gold medal in javelin throw. While there is absolutely nothing which takes away from individual heroics of the athletes which won medals at the Olympics, or the ones which could not but made us all take notice; the Indian women’s hockey team or Aditi Ashok in golf, for example, the overall performance is yet another vindication of the fact that Indian sport is slowly but steadily expanding its footprint at the global stage.

31-12-2021||India||Uttarakhand cook who was fired in ‘caste’ row reinstated||Rudrapur: A 32-year-old Dalit woman, who was fired as the cook in a government school in Uttarakhand 10 days ago after upper-caste students refused to eat meals cooked by her, was reinstated on Friday following widespread criticism of her removal.Her reappointment came a day after the police registered a First Information Report (FIR) against six named and 18-20 other unnamed– including a female block development committee (BDC) member and the president of the parent teacher association -- under the Scheduled Castes (SC) and the Scheduled Tribes (ST) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and 506 (criminal intimation), on a complaint filed by the Dalit woman, Sunita Devi.“We held a meeting of the parent teachers association and school management committee in the college and reinstated the Dalit woman as bhojanmata (midday meal cook) who was removed from her post on December 22,” said RC Purohit, chief education officer (CEO) of Champawat district.“I am so happy after all I have not only got justice but also will be able to financially help my family. Before my appointment and removal from bhojanmata post, I was not aware of the fact that a Dalit woman can apply for this post. My reappointment for the post has given me the strength to raise my voice for my own right,” Devi said. Devi had joined as bhojanmata (midday meal cook) in the government inter college (GIC) at Sukhidhang on December 13. She replaced Shakuntala Devi, an upper caste woman who retired after turning 60. On Sunita Devi’s first day, all students had the midday meal together.But a day later, some 40 upper caste students in classes 6 to 8 -- out of a total of 66 pupils in these classes -- stopped eating the meals and started bringing their tiffin boxes from home, sparking a row over caste discrimination in the area.She was subsequently fired by the education department on December 22, citing “procedural lapses” in her appointment. Two days later, Dalit students in the school boycotted the midday meal cooked by the upper caste woman who replaced Devi. The incident sparked widespread condemnation and allegations of caste bias. On Thursday, Mukesh Kumar, chairman of the state commission for scheduled castes, met Devi and told the police to file a case in the matter.“We have booked six named and 18-20 other persons, including a woman, under the SC/ST Act on the complaint of a bhojanmata (cook). A probe will be conducted by a circle officer (CO),” said sub-inspector (SI) Devendra Bisht, in-charge of Chalthi police outpost in Champawat district.Devi praised the police action. ”These people created trouble in my appointment and threatened me. So I approached the police. I will take my case back if they promise me in writing that they will not create any problems in future and will live harmoniously in the village as earlier,” she said.Among those named in the FIR were BDC member Deepa Joshi, parents-teachers association(PTA) chief Narendra Joshi, Mahesh Chaurakoti, Babloo Gahtori, Shankar Datt and Satish Chand, said Bisht. The FIR was filed on Thursday.Deputy inspector general of Kumaon range, Nilesh Anand Bharne, who was directed by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to probe into the matter, confirmed the FIR. “The case will be investigated at a high-priority level,” he added.Deepa Joshi refuted the allegations. “We have done nothing except raising voice against procedural lapses in Sunita Devi’s appointment. But it was made a case of caste discrimination by some elements. These elements have provoked her to lodge an FIR against us. We have full faith in the police probe,” she said.“Education authorities have reinstated Sunita Devi as per government’s norms. We have no problem and want our village atmosphere as it was earlier.

31-12-2021||India||Variant watch: Scotland study finds Omicron made a major shift||A new study by researchers in Scotland has found that the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 has undergone significant biological changes compared to older configurations of the virus, leading to not only the large immune resistance it is now established to have but even seemingly changing the way it infects cells. At the outset, these insights have an implication for the “pathogenesis (the way disease progresses) and clinical severity” of Covid-19 it causes, both of which have been seen to be milder. But it also demonstrates the coronavirus’s ability to be very highly adaptive, which means it can still significantly change the way it spreads and sickens us in the future. “The Omicron variant represents a major change in biological function and antigenicity of Sars-CoV-2 virus… Moreover, our work demonstrates that Sars-CoV-2 exhibits high antigenic and functional plasticity; further fundamental shifts in transmission and disease should be anticipated,” said the team led by researchers from MRC – University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research in the report.The researchers corroborate two findings that have been reported by several scientists in the last month – the variant is very resistant to antibodies from vaccinated people, and it is bad at infecting lung cells. The last factor is among reasons it may be leading to milder disease. ‘Switch in mechanism’ But, more importantly, they uncover a previously unknown insight into the mechanism by which it infects human cells. Normally, the Sars-CoV-2 has had two routes by which it does this. One involves an enzyme called TMRRS2 among the several steps from the point the virus latches on to cells till it fuses with the target. Till now, all variants have favoured this route.Omicron, however, takes the other route, using enzymes called cathepsins among the many steps of the infection process. The mechanistic difference has several implications. “This biological about-face may impact transmission, cellular tropism and pathogenesis,” the authors say in their report. In other words, it changes how it can transmit, which tissues it infects and how it grows in them, and the disease it leads to. We know it transmits faster, grows quickly in some parts of the respiratory systems but not the lungs, and leads to less severe disease.A particular implication of the mechanistic change is that the variant now no longer leads to the formation of syncitia, or giant cells -- at all. Even the variant that first spread around Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, led to some syncitia. Syncitia refers to the forming of giant infected cells that is linked to severe disease. The Delta variant was particularly stark for how it led to syncitia, and as a variant of concern (VOC), it is regarded as most likely to cause severe disease.Like most early studies, the report is yet to be peer-reviewed.New UK estimates on vaccines hospitalisationThe UK Health Security Agency released a new variant update on Friday, presenting the first vaccine efficacy estimates against hospitalisation for people infected with the variant. The headline number for the country is that three shots appeared to provide close to 90% protection from needing hospital admission.But the assessment found the risk of hospitalisation for those with two doses may considerably more, especially if their last dose was more than six months ago. “When combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, this (hospitalisation risk) was equivalent to vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation of 52% after one dose, 72% 2-to-24 weeks after dose 2, 52% 25+ weeks after dose 2, and 88% 2+ weeks after a booster dose,” said the briefing document.The data was based on a total of 815 individuals with laboratory-confirmed (sequencing, genotyping or SGTF) Omicron infections, who have been admitted or transferred from emergency departments. 
31-12-2021||India||GST Council defers tax hike on textiles||New Delhi The Goods and Services Tax Council on Friday deferred its decision to raise tax on textiles from January 1, but the bulk of footwear may become costlier from Saturday as GST on low-end products is set to jump from 5% to 12% on the first day of the New Year.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the 46th meeting of the GST Council was convened on short notice under the “emergency provisions” after Gujarat approached her with a proposal to defer the September decision of the council to put certain textile items under a higher tax slab to correct the inverted duty structure.The GST Council on September 17 announced its decision to correct the duty inversion on textiles and the footwear value chain from January 1. The move could have made both garments and footwear costlier as GST on them would have gone up from 5% to 12% in order to correct duty inversion.Higher duty on raw materials as compared to finished products leads to an inverted tax structure that makes it difficult for manufacturers to claim input tax credit (ITC), and the burden is ultimately passed on to the consumer. ITC allows a GST-registered business to claim levies already paid on inputs before making a final sale of the product and services that aims to prevent cascading of taxes.The Union finance minister, who is also the chairperson of the GST Council, said at the emergency meeting held on Friday, the Council decided “to retain the status quo” and not to make duty correction from 5% to 12% from January 1 in the case of textiles. “Textile was the only issue of discussion in this emergency meet,” she said.She said that the committee, which is looking into “rate rationalisation”, will review the issue of tax anomalies in the complex textile sector along with other items and submit its report by February. The report will be circulated to all members before the Council will take up the matter either by the end of February or sometime in March, she added.At the 45th meeting of the Council on September 17, the apex decision-making body on indirect tax matters also decided to set up two groups of ministers (GoMs) -- one will examine ways to rationalise tax rates and review exemptions to boost revenues and the other to discuss ways and means of using technology to improve compliances.Bimal Jain, chairman of the indirect tax committee at PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) said, “There is no deferment on GST rate from 5% to 12% on footwear w.e.f. January 1, 2022, which is also one of unorganised sector... this hike in GST rates will make footwear expensive for the common man.”MS Mani, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India, said it is necessary to find out a solution to the problems of inverted duty structure in the textile sector. “The decision to roll back the proposed GST rate increase case of the textile products would also make the footwear sector expect a similar treatment in future,” he added.Sitharaman said although it was a “brief meeting” with “only one agenda” some of the ministers did raise the issue of extending compensation to states beyond June 2022. “We’ve heard them. That wasn’t in the agenda, so there wasn’t any response from our side on that,” she added.Several states are seeking extension of the indirect tax compensation system beyond June 2022. As the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over, they fear a sudden drop in their GST receipts after the five-year guarantee period will end in June 2022. They want this period to be extended under the unforeseen circumstances by amending the GST law, between two and five years.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years, and assured them that their revenue shortfall would be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco.The textile ministry thanked the PM and the FM for considering the requests of industry stakeholders, especially in the present challenging time when the sector is on the path of recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-defers-tax-hike-on-textiles-101640971008831.html
31-12-2021||India||Another muted New Year's Eve as Covid tally continues to rise||New Delhi: India rang in a muted New Year at midnight on Saturday as the number of new cases in several parts of the country continued on a sharp rise, with officials saying the Omicron variant is now in community transmission in many cities, a conclusion also corroborated by genome surveillance trends.In all, around 19% of sequences submitted by India to a global genome testing database were of the Omicron variant, which spreads an estimated three times faster than other variants but is believed to be less than half as likely as Delta to lead to serious Covid-19.Also Read | Amid Covid-19 surge, govt tells states to set up 24x7 testing booths“The trends for India show that 18.7% of the Covid-19 positive samples that have been whole genome sequenced so far since the time aggressive sequencing began earlier this month, were positive for the heavily mutated Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2,” said a senior central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.The India samples are both from international travellers and from within the community that tested positive for Covid-19. “These are results of tests performed in all labs across the country, and is a mix of travellers and sentinel surveillance samples,” said the official.Among the cities that recorded a sharp spike were Delhi and Mumbai. The two cities receive the highest numbers of international passengers and the surge was expected since the variant originated in South Africa and took hold in the UK, from where it has likely been imported by infected travellers.On Friday, Delhi reported 1,796 new cases – in terms of average daily cases over a week, the count has increased 567%. In Mumbai, there were 5,428 new cases, with the rate of average daily cases having risen 437% in the most recent seven-day period.The surge has caused most cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, to limit or cancel New Year’s Eve celebrations for the second straight year. In Mumbai, officials announced people will not be allowed to gather on beaches, seafront or gardens between 5pm and 5am for the next fortnight. In Delhi, New Year parties in public places and businesses have been prohibited.HT reported on Thursday that more than half of community samples analysed by one large hospital in the last week were of Omicron. The proportion in Mumbai’s case was around 37%, officials there said.The official quoted above said people should guard against believing Omicron’s rise was a good sign because it can lead to milder disease. “Delta infected population does not mean people will not get the infection when Omicron is in circulation. Whatever immune capacity we have, it has not been able to protect people from getting infected with Omicron even in a city like Delhi that has shown 80-90% seroprevalence in recent surveys,” said the official.The person added that the rapid nature of Omicron’s spread would complicate containment efforts. “This is far more transmissible variant than what we have seen before; therefore, after a point, containment measures or contact tracing will be pointless. Each of us will have to look out for ourselves,” the official added.The government also advised states to boost testing efforts.Experts around the wold have stressed on the need to focus on mitigation measures – steps that can help manage the disease for those that need attention the most, since the variant is causing a smaller proportion of people to become seriously ill than before. Strategies to contain infections that can be mild or asymptomatic will involve huge numbers, be difficult to carry out and cause significant disruption.Experts in India said the third wave is very much here. “There are early signs of third wave with consistently increasing rate of transmission and rising test positivity, especially in urban areas. With the way cases are multiplying truly exponentially, third wave is almost here,” said Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar went on record to say the third wave had begun in his state. “Bihar has recorded the first Omicron case. Everyone has to be alert. The state is witnessing a sharp rise in cases, with the maximum being registered in Patna and Gaya. A large number of people from other states reside in these two places, and this could be a reason behind the spike in cases in these areas. The third Covid wave has begun in the state,” Kumar said.Preventive measures remain the same — masking up, maintaining physical distancing and hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded spaces – and will remain crucial, a second expert added. “We also have tools we did not have before—drugs and vaccines that can be updated quickly if needed,” said Gagandeep Kang, vaccine expert, Christian Medical College, Vellore.

On Thursday, Union health ministry joint secretary Luv Agarwal had flagged eight districts, which logged more than 10% weekly positivity rate. Six of these districts are from Mizoram. Agarwal also highlighted that weekly positivity rate in 14 districts was between 5-10%. Four of those districts are in Mizoram. “Data (on positivity rates and infections) changes every day. Since more of likely positive cases are tested, the rate may seem high,” Dr. Pachuau Lalmalsawma, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mizoram stated. On Friday, Mizoram recorded 243 new Covid-19 cases, the highest among all states in the northeast and one death. There are 1,471 active cases in the state at present. Till date the state has recorded 141400 cases and 543 deaths. The state has not recorded any Omicron case till date, but the health department has taken measures to ensure that it doesn’t spread. “There’s regular screening at Aizawl airport with RAT tests done for arriving passengers. If tested negative, RT-PCR test is done. Those found positive are sent to quarantine for a week followed by another RT-PCR test. We have also set up separate facilities for quarantine and isolation,” said Dr Pachuau.

Here's what data reveals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Friday revealed that Omicron has overtaken Delta in a specific group of samples which were sent for genome sequencing. This comes as experts opined that Omicron in India has begun to replace Delta. However, the health ministry on Thursday said that Delta still was the dominant strain in India.As much as 55 per cent out of 282 samples of coronavirus patients from Mumbai, sent for genome sequencing, have tested positive for the Omicron variant, the BMC said. This was the seventh batch of samples sent to a lab at the Kasturba Hospital of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Out of 282 samples, 156 (55 per cent) were found to be of Omicron variant, 89 (32 per cent) of Delta Derivative and 37 (13 per cent) of Delta variant."The trend of an increasing number of Covid-19 cases shows that it is due to Omicron, which is replacing Delta in India and globally as well," official sources told news agency ANI.Omicron, first detected in South Africa, is known to be more transmissible than other variants of the virus. With its immuno-evasive nature, it is infecting vaccinated people as well, though the severity of the cases is mild.The first cases detected in India were of foreign origin clearly establishing the fact that they got the variant abroad. But now people without any travel history are testing positive for the Omicron variant. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said Omicron is spreading in the community.The trend is not exclusive to Delhi. In Mumbai too, people without travel history are testing positive for Omicron. According to BMC's Thursday data, As many as 141 Mumbai residents who had not travelled abroad recently tested positive for the Omicron variant of coronavirus. BMC has not confirmed the community spread of Omicron. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI that the BMC would be sending 375 more samples for genome sequencing to check if there has been a community spread of the Omicron variant. Community spread can be confirmed only after the report arrives, Kakani added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-omicron-is-spreading-so-fast-in-delhi-mumbai-here-s-what-data-reveals-101640970384587.html

It acknowledged, however, that the renewal of FCRA registration of MoC was refused on December 25, citing “adverse inputs”, and that it has not yet applied for a review.The registration of Missionaries of Charity, under FCRA vide Registration No 147120001, was valid up to October 31, 2021, according to the ministry. It added that the validity was subsequently extended to December 31, 2021, along with other FCRA associations whose renewal applications were pending renewal.The organisation also, in a statement, clarified “that the FCRA registration has neither been suspended nor cancelled. Further there is no freeze ordered by the ministry of home affairs on any of our bank accounts”. “We have been informed that our FCRA renewal application has not been approved. Therefore, as a measure to ensure there is no lapse, we have asked our centres not to operate any of the FC accounts until the matter is resolved,” it said.The government amended the FCRA in September 2020 to make the law stricter. A new provision in the law mandated that non-government organisations receiving foreign funding will have to operate bank accounts in State Bank of India in New Delhi only.On Thursday, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik directed all district collectors to ensure that no unit of the Missionaries of Charity operating in the state faces any financial crisis and, if necessary, to use the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-extends-validity-of-fcra-registration-of-ngos-till-march-31-101640969328523.html

The positivity rate shot over 2% after 221 days, the highest since May 24 (2.52%). On Thursday, Delhi recorded 1,313 cases and the positivity rate was at 1.73. The sharp rise comes as the national capital is welcoming the new year amid a mini lockdown. Data reveals the number of containment zones in Delhi has increased by more than 8 times in December. As on January 31, the number of Delhi's containment zones stands at 914. No fatality was reported on Friday. In December, the capital reported 9 deaths overall. The rise in cases in Delhi comes as the overall Covid tally of India is on a rise for the past few days. On December 1, when the national capital had logged 39 infections in a single day, the number of containment zones stood at 102. On December 30, the number of containment zones has increased to 823, while single-day infections have risen to 1,313.South district has the maximum number of active containment zones at 402, followed by west at 108 and New Delhi at 84 zones.

"I think it's very clear that we are going to have to learn to live with SARS-COv-2 virus and with the various variants that will continue to emerge from a virus that replicates at a very high level," Dr Kang said to news agency ANI, in an interview. The country is better prepared than it was two years ago and people should now learn to live of Covid-19, she said.The observation comes as India is on the threshold of a fresh possible wave likely to be driven by Omicron. In the last few days, the daily number of Covid cases has gone up remarkably, while Omicron cases are also shooting up. From January 3, India will be administering vaccines to children between the age of 15 and 18 years. From January 10, frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities will be given precaution doses.Even if Omicron may cause less severe disease: WHO chief scientist's warning"I believe we should be sending children to school, as generally COVID-19 infections are not much severe in children. Data available to inform a decision as to which vaccine should be used as a booster dose in India is very little," Dr Kang added."The important thing to remember is that we are not today in the same situation that we were in two years ago. We have a lot of tools available to us, a better understanding of how to use testing, what kinds of treatments work, and how to use and how to make vaccines that are effective," Dr Kang said.The impact of Omicron seems to be somewhat less severe than other variants, the virologist said. "I think the important thing to remember about third and other waves is that there will be a third or fourth or fifth. When you have viruses that are respiratory viruses, what we tend to see of the viruses is a great deal of seasonality. These are viruses that keep coming back time and again," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-waves-will-come-omicron-fortunately-less-severe-virologist-gagandeep-kang-101640965205314.html

31-12-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: January 1, 2000 — Hostages home, happy new year; tearful reunions at Delhi airport||New Delhi: The two Indian Airlines aircraft carrying the hostages, officials and the Union External Affairs Minister Mr Jaswant Singh arrived at the Indira Gandhi International Airport tonight bringing to an end eight-days long hijack drama which ended earlier this evening following the release of three militants in Kandahar. Moving scenes were witnessed as the hostages were reunited with their family members. Some of the released passengers had to be rushed straight to hospitals as they needed immediate medical attention. While one plane carrying 101 passengers landed shortly before 9 p m. the second aircraft arrived 10 minutes later. Many of the passengers were reluctant to speak about their captivity and expressed happiness that they had reached the Indian capital safely. Some of the hostages were critical about the government’s inordinate delay in arriving at the settlement. “Our government has failed. It took more than three days for any government representative to even come to Kandahar and check out our well being”, said Daman Soni, soon after being embraced into the fold of his family. His son Satish, suffering from chronic kidney, was wheeled into a waiting ambulance on a wheel chair.Daman Soni, who was sitting next to the slain Ripun Katyal, recalled, “He kept crying for water for more than two hours before he finally bled to death in front of us. There was nothing we could do.” Among the significant details that the released hostages revealed was that the number of weapons carried by the hijackers increased at Kandahar. “Before the plane reached Kandahar the hijackers had only one pistol, two knives and grenades. But once there, they suddenly had more pistols and grenades,” recalled Chander Chhabra, another released passenger. While the hijackers were not harsh with the passengers, one of the released hostages said, “They would keep asking to put on the blind-folds on different occasions and whenever there was a stalemate in the negotiations with the Indian government refusing their demands, they would threaten us, put knives at our throats and pistols at our temples.” About the food and sanitation conditions, N Mahesh, who had gone to Kathmandu on his honeymoon, with his wife, Neelima, said, “Vegetarians were literally starving. They gave us only beef.” Sunil Sharma, a slightly built passenger, who appeared even more haggard after his ordeal, said, “Maybe we could have overpowered them if we had been able to talk freely with each other. But if a pistol is put to your head, you do feel scared.” In a highly surcharged atmosphere some cried, others tried to smile as they came out of the special aircraft. The passengers were put in cars at the Indira Gandhi Airport where stand-by ambulances were there to meet any emergency.

31-12-2021||India||In 2021, a countrywide vaccination drive of immense value||December 31, 2021 marks exactly two years since the day that China confirmed that it was trying to ascertain the cause of an “unidentified pneumonia outbreak” in Wuhan. Since then, the Covid-disease causing coronavirus has redefined that world as we know it. In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, countries saw an unprecedented health crisis, which sparked lockdowns across the globe and led to widespread economic disruption whose effects we’re still reeling under. And while 2020 will be remembered about how the world grappled with containing a new virus, 2021 will go down in history as the year we fought back — it will be remembered as the year of the vaccines. In India, the first shot of the Covid19 vaccine was administered outside of a trial setting on January 16, 2021. The first recipients of the shots were the millions of health care and front-line workers who were directly dealing with Covid patients. A total of 191,181 people were given shots on the very first day. Through the next month-and-a-half, the phase one of the drive delivered shots to 11.8 million this group. Starting March 1, phase two of the drive partially opened it to the public — it covered those above the age of 60 years and people between the ages of 45 and 60 years with one or more qualifying comorbidities. To cover the normal populace, an online registration system was kicked off using the (till then) contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu and the Co-WIN website. The third phase of the drive made everyone above the age of 45 years eligible for a shot starting April 1. The biggest boost to the drive, however, was given when the drive was thrown open to all adults from May 1. On the first day of registration, nearly 13.3 million people booked their vaccine slots. By August 6, more than 500 million doses had been administered across the country under what was being dubbed as the world’s largest vaccination drive. In another two-and-a-half months, India’s dose administration had soared to a billion. In absolute numbers, the billion (100 crore) shots placed India as the second country in the world (next to China with 2.2 billion shots administered till October 21) in terms of total Covid-19 vaccine doses administered. The vaccines were administered in roughly 430,000 centres and a total of at least around 2 million health workers were directly involved in the process. At the time of this piece going to print, this number stands at nearly 1.44 billion doses. These 1,437,514,611 shots of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered to 841 million people. When these numbers are seen alongside India’s projected adult population (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population) of 940 million by 2021, this means that nearly one in nine persons in the country (89.5%) above the age of 18 years have received a vaccine shot — 63.4% are fully vaccinated and another 26.1% partially vaccinated. But the headline number on coverage glosses over wide variations in coverage across the country. Himachal Pradesh leads the country in not only overall coverage, but also the proportion of people fully vaccinated — with the state’s entire adult population fully vaccinated with both doses. Among India’s major states, four — Jammu & Kashmir, Telangana, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh — have achieved single-dose coverage of their entire populations, while their respective two-dose coverage stands at 92.7%, 66.9%, 72.8%, and 74.2%. At the other end of the spectrum, North-East states (excluding Assam) have the lowest overall coverage of their populations (69.9%) by at least one dose. They are followed by Jharkhand (74% coverage with at least one shot), Punjab (75%), Bihar (78.4%) and Tamil Nadu (85.8%), as per CoWIN data till late December 29.But despite all this, India’s vaccination drive has hardly been devoid of challenges. One of the largest issues that has plagued the drive has been the patchy rate of vaccination. At times, it has soared to averaging more than 10 million doses a day, and other times, it has dropped to under 1.4 million shots a day. By the end of September, when India was averaging administering 10 million shots a day, it looked like the country was set to hit its target of fully vaccinating everyone by the end of the year. But then, by early October this pace dropped to under 3 million (government officials attributed the festive season for the drop). Another reason for the patchy pace (at least in the initial weeks) was supply. At the start of Phase 4, several states, including Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh announced that they would delay their wider roll-outs of vaccines for all adults to later in May as they were apprehensive about supplies. States and the Centre were involved in public spats over supply issues. Both these issues, however, appear to be behind the country now. Average vaccination pace has been decent in recent weeks (around 7 million/day), while supply issues appear to have been sorted (at the time of writing this article, states have with them a surplus of 177 million doses). But such a massive surplus of supply with states may be pointing to a problem in itself. Even though close to 90% of the country has received first shots, the government has been trying hard in the past week to make the final 10%-or-so to come to the vaccine centres (which is evident in the fall in single dose administration rate – from 6 million/day in September to 1.6 million/day in the past week). Furthermore, several states are struggling to get the people who have their second dose overdue to come out and get fully vaccinated. To tackle both these issues, the government has kicked off a door-to-door campaign for last-mile outreach, which assumes a lot more importance at a time when the world is grappling with a new highly infectious variant of Sars-CoV-2. And this same surplus of doses may also hold the answer to a critical question being asked with the new variant placing the world on alert — what must be done about booster shots? 2022 will bring us answers.

In such cases, the governments should increase rapid antigen testing and encourage people to use self-testing kits that have been approved by the government. Any individual presenting with fever with/without cough, headache, sore throat, breathlessness, bodyache, recent loss of taste or smell, fatigue and diarrhoea should be considered as suspect case of Covid-19 unless proven otherwise by confirmation or another etiology. All such individuals must be tested, the Centre said. "A rise in Covid-19 cases accompanied by an increase in positivity rate is being documented in various parts of the country. Early testing of suspect patients and their contacts and isolating them expeditiously are one of the key measures to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2," the letter said.Also Read | 14 cities in 8 states on govt’s Omicron watch"Based on the previous experience, it has been observed that if the number of the cases rise above a certain threshold, RTPCR-based testing leads to delays in confirming diagnosis due to its turnaround time of about 5-8 hours," it said.Listing out the symptoms which need to be tested, the Centre said while their results are awaited, they should be advised to isolate and follow the home isolation guideline of the health ministry.Starting from December 26, India is witnessing a sudden surge in the daily Covid toll, which is believed to be driven by Omicron, the latest variant of SARs-CoV-2. Experts believe Omicron has replaced Delta to be the dominant strain in the country as maximum cases reported now are of the Omicron variant. As on Friday, India's Omicron tally stands at 1,270 while the country recorded 16,764 new infections and 220 daily fatalities. The sudden rise in the cases has triggered apprehension that the third wave of the pandemic has begun in the country. The Centre on Thursday said the surge in India could be linked to the global surge but there is no need to panic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-cases-of-fever-body-ache-to-be-tested-for-covid-centre-writes-to-states-lists-8-symptoms-101640958252042.html
31-12-2021||India||Govt will not extend Dec 31 deadline for filing I-T returns: Revenue Secretary||The Union finance ministry on Friday said the last date for filing income-tax returns is December 31, 2021 and it will not be extended further due to the rising cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 as the entire process is online and has so far generated huge taxpayers’ response.“There is absolutely no proposal to extend the date,” Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said. The extended deadline for filing income tax returns by individuals will end on Friday midnight.Bajaj said the number of income-tax returns (ITRs) filed this year is considerably higher compared to last year, signifying a smooth filing process; hence there is no reason for extending the deadline.“Look the ITR return filing is going on very smoothly. Let me tell you, by 3 pm [on Friday] 5.62 crore returns have already been filed in total, and today itself people have filed more than 20 lakh returns, which is the highest. And in the last one hour 3.44 lakh returns have been filed. So, if returns are being filed in such numbers, I see no reason for anybody to claim [missing deadline for technical reasons],” he said.He compared return filings this year with the previous year to prove the point that the system is efficient and several people have already met the deadline. “Last year, [as] on 30th of December, 4.83 crore returns were filed this year 5.43 [crore] returns have been filed. So, 60 lakh more returns have been filed on the same [period] as compared to the last year when the last year also the closing date was the same,” he said.Even as the filing will continue till Friday midnight, the ITR numbers have already crossed 5.62 crore by Friday afternoon as compared 4.93 crore figure achieved on December 31, 2020, he said.“I expect another at least 20-25 lakh returns to come by 12 in the night. And, I think, the figures that we are anticipating would have come... The return filing is going on very smoothly. There is absolutely no proposal to extend the date. And I’m sure, through this message the other people [those who have not yet filed returns] also would now be filing their returns,” he said.On a question that some people may have faced difficulties in filing their returns due to the latest spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, Bajaj said: “You tell me, ... how is Omicron stopping you?... You have to sit on your laptop to file the return. Your chartered accountant also has to do that. What is the reason that we are asking?” he said.“I am also OK if the returns are less by 1 crore. The returns are not less by 1 crore. The returns are more than last year,” he added.He said that there are no technical issues stopping people from filing returns. “I’m telling you, if there’s a technical glitch, I’m watching the figures every one hour. So the figures are going up to 2 lakh, 2.5 lakh, 3 lakhs, 3.5 lakh. Where are these numbers coming from?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-will-not-extend-dec-31-deadline-for-filing-i-t-returns-revenue-secretary-101640958173034.html

The claim of such expenses does not seem to be appropriate, the CBDT said.The tax sleeths found evidence with regard to the inflation of expenses, payments on behalf of the associated enterprises that led to the reduction of taxable profits of the Indian mobile handset manufacturing company. Such an amount could be in excess of R.1,400 crore, the I-T department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-foreign-controlled-mobile-cos-could-face-action-for-violating-law-govt-101640956180610.html

31-12-2021||India||Chinese embassy's letter to MPs triggers strong reaction||A letter written by the Chinese embassy to several Indian lawmakers for attending a reception hosted by the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile triggered sharp political reactions on Friday, with a prominent parliamentarian slamming the mission for commenting on a matter in which it does not have a locus standi.At least six MPs from various political parties attended the dinner reception in Delhi last week.The Chinese embassy, in a letter to some of the members of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet, expressed concern over their attendance at the event and asked them to refrain from providing support to Tibetan forces.Sujeet Kumar, the convenor of the forum, said the Chinese embassy has no locus standi to write to an Indian MP.There was no immediate reaction from the government on the issue. Generally, India does not approve of any foreign embassy commenting on the country's internal matters.The Chinese embassy's letter came in the backdrop of strain in ties between the two countries following the eastern Ladakh border row.Kumar, a BJD MP, said he himself has not received the letter but several other members of Parliament have got it."I personally treat the letter with the contempt it deserves. It is not the first time the embassy has written to me, it has written to me several times. The embassy does not have any locus standi to write to an Indian parliamentarian. If it had any issue, it could have written to the Ministry of External Affairs. It has violated the protocol," he told PTI.Underlining that the meeting of the Indian MPs with the Tibetan government-in-exile was not a political engagement, Kumar said it was aimed at promoting cultural and trade ties."We have not met the Tibetan government-in-exile on behalf of the Ministry of External Affairs or the Indian government. We attended the dinner as members of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet. Our meeting was aimed at promoting cultural and trade ties between India and Tibet."The forum is advocating for the preservation of Tibetan art, culture and philosophy. We do not want to engage in political activities but wish to increase people-to-people interaction," he said.Kumar added that as an Indian citizen, he can express his views and so can other MPs.He said the members of the forum do intend to visit Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh and meet the Dalai Lama.When contacted, Manish Tewari of the Congress, who is also a member of the forum, said, "My attention has been drawn to a report published in some English newspaper. Neither have I received any letter nor will I demean or diminish myself by responding to such imbecile missives. Had (Chinese Foreign Minister) Wang Yi written, perhaps I would have considered responding."After a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India, where he set up a government-in-exile.Beijing has in the past accused the Dalai Lama of indulging in "separatist" activities and trying to split Tibet, and considers him as a divisive figure.However, the Tibetan spiritual leader has insisted that he is not seeking independence but "genuine autonomy" for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet.Kumar, who was recently appointed as the convenor of the All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for Tibet, said the forum was almost defunct for several years, but it is being revived now."The forum was very active when late George Fernandes was its convenor. Later, I think it got defunct, it was not very active. Now, it is being revived. We have plans to visit Dharamshala and meet his holiness the Dalai Lama. We also want to talk about the cultural genocide in Tibet," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-embassy-s-letter-to-mps-triggers-strong-reaction-101640954647037.html
31-12-2021||India||A TIME OF CHURN: HEALTH CRISIS TO FARM CHAOS||The year began with guarded hope. On the first day of 2021, the government cleared two vaccines for wide use, paving the way for the world’s largest inoculation drive. Infections were falling, the administration seemed to be in control of mitigation efforts, and the economy was looking up.The year ended with guarded hope. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus hit India and nudged cases upwards, but initial trends suggested the mutant doesn’t cause very severe disease or mass hospitalisation. Nearly two-thirds of the country is fully vaccinated, nearly 90% has got one shot, and most governments have oxygen supplies, hospital beds and ventilators ready. There is fear, yes, but also optimism that the country will get through the Omicron wave.In the months in between, though, the country lurched from normalcy to despair repeatedly as the brutal Delta wave of infections exposed the limitations of India’s political class and governmental machinery, cemented the importance of the higher judiciary in everyday life, and underlined the pitfalls of prioritising political compulsions over health concerns.There were some surprises, too. Unlike 2020, political developments were not intimately tied to the pandemic; the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued to be the primary pole in Indian politics but its expansive ambitions were checked by a cohort of feisty regional leaders. The most significant concession from the government was won not at the polling booth but from street-side protest sites.But largely, 2021 will be remembered for the second wave of the pandemic and the harsh lessons it had for the government, politicians and citizens. If 2020 was the year of the government, which determined when you could go out, which places you could visit and how you could travel, 2021 showed the limits of that power when faced with a once-in-a-generation health crisis.As cases and deaths rose steadily in March and April, depleting medicine stocks, oxygen supplies and hospital beds, ordinary people increasingly found that traditional support structures had collapsed. The poor and the underprivileged were, of course, the worst hit, but even middle-class folks in big cities found that phone calls to important people were not enough to assure them of quality medical help. The local politician receded from view and even senior leaders and ministers struggled to secure hospital beds or oxygen cylinders. Volunteer groups tried to fill the vacuum but it was clear that the government and political class were overwhelmed and found wanting.The impact of this was devastating in the short term, with reports indicating that several people died in their homes without adequate medical care and others struggled to even give a decent burial to their loved ones. But it is yet to be seen if this tragedy also engendered a fundamental breakdown in the trust compact between the citizen and the politician in the long term, or whether it was perceived simply as an incumbency issue that can be resolved by voting for another politician in the next election.This breakdown of trust between ordinary citizens and the political class was also manifested in the expanded role of the judiciary. When hospitals ran out of oxygen at midnight, they approached the courts. When deaths due to oxygen ravaged major hospitals, patients approached the courts. When people were outraged by election rallies or religious events in the middle of the second wave, they approached the courts. When the vaccination efforts were fumbling due to a complex web of rules and procurement problems, the courts stepped in.The story of governance in 2021, therefore, is one that must include its legal fraternity, for courts shaped the country’s pandemic response not only by its orders, but also by its criticism, advice and statements on critical policy initiatives. Be it oxygen-related deaths, inoculation efforts or Covid compensation, the court’s stamp of authority was visible everywhere.To be sure, this is not to say that politics receded to the background this year. Through most of the second wave, political parties fought a fierce election battle in West Bengal, considered by many as the BJP’s final frontier. Though polls were also on in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Puducherry, attention was focused on Bengal as Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) checked the BJP from breaching its citadel. The TMC’s resounding victory was a reality check to the BJP and a reminder to Opposition parties that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hold on national politics was unmatched, regional parties with strong sub-national agendas and rooted leaders could hold their own against the country’s ruling party. Though the BJP retained power in Assam, the victories of Banerjee, MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu and Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala energised the Opposition. Most of the subsequent months saw a realignment of Opposition politics with Banerjee seeking to chip away at the Congress’s strengths and position herself as a national leader.But the most significant political moment this year didn’t involve the organised Opposition at all. In a surprise speech in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of three controversial farm laws that his government had enacted last year, and vigorously defended for 12 months. The withdrawal of the laws — the government still maintains they were key for agri reforms, and the farmers contend they would have led to corporate monopolies — was a huge, if unexpected, moment of triumph for thousands of farmers who were camped outside the Capital since late last year. This government is not known to walk back its policies. Its only notable concessions remain the 2015 land acquisition bill and a controversial policy for promotion of SC/STs.The successful stir by an organised, cohesive group of farmers brought back memories of the 1980s, the heyday of farm politics, and reminded people that despite lopsided power structures, citizen protest was still a potent way to grab the bully pulpit, and therefore, the attention of the government.
31-12-2021||India||Reading a virus: From Alpha to Omicron||An insurrection at the heart of the American democracy, a giant container ship wedged across the Suez Canal, a coup d’état in Myanmar, and humanity’s first powered flight on another planet — much of what happened in the first three-and-a-half months of 2021 was conspicuously unrelated to the pandemic that defined 2020.And why wouldn’t it? A sense of hope dominated the last few months of 2020 after the first coronavirus vaccines were approved and administered in some parts of the world. Countries opened up as shots were delivered into outstretched arms, literally and figuratively.At the same time, between January and March 2021, a particular configuration of the Sars-CoV-2 virus began circulating in India, helped copiously by cavalier crowds at religious festivals, political rallies, and political leaders who declared a premature “victory” over the virus.The variant, then known as B.1.617 (eventually named Delta) was sowing the epidemiological seeds of what would turn into one of the most devastating outbreaks of Covid-19 in the world. This then was the story of 2021, which began in the shadow of Alpha, was consumed by Delta in spring, and spooked by Omicron at the end — evolutionary biology gave us a reality check and showed us that the pandemic is far from over. The year brought us a reminder of tribalism in a globalised world, where rich nations hoarded vaccines while poorer nations faced a severe lack of them.And along the way, some unanswered questions were addressed (How long will vaccines be effective for? Answer: six months, or less if the variant is Omicron), while some mysteries continued (Where and how did the Sars-CoV-2 originate? Answer: The jury is still out on that). The rise of the variantsThe first two variants of concern (VOC) designations came in the last days of 2020. On December 18, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated Alpha and Beta variants (the Greek letters were assigned in mid-2021). Alpha, because it spread much more rapidly than the ancestral variant first seen in Wuhan, and Beta because it was more immune resistant than the ancestral virus seen in early 2020. In early 2021, a variant similar to Beta’s properties was designated as Gamma.Among the three, Alpha remained the most worrying as it drove new waves in countries where it took hold, prompting the return of country-specific travel bans first targeted against China when the coronavirus was first found in early 2020.In the scientific community, the variants changed the pandemic equation, triggering a rush of new research on what made them dangerous and what their traits meant for pandemic modelling.If the biggest scientific mystery of 2020 was how the virus caused wildly varying disease in people, the conundrum of 2021 was to decode how changes in the coronavirus’s genetic constitution influenced the way it spread, infected, and sickened us.The variants also exposed a glaring lack of understanding. The Delta variant spread through Maharashtra for much of the second half of March before it took hold in other parts of the country. All this while, the people in India had no idea that the seemingly inexplicable surge in cases was the result of a variant that was 50% more transmissible and was nearly twice as likely as the Alpha variant to lead to hospitalisation. Molecular biologists would later discover new traits that the coronavirus could pick up. Delta, for instance, had a mutation known as P681R, which triggers the formation of giant infected cells (called syncitia). Such infected cells are exhaled more readily and caused a more serious infection.In November, the coronavirus changed again, becoming even more transmissible than Delta as it tore through a South African province. The variant, designated as Omicron on November 26, also lead to a huge drop in the efficacy of vaccine but, providentially, was significantly less severe. The increased transmissibility was the result of yet another trick the virus seems to have hidden up its sleeve: the ability to spread between cells.Missing vaccinesExcept for the United States and the United Kingdom, most countries began their coronavirus vaccination campaigns in 2021. Sometime in the first week of November, the world crossed a significant milestone — over 7 billion doses, enough to vaccinate the global population with one dose — had been delivered.At the same time, however, 81 low and low-and-middle income countries (LIC and LMIC), excluding India, had received a mere 864 million doses, according to estimates by the Unicef’s Covid-19 vaccine market dashboard on November 11.Two months prior to the Unicef’s assessment, science analytics company Airfinity released forecasts that showed the richest nations in the world — US, UK, EU and Japan — would together have 1.2 billion surplus doses by the end of the year, even if they gave doses to children and boosters to all adults.World leaders, including those from WHO, have repeatedly warned that the continuing vaccine inequity will prolong the pandemic, raising the chances of new variants arising as the virus continues to spread in large unvaccinated populations in poorer countries.“We have often said as long as vaccine inequity persists, the more opportunity the virus has to spread and mutate in ways no one can prevent or predict. And so, we have Omicron,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on December 5. As we move into 2022, our biggest challenge will be simply this — we must not let down the best human endeavour of our times.The breakthrough drugsDuring the first year of the pandemic, the only drugs that helped were steroids and interleukin (IL) inhibitors. While these significantly improved the chances of survival, it was not because they could target the virus itself, but because they suppressed the deadly immune reaction towards the virus. In 2021, Merck and Pfizer struck clinical trial success. Merck’s Molnupiravir reduced the chances of hospitalisation in unvaccinated people and with at least one comorbidity by 30% if administered early. Pfizer’s Paxlovid led to an 89% reduction in risk of hospitalisation and death. Both drugs limit the Sars-CoV-2 virus’ ability to replicate. Molnupiravir does so by introducing errors in the pathogen’s genetic code, while Paxlovid inhibits an enzyme crucial to the virus’ function and reproduction. Both will soon be available in high volumes after its makers released the patents to the United Nations (UN) patent pool, allowing generics makers around the world to churn out the pills.Protecting the childrenThis year, countries around the world began vaccinating children. The wave of child immunisations began in the summer shortly after Pfizer-BioNTech released data that showed that their vaccines were safe and effective in some younger age groups. By December, all of the European Union, the UK and the US have covered most of their 12-plus age group. The UK has even begun offering booster doses to anyone above the age of 16. The World Health Organization was initially reluctant to endorse the move due to vaccine supply inequity. Adults, who are at significantly higher risk of Covid-19 have not been covered adequately in many parts of the world. But by November, the agency changed its stance, saying countries benefitted from immunising children and adolescents in “their specific epidemiological and social context”. The gains of vaccinating children and adolescents go beyond the direct health benefits: it may reduce transmission, help reduce mitigation measures in schools, and minimize disruption to education.The waning of vaccinesThe year reinforced the undeniable benefits of the coronavirus vaccine even though there were large pockets of vaccine scepticism in some countries, like the US and in India. The UK, on the other hand, showed how much of a difference vaccines made: the deadliest wave UK had was in early 2021 with the Alpha variant, which while more transmissible than the Wuhan version was hardly the worst the country was hit with. That was Delta, which was almost as highly transmissible and significantly more virulent. But Alpha caused over 1,200 deaths a day and Delta’s force was blunted, with peak deaths around 200 a day. The difference? More people were vaccinated during the Delta wave. The big question is how long does this last? By July and August, studies began to show antibodies waning, especially in those whose doses were taken six months ago. Still, people remained significantly protected from severe disease. But the waning pushed many countries to start booster doses. As of December-end, at least 92 countries in the world have administered boosters, according to Our World in Data, and not all of them are rich western countries.The origins brouhahaHow did the Sars-CoV-2 come to be? Did it come from bats that perhaps infected a second unknown animal (likely a pangolin) before it made its way to humans in Wuhan? Was it created in a lab as part of research, or, worse still, deliberately? The controversy around the coronavirus’s genesis continued well into the second year of the pandemic, at times raising pertinent questions but often straying into the realm of the absurd. In March, the WHO released a much-awaited report of a fact-finding mission that went to China. The report concluded that the virus likely came from an animal, but further studies and data were required. The saga even drew in the new US President, Joe Biden, to a posture similar to his bitter rival and predecessor, Donald Trump. Science has signalled that the first theory — originating in bats followed by an intermediate host — is the most likely. In fact, a discovery in Laos, published in September, might just put a lid on the controversy for good. Scientists there found three viruses in bats that are more similar to Sars-CoV-2 than any other known viruses. Not only that, they are also directly infectious to humans via the same mechanisms the Covid-19 virus uses to infect human cells.

His lawyer advocate Anant Malik has released a press statement in which Chandrashekhar said why the jail officials who took money from him are not probed. Why ex-Ranbaxy promoter's wife Aditi Singh who paid ₹200 crore to him was not being probed, Sukesh said in the statement, news agency ANI reported. Chandrashekhar said a lot is being said and dictated about him but it is wrong to say that he is a "conman" or "Thug" as he has not been convicted yet.In the statement, he said he was in a relationship with Bollywood actor Jacqueline Fernandez and his personal relationship has no bearing on the criminal case.Sukesh said he worked as a corporate lobbyist with multiple corporate houses in India and abroad. As a lobbyist, he served as a bridge between corporate houses and the government of different states. He claimed to have good relationships with several political parties and various business families, ANI reported.'Can't breathe': Conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar who ran extortion racket from jail says he's being harassed at TiharThe ED is investigating the ₹200 crore extortion case and during the course of the probe, several sensational details have been revealed by the central agency. Apart from Sukesh's closeness to Jacqueline Fernandez, Nora Fatehi and several other Bollywood actors whom Sukesh used to send expensive gifts, it has been revealed that Sukesh used a spoofing app to call his targets impersonating government officials. Jacqueline Fernandez has already been questioned in connection with the case. According to reports, the actor said she too was conned by Sukesh as Sukesh claimed to be the owner of Sun Tv and approached her with a film offer. ED investigation revealed that Sukesh called Aditi Singh, whom he met in the jail as Singh came to visit her husband, from his barrack in Rohini Jail, posing as a government officer. Promising help in early bail for her husband, he reportedly took ₹200 crore from Singh. All this happened from his spacious barrack inside Rohini where he used to pay crores to jail officials who were aiding him in running his racket. If jail officials took crores from him, if Aditi Singh paid ₹200 crore to him, then they should also be probed, Sukesh Chandrashekhar said in his statement. He also claimed that he is being pressured and extorted by jail officials but no action was taken against the officers involved. Chandrashekhar said that he will be approaching court against ED seizure of assets. Earlier, he said he was being tortured in Rohini Jail. It has been revealed that Sukesh and his wife actor Leena Maria Paul have been conning people for several years and have been arrested in past too. Sukesh's first major scam was the AIADMK bribery case in which he took money from the TTV Dinakaran faction promising that he would bribe Election Commission officials to give the two leaves symbol of the party to this faction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-conman-was-in-a-relationship-with-jacqueline-fernandez-says-sukesh-chandrashekhar-101640953323136.html

Cybercriminals are always finding new ways to defraud citizens. As nowadays Omicron variant themed cybercrimes are increasing every day. Cybercriminals are employing various tactics to perpetrate cybercrimes to capitalize on the rapidly evolving situation to defraud innocent victims."Further, it mentioned that fraudsters send emails regarding PCR testing for Omicron with the attached malicious links and malicious files."Government and Private Health Services are being mimicked (e.g. their names are used as senders) in such attempts to scam innocent citizens. Potential victims clicking on the links are pointed towards fake websites created by fraudsters that look similar to government/private health services, where citizens can apply for a COVID-19 Omicron PCR test"."The lure of a free Omicron PCR test allowing citizens to avoid Omicron related restrictions imposed by governments is presented to potential victims. Cybercriminals attain personal details and banking credentials through this method for committing further cybercrimes such as financial cyber frauds, identity theft, etc," it says.The government advised people to scrutinize the domain name and URL to check the authenticity of the websites and report any such incidents on the cybercrime.gov.in portal.Meanwhile, India's Omicron case tally has surpassed 1,200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-issues-advisory-against-cybercriminals-offering-free-omicron-test-101640952918227.html

The minister said out of 107, 29 people came from the United Arab Emirates, 23 from the United Kingdom and the others from different countries. Seven people contracted the new variant through contact. She said the maximum number of cases was reported from Ernakulam at 37 followed by Thiruvananthapuram district at 26. One person also recovered from the infection she said adding all tests were held at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the state capital. The minister asked people to be vigilant and exercise utmost caution during the New Year and other festivities. “There is no need for any panic. But we have to be extremely careful. We have to be vigilant and follow Covid-appropriate behvavior,” she said. New cases were reported a day after the state announced night curfew for four days, December 30 to January 2. People close to the government said the curbs are likely to be extended if the state reports more such cases. Kerala detected the first case of the new variant on December 7 and the number of infections crossed 100 in less than a month. Experts said Omicron cases are likely to peak in the state in two months. The government said it has taken enough precautions to meet the exigency. The minister indicated that the state will start vaccination of children below 18 from January 3 and all arrangements have been done. At least 98 per cent of the eligible population in the state received the first dose of the vaccine and 77 per cent have received both. Health experts said the good vaccination rate will help contain the new threat of Omicron but they have also warned that it is too early to lower guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adds-44-more-omicron-cases-state-tally-climbs-to-107-101640952647008.html

Sounding an alarm for countries which are beginning to feel the heat of Omicron, Dr Swaminathan said, "Though Omicron may cause less severe disease, a small % of a huge number is still very large and can overwhelm health systems." Congratulating health workers, the chief scientist said vaccination protects against hospitalisation and death -- be it caused by Omicron, Delta or any other variant of covid. Hospitalizations are also rising, mostly in unvaccinated people. Though #Omicron may cause less severe disease, a small % of a huge number is still very large & can overwhelm health systems.Kudos to health workers around the world for two years of service! https://t.co/rP2ztb9itv'Tsunami' of Covid cases may lead to collapse of health systems, says WHO chiefThe warning comes as India is seeing a sudden increase in the number of daily Covid cases, possibly driven by Omicron. As of Friday morning, India's Omicron tally stands at 1,270 with experts apprehending that Omicron has started replacing the Delta variant in the country already. Reports said almost 80 per cent of cases in India are Omicron now.Talking about the effectiveness of vaccines, Dr Swaminathan earlier tweeted, "As expected, T cell immunity holding up better against Omicron. This will protect us against severe disease. Please get vaccinated if you have not". In its latest epidemiological update, the world body said the risks related to the Omicron variant is very high and the variant has overtaken Delta in the US and the UK.The Centre on Thursday observed that India is seeing a sudden surge which has started only three days ago. Alerting states to take utmost precaution against the spread of Omicron in the festive season, the Centre said that there is no need to panic as the country is prepared to handle a surge. India's surge could be part of the global surge driven by Omicron, the health ministry has noted.The health ministry observed that though the number of Covid infections is increasing rapidly, the fatality rate is stable. This may be because of India's extensive vaccine coverage or the nature of the new variant or both. Omicron, first identified in South Africa on November 24, is known to be spreading fast across the world. The first Omicron cases in India were detected on December 2 and within a month, the variant has spread to over 1,000 people, whose samples have been genome-sequenced. Many experts believe the actual spread of the variant could be more than this as all samples are not being sent for genome sequencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-if-omicron-may-cause-less-severe-disease-who-chief-scientist-s-warning-101640950496239.html

31-12-2021||India||'Height of wall is height of money': Sitharaman talks on I-T raids, slams Akhilesh Yadav||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said when law enforcing agencies raid any place, they go only with actionable intelligence. Saying that the wrong man has been raided raises questions over the professionalism of the agency. "How does Uttar Pradesh former chief minister know that this is BJP's money? Is he the partner? Is he scared," Sitharaman said on the sidelines of the press conference of the GST council meet.Asserting that both the raids on the premises of Peeyush Jain which continued for almost a week and the raid on Pushpraj Jain on Friday have been based on specific inputs, the finance minister said, "Did they come empty-handed? Politicisation of such a thing is condemnable."On the timing of the raids coinciding with the election in the state, Sitharaman said, "Should we wait for a muhurtam to catch the thief?" The height of the wall is the height of the cash, Sitharaman said. On December 26, Kannauj-based perfume maker Peeyush Jain was raided and recovery of the huge amount of cash stunned the officials. Cash was hidden in underground bunkers, eyewitnesses accompanying the tax officials said. The finance ministry said the seizure of ₹177 crore unaccounted cash was the biggest ever seizure of cash by an enforcement agency.The raid became a political issue ahead of the Uttar Pradesh election as Peeyush Jain was linked with Samajwadi Party which the party denied.Akhilesh Yadav said the BJP got its own businessman raided by mistake. "By mistake, the BJP got its own businessman raided. Instead of SP leader Pushpraj Jain, it got Piyush Jain raided," Akhilesh said. Pushpraj Jain, on the other hand, is an SP MLC who launched Samajwadi perfume.Incidentally, Pushpraj Jain was raided on Friday as part of the income tax department's action on certain perfume traders in Uttar Pradesh. Searches were conducted on 30-40 premises in Kannauj, Kanpur, Delhi, Surat, Mumbai and a few other places.Both Peeyush Jain and Pushpraj Jain have their residential premises located at a distance of a few metres in the same locality in Kannauj."The raids were pre-determined. Information was coming here for the past few days that raids have started on SP leaders. Here, for the last two weeks, there have been raids on people associated with Samajwadi and whenever the BJP leaders from Delhi come to Uttar Pradesh they bring these agencies along. During this time, they are instructed to conduct raids," Akhilesh said on Friday. "Remember, when there were elections in West Bengal, all the agencies of Delhi had reached Bengal. It happened with Stalin in Tamil Nadu and the same thing happened in Bangalore," Akhilesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-akhilesh-yadav-scared-nirmala-sitharaman-on-i-t-raids-in-uttar-pradesh-101640946361322.html

However, all have also cautioned about the lack of extensive data and the need for more study into the variant.“Till now, we've received 360 patients out of which 110 were Omicron affected. 89 of these patients have been discharged. All are stable. Not a single patient required ICU support because their oxygen saturation level was perfectly normal,” news agency ANI quoted Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP.Also read | India’s Omicron tally mounts to 1,270; daily Covid-19 cases rise again by 16,764Notably, this was not the first time the doctor has made the observation. On December 22, when Delhi had reported over 30 Omicron cases, he said that patients who were fully vaccinated (with two doses) did not have any major complications and did not require admission in the intensive care unit (ICU), according to a report by ANI.Meanwhile, on Friday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said that 320 Omicron cases have been reported from the national capital of which 57 have been discharged or recovered. Also, the total caseload due to the new variant stood at 1,270 in the country. Maharashtra added the maximum to the national tally with 450 cases.In its latest press conference regarding the pandemic, the WHO reiterated its warning on hospitalisations due to the variant. “Right now, Delta and Omicron are twin threats that are driving up cases to record numbers, which again is leading to spikes in hospitalisations and deaths,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the UN health body. “I am highly concerned that Omicron being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta - is leading to a tsunami of cases,” he further said.Several countries, including the United States, the UK and several European nations, have reported surges in their daily Covid-19 infections. Lastly, France, where the infections have spiked, said on Friday that the Omicron has become the predominant variant in the country, the AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-single-patient-required-icu-delhi-doctor-says-oxygen-levels-among-omicron-patients-stable-101640943333570.html
31-12-2021||India||Public hearing on January 27 for Great Nicobar development project||NEW DELHI: Great Nicobar’s development will have environmental impacts, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report has said ahead of a public hearing on January 27 for a project involving the construction of an International Container Transhipment Terminal, a greenfield airport, a residential township and a 450 MVA gas/solar-based power plant there. NITI Aayog has conceptualised the Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands project. “The development of Great Nicobar will have environmental impacts. The holistic master plan enables environmentally and socio-culturally sustainable development and identifies effective mitigating measures for any anticipated negative impacts,” said the EIA. It added the development of Great Nicobar Island, which is one of India’s most ecologically fragile and biologically diverse regions. requires a sensitive, holistic approach. The EIA noted the island is home to a dwindling number of indigenous people. “Development plans must not only consider the impact of growth on these people but also generate benefits for them as well as for future in-migrants and investors.” Many reserved areas are expected to be de-notified for the project. They include land under the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve and a tribal reserve. Around 81.74% of the island covers national parks, reserves and forests. The EIA said 15.02% of the forest land has to be diverted for the project. An area of 166.10 sq km is required for developmental activities in the first phase. This includes 84.10 square km of land under tribal reserved areas ​inhabited by the Nicobarese and Shompen tribes with a population of 1094 and 237. An area of 11.032 sq km of the tribal reserve also falls within revenue villages and is required to be de-notified. The administration has proposed to re-notify 45.23 sq km of land in Campbell Bay and Galathea National Parks and 31.73 sq km of land outside the project area de-notified in 1972 to compensate for the loss. Greater Nicobar Island has tropical wet evergreen forests, mountain ranges reaching a height of nearly 650m above sea level, and coastal plains. “The tract is rich in plant diversity and fosters a number of rare and endemic species, including Cyathea albosetacea (tree fern) and Phalaenopsis speciosa (orchid). A total of 14 species of mammals, 71 species of birds, 26 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibians, and 113 species of fish have been reported. The region also harbours a large number of endemic and endangered species of fauna,” the EIA said. There are 11 species of mammals, 32 species of birds, seven species of reptiles and four species of amphibians that are endemic including the Crab-eating Macaque, Nicobar Tree Shrew, Dugong, Nicobar Megapode, Serpent Eagle, salt-water crocodile, marine turtles and Reticulated Python. The region also has coral reefs with varied thicknesses and diversity. In a few areas, new coral recruits have also been seen. Along the coastal beaches of Nicobar Island, Leatherback and Olive Ridley turtles are known to nest. Each Leatherback turtle lays about 100 eggs, and the success rate of the hatchlings was around 63.5% in 2020. Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO), which is developing the project, has said it is critical because of the region’s strategic location adjacent to the Malacca Straits. Seven countries are close to Campbell Bay, which is the headquarters of the southernmost frontier of India. Also Read | Tweaks in green laws may dilute safeguards, warn expertsOfficials said foreign powers are strengthening and forging new diplomatic ties with other states in the Indian Ocean region, which India needs to counter by improving connectivity and the tourism sector as well as through economic development of the area. “We are conducting the public hearing on behalf of the project proponent ANIIDCO. It is mandatory to conduct public hearings for environmental clearance. People have a month to read the details of the project,” said an Andaman and Nicobar Pollution Control Committee member, requesting anonymity. Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said a proposal of this scale and intent required a socio-ecological assessment at the design and planning stage and not downstream in the decision-making process. “The public hearing and impact assessment process is being carried out in the shadow of the government’s intent to transform the demographic and ecological character of the islands. What will be up for the challenge will be whether the legal process and scientific assessments will be amenable to a predetermined outcome of the government’s version of holistic development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-hearing-on-january-27-for-great-nicobar-development-project-101640943466176.html

They also received a special allowance amounting to 25% of the cost of their air travel to attend the meetings before it was done away with when late Arun Jaitley was the finance minister in 2018.“The Rajya Sabha chairman has asked the secretariat to find out the rate of attendance when this allowance was in place.

Birla told the members that this proposal would be sent to the Rules Committee and General Purpose Committee for approval.“At Naidu’s meeting, much time was spent on discussing attendance at these meetings after Leader of the House and Union minister Piyush Goyal raised the topic,” said a person, who attended the meeting.Naidu was quoted as saying he has been closely monitoring the attendance at the meetings of the eight committees of Rajya Sabha. He noted the attendance has improved substantially over the last three years. Naidu said the committees are complementing the Parliament in its functions.

According to an official release, the university will be established at an estimated cost of ₹700 crore at the Salawa and Kaili villages of the Sardhana town in Meerut.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the sports university will have the capacity of training 1,080 sportspersons, including 540 women and 540 men.Modi had earlier said that inculcating sporting culture and establishing a world-class sporting infrastructure in all parts of the country is one of the key areas of focus for his government. The establishment of the Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in the poll-bound state is expected to be a major step towards fulfilling this vision.Named after field hockey legend Major Dhyan Chand, the sports university has been planned with all the modern, state-of-the-art sports infrastructure – including a synthetic hockey ground, football ground, separate grounds for basketball, volleyball, handball, and kabaddi.It also includes a lawn tennis court, gymnasium hall, a synthetic running stadium, swimming pool, a multipurpose hall and a cycling velodrome.According to the government release, the university will also house facilities for shooting, squash, gymnastics, weightlifting, archery, canoeing, and kayaking, among other facilities.Major Dhyan Chand, widely regarded as one of the greatest field hockey players in history, scored three Olympic gold medals for India – in 1928, 1932, and 1936 – at a time when the country dominated field hockey. Although he played for India, ‘The Wizard’ extended his influence abroad in the West, too – where he was called the “hockey's equivalent of Muhammad Ali”.In 1956, India awarded Major Dhyan Chand the country's third-highest civilian honour – the Padma Bhushan – and his birthday on August 29 is celebrated as National Sports Day every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-visit-meerut-on-sunday-lay-foundation-of-major-dhyan-chand-sports-university-101640934164957.html

Officials cited above said Multani, 45, has been charged with criminal conspiracy, waging war against India, and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the NIA’s First Information Report (FIR) filed on Thursday.Alleged bomber Gagandeep Singh, a dismissed policeman, was killed while six people were injured in the December 23 blast at the districts and sessions court complex in Ludhiana. Preliminary examination has suggested that 1.5kg of explosives was assembled in a plastic container to carry out the blast. Agencies were analysing some international made from Singh’s phone in the last few months.Also Read | Ludhiana blast accused assembled bomb in court washroom: Punjab police chiefIt is suspected the blast was carried out at the behest of Multani, who allegedly arranged the logistics remotely with the help of his contacts in Pakistan. Multani was earlier under investigation for terror-related incidents in Punjab this year apart from allegedly sending consignments of weapons, explosives, drugs, pistols, and hand grenades with the help of Pakistan-based operatives. A close associate of US-based SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, Multani is known as an expert in radicalising Sikh youth to take part in extremist activities.The Punjab police lodged two cases against Multani in February and August. One of the cases pertains to an alleged plot to kill farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal to spread unrest.Multani and his Pakistani associates are believed to have been allegedly planning to target Delhi and Mumbai as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ludhiana-court-blast-nia-files-case-against-banned-outfit-member-101640934405407.html

On Thursday night, Bihar became the latest state to report a case of the new variant.Meanwhile, India's daily tally of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) also continued to spike for a third consecutive day after 16,764 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, pushing the caseload to 34,838,804, according to the health ministry's update.More than 7,500 patients recovered and 220 succumbed to the viral disease, taking the cumulative count of recoveries and deaths to 34,266,363 and 481,080 respectively.

31-12-2021||India||Reports about highest tiger deaths in 2021 ‘lopsided’: Centre||The Union environment, forest, and climate change ministry on Thursday rejected as “lopsided” media reports that said the highest tiger deaths were recorded in the country in 2021.“While it is appreciated that figures as available on the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s website have been used in these reports, the manner in which it has been presented causes alarm and does not take into account the gamut of processes that go into dealing with tiger death in the country and the natural gains that have been made in tiger conservation, as a result of sustained technical and financial interventions by the Government of India,” the ministry said in a statement.It said out of 126 reported tiger deaths, 60 were due to poachers, accidents, animal-human conflict outside protected areas. The ministry added the reports ignored the process involved in ascribing tiger mortality cause. It said NTCA has a stringent protocol to ascribe the cause to a tiger’s death. The ministry underlined only after detailed analysis, the causes of the deaths of 60 tigers outside tiger reserves could be ascertained.Also Read: No entry in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve sans Covid-19 samplingThe statement referred to the government‘s efforts through NTCA and added the tiger population has been taken from “the brink to an assured path of recovery”. It cited the quadrennial All India Tiger Estimation in 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 and added the big cat population has shown a healthy annual growth rate of 6%. The ministry said it offsets natural losses and keeps tigers at the habitats at the carrying capacity level in the Indian context.The statement referred to the 2012-2021 period and said the average tiger deaths annually hover around 98, which is balanced “by the annual recruitment as highlighted by this robust growth rate”. It added NTCA has taken several steps under the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger to address poaching, which too, is significantly controlled “as seen in the confirmed poaching and seizure cases”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reports-about-highest-tiger-deaths-in-2021-lopsided-centre-101640923424178.html

31-12-2021||India||Afspa can still be repealed, says Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma. There’s a rider||As the Centre extended the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Afspa) for another six months in Nagaland, Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma on Thursday held out hope that the northeast could see the scrapping of the controversial law.“Even though there has been a six-month extension in Nagaland, it can still be repealed,” Conrad K Sangma told HT amid howls of protest in Nagaland that is still mourning the killing of civilians in a botched army operation and the ensuing violence.Sangma’s party, the National People's Party (NPP), is an alliance partner of Bharatiya Janata Party in Meghalaya which helped him come to power after the 2018 assembly elections. In Manipur, NPP which had four MLAs till recently - one of them crossed over to the BJP this week - supports the BJP government led by N Biren Singh. Conrad’s party plans to contest the Manipur elections scheduled for early next year on its own.Afspa doesn’t apply to Meghalaya any longer. For years, the law that kicks in once an area is notified as a “disturbed area”, was applicable within a 20 km wide belt of Meghalaya along the border with Assam.In 2018, the Centre completely removed Afspa from Meghalaya after 27 years. It is in force in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur (excluding seven assembly constituencies in Imphal) and parts of Arunachal Pradesh.Chief ministers of several northeastern states including Sangma spoke out against the law after 13 civilians were killed on December 4 in a botched counter-insurgency operation by the Indian Army in Nagaland’s Mon district.The central government subsequently decided to set up a committee to assess the possibility of withdrawing Afspa from the region.Sangma alluded to this panel to explain his optimism.“I am sure that when the situation comes where the review is done, and they (Centre) are actually able to take a decision, that it should be repealed then,” the chief minister said.Pointing out the extension of the ‘disturbed areas’ tag in Nagaland was just a routine procedure, he underscored: “Once that proposal or that review committee looks into it, the panel looks into it, I'm sure it'll come up separately.”In its notification extending the law, which shields security forces from prosecution without the central government’s sanction, the union home ministry said Nagaland was in a “disturbed and dangerous condition”.“The Central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole of the State of Nagaland is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary,” the government order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afspa-can-still-be-repealed-says-meghalaya-cm-conrad-sangma-there-s-a-rider-101640896017359.html
31-12-2021||India||Arvind Kejriwal to lead AAP's 'Shanti March' in Punjab's Patiala today||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will take out a ‘Shanti March’ in Punjab's Patiala on Friday, which comes days after the state witnessed the Ludhiana district court bombing and the sacrilege attempt at the Golden Temple in Amritsar.The AAP said its national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will lead the Shanti March on Friday and senior party leader Bhagwant Mann will also be present during the rally. Kejriwal is currently on a three-day visit to Punjab that started on Thursday and will end on Saturday.The AAP has said that both incidents of violence in Punjab were carried out under a conspiracy to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere in the state.The opposition party also hit out at the ruling Congress government by saying that its leaders are fighting amongst themselves. "Punjab needs an honest, strong government, which acts against those indulging in conspiracies," Arvind Kejriwal said on December 24.On December 18, a man lynched by a group of angry pilgrims after stepping inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple in Amritsar picked a sword and reached the area where a priest was reciting the holy Guru Granth Sahib.Hindustan Times reported last week that the deceased paid obeisance in the sanctum sanctorum of the shrine 17 times in the last four days before he committed the sacrilege bid on December 18.Five days later, one man died while six others were injured after an explosion took place inside the washroom on the second floor of the Ludhiana district court on December 23.The Punjab Police said that Gagandeep Singh, a former cop, was the bomber at the court complex. Singh, who was killed in the blast, was dismissed from service in 2019 in connection with a drugs case and spent two years in jail. He was released in September this year.Meanwhile, Jaswinder Singh Multani, a member of the banned outfit 'Sikhs for Justice', was arrested in Germany for his involvement in the Ludhiana court blast and plans to target locations in Delhi and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-lead-aap-s-shanti-march-in-punjab-s-patiala-today-101640908956036.html
31-12-2021||India||Sameer Wankhede's eventful stint with NCB to end today. A look back at his tenure||The tenure of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal chief Sameer Wankhede, which was marked by controversies, is set to end on Friday, December 31. Wankhede, a 2008-batch Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, had found himself in a spot following the arrest of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan in the drugs-on-cruise case.Earlier this month, Wankhede confirmed he will not seek an extension of his term with the NCB. It is not yet clear where he would be posted after his NCB deputation ends, as per officials following the matter.Sameer Wankhede's eventful tenure with the NCB is most notable for investigations into the alleged Bollywood drugs syndicate after actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death by suicide. Starting with actor Rhea Chakraborty, multiple high-profile Bollywood personalities were interrogated and arrested by the NCB under Wankhede, who was on a deputation to the central agency since September 2020.In October this year, a team led by Sameer Wankhede allegedly recovered drugs during a raid on a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and arrested Aryan Khan along with others. But subsequently, questions were raised about the credentials of independent witnesses used by the NCB during the raid, and it was also alleged that there was an attempt to extort money from Shah Rukh Khan by officials of the anti-drug agency.Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik also raised a barrage of allegations against Wankhede, alleging that the officer was born a Muslim but later forged a caste certificate to get a job in the Scheduled Caste (SC) quota.Although Wankhede denied the allegations and his father filed a defamation suit against Malik, the allegations caused an uproar on social media. Several high-profile cases, including that of Aryan Khan and that of Nawab Malik's son-in-law, were transferred from the NCB Mumbai to a special investigation team formed by the head office.Between August and December 2020, Wankhede arrested 96 and registered 28 cases. In 2021, Wankhede made 234 arrests, registered 117 cases, seized over 1,791kg drugs worth around ₹1,000 crore, and froze properties over ₹11 crore, the NCB has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sameer-wankhede-s-eventful-stint-with-ncb-to-end-today-a-look-back-at-his-tenure-101640911519964.html

31-12-2021||India||Red alert in 4 Tamil Nadu districts after heavy rain, Chennai inundated||A red alert has been issued in four districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, Kanchipuram, Thiruvallur and Chinglepet, as heavy rainfall inundated roads and subways in the capital city and its suburbs and three people were killed on Thursday.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin visited the flood control room of Greater Chennai Corporation on Thursday night to review the rain, relief, and rescue works in various parts of the city.State revenue and disaster management minister KKSSR Ramachandran said three people, including two women and a boy, died of electrocution in Chennai after the intense spell of rain, which may be one of the heaviest witnessed in recent years."A red alert has been issued for four districts of Tamil Nadu including Chennai, Kanchipuram, Thiruvallur, and Chinglepet in view of heavy rainfall. Three people have died due to electrocution today," Ramachandran said.As roads and subways were flooded and led to traffic congestion in the city and suburbs motorists struggled to manoeuvre their vehicles.Police said three subways were closed and in view of inundation and traffic moved at a snail's pace in at least 14 arterial city thoroughfares. Greater Chennai Corporation said more than 145 pumps were used to de-clog inundated locations.Metro authorities extended the train services by an hour till 12am to help passengers reach their destinations safely.Most areas in the city and suburbs began receiving rainfall in the afternoon and it was heavy to very heavy in several locations. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the highest rainfall of 17.65cm was recorded in MRC Nagar in Chennai.The IMD said it was 14.65cm and 10cm at Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam respectively. In other areas, including those falling under neighbouring Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts, the showers ranged from 1cm (Madhavaram) to 10cm (Nandanam). The rainfall data was recorded between 8.30am and 6.15pm on Thursday.According to the weather department, isolated heavy to very rainfall activity is likely to continue over north coastal Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of south coastal Andhra Pradesh during the next three days and decrease thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-alert-in-4-tamil-nadu-districts-after-heavy-rain-chennai-inundated-101640909842905.html

31-12-2021||India||Omicron has spread in the community: Jain||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has spread in the community, state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday, adding that most patients have had only minor symptoms, while none have so far needed oxygen support.Addressing a press briefing, Jain said more than half the positive samples analysed are of the Omicron variant, according to the latest genome sequencing report, which includes patients with no travel history.“The variant is gradually spreading in the community and its proportion will increase in the coming days,” said Jain.“None of the hospitalised patients have required oxygen... and most patients have only had minor symptoms. However, the most serious problem is that it is spreading much faster than the Delta variant,” he added.“There are around 200 [Omicron] patients hospitalised in Delhi, of whom 115 people who tested positive at the airport have isolated in hospital. Of these 200, 102 are from Delhi and 98 are from outside the city,” said Jain.Jain said that since the hospital occupancy is still low and most Omicron infections mild, the government will not issue a Level 2 [amber] alert under its Graded Response Action Plan for now.“A decision on imposing more curbs will be taken at a DDMA [Delhi Disaster Management Authority] meeting after monitoring the Covid-19 situation,” said Jain.The first phase of curbs under the action plan – the yellow alert - was triggered on Tuesday, putting in place a curfew from 10pm-5am, shutting schools, colleges, movie theatres and gyms, apart from curbs on public transit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/omicron-has-spread-in-the-community-jain-101640892842730.html

The state has 1,480 active cases, according to the union health ministry database.In a order issued by the special relief commissioner, the state government directed officials to carry out random checking of crowd and gatherings at public places such as picnic spots, malls, shopping complexes, hotels, clubs and restaurants.All social and religious gatherings will remain prohibited and no picnic in parks, nature clubs, beaches will be allowed. Also, no cultural and dance programmes of any sort would be organised in hotels or any other venue.“No educational institutions would organize excursions/ picnics till end of January 2022,” the notification said.The government also brought back night curfew in all urban areas of the state from 10pm to 5am. There will be no movement of vehicles except for exigencies on production of proper evidence.The government, however, has allowed political gatherings of not more than 100 people with full compliance to Covid protocols in view of panchayat polls scheduled to be held in February next year.The government said strict enforcement of Covid-19 safety protocols such as wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing of at least six feet between persons at public places will be ensured.

31-12-2021||India||Dec 31: What we know about the Omicron variant so far||New studies released this week now confirm what was thought to be the second reason why Omicron is likely to lead to milder disease than Delta did.The adaptive component of the human body continues to recognise cells infected by the new variant of concern (VOC), eliminating them before they multiply to such a large extent that the disease becomes severe.At play is what is known as the T Cell immunity, which has two sorts of cells – helper (CD4) and killer (CD8). These are different from antibodies, which are synthesised by B cells.The Omicron variant has mutations that can cheat the antibody response but, as the new studies show, they are still susceptible to the killer cells. At least partly, this explains why the disease is halted before it gets more serious.Studies published earlier this month showed the Omicron variant was significantly less capable in binding to lung cells and most of the people infected in hot spot regions of South Africa and UK were vaccinated or had a past infection -- two other factors attributed for the variant’s possibly decreased virulence.The first new study on T cells was carried out by researchers in South Africa, who took samples from a group of 70 people that included people with prior Covid-19 and full vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech and J&J vaccines.The researchers found that that “70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups” and that the intensity with which the T cells reacted with the Omicron variant was similar to magnitude of when they reacted with Beta or Delta variants, “despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations”.There was a fear that this would not happen – a virus that has changed drastically will be better able to fool the body’s defences. Omicron has 32-36 mutations in the spike protein (the protrusion that latches onto target cells) while Beta, the most resistant variant prior to Omicron, had only 11.Thankfully, the T cell response recognises all of the spike.The second study, by another group that was based at the La Jolla Institute in California but collaborated with the first group, had a more detailed quantification of the T cell response. They found that “84% and 85% of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were preserved”.How significant is this?It reinforces the need for vaccination. All vaccines elicit a repertoire of immune response, including B cell and T cell responses. People who may be completely immune naïve will lack the T cell response that the researchers found in their studies.The second is that the evolution of the S protein must be monitored to see the degree to which it changes. A spike that changes more of the “epitopes” – the locations that T cells recognise – would mean even this adaptive immune response would be lost.“The resilience of the T cell response demonstrated here also bodes well in the event that more highly mutated variants emerge in the future. We still need to see how long T cell immunity lasts, but after Sars1 it was still detectable after 17yrs,” said Wendy Burgers, one of the South African researchers in a tweet.The La Jolla team added in their report: “Nevertheless, the data also underline the need for continued surveillance and the potential danger posed by continued variant evolution that could result in further reduction of T cell responses.”
31-12-2021||India||SIT meets soldiers in Nagaland firing case||GUWAHATI: A special investigation team (SIT) set up by the Nagaland government on Thursday collected the statements of army officers and jawans who killed 14 civilians in a botched operation in the state’s Mon district earlier this month.The six-member SIT team recorded the statements at the Rainforest Research Institute at Jorhat in Assam, said army officials familiar with the matter. The proceedings are expected to continue on Friday.Also Read | Afspa renewed in Nagaland: GovtThe army and Nagaland Police refused to comment but people aware of developments said that the SIT collected the statements of seven to eight army personnel, including two officers who were allegedly part of the shooting at Oting in Mon district of Nagaland on December 4-5.“It is an ongoing (investigation). I can’t comment on it,” stated Nagaland director general of police T. John Longkumer. It was not clear whether the SIT interrogated the army personnel or only recorded their prepared statements.The 21 Para Special Force, which was part of the operation at Oting, are stationed in Jorhat. Nearly two dozen of its personnel are believed to have been part of the December 4 incident, when six villagers returning home from a local coal mine were shot dead, allegedly on suspicion of them being terrorists.Soon after the incident, angry villagers reached the spot and set ablaze two security vehicles, sparking off another round of firing by forces to “control the situation” in which at least six villagers and one soldier died. On the following day, a 14th civilian was killed and at least 35 people were injured in police firing when an angry mob went on a rampage and vandalised an Assam Rifles camp.The development came a day after the army court of inquiry (CoI) -- which is probing the incident -- recorded the statements of two witnesses at Tizit. The team headed by a major general also visited the site of the shooting.
31-12-2021||India||The year that was: BJP makes inroads, TRS takes on Centre in Telangana||The year began on a not-so-happy note for the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) headed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, following the not-so-impressive show by the party in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls. The TRS, which won just 56 out of the 150 seats in the GHMC as against 48 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), managed to grab the mayor and deputy mayor posts only with support of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, on February 11. The TRS, however, retained its supremacy, by winning two MLC seats under graduates’ quota in the elections held in March and also the by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat held in April. However, the state politics witnessed a major turning point with the expulsion of state health minister Eatala Rajender from the KCR cabinet on May 1 on charges of land encroachments. Subsequently, Rajender quit the TRS and also his state assembly membership to join the BJP. In July, firebrand Congress MP from Malkajgiri A Revanth Reddy took over as the new president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee. Though his appointment resulted in rumblings within the party, he soon took complete control of the party affairs and reconstituted the PCC completely. In the same month, a new regional party – YSR Telangana Party – was launched in Telangana by YS Sharmila, the sister of Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. She took up a series of protest dharnas prior to the launch of the party. On October 20, she kick-started a marathon padayatra (foot march) from Chevella, but had to suspend the same on November 10 due to the announcement of election schedule for the MLC elections under local bodies’ quota. She has not yet resumed her padayatra. Another interesting development in July was the announcement of a senior IPS officer RS Praveen Kumar that he was opting for voluntary retirement to enter politics. He joined the Bahujan Samaj Party a couple of weeks later and has since been attacking the TRS government. The launch of Dalit Bandhu, a major populist scheme by the KCR government, was yet another major development in Telangana this year. The scheme, aimed at direct transferring of ₹10 lakh into the accounts of eligible Dalit families, was launched on August 16, ahead of the by-elections to Huzurabad assembly seat aimed at defeating Eatala Rajender. However, the scheme did not fetch any electoral benefits to the TRS, as the party lost the by-elections to the BJP with Rajender winning the seat with a handsome margin on November 2. It was a huge setback to the TRS politically and the victory in the elections to 12 MLC seats held December was only a consolation for the ruling party. Following the defeat in the Huzurabad by-election, KCR entered into a direct confrontation with the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre on the latter’s alleged anti-farmer policies. He even announced payment of ₹3 lakh compensation to the families of north Indian farmers who lost their lives during the agitation on Delhi borders. Taking up the issue of the Centre’s indifferent attitude in paddy procurement from the state, the TRS staged agitations across the state and for the first time, KCR himself sat on a dharna in Hyderabad on November 18. His party MPs staged protests in Delhi and even joined the Congress-led opposition against the BJP. The TRS chief went to Tamil Nadu to hold talks with DMK leader and chief minister MK Stalin as part of building up anti-BJP front at the national level. As the year comes to an end, the TRS and the BJP have stepped up their offensive against each other, as the Congress party is struggling to overcome the internal wrangling. 
31-12-2021||India||14 cities in 8 states on govt’s Omicron watch||The Union government wrote to eight states and Union territories, asking them to enhance testing, strengthen hospital preparedness, and accelerate vaccinations after cities in their territories recorded a sharp surge in new Covid-19 cases, which officials said is likely to be because of the Omicron variant.India recorded 16,574 new cases on Thursday, the highest single-day tally in more than 70 days, with Maharashtra, Kerala, West Bengal and Delhi contributing the highest numbers. On Tuesday, the number of new cases was 12,987 and on Wednesday, it was 9,155, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.Also Read | Delhi, Mumbai's R-value exceeds 2 amid Omicron spike: What it means“We believe what we are witnessing is possibly part of the global rise in cases pushed by the Omicron variant,” said Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul, while speaking at the Union health ministry’s press briefing on Covid-19.
31-12-2021||India||Delays and virtual hearings, but rights and responses in focus||It was a defining moment for the Supreme Court this year as the unprecedented second wave of Covid-19 pandemic put to test the efficiency of virtual court hearings and efficacy of courts as guardians of people’s fundamental rights. While the virtual court experience changed for the better by overcoming the glitches experienced during the past year, the top court left a deep imprint on citizens’ minds and lives during the pandemic with their spate of rulings on vaccine roll-out, Covid death compensation, repatriation of migrant workers, and the mandate to secure education of children who lost their parents or caretakers due to Covid.Judicial activism was seen at the fore in a string of judgments delivered by the Court, including the Pegasus spyware case, where it stepped in to form a committee to enquire into the truth whether the government or any of its agencies had indeed pried upon its citizens using a sophisticated foreign surveillance technology. It was again the year of women as the court passed path-breaking decisions admitting women into the once-male bastions of the prestigious national defence academy (NDA), among other military institutions.The court also took the final call on policy matters of the government when it came to the prized projects of Central Vista, the Char Dham road expansion scheme, and the reservation policies. Gender sensitisation was high on priority in several decisions by the court. Judges even placed the lens on disability rights giving it a meaningful interpretation while implementing it in the context of disciplinary proceedings and competitive examinations.Explaining this and much more, we have categorised the highlights at the country’s top court and its notable decisions throughout 2021.Virtual Revamp The need for a better video conferencing platform was hugely felt as the year began with the Supreme Court hearing cases on the Vidyo videoconferencing app. This app was in use since March 2020 but faced limitations of participant strength, besides frequent glitches. However, this did not deter judges from taking up even Constitution bench matters. During this period, a five-judge bench of the top court took up and decided the constitutional validity of Maharashtra’s Maratha quota law. By August, the Court shifted to the Cisco Webex platform, providing a smoother experience to judges, lawyers and litigants.More than 150,000 virtual hearings were conducted by the top court since the pandemic began. The E-Committee of the Supreme Court came out with uniform rules for videoconferencing and applied it throughout all high courts. It even framed model rules for live streaming and recording of court proceedings, the work on which is still in progress. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has opened for physical hearing of cases but the option of providing an online link is kept open for lawyers on all working days.Covid outreach The court made its presence felt in more than one way when the second wave of the Covid pandemic strained bed facility at hospitals, exhausted medical oxygen reserves, and essential drugs ran out of supply. At a time when the government was overwhelmed by the scaled demand across states, the top court stepped in by initiating a suo motu petition and formed a national task force on oxygen allocation to ensure smooth and transparent supply of medical oxygen across states. The court made a critical analysis of the vaccination policy by demanding an action plan on providing vaccination to the entire population. In separate suo motu proceedings, it ordered supply of dry ration and cooked food for stranded migrant workers and ordered states/UTs to ensure that financial distress does not come in the way of continuing education of children who lost their parents or caregivers due to Covid.Grief-stricken families who lost their near and dear ones due to Covid or Covid-related complications got ₹50,000 ex gratia, through the intervention of the Supreme Court, which also ensured that any death that took place within 30 days of testing Covid-positive, including death by suicide, will be entitled to this amount. This amount was meant to be over and above any central or state compensation schemes.Judicial activism In July, news broke about several Indian politicians, journalists and rights activists being part of a global list of persons whose phones were under surveillance using Pegasus, a sophisticated software developed by Israel’s NSO Group, which the company claimed to sell only to governments and not private individuals or groups. Amid concerns of whether the surveillance was State-sponsored, the Supreme Court entertained a clutch of petitions demanding an independent probe into the matter, terming any such action to be a violation of right to privacy and freedom of speech of a citizen. When the government spoke of national security and refused to reveal information, the court held that the State cannot get “a free pass every time” by raising the spectre of national security as it set up a three-member expert committee, supervised by a former Supreme Court judge, to ascertain the truth behind the controversy.A similar exercise of judicial activism unfolded when the court was unimpressed by the probe conducted by the Uttar Pradesh police into the mowing down of farmers by a car during farmer protests at Lakhimpur Kheri in October. Replacing a judicial enquiry panel formed by the state government with a one-man probe committee headed by a retired high court judge, the Supreme Court allayed concerns about a fair probe and revamped the special investigation team (SIT) probing the case by bringing in three IPS officers. The son of Union minister Ajay Mishra is among those arrested in this case.Armed forces The top court opened the gates of the prestigious National Defence Academy to women for the first time in 65 years. By a judicial order, it ended the discrimination existing at the premier military training institute and extended its order further to Indian Naval Academy and the Dehradun-based Royal Indian Military College. Forcing a mindset change in the army after its order last year that guaranteed permanent commission for women, the court fast-tracked preparations to admit women cadets to apply and get trained beginning this year itself.Even on the permanent commission (PC) front, the top court rallied in favour of women with order after order to call out as unrealistic yardsticks imposed by the Indian Army for women to get PC. Later, the court monitored the implementation of its orders to ensure full justice to women Short Service Commission officers.Reservation policies The reservation conundrum was up for debate in the top court, which questioned the criteria followed by the government to provide 10% reservation to economically weaker section (EWS) among forward castes for reservation in posts and admissions. The court made some searching queries on how EWS identification can be based on a uniform annual income criteria limit of ₹8 lakh, without accounting for disparities in income and purchasing power that varies across states. There was no answer on whether this limit takes into account income from other assets and landed property. The Centre formed a three-member committee to revisit this criterion and pending this exercise, put on hold the counselling for NEET-PG admissions where EWS quota was to apply from this academic year.In a separate judgment, the court insisted that seats allocated under the 27% quota for other backward classes (OBC) in local body polls has to be reserved seat-wise depending on empirical data gathered by an independent commission that can demonstrate backwardness of OBCs. In any event, the total reservation must remain within the 50% benchmark. The judgment has been applied to Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh with a direction to all state election commissions to implement this rule in future municipal polls.Gender sensitisation Taking a strict view on crimes against women and children, the Supreme Court ruled that “skin-to-skin” contact is not an essential requirement for convicting persons charged for sexual assault against children under the special legislation of Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). The court set aside two judgments of the Bombay high court that prescribed this rule to release two accused persons who had touched the child inappropriately through her clothing and not her bare skin. By this, the court ended the escape route for sex offenders charged under this law.The court also stepped in to address a trend among some trial courts and high courts to trivialise sex crimes. It set aside an order by the Madhya Pradesh high court asking a man, who molested a woman, to get a rakhi tied on his hand by the victim. The court said such orders trivialised the trauma of the victim and may result in normalising a crime. The top court passed a slew of directions underlining the need for training modules to sensitise judges on this aspect.Policy scrutiny The year began with the Supreme Court clearing the Central Vista redevelopment plan. The project involving the construction of a new Parliament, central secretariat and residences of the Prime Minister and Vice President in the heart of the Capital was challenged on multiple fronts – environmental concerns, loss of heritage, lack of compliance with developmental regulations, and alleged the hurry shown by the Central Vista committee to invite objections and process plan for redevelopment without holding adequate consultation.The top court later allowed the Char Dham road expansion project on three feeder roads leading to India-China border keeping the interest of the Army in mind that required wide roads to move machinery, artillery to the border regions. By an earlier order, the top court had restricted the road width to 5.5 metres. The army sought a modification to extend this width to 10 metres.Backlog While highlighting the hits, a big miss cannot be ignored. The grouse over significant cases hanging fire in the top court remained pertinent in 2021. Cases involving scrapping of Article 370, validity of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), validity of electoral bonds, and passage of crucial legislative amendments through the money bill route were some of the significant cases that could not be taken up this year too. With the threat of a third wave of Covid pandemic looming and the Supreme Court working in a hybrid mode, the possibility of early hearings in these matters in the near future appears bleak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delays-and-virtual-hearings-but-rights-and-responses-in-focus-101640889460028.html
31-12-2021||India||MBBS seat sale: Hurriyat leader among 9 charged||The Special Investigation Agency (SIA) of Jammu and Kashmir Police filed its first charge sheet against nine people, including a Hurriyat leader, in a case related to “selling” of MBBS seats in Pakistan to Kashmiri students and using the money to support and fund terrorism, officials said on Thursday. The case was registered by the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK), a branch of the police’s CID, in July last year after receiving information through reliable sources that several unscrupulous people, including some Hurriyat leaders, were hand in glove with some educational consultancies and were “selling” Pakistan-based MBBS seats and seats in other professional courses in colleges and universities. The CIK, which has been designated as the SIA now, filed its charge sheet before a court against Mohammad Akbar Bhat alias Zaffar Akbar Bhat, the chairman of Salvation Movement, a constituent of hardline Hurriyat Conference. Others named in the chargesheet are Abdul Jabbar, Fatima Shah, Altaf Ahmad Bhat Qazi Yasir, Mohammad Abdullah Shah, Sabzar Ahmad Sheikh, Manzoor Ahmad Shah, Syed Khalid Geelani and Mohd Iqbal Mir of Mahaz Azadi Front. During investigation, oral, documentary and technical evidence was collected and in analysis it surfaced that MBBS and other professional degrees-related seats were preferentially given to those students who were close family members or relatives of killed terrorists, they said. Evidence also came on record to show that money had been put into channels that ended up supporting programmes and projects pertaining to terrorism and separatism, which included the unrest after the killing of Burhan Wani, the poster boy of banned Hizbul Mujahideen terror group, in 2016. The money was also used in failed efforts to disrupt peace after the abrogation of the erstwhile state’s special status in August, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mbbsseat-sale-hurriyat-leader-among-9-charged-101640889402288.html
31-12-2021||India||The year that was: Financial crisis and political bouts mark Andhra’s year||Landslide victories of the ruling YSR Congress party in the local body elections and by-elections, alleged witch-hunt of political opponents by the ruling party, continued confrontation with the constitutional bodies by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government and unprecedented financial crisis amidst implementation of welfare schemes are some of the major developments in Andhra Pradesh in 2021.Confrontation with state election commissionThe year began with the confrontation with the state election commission headed by Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar, who announced the elections to the gram panchayats in February. The Jagan government strongly resisted the announcement and moved court, but failed to get a positive verdict.However, the ruling YSRC won the gram panchayat elections and subsequent municipal polls with a huge majority, decimating the main opposition Telugu Desam Party. In the block parishad, zilla parishad and municipal elections, the YSRC bagged more than 90 per cent of the seats.The ruling party also won the by-election to the Tirupati parliamentary seat held in April and to the Badwel assembly seat in November with a huge mandate. The YSRC also conquered all the local body elections in Kuppam, the bastion of TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu in Chittoor district.Setbacks on legal frontHowever, the Jagan government received a series of setbacks on the legal front. The state high court struck down the CID probe into the alleged insider trading in Amaravati, the state capital region. The government got a jolt even in the Supreme Court on the issue.The government witnessed similar setbacks in the high court in many other instances like striking down of the orders stripping former Union minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju of his post in the royal family trusts, closure of Sangam Dairy, and Amara Raja Batteries case.Following a high court order, the CBI also arrested several YSRC social media activists in the alleged abuse of judiciary on social media. The arrest of a few YSRC leaders close to Jagan’s cousin and Kadapa MP Y V Avinash Reddy caused an embarrassment to the state government.Witch-hunt of Jagan’s political rivalsThe alleged witch-hunt of Jagan’s political rivals was also a major highlight of the YSRC rule in 2021. The attack on TDP official spokesman K Pattabhi and his subsequent arrest, the attack on the residence of Chandrababu Naidu at Amaravati, the arrest of rebel YSRC MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju in a CID case and his alleged torture in the CID custody hit the headlines during the year.The year also witnessed two major movements – one the year-long agitation by workers of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant against the Centre’s decision to privatise it and the 400-km-long padayatra by the farmers of Amaravati to retain the capital city at their place. Both the agitations are still continuing with all the political parties joining the stir.U-turn on laws on three capitalsThe Jagan government took a U-turn on two major issues. It repealed the laws seeking to create three capitals for Andhra Pradesh, but vowed to bring them back without legal issues. Secondly, it also sought to restore the state legislative council, which it wanted to abolish last year.For the TDP, which lost most of the elections it had contested in the year, the biggest shock was the way the YSRC humiliated Chandrababu Naidu on the floor of the assembly by allegedly passing vulgar comments against his wife. A visibly shaken Naidu broke down before the media and vowed to enter the assembly again only after becoming the chief minister in the next elections.Welfare schemes and financial crisisDuring the course of the year, the Jagan government has implemented a majority of its welfare schemes, but at the same time, faced an unprecedented financial crisis. It was accused of resorting to indiscriminate borrowings, selling public assets and diverting funds from central government schemes and panchayat raj bodies to fund its welfare schemes and manage day-to-day expenses.The latest scheme launched by Jagan to mobilise funds from people in the name of regularising the houses of the poor under One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme has also come under sharp criticism from the opposition parties.

A limit on the use of water, exceeding which the use of restrooms was banned, and unsanitary food that left 159 factory workers in hospital. These were the living conditions at the dormitories at a plant operated by Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics manufacturer in Sriperumbudur on the outskirts of Chennai, where iPhones are assembled. Anger against these conditions burst into a protest that blocked the Chennai-Bengaluru highway for 8 hours in the middle of December, prompting the Tamil Nadu government to form an inspection team led by two ministers. The protest forced the tech giant Apple to issue a statement and put the facility on probation. On the night of December 18, hundreds of workers of the Foxconn plant blocked the highway at Sriperumbudur, after over 200 workers at the factory fell ill and 159 people were admitted to the district hospital, after what the Thiruvallur district administration described as an outbreak of an “acute diarrhoeal disease.” But workers at the Foxconn plant told HT that this was only the latest instance of exploitative working and living conditions that caused the outpouring of anger. A 21-year-old worker at the plant, who lived in one of the company’s dormitories, said, “In a room where more than five people can’t sleep, 15 of us sleep together on the floor. We stick to one another. Water is opened for us only one-and-a-half hours before our shift. If we don’t save water for later use, we cannot use the restrooms,” she said. The worker, who did not want to be identified, said she earned ₹11,500 per month and paid ₹130 per month for the hostel and food. “Several others and I have had stomach pains and urinary tract infections before. They serve us food on time but very little. Some women stay hungry throughout the day. There have been worms in our food before and we sent photos to the supervisor, but no action was taken. If I ask for leave to go home because of a death, my supervisor will ask me to show video proof,” she said. The 21-year-old was part of the protests against the living conditions and food poisoning, and has been home in her village in Tamil Nadu since the plant’s closure on December 18. She does not intend to return. On December 26, an inspection team of the Tamil Nadu government, comprising of administration officials and led by two ministers TM Anbarasan and CV Ganesan, visited the hostel facilities where the mass food poisoning took place, and looked at the amenities. One of the two ministers said that they had conveyed their recommendations to the Foxconn Technology Group to “improve infrastructure.” “We have also asked for action to be taken against those responsible for food poisoning,” the minister said. The government has asked the company to provide a minimum of four litres of drinking water per employee a day, provide water for bathing, increase washrooms to match the strength of the workforce, which is more than 15,000 employees out of which more than 10,000 are women, and provide inverters in case there are disruptions in power. “After we inspected the facilities, we have asked the management to not cram too many people in a room. They shouldn’t house more than five people in a 300 sq feet room and four people within a 250 sq ft room,” the minister said. The Foxconn management has agreed to comply, he said. Foxconn, which opened the plant in 2019, has admitted to lapses in living conditions, and apologised. “The safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority. We are very sorry for the issue our employees experienced and are taking immediate steps to enhance the facilities and services we provide at the remote dormitory accommodations,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that they were also restructuring their management team. They have also assured all employees that they will continue to be paid during the time it is closed while improvements are being made before restarting operations. An Apple spokesperson said that following the recent concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions at Foxconn, they have dispatched independent auditors to undertake additional detailed assessments. “We hold our suppliers accountable to the highest standards in the industry and regularly conduct assessments to ensure compliance,” the spokesperson said. “We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented. Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur facility has been placed on probation and we will ensure our strict standards are met before the facility reopens. We will continue to monitor conditions closely,” the Apple spokesperson said. There is no word from the two companies on when the factory will reopen. 
31-12-2021||India||Heavy rains lash Chennai, 3 killed; IMD sounds red alert||Three people died after sudden heavy rains lashed Chennai on Thursday flooding several parts of the city, a Tamil Nadu minister and officials said.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for Chennai and three adjoining districts following the downpour that came after record-breaking rains crippled the capital in November. The weather stations in Chennai’s MRC Nagar and Nungambakkam recorded 200 mm and 160 mm of rainfall in a span of a few hours up to 8 pm, according to IMD. For December, this is the highest rainfall recorded within 24 hours after 110 mm was recorded on December 13, 2016. The all-time record for December in Chennai, according to IMD’s data, is 290 mm recorded on December 2, 2015. “All of them (three) died due to electrocution,” minister for disaster management KKSSR Ramachandran told a press conference in Chennai. The minister requested people not to step out in the night, assuring that the situation will improve by Friday morning. The deceased included a 70-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy, all from Chennai. The minister said that nature’s fury was more than what was anticipated but authorities of the four affected districts began working instantly. “Shelters are open and people can move there to avoid any mishap and Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is also evacuating people from flood-prone areas,” the minister said. GCC commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said heavy duty pumps were being used across the city to drain out water. “Over 145 pumps are running and installation of pumps in process at other places also,” Bedi said.Thursday’s rains inundated localities, such as T Nagar, Ashok Nagar and Anna Nagar, among others. “This was our situation when the first heavy spell occurred on November 7 and our situation is the same now,” said V S Narayanasamy, a resident of Motilal Street in T Nagar. The water levels here submerged half the height of their two-wheelers and entered the ground-floor homes in the apartment. The rains brought traffic to a standstill. Four subways were closed in the city. Visuals showed a white car floating in the Madley subway near T Nagar. Chennai’s MetroRail extended services by an hour from 11:00 pm to 12:00 am as commuters got stuck on roads for hours due to the heavy rain.Weather models had not forecast the rains. The IMD on Thursday evening issued a heavy-to-very heavy rainfall warning for Chennai and its adjoining districts of Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu. “Convective cells present over Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chengalpattu districts are likely to cause significant rain spells in these districts during the next 3 hours,” the IMD said in its statement. The weather department has forecast heavy rain likely to occur at isolated places in Cuddalore, Villupuram and Mayiladuthurai districts and moderate rain at many places in the rest of the coastal districts on December 31 and January 1. “It is apt to call it a cloudburst,” said independent weather watcher and blogger, Pradeep John, who goes by the moniker Tamil Nadu Weatherman. “One of the craziest spells of (a) lifetime. Though I expected rain today in the city, what happened today was a completely freak event and some crazy stuff. This has never happened in the 15 years and has caught us all by surprise. We have seen a 5 mm forecast giving 50 mm rains but not 200 mm rains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rains-lash-chennai-3-killed-imd-sounds-red-alert-101640889222489.html
31-12-2021||India||BJP seeks renaming of Andhra’s Jinnah Tower||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday demanded the Andhra Pradesh government to change the name of a popular landmark in Guntur town named after Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan. The Jinnah Tower, located in the heart of Guntur on Mahatma Gandhi road, is a tall monument built around 1945. The tower consists of six pillars with a dome-shaped structure atop and is considered a symbol of harmony and peace by the locals. The location is also referred to as Jinnah Centre.BJP leaders demanded that the state government remove the name “Jinnah” from the monument and the location, as it symbolises the name of a person responsible for the partition of India.It all started with a tweet by BJP national secretary Y Satya Kumar on Thursday morning, which said, “This tower is named after Jinnah & area as Jinnah Centre. The irony, it’s not in Pakistan but the Guntur City of AP. A centre that still carries the name of a traitor of India. Why shouldn’t it be named after Dr Kalam or son of the soil, a great Dalit poet, Gurram Jashuva? Just an idea!”Within no time, BJP Andhra Pradesh unit president Somu Veerraju issued a statement saying the party was strongly opposing Jinnah’s name for the monument in Guntur. “Jinnah was responsible for the formation of Pakistan by dividing India. He had sown the seeds of enmity among the people of the country,” he said.The BJP state president demanded that the state government rename the tower after any other patriot who had strived for the independence of India. “Not just in Guntur, the government should change the names of all the places in the country that are named after those responsible for the partition of India,” Veerraju said.BJP state vice-president S Vishnuvardhan Reddy also put forward a similar demand, while Telangana BJP lawmaker T Raja Singh went a step ahead and threatened to pull down Jinnah Tower, which he said, was the symbol of India’s partition. He demanded that the location be named after Abdul Kalam.Reacting to the demands, the ruling YSR Congress party alleged that the BJP leaders were raising the issue of a historic monument named after Jinnah, only with a motive of disturbing the communal harmony in the state and creating troubles for the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government.YSRCP general secretary and legislator Lella Appi Reddy, who hails from Guntur town, said the Jinnah Tower was built before India got the independence and wondered why the BJP leaders were suddenly concerned about its name.He pointed out that veteran BJP leader L K Advani, during his visit to Pakistan in 2005, had praised Jinnah as the most secular freedom fighter and an ambassador for Hindus and Muslims. “Advani had even refused to take back his comments about Jinnah when some media persons questioned him,” Reddy recalled.“Unfortunately, the BJP leaders are kicking up controversies for their political gains,” he alleged.In 2017, the Pakistan government acknowledged the Jinnah Tower in an official tweet. “#Jinnah Tower is a landmark monument in the city of #Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. It is named after the father of #Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and is located on Mahatma Gandhi Road of the city as a symbol of peace and harmony. #QuaidEAzam #JinnahKaPakistan” it tweeted.
31-12-2021||India||Kerala governor refuses to accept HC notice on V-C’s reappointment||Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Thursday clarified that he will not return as the chancellor and has asked the Pinarayi Vijayan led-government to deal with the notice issued by the Kerala high court seeking clarification on the re-appointment of Kannur vice-chancellor Gopinath Raveendran. Talking to newsmen Khan said he abdicated his position as the chancellor on December 8 and there is no plan to withdraw the decision. “The court has issued notice to the chancellor, not Arif Mohammad Khan. You know, from Dec 8 onwards I am not the chancellor,” he said, suggesting the tiff with the Communist Party of India (Maoist) or CPI (M) government is far from over. Earlier, he had asked his office not to accept any files regarding universities in the state. “I am no more in that position. Let the government decide,” he said. Governor Khan reappointed Raveendran as the Kannur University V-C for four more years on November 24, the first in the state’s higher education sector history, despite the government constituting a search committee to select a new candidate. Khan had pointed out that the government “pressurized him to sign the re-appointment order”. Following this, the Save University Campaign Committee, a whistleblower in the higher education sector, sent several letters to Khan indicating the political appointments in universities, bypassing eligible candidates. On December 8, Khan sent a strongly-worded letter to CM Pinarayi Vijayan, saying that he was hurt over the “dipping standard” of the higher education sector and blamed “brazen political interference” as a reason in varsities for this. He asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if political interference continued and he can’t bend further. He also slammed state higher education minister R Bindhu for prompting Raveendran’s reappointment through several letters. After the reappointment of Kannur VC, syndicate member Dr Premachandran K and academic council member Shino Jose moved the high court to quash the re-appointment. But on December 15, the court rejected the plea after the government contended that all procedures were met by the governor. After the governor’s outburst, an appeal was filed in the division bench, which sent notices to all respondents, including Khan.On Thursday, the ruling CPI (M) and opposition Congress took strong exception to the governor’s statements. “If the state assembly wants, the government can take up the role of chancellor, but we want the governor to continue in his post. We hope he will have a rethinking,” said CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Congress also said Khan cannot abdicate his power after making all appointments. “He can’t run away from his responsibility like this. After making all appointments, he can’t protest now. It will vitiate the higher education sector further,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. The state government has come under heavy criticism recently over the appointment of relatives of party leaders at high positions in the Kannur University. Vijayan’s political secretary K K Ragesh’s wife Priya Varghese was appointed as the associate professor in November this year. Though many contenders to the post questioned her appointment, saying that she did not meet the UGC’s prescribed term of teaching period, she was finally appointed, ignoring six others. In April this year, the Kerala high court quashed the appointment of party legislator A N Shameer’s wife Shahala as the assistant professor in the university. Arif Mohammad Khan is the third governor of a non-Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state where a clash has erupted over the running of state universities. As per norms of higher education institutions, the governor is chancellor of state universities, same as the president is the chancellor of Central universities. In the past few months, governors of West Bengal (Jagdeep Dhankar), Maharashtra (Bhagat Singh Koshyari) and Kerala (Khan) have taken umbrage, alleging that the state governments were undermining their position as chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-governor-refuses-to-accept-hc-notice-on-v-c-s-reappointment-101640889160697.html

However, it was later revealed that the NGO had sent a request to State Bank of India to freeze the accounts in view of MHA’s denial of its request to renew its FCRA licence.Also Read | Mother Teresa's charity denies bank account freeze after Mamata blames CentreOfficials from the CM’s office said Patnaik directed district collectors to use funds from Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for food and treatment of inmates in orphanages and the leprosy home run by the organisation. Organisations involveed in philanthropic work can receive donations from foreign countries if they are registered according to provisions under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010.Missionaries of Charity runs a leprosy home on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar housing 300 inmates. It also runs 12 orphanages with 600-odd inmates. Besides, there are 87 sisters who look after the day-to-day affairs of these institutions.Also Read | Bengal-Centre row over Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of CharityOn December 25, the Ministry of Home Affairs had said that Missionaries of Charity’s request for renewal of their certification under FCRA was refused, for “not meeting the eligibility conditions under the FCRA, 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR) 2011”.Also Read | Missionaries of Charity’s troubles continueThe registration was originally set to expire on October 31, however, its license was extended till December 31 to give them time to complete the renewal process, due to Covid-19 disruptions.BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma saidthe state government should do the same thing for other organisations in the state facing similar problems.Also Read | Mamata's intention mala fide: BJP on Missionaries of Charity's a/c freeze claim“The FCRA renewal of Missionaries of Charity was not done due to audit irregularities.

In a federal government, when the Centre takes certain steps, the states should respect it.

31-12-2021||India||Covaxin safe, immunogenic in 2-18 age group: Bharat Biotech||Days after the Centre allowed the use of Covaxin (BBV152) among 15-18 year-olds, Bharat Biotech on Thursday said that its vaccine was found to be “safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic” in phase 2/3 clinical trials on children in the 2-18 years age group. The Hyderabad-based firm, in a statement, also said that neutralizing antibodies in children, on average, were found to be 1.7 times higher than in adults. No serious adverse event was reported during the trials, it added. “Covaxin clinical trial data from the paediatric population is very encouraging. Safety of the vaccine is critical for children, and we are glad to share that Covaxin has now proven data for safety and immunogenicity in children. We have now achieved our goal of developing a safe and efficacious Covid-19 vaccine for adults and children,” firm chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said. “Vaccines are a great preventive tool; the power of vaccines can only be harnessed if used prophylactically,” Ella added. As part of the firm’s phase II/III clinical trials and multicentre studies, as many as 374 subjects in the concerned age group were inoculated two 0.5 ml doses of Covaxin, which was the same formulation used in adults. “Immunogenicity analysis (by PRNT) shows superior antibody responses were observed in children compared to adults, suggesting that BBV152 will also be efficacious in this age group,” the study uploaded in open access journal medRxiv said. The trials in the paediatric population were conducted between June and September, and have shown robust safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity, it added. While no serious adverse event took place, the subjects reported either mild or moderate severity symptoms, with 78.6 per cent getting resolved within a day. Pain at the injection site was the most commonly reported adverse event, the company said. For the trial, 976 subjects were screened for Sars-CoV-2 using RT-PCR and ELISA testing (enzyme-linked immunoassay), out of which, 525 eligible participants were enrolled. Based on the age, participants were distinguished into three groups in an age de-escalatory manner.Researchers involved in the trial said the report presents data obtained up to four weeks after the second shot, but the study is ongoing to collect safety data up to six months after the last vaccination, which will be reported separately.The data was submitted to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) during October 2021 and received emergency use nod for children aged 12-18 from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) recently.The approval on December 25 from DCGI came nearly 10 weeks after the subject expert committee of CDSCO recommended Covaxin’s use in children on October 12.

This came after the state assembly passed a resolution against AFSPA amid mounting outrage among the state’s population over the special law.A senior officer who didn’t want to be named said renewing such notifications on their expiry was a routine practice depending on the ground situation.“Any decision on removal of AFSPA from Nagaland will only be taken only after the report of high-level committee led by Vivek Joshi (the registrar general and census commissioner of India) submits its report,” the officer added. The panel is expected to submit its report in 45 days.
31-12-2021||India||Vaccine for third dose to be decided by January 10: ICMR||The Centre will take a decision before January 10 on whether the precautionary dose against Covid-19 for healthcare and frontline workers and citizens above 60 years with comorbidities should be as the first two doses or a mixed one, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Thursday. “We are analyzing all the data that is available in terms of which vaccine can be given to which beneficiary — whether it is going to be the same one or is it going to be a different one. Before the 10th (January), we will have clear cut recommendations on the same. The drugs controller and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) are meeting, and that decision will be taken soon,” ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said at the weekly media briefing here. “We are having an extensive debate (on which vaccine to be given as a precautionary dose). We’ve had a series of meetings of NTAGI yesterday, day before, today and we are deciding for the population group that will require this precaution dose… which vaccine can be given for in terms of safety and efficacy,” he added.Experts believe that mixing and matching of vaccines is likely to be more effective. “For precaution dose, it is likely to work better, but both safety and effectiveness need to be monitored,” Gagandeep Kang, senior vaccine expert, Christian Medical College, Vellore, said. Besides this, the ICMR director general said the durability of immunity post Covid-19 vaccination persists for nine months or more and a precautionary dose of vaccine which will be administered to the concerned population is to mitigate the severity of infection, hospitalisation and death. He said hybrid immunity, which is developed as a result of vaccination and natural infection, mounts a stronger response and robust antibody titres after the second dose.“If you have had an infection and vaccination, your immune response is more than only infection or vaccine. So the important thing is that vaccination is absolutely essential,” he said. Citing a few global and Indian studies, Bhargava said: “This is from the US published in Science, and there is antibody and cellular response more than nine months after infection from China. Then longitudinal investigations in the US have multiple studies have shown that the antibody responses persists for more than 13 months post infection and the systematic review of 10 studies from Israel, England, Denmark, US, Austria and Italy have shown more than 90% reduction in reinfection up to 10 months.” “... We like to say that up to nine months and take a slightly conservative estimate of that and that is what is the evidence. From India there are three studies two from ICMR and one from Mumbai, on 284 patients, on 755 patients and 244 that it persists for up to eight months, seven months and six months (respectively) and these are all published data from infection that occurred in 2020, 2021,” he added. Precaution dose is primarily to mitigate severity of infections, hospitalisation and death, he reiterated. . “Now this is very important for individuals who are elderly, immune compromised or on chemotherapy, or patients who have chronic obstructive lung disease. So these are patients where a precautionary dose would be useful to prevent serious disease hospitalization and death,” he said. 
31-12-2021||Today's||New politics for a new Parliament||The dawn of a new year is a customary and solemn occasion for reflecting on the time gone by and resolving on the way forward, with a difference based on experience and lessons learned. Such reflection and new resolution are more apt and timely for making a difference to the functioning of Parliament. More so, when the apex legislature of the country gets relocated in a new building in the new year — 100 years after the present one began to take shape. Also, independent India will complete 75 years in 2022. This occasion can’t be missed in our collective quest for a new normal for the functioning of our Parliament, the temple of democracy.A case for reflectionA new building per se doesn’t add much value to the functioning of Parliament, unless it is accompanied by a new work ethic to restore its stature. Unfortunately, the virus of disruption that infected the apex legislature about 20 years back has remained endemic and has become more virulent in the last few years. It is afflicting both the Houses in varying degrees, given the differences in composition.The last two sessions of the Rajya Sabha have left a bitter taste with productivity of only 28% and 47%, respectively. With annual productivity of 58.9%, 2021 is the second-worst for the Upper House, which hit the nadir with productivity of 36% in 2018. Two of its worst-performing years came during the last four years. It is, hence, a matter of serious concern, warranting equally grave reflection and introspection so that a new normal of working is found to justify a new Parliament complex.Subversion of democracyParliament functions in a certain political milieu and is hence a political institution. Political motives play out influencing the functioning of different sections of the Houses of Parliament. Protests are a part of political contestation that is integral to the functioning of legislatures. But persistent disruptions, disregarding the sanctity of the rules and the authority of the Chair, derailing the functioning of the House, subvert democracy that the people of India opted for as a vehicle of transformation of their lives, as stated in the Preamble of the Constitution.Persistent disruptions and forced adjournments compromise the quality of legislation besides resulting in the abdication of the important “oversight” function of the House. Under the Constitution, the executive is accountable to the legislature. This oversight function is ensured through Question Hour, Short Duration Discussions (SDD), Calling Attention Notices (CAN), and debates on legislative proposals.Disruptions render the House dysfunctional, with a substantial share of the scheduled available time lost as forfeited. With legislative business conventionally getting priority, enough time is not left for SDD and CAN. The winter session din prevented discussion on price rise, and the Omicron outbreak was debated only in passing. The Rajya Sabha lost over 60% of the Question Hour time during the winter session and even more during the monsoon session.Parliamentary democracy enables the participation of the people in governance through their elected representatives. Swaraj, for which a long-drawn freedom struggle was waged, is all about people so governing themselves. This is the representative function of legislatures. Quality debates constitute the deliberative function.Dereliction of these four functions by legislatures — representative, deliberative, oversight, and law-making — amounts to a certain negation of the spirit and provisions of the Constitution. It is time this worrisome parliamentary deficit is addressed when independent India is set to enter its 76th year, and Parliament is to move into a new building. This should not be difficult if only the legislators remind themselves of their oath of allegiance to the Constitution.Why disrupt?Democratic functioning is all about debates and deliberations. A functional democracy enables the presentation of different perspectives and even the hottest political contestation on the floor of the House. A disruptive and noisy alternative, on show at present, is its negation. No one wins in the din.The root cause of disruptions appears to be the rising discord between the political mission and the parliamentary project. All political parties need to remind themselves that they are also bound by the Constitution. Parties winning the people’s mandate govern, while others don the mantle of a responsible and constructive Opposition. Both sides have a responsibility towards the people who decide the composition of law-making bodies. It is this realisation of collective responsibility that makes Parliament functional.Parliament should not be viewed as a mere extension of politics. Politics should further the cause of the parliamentary project. This new politics is the need of the hour.Politics and Parliament, each with a specific mission, are integral to democracy. The mission of politics is to win the mandate of the people with promises of improving the quality of their lives. The mission of Parliament is to delineate the path for realising such promises. In essence, these two missions are complementary to each other and not mutually exclusive. So then why the discord and disruptions? The problem lies in drawing a line between protests and obstructive disruptions.It then logically follows that what is needed is a synchronic vibration between the political mission and Parliament. It is this resonance with which we need to enter the new year with a resolve that this concord marks the functioning of our Parliament in the new grand structure so that our parliamentary democracy shines in a new grandeur. Hopefully, we will find a New Parliament. A spirit of accommodation among various sections of Parliament, guided by new politics to subserve the national mission, is the key to this much- desired resonance. Debate and decide. Don’t disrupt democracy.M Venkaiah Naidu is the Vice-President of India The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/new-politics-for-a-new-parliament-101640959668117.html
