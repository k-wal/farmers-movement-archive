Students are furious over this decision as many of them are in their home towns and some are afraid of the new Omicron variant and want to appear online for the exams.The exams of BVU’s New Law College are set to commence first and students have been sent a schedule. “Our exams are going to be held offline and I am at my village in Aurangabad, as my parents are not allowing me to travel to Pune due to the Covid-19 . And if the state education minister is appealing to give both options for exams then why is our university forcing students to appear for offline exams,” said a law student on condition of anonymity.Talking about the issue M M Salunkhe, vice-chancellor, Bharati Vidyapeeth university said, “Our examinations are going to be held offline and it is also appealed by the state higher education minister Uday Samant recently to go towards offline classes and exams. We are taking the review of Covid situation and if needed in the future both offline and online options will be given to students. But as of now exams are held only offline,”While Rishi Pardeshi, state observer, Nationalist Students Congress party said, “This is a complete violation of Covid guidelines and safety of students is compromised by calling them and forcing them to attend offline classes. Still, there is fear of Covid-19 and most students are in their home towns. So, our demand is BVU should give both online and offline options to students for appearing for exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-unhappy-over-offline-exams-to-be-held-by-bharati-vidyapeeth-university-101639506543341.html

It took the gangster and his men 10 days to execute the plan which involved 20 people, including policemen, doctors, and financers, said the officials. The two apartments in which the theft took place on August 4 were being used as maintenance office by the developer of the residential society, the STF officials said, adding that the theft came to the fore on August 20 when an employee of the developer visited the maintenance office to collect the cash to deposit it in the bank. After scanning the CCTV footage, the realtor discovered that the money was stolen, they said. On August 21, a case of theft was registered at Kherki Daula police station where police did not mention theft amount, but later the case was transferred to the STF which revealed that gold and cash, including US dollars, worth at least ₹40 crore were stolen. The stolen money was kept in more than 40 bags and sacks, said the officials. According to the STF, the heist which took place between 11pm and 4am (intervening night of August 3-4) was followed by transporting part of the stolen money to Delhi’s Dwarka, while some amount was sent through hawala to gangster Lagarpuria who is believed to be in the UAE and runs the operations from there. So far, 15 people, including six henchmen of the gangster, three doctors, two employees of the developer, two financers and an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of the Delhi Police. On November 10, the STF arrested two doctors -- Dr Sachinder Jain Nawal, a leading paediatrician who owns two hospitals in Gurugram, and Dr Gurpartap Singh.According to the officials, the developer had kept more than ₹40 crore in the two apartments -- one on fourth floor and the other on 11th floor -- of a building. The information, which was allegedly leaked to Dr Nawal in July, was passed on to gangster Lagarpuria following which the heist was planned and executed, they said. STF deputy inspector general Satheesh Balan said that the gangster asked his men to take up an apartment on rent in the society and start keeping a watch on the two apartments. “The apartments were unattended at night and there were no lockers. The bags containing money was kept in the almirahs,” he said, adding that other residents of the building were not aware of the theft. Balan said as per the plan Dr Nawal asked the gangster to arrange henchmen and a vehicle to transport money from the society to a location in Delhi. “Around 11pm, a Scorpio with six men entered the society to meet some friends who were already waiting for them at the rented apartment. They parked the SUV near the tower and met a close aide of Lagarpuria — Abinav Sharma. Then they broke open the two apartments, took out the bags, loaded them in the SUV and drove towards Delhi,” he said. The officials said the stolen money was taken to Dwarka in Delhi to Dr Ashwin Tehlan’s house for safekeeping in two shifts. Dr Tehlan, a dentist, is the gangster’s friend, they said, adding that Tehlan’s father denied keeping the money in the apartment and asked him to return the money. Meanwhile, the SUV returned to Gurugram for the second round and the gangster contacted ASI Vikas Gulia to arrange another vehicle for transporting the stolen money to a financer’s flat in Delhi, the STF said. Lagarpuria had called Tehlan and informed him that he was sending money to him to keep it safe for a few days. He told him that it was hawala money and he wanted him to keep it to which he agreed, said the officials, adding that Tehlan was under the impression that the amount would be around ₹30-40 lakh but was shocked to see bags and sacks containing money.Dr Tehlan and Sandeep Badhwar, one of the financers, surrendered before STF on November 10, said the officials, adding that Dr Tehlan was not aware that the money was stolen and he came to know about the theft after the arrest of ASI Gulia through newspaper reports. Tehlan was a member of “Half Lady Club” – a chit fund club and had come in touch with gangster Lagarpuria in 2020 through financier Badhwar in a club, the STF said, adding that earlier Tehlan knew Lagarpuria as a financer but in March this year Lagarpuria revealed his original identity to Tehlan. The officials said that the STF is planning to make two people -- Tehlan and Badhwar -- government approvers, as they were not directly involved in the heist. The STF has recovered nearly ₹5.80 core from possession of the suspects, they said.A spokesperson of Alpha Corp, the developer, said, “The IT department has served notice to the company. On the query received from the IT department that has been watched as a theft case, Alpha Corp has reverted them with the official version and has confirmed the amount of ₹50 lakh.”

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also investigating the case wherein seven accused have already been arrested in connection with fraud and forgery of government documents related to waqf land at Maan village in Hinjewadi allegedly in connivance with the officials at the Pune district collectorate. The court rejected the bail application of Sahil Munna Khan, Rehana Ishraque Khan and Uzair Ishraque Khan.Additional sessions judge P R Ashturkar in his order stated “ Moving further, it is not at all the case that applicants are totally unaware or strange persons in connection with the offence. On the contrary, it can be seen that they are direct beneficiaries. As this is one kind of economic offence, based on various documents, it is necessary that investigation machinery get fair opportunity for minute investigation. Unless and until every chain of transaction is properly linked and brought on record, this kind of offence cannot be duly proved. Even a single loose bit of chain can turn into failure of the entire investigation. Thus, the presence of the accused with police is necessary for minute investigation and to discover the facts in their special knowledge. Looking at the facts and circumstances, applicants are thus not entitled for anticipatory bail. Hence order.”Sahil Munna Khan, another trustee of Taboot Inam Endowment Trust had also filed for anticipatory bail . The prosecution, while strongly objecting to the bail application, submitted that, during investigation, it was found that applicants have issued few cheques and has also been to the bank with prime accused Imtiyaz . He has also furnished his own Adhaar and pan card on the bank record, it is submitted that application be rejected.According to the Pune police,the total value of the fraudulent deal involving the Tabut Inam Endowment Trust is ₹9.64 crore, The Bund Garden police had arrested Imtiaz Shaikh and Chand Mulani, both of whom were arrested on charges of impersonating the trust’s president and secretary, respectively based on the complaint filed by Pune regional officer of Waqf Board. The police are also on the lookout for a high-profile criminal known as land mafia in the investigative circles in connection with the fraud.What the FIR saysAccording to the FIR, Taboot Inam Endowment Trust,which is registered with the Waqf board, owns 8 hectares 57.1 R land at Gat no. 335/1 in Maan village in Mulshi taluka of Pune district. The state government acquired 5 hectares 51 R land out of the total land for the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government were supposed to give around ₹9.64 crore to the trust in return and accordingly the government had released an amount of ₹7.73 crore. The amount was siphoned off by the accused who prepared bogus documents and resorted to cheating the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-court-rejects-anticipatory-bail-applications-of-three-accused-in-hinjewadi-waqf-land-scam-case-101639505280738.html

Officials made clear that the facility slips will be given two days after the land allotments to the allotees. The institutions which did not formally return the facilities after taking them last year will not be given any facility this time.

They will be given the same facilities and land next year as they have been receiving in the past, he made clear.Till last year, the tent city was set up on 640 hectares of land. This time the work of the railways is going on for construction of a railway over bridge besides a large part of the land has been inundated by the Ganga.In such a situation, about 60 hectares of land is falling short. In view of this, the fair area is expected to be expanded in Hetapatti area towards Jhunsi and towards Darganj so that all institutions can be given the same amount of land and facilities as they had received last year, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/magh-mela-2022-land-allotments-for-camps-to-seers-religious-bodies-from-dec-22-101639505165898.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal assembly passes bill to appoint high court judges as Lokayukta||The Himachal Pradesh Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which provides for appointment of a high court Judge as Lokayukta, was passed in the assembly on Tuesday amid a walkout by the Opposition.Replying to a debate on the Bill, Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj said the Lokayukta legislation was first brought by the government led by former chief minister Virbhadra Singh in 1985.Being a small state, one person was posted as the Lokayukta as well as the chairman of the state Human Rights Commission.“As per Section 3 of the Lokayukta Act, it is necessary for a person to be a judge of the Supreme Court or a chief justice of a high court to be eligible for appointment to the post of Lokayukta,” said Bhardwaj.It was due to the limited scope of eligibility criteria that the post remained vacant, he added. The minister said it was necessary to make the institution of Lokayukta functional.“There is no ulterior motive for bringing such amendment,” he said adding that it would not lower the stature of chief minister as has been said by the Theog legislator Rakesh Singha.Bhardwaj said that a high court judge is an important person who is appointed by a collegium system and holds judicial powers equivalent to the chief justice of the high court except the administrative powers.Earlier taking part in the discussion, Jagat Singh Negi alleged that the BJP government came up with the amendment in the bill to diminish the sanctity of the constitutional body.He said that not a single person was prosecuted by the Lokayukta since the inception of the institution. Negi said the government came up with an amendment to facilitate someone whom they wanted to appoint as Lokayukta.Congress member Harshvardhan Chauhan allegedly said the reason cited by the government that it was tough to find an eligible person to hold the post was absurd.Asha Kumari pointed out that by making provision of appointment of a judge of high court as Lokayukta will also lower the status of chief minister.CPI (M) Rakesh Singha also agreed with her and said the Bill should be withdrawn.The assembly, however, passed the Bill with voice-vote, rejecting the amendment moved by Rakesh Singha, amid walkout by the Opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-assembly-passes-bill-to-appoint-high-court-judges-as-lokayukta-101639505163551.html
14-12-2021||Pune||Dug up road add to commuters’ woes near Mandai||PUNE Travelling through the Chhatrapati Shivaji road has become a nightmare for residents in the last few months. There is traffic chaos due to the ongoing Pune Metro work near the Mandai market and the drainage and pipeline work near the Mandai area has added to the woes not only for commuters but for residents and shop owners.Residents have complained about the issue to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) as it is affecting their daily work and safety.From the last few months for the Mandai Metro station work, the entire Mandai area and Shivaji roadside have been either dug up or barricaded. Now the road starting from the Datta Mandir chowk till Mandai chowk has been dug up for the drainage and underground pipeline work. Due to which half of the road has been barricaded and it is adding to the daily traffic congestions.“There is a heavy flow of traffic every day while going to and coming back from office. There are no proper safety measures taken by the contractor and also no police personnel are there to monitor the traffic during the peak hours,” said Kiran Pisal, a resident.Mandai market area is surrounded by both residential and market place. There is the main Mandai vegetable market, Bohri Aali Market, Tulshibaug market and Raviwar peth market surrounding the Shivaji road. Also, theDagdusheth Ganpati temple is on the same route and major traffic flow from Shaniwarwada to Swargate is witnessed by commuters daily.“There is no proper management by PMC to carry out such drainage and pipeline works in the middle of the city. As the road is dug in front of my shop, from last two weeks customer footfall to my shop has reduced down by 50 per cent. Also, no proper alternate options for pedestrians are provided and this leads to heavy crowding. People cannot walk through the dup-up road, debris lying all over and traffic congestion adds to the woes,” said Pritam Parekh, a shop owner on the Shivaji road.Senior officials from the PMC’s road department said, “The drainage and pipeline work underway on the Shivaji road will soon be completed, and we are aware of the inconvenience caused to the public due to it. We have given strict warning to the contractor and also to the water supply and drainage department to speed up the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dug-up-road-add-to-commuters-woes-near-mandai-101639504622582.html

14-12-2021||Mumbai||SC admits petition of suspended BJP MLAs||Delhi/Mumbai: The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday admitted for hearing a clutch of petitions filed by 12 Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) legislators challenging their year-long suspension from the Maharashtra legislative assembly for allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer. Issuing notices to the state assembly and the Maharashtra government, the top court clarified that the MLAs are at liberty to approach the House for reduction of their suspension term during the pendency of the case, which will be heard next on January 22. On July 5, the assembly passed a resolution to suspend 12 MLAs for a year for allegedly heckling and misbehaving with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav who occupied the Speaker’s chair. Jadhav is a Shiv Sena legislator. The 12 suspended members are Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Parag Alavani, Harish Pimpale, Yogesh Sagar, Jay Kumar Rawat, Narayan Kuche, Ram Satpute and Bunty Bhangdia. On Tuesday, a bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar observed that issues raised in the matter required deeper consideration. “Needless to observe that pendency of these petitions will not come in the way of the petitioners to explore the possibility of urging upon the House to reconsider the decision impugned in these writ petitions, at least to the extent of reducing the term specified therein. That is a matter which can be considered by the House, if so advised,” the bench, which also comprised Justice CT Ravikumar, said. The winter session of the state assembly is slated to be held between December 22 and 28. Arguing for the suspended MLAs, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Harish Salve, Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Siddharth Bhatnagar contended that the suspension order was in violation of the principles of natural justice since the MLAs were not given any opportunity to present their defence. Further, the MLAs argued that rules of the legislative assembly were also breached in so far as punitive actions were ordered without prior notice given to them. “The SC court has said that the action by the state legislature is subject to the legal scrutiny and set aside the contention by the state government that the action cannot be questioned. The SC has also asked the legislature to explain that under which rule the action has been initiated and suspension has been done. Though our suspension has not been scrapped by the top court, it has pressed for the detailed discussion on the action. It has also not conceded state government’s prayer to reject the petition,” Ashish Shelar, BJP legislator and one of the petitioners, said. Shelar said that as suggested by the top court they will approach the state legislature with the request to reconsider the action and reduce the period of suspension. Senior counsel CA Sundaram who represented the state government urged the bench to refrain from reviewing the decision of the House when the MLAs had not refuted the allegation of misbehaviour. He said that Article 212 of the Constitution held that the validity of any proceeding in the legislature of a state shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure. Atul Londhe, spokesperson, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), charged the BJP MLAs with using objectionable language against the chair, which had precipitated the action. He added that this was not vindictive action, and was justified, as against the suspension of 12 Opposition members of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha during the ongoing winter session. The Rajya Sabha on the first day of its business for the winter session which began on November 29 suspended 12 of its members, including Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi and Trinamool MP Dola Sen, for the remaining part of the current session. The action was taken against them for indiscipline on the last day of the monsoon session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-admits-petition-of-suspended-bjp-mlas-101639503780615.html

In the coming assembly election, the history will repeat itself and the Congress besides rival parties will meet the same fate.” Mayawati also extended wishes to SAD leadership on completing 100 years. “There are a few parties in the country that have served the people for hundred years. Akali Dal is one of the oldest regional parties in the country that is fighting for the welfare and rights of the people of Punjab,” she said. “In last year hundred years, Punjab witnessed several social and political upheavals. Governments have been dismissed and Emergency has been imposed as well yet SAD has emerged as the voice of the people of Punjab,” Mayawati added. “Punjab has a special place for us. The BSP has a strong bond with the people of Punjab since decades. Punjab is the birthplace of the BSP founder Kanshi Ram. He launched a movement for the uplift of the weaker sections in society in Punjab. The BSP cadre is working hard to fulfil the dreams of Kanshi Ram,” she said.“Sukhbir Singh Badal has the blessings of former CM Prakash Singh Badal who has served the people of Punjab for a long time. Kanshi Ram had good terms with Prakash Singh Badal. The people of Punjab are aware of the fact,” former UP chief minister said. BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra is on a three-day visit to poll-bound Punjab. He will participate in the foundation day programme of SAD organised at Moga. Later, he will discuss the assembly election campaign strategy with top SAD leaders, including former CM Prakash Singh Badal, Sukhbir Singh Badal and Harsimrat Kaur Badal. On Wednesday, Mishra will hold a meeting with BSP office bearers and workers in Chandigarh. Later, he will attend a meeting of BSP-SAD candidates for the 2022 assembly election and other leaders. Besides discussing various issues associated with Punjab, he will also discuss poll strategy.The SAD forged an alliance with the BSP in June for next year’s Punjab assembly polls. According to the seat-sharing arrangement, the BSP will field candidates in 20 of the 117 assembly seats in the state while the rest will be contested by the SAD.

The bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj told the SEC to provide CCTV cameras in all the main and auxiliary polling booths as also in strong rooms where EVMs will be kept.The high court was earlier informed by West Bengal’s top law officer, advocate general SN Mukherjee, that there was a provision to install CCTV cameras in 25% polling booths but the government was ready to accept Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devdutta Maji’s suggestion. Maji cited incidents of violence during the 2015 KMC polls to seek orders that all polling booths and strong rooms should be covered by CCTV cameras.The BJP, in another petition filed on Tuesday, also sought orders for deployment of central armed police forces during the muncipal polls. The petition was filed after the Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear it and asked the BJP to approach the Calcutta high court. “We cannot take decisions with respect to the requirement of central forces. High court will be in a better position to know the situation,” said the Supreme Court’s bench of justices L Nagesara Rao and BR Gavai. The petition, filed by Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar, said BJP candidates are receiving threats from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).A third petition filed by the BJP to seek orders to hold elections to West Bengal’s 120-odd municipal corporations and municipalities on a single day is already pending before the high court.The division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj reserved its judgment on this petition on Friday. BJP’s Bengal vice-president Pratap Banerjee filed the petition.The state election commission told the bench that it wants to hold the elections in six to eight phases by May next year.During the last hearing on Friday, the Bengal’s top law officer SN Mukherjee told the high court that the KMC polls will be held on December 19 because of the better Covid vaccination status of Kolkata residents and healthcare facilities available in the city. He cited logistical problems and the Covid-19 pandemic as reasons for postponing of the polls in the remaining 22 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/hc-orders-cctv-surveillance-in-booths-strong-rooms-for-kolkata-municipal-polls-101639503660609.html

The parameters included a total restriction on armed forces to convoy and patrol within “Konyaks soil”, no military recruitment rally within Mon district, no Konyak youth to participate in any army recruitment rally, no Konyak village council or any of its civil organizations should accept any form of developmental package/assistance from the army, and the same to denounce immediately any assured package/assistance from the forces.The Konyak Union has also directed all customary landowners to immediately denounce past land-agreement allotted for setting up military base camps (operating points) within its respective jurisdiction (Naginimora, Tizit, Lampong Sheanghah, Wakching Town, Mon Town, Longshen Town, Sheanghah Wamsa, Longwa, Chenmoho, Chenloishu, Wangti, Aboi, Angjangyang, Tobu and Monyakshu etc.).Further, the union has instructed all Konyak offices, schools and institutions to hoist black flags and vehicles to carry black flags until justice is served.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-civilian-killings-apex-tribal-body-of-5-districts-declare-non-cooperation-with-army-101639503484332.html
14-12-2021||Lucknow||BJP’s “double-engine” colliding: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said the “double-engine” government of the BJP had “failed” with its engines colliding against each other, accusing it of disappointing farmers and the jobless youth in Uttar Pradesh. “Under the BJP government, income has come down by half, inflation went up by double. Had farmers not toiled despite Covid, the country’s economy had been even worse,” he alleged.“BJP’s MPs, MLAs are not allowed entry in villages for their failure and this double engine government’s engines are colliding head-on with each other,” he told reporters at the press conference he held at the helipad soon after he arrived in Jaunpur for his two-day (Tuesday and Wednesday) visit to resume his “rath yatra” poll campaign.“The farmers will never forget the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. First, this government introduced three black farm laws, then insulted the agitating farmers. Over 700 farmers lost their lives in the agitation. And then looking at the elections in UP and Punjab, the government withdrew the black laws. So many farmers would not have lost their lives had this government listened to us and the farmers. BJP people mowed down farmers by SUVs,” he further alleged. Adding to Akhilesh’s comment, SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “Akhilesh ji had been demanding the dismissal of the MoS (home) since day one”. Moreover, the SP leader also alleged that chief minister Yogi Adityanath did not take a dip in the Ganga in Varanasi on Monday because he knew that the river was “dirty”. He also alleged that all the money meant for the cleaning of rivers flowed down the drain and all the rivers in the state —Ganga, Yamuna, Hindon or Gomti—were dirty.“Out of his intelligence and wisdom, our chief minister (Yogi Adityanath) did not take a dip in the Maa Ganga (the river Ganga) for the river is dirty,” Akhilesh said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken a dip in the Ganga in Varanasi before he inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor on Monday. “Someone was getting photographed (Modi) while someone else stood by the sidelines watching. Imagine someone who has to be the ‘groom’ in the (UP) elections stood aside,” he alleged. A dip in the Ganga by PM Modi was one of the highlights of the KV Corridor inauguration event. When asked about PM Modi’s breaking bread with labourers at the KV Corridor event, Akhilesh said: “Who doesn’t eat with labourers. I did it so many times. But the issue is not sharing food with them, the issue is providing nutritious food to labourers regularly. Would BJP government tell why it scrapped the nutritious food scheme introduced for labourers by the previous SP government?” He said his “Vijay Rath” was continuously riding amid people and getting their support. Akhilesh’s alliance partners Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SPSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, Janwadi Party (Socialist) chief Sanjay Chauhan, Apna Dal (Krishna Patel faction) chief Krishna Patel and former BSP leader Ramachal Rajbhar who recently joined the SP were with Akhilesh at the press conference.“What I have been saying since the start that the SP along with its allies and public support will win 400 seats might turn out to be true,” he said. When asked about the PM Modi’s “red colour is red alert” comment, Akhilesh said: “These people have no understanding of the red colour. Red is the colour of happiness, anger and revolution. Is BJP people’s blood of black colour, no it is also red.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjps-double-engine-colliding-akhilesh-101639503061387.html

The BJP’s aim is development and focus is to improve ‘ease of living’, he said while chairing a meeting with chief ministers of 12 BJP-ruled states at Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) auditorium in Varanasi. BJP president JP Nadda, who welcomed the PM at the venue, said “BJP and good governance had become synonymous” and it was the only party that sought popular mandate on the basis of its performance.The PM reaffirmed the principle of “minimum government, maximum governance” and urged the states to remove laws that had become archaic and reduce compliance burdens.The meeting was focused on good governance practices for the betterment of citizens. Chief ministers and deputy CMs made presentations to highlight key welfare schemes of their respective states and elaborated on innovative governance practices they ushered in. Some of the best practices discussed included climate resilient infra projects, issuance of family identity cards, schemes for promotion of natural farming, rural livelihood programmes with self help groups, etc.Highlighting the importance of technology in governance, Modi called for governance to be data driven to ensure last mile delivery, speed and transparency.The PM asked the states to work on ‘One District, One Product’ scheme as a means to boost economic opportunities and strengthen the quest to become Aatmanirbhar. He also said that once this initiative gains currency in the states, they must also look at exporting their products overseas and creating a global market for the products. Modi also spoke about the importance of youth development and women empowerment as priority sectors for every government. In this context, he mentioned the need to strengthen Poshan Abhiyan and fight the menace of malnutrition. He also stressed on popularising a culture of sports and fitness among the youth.The PM and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath arrived at the auditorium in the same vehicle from the Bareka guest house. Modi asked all the CMs, including Yogi Adityanath, to apprise people of various welfare and development schemes implemented by the government. “In a democracy, people are everything. In such a situation, it is very important to take care of the interest of public. There should be no laxity in implementing developmental schemes,” said the PM, according to senior BJP leaders. Party sources said the PM praised the Yogi Adityanath government, saying that if any work was done with determination, then no one could stop it from being completed, in an apparent reference to the newly constructed Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had monitored the project and inspected it a record 50 times. “Medical colleges have been constructed in a number of districts in UP and air connectivity improved because of the construction of airports in several districts. Today, the state is on the path of development due to the working of the Yogi government,” the stated the PM, according to a senior BJP leader.

Also, he claimed he did not collect money from any bar owners and therefore there was no occasion for him to handover any money to the personal secretary of the then home minister.Vaze’s assertion on Tuesday is at variance with his three statements to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) where the sacked police officer claimed that he was instructed to collect bribes from bars and restaurants in Mumbai for Deshmukh, who was arrested by ED last month and is in judicial custody.The Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal commission of inquiry was constituted by the Maharashtra government in March this year to look into the allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh.It is not clear if, or how Sachin Vaze’s new stand on Anil Deshmukh will impact the multiple cases against the minister and his top aides who are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED.Also Read: Cited in Param Bir Singh charge sheet: Sachin Vaze, cops and bookiesAs Anil Deshmukh’s lawyer Girish Kulkarni cross-examined Sachin Vaze on Tuesday, he insisted that he never collected money (from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants) for Deshmukh or for his staff. Vaze also said that he never gave any money to Deshmukh or his staff and also, Deshmukh or his ministry never interfered with the investigations of Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) that Vaze previosuly headed, said Kulkarni.Asked if anyone from Anil Deshmukh’s office or he himself asked Vaze to collect money from bars or restaurants, the dismissed cop said that he doesn’t remember anything. The former police officer, who in the past also alleged that Deshmukh demanded ₹2 crore to let him continue in service, was asked if there was any occasion when he had to pay former home minister Anil Deshmukh. He responded saying, “No”. Advocate Kulkarni asked Vaze, “I suggest, there was no payment by you to Kundan Shinde (Deshmukh’s personal assistant who is also in judicial custody) in the capacity as staff of Anil Deshmukh or otherwise ?” To this Vaze responded saying, “l do not recollect.”Vaze’s denial comes days after a special Mumbai court declined bail to Shinde, underlining that the court could not disbelieve allegations of bribes being paid to the former minister’s aide even though these were made by Vaze whose integrity is under question.ED earlier alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze — who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases — collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”. In its chargesheet, the agency stated that Vaze used to visit Deshmukh’s official residence Dnyaneshwari regularly. Vaze allegedly collected ₹4.7 crore from various bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021, at Deshmukh’s behest. According to the agency, Vaze gave the extorted money to Shinde and subsequently, a part of the amount was routed to the charitable trust in Nagpur through various shell companies.Deshmukh resigned as home minister on April 5, less than a month after former police commissioner Param Bir Singh wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior government officials, alleging that the minister ran an extortion racket. The Bombay HC ordered a federal probe into these allegations, which prompted Deshmukh’s resignation on “moral grounds”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-sachin-vaze-s-new-stand-he-does-not-remember-paying-bribes-to-anil-deshmukh-101639501405052.html
14-12-2021||Pune||Naidu hospital floor in Pune reserved for Omicron cases||In view of the Omicron Covid variant threat, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has reserved a floor at the infection control Naidu hospital exclusively for those who test positive for the new variant that first emerged in Africa. Although the jumbo facility at College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) has not been dismantled due to heavy financial requirements, the civic body aims to first utilise its existing hospitals and then open the new Baner and CoEP jumbo facility. The paediatric ward at Rajiv Gandhi facility as well will be equipped with ventilators and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds some of which would be sponsored through CSR. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department said, “An entire floor at Naidu infection control hospital has been identified for Omicron patients in case the numbers go high. The total capacity at Naidu hospital is about 100 beds. We also have about 611 beds at BJ Medical college. We have prepared other hospitals like the one at Bopodi (55), Laigude hospital (50) which are currently operating non-Covid-19 patients. We have identified the jumbo hospital which has been kept ready just in case the numbers go high. However, we are not planning to restart the facilities as yet as it would cost heavily on the civic body exchequer. So, we will first use the existing municipal infrastructure and then if needed restart the jumbo facility, if at all the cases go up. We do not know as of now if and when the third wave will hit the city. But we are prepared with adequate medicines, drugs, oxygen and other infrastructure.” As of Tuesday, Pune city has two patients who were informed to be infected with the Omicron variant. One among the two has already been discharged after testing negative and the other has been institutionally quarantined. Dr Bharti said that the paediatric ward at Rajiv Gandhi hospital would also have about 14 NICU and 25 paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds. “We are hoping that the mother and child hospital would be ready by the 1st-2nd week of January as we are also getting extra ventilators and equipment through CSR which should be with us by next week,” he said. As per the PMC health department data, in the first wave the city saw 22,792 patients in the age group of 0-18 years which was about 11.15% of the total patients. Of these, 31 were reported dead which is about 0.14% fatality rate. In the second wave, 30,157 kids were reported infected with Covid-19 infection, however as the second wave was more fatal and widespread than the first wave the percentage of infection among kids was lower than the first wave at 9.95% and 26 were reported dead which was about 0.09%. The second numbers account for March 1, 2021 to December 8, 2021 and so 98 kids are still undergoing treatment for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/naidu-hospital-floor-in-pune-reserved-for-omicron-cases-101639501285014.html

14-12-2021||Patna||JMM considering constituting party’s OBC Morcha||RANCHI: In an effort to widen its social base, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) is considering to constitute an Other Backward Classes (OBC) wing in its organisation, people aware of the development said.Formally launched as a political party in 1984, the JMM has cultivated and carried the image of being a party for the tribals, who according to 2011 census make 26.4% of the 3.29 crore popluation in Jharkhand. It also led the demand for a separate state of Jharkhand.However, people aware of the development said, the party is now considering to formally constitute a dedicated wing in its organisation for the OBCs, who according to political activists make over 50 per cent of the state’s population. A resolution over the issue could be brought up for discussion and adoption in its upcoming 12th three-yearly national convention on December 19, which will be chaired by party president Shibu Soren.“Discussion over the issue is on. Chief minister Hemant Soren who is also the working president of the party is likely to take a final call over the issue in a day or two. If approved by the central leadership, a resolution for the same would be adopted at the national convention,” a senior party leader said.With identity politics being a major factor in the country, there has been a growing domination of the OBC groups across the country in electoral politics. Barring the BJP, almost all political parties have been demanding for caste-based census and subsequent increase in reservation in jobs and educational institutions commensurate with their actual population.All parties in Jharkhand had promised to increase reservation for OBCs ahead of the 2019 assembly polls. While the JMM, Congress, RJD and Ajsu Party promised to increase quota for OBCs to 27 % from the existing 14 %, the BJP promised to increase OBC reservation within the constitutional provisions.

The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is celebrating its 100th anniversary. I wanted to attend their function...parties are not bad, but sometimes leaders are bad. The team of the Congress has changed and people like it, but the SAD is being led by Sukhbir and Majithia who have defamed it. The SAD cannot revive under their leadership; for a democracy, however, a strong opposition is required,” said Channi, addressing a gathering in Deh Kalan village. Channi laid the foundation stones of Shree Cement plant and Medical College in Deh Kalan and Ghabdan villages, respectively. Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, public works department minister Vijay Inder Singla and Dhuri MLA Dalvir Singh Goldy accompanied Channi. Attacking Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Channi termed him an outsider. “How can they (AAP Delhi leaders) be common man of Punjab? They came to Punjab to loot the state. Their Delhi leadership does not even use pictures of state chief Bhagwant Mann. They are just seeking a chance for Kejriwal,” he claimed.He added that the ₹700 crore Punjab Cement Plant project would ensure direct and indirect employment to thousands of youth, and ₹350-crore medical college would offer quality health care. Dhiman skips eventAmargarh MLA Surjit Singh Dhiman skipped Channi’s event; in a related development, state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu had visited the Dirba residence of Dhiman and held a meeting for over an hour on Monday night.“I was busy in a meeting in Chandigarh on Tuesday. Sidhu visited my place for a routine meeting, as he had not visited here since taking charge as the PPC chief. I will contest from the same seat, but I also demand a ticket from Sunam for my son Jaswinder Dhiman. If the party gives two tickets to other families, we must also be given two.

It had to execute the project. Had it been on time, it would have saved many lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the foundation stone is so delayed, God knows how long its inauguration would take if things move at the same pace,“ he added.He, however, said that he was happy the first hurdle had been finally crossed after three tenders. “I was there in Jamui, but the CM did not feel the need to visit here for a project that people of the district had been waiting for so long and I have myself written a couple of times to CM not to delay it further. But I was surprised to see that it has been made out to be a state government project, while the fact is that the Centre gave it to Jamui and I have been personally instrumental in it. Centre has provided the major share of fund for it,” he added.Chirag said that there was not even one poster of Prime Minister Narendra Modi or any central leader, while all the hoardings and banners had Nitish Kumar’s picture. “No representative of the union government was invited. Only CM and Bihar ministers are visible here. On Monday, I talked to the union health minister’s office about it, and he was not even aware of the foundation stone laying,” he added.Bihar minister Dr Ashok Choudhary, who is also the in-charge minister of Jamui, said that BJP’s Mangal Pandey as the health minister was there at the foundation stone laying function and he should be more concerned about it. “Why should Chirag be worried about it?” he asked.Another minister Sumit Kumar, who was in Jamui, hit back at Chirag, saying he had come just for a photo shoot.In August also, Chirag had trained his gun at the Bihar government, accusing it of going slow on the medical college project in his constituency.

He also greeted the citizens on the occasion of Geeta Jayanti.“During freedom movement, Sadguru gave a mantra of Swadeshi. Now, the nation has started the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Mission. Local trade, business and products are being strengthened. Local is being made global,” said the Prime Minister.“By giving strength to the local business and focusing on employment generation, the local is being made global,” said Modi. He emphasized that cities like Varanasi had preserved the seeds of India’s identity, art and entrepreneurship, even in the toughest of times. “Where there is a seed, the tree begins to expand from there. And that is why, when we talk about the development of Banaras, it also forms the roadmap for the development of the entire India,” said Modi. “Embracing the novelty while retaining the old, Benaras is giving a new direction to the country,” he added. The PM also urged people to take a resolution to educate their daughters and develop their skills. “Along with their families, the people who can afford, should also take the responsibility of skill development of one or two daughters from financially weaker section families,” he said. Appealing to people to save water, he said: “We have to keep our rivers, Gangaji and all water sources clean.” These can be resolutions that should be given momentum in the next two years, added the PM. Zero budget farming should become mass movement: PMPrime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised on the importance of zero budget natural farming, saying it should be made a mass movement.“Our Gaudhan (cows) should not only be a source of milk for farmers. It is our endeavor that cows add to other dimensions of progress. Today, the country is promoting bio-fuel through Gobardhan scheme while organic and zero budget farming are also being encouraged. People should be made aware of benefits of organic and zero budget farming so that more people engage in zero budget farming, which could become a mass movement,” he said while addressing the event marking the 98th anniversary celebrations of Sadguru Sadafaldeo Vihangam Yog Sansthan at Swarved Mahamandir here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/its-our-responsibility-to-bring-spiritual-gurus-contribution-to-light-pm-101639496724216.html

14-12-2021||Mumbai||NCB seizes ₹13 cr worth drugs in courier||Mumbai Mumbai zonal office of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) carried out eight operations in the past two days and seized nearly 10kg of multiple drugs and psychotropic substances, estimated to be worth ₹13 crore in the illicit market. An Ivory Coast national has been arrested by the NCB in connection with the seizures. The seized drugs, which mainly include amphetamine and opium, were to be smuggled to different destinations in Europe, America, Gulf countries and Australia through courier parcels. An NCB officer said the consignments were being smuggled to meet the demand for new year celebrations. NCB Mumbai Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede said his team carried out eight operations in last two days and raided multiple premises across Mumbai. “During the operation, approximately 2.296kg amphetamine, 3.906kg of opium, 2.525kg (more than 10,000 pills) Zolpidem were seized. Private places including offices of some courier service providers were raided in Andheri, Dongri and other areas,” said Wankhede. He added that the seized amphetamine has been manufactured in Mumbai, while opium was suspected to be brought from Madhya Pradesh. The cartel, he said, was believed to have sent drugs abroad in the last two months, as they were very active during this time. The agency also suspects that the cartel was highly organised and sophisticated. “They used modus operandi which we haven’t heard of. The racket members were smuggling drugs by cleverly concealing them in cavities of stethoscopes, bicycle helmets, ovens, hose pipes, bangles, hard disks and in packets of grocery items such as eatables, corn flakes, snack mix and other grocery items,” said Wankhede. Initial probe by NCB has revealed that the drugs were being supplied to meet orders received from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Dubai, Maldives and other European countries. “We have arrested one John Bkayoko, an Ivory Coast national after his role was ascertained. He is the common link in at least three cases. He had booked the couriers and was the point person for the foreign cartels in India. Fake identity cards and two passports have also been seized from the foreigner. He would be produced before the court on Wednesday for remand,” Wankhede added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-seizes-rs-13-cr-worth-drugs-in-courier-101639494623926.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Money laundering: HC rejects ED’s plea for Khaira’s custody||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday dismissed the enforcement directorate’s (ED) plea seeking custody of Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira in the alleged money laundering case. The plea filed on November 24 was dismissed by the bench of justice Sureshwar Thakur. The detailed order is awaited. The ED in this plea has challenged a Mohali court order, which denied it Khaira’s remand and sent him to judicial custody on November 18. While seeking the Congress leader’s seven-day custody, the ED had claimed that he was an accomplice of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. Khaira is also to be questioned about the source of funds that he got from the United States for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2016, the plea stated. The ED had also claimed that he did not cooperate during the custody. Khaira won the assembly election in 2017 from Bholath on the AAP ticket. He later rebelled and floated a party ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, before resigning as the MLA and joining the Congress in June this year. The ED arrested him on November 11 under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The central probe agency had also raided his premises in March this year. Proceedings have been initiated in connection with a 2015 FIR. A court had convicted four persons and by the same order, Khaira was summoned as “additional accused”. In December 2017, the Supreme Court stayed his summoning. Khaira has all along maintained that these proceedings are part of “political vendetta”. Khaira, who is in judicial custody, also approached the high court on Monday seeking bail. Acting on the plea, the high court has directed the ED to file a detailed status report within a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-hc-rejects-ed-s-plea-for-khaira-s-custody-101639493663987.html

14-12-2021||Mumbai||Accused who beheaded wife in Matheran tried to cover all possible evidences: Police||The accused who beheaded his wife at a lodge in Matheran was inspired by a popular crime show, police said. The accused, Ramsilochan Pal (25), had made a detailed plan to kill his wife, Poonam (27), and then hide the evidence. “He tried to cover all possible evidence and he was successful in covering 80% of the loopholes. Yet we managed to nab him within 12 hours. He was sure that he had planned a perfect murder and won’t be caught, but was taken by surprise when he found us at his door,” sub-divisional police officer, Vijay Lagare, said.Police added that he had no regrets until he was caught. As per their tradition, the couple had to stay separately after marriage till a ritual was conducted. During this phase, the couple developed friendly relations over the phone and the deceased happened to speak to him about her past, which didn’t go well with him.“The deceased was born and brought up in Mumbai while the accused had spent half of his life in Uttar Pradesh and came here during his engineering days. The accused didn’t like his wife’s frank nature but never showed any dislikes to her. When we spoke to Poonam’s friend, she said that the deceased had always told that her husband was very understanding,” Lagare added.In the last three months, the couple had visited Matheran twice and stayed at two different lodges. In both the lodges, the administration asked for their Aadhar card copies. Hence, this time, the accused booked another lodge which was on the outskirts. He was carrying plastic bags and a knife with him this time. On the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, the accused throttled his wife to death while she was asleep and then undressed her before dragging her to the bathroom wherein he beheaded her. He then kept her body beneath the cot and wrapped the head in three plastic bags and a cloth bag, and walked out of the lodge, dumping her purse, clothes and head one by one into a valley. On his way from Neral to Thane by train, he threw her phone. After he reached home, his wife’s brother called him on phone to check their whereabouts, to which he said that he was not with her and doesn’t know where she was.“The accused had switched off his phone on Saturday while leaving Panvel and switched it on only after returning to Panvel after the crime. The couple met each other at Neral on Saturday and travelled together to Matheran. While the victim told her parents that she was going out with her husband and left Goregaon, the accused said that he was out for company work and left his Panvel residence. Since the duo met at Neral, we suspect that he would have had some other phone with him, which he would have used to coordinate with his wife. We are in the process of procuring the Call Data Record of his wife to find the same,” Lagare said.Raigad DSP, Atul Zende, said, “The accused has been remanded to police custody for five days. We’ll try to recover the weapon used. We’ll also be taking action against the lodge for not taking the identity cards of the couple.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/accused-who-beheaded-wife-in-matheran-tried-to-cover-all-possible-evidences-police-101639491743812.html

Bhattacharya had won from Singur four times in a row between 2001 and 2016.Top Bengal BJP leaders, including state president Sukanta Majumdar, took part in the agitation that was led by the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, who left the TMC in December last year.After coming to power for the first time in 2011, the TMC said that it was open to the idea of setting up industries in Singur but not without securing the interest of farmers. On June 14 that year, the assembly passed the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Bill 2011. In his speech, Adhikari, who was earlier a member of the state cabinet, focused on the 997.11 acres of multi-crop farmland that then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee acquired for the Tata project. A portion of this land is still lying useless because the cement work done for the project made it unfit for farming. Adhikari accused Banerjee of ruining job opportunities as opposition leader and failing to provide a livelihood to local people as the chief minister.“Where are the promises you made? Today, the farmers are in distress and the local people of Singur have no work. Fertilizers are being sold at a premium by middlemen. Farmers are not getting the right price for their crops. You (the chief minister) said a lot of things against the Centre’s farm laws that were supposed to protect farmers. What have you done for them?” said Adhikari.After the assembly polls, Bengal’s industry minister Partha Chatterjee said his government was ready to welcome the Tata Group to Bengal but clarified that the agricultural land in Singur would not be used for setting up engineering industries.“Why would the Tatas want to return to Singur? The land has already been given back to farmers. We are planning to come up with agro-based industries in Singur as the area’s economy is based on agriculture,” Chatterjee said in July.On Tuesday, however, Chatterjee and other TMC leaders countered the BJP politically, skirting the issue of employment. “At a time when the campaign is on for the December 19 Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections, the BJP has gone to Singur because it knows that it cannot win a single seat,” said Chatterjee.“If the BJP enjoyed the confidence of Singur farmers, it would have won the local assembly seat. This is nothing but diversionary tactics to shift focus from the KMC elections,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-demands-protection-for-bengal-s-farmers-launches-agitation-in-singur-101639491627536.html
14-12-2021||Mumbai||City records sharp dip in temperature, but winter isn’t here yet||Mumbai After just over a week of above-normal temperatures, the city recorded a dip in mercury with Tuesday’s minimum settling at 18.9 degrees Celsius -- the second coldest morning of the season.Unseasonal rain earlier this month sent the temperature dropping to 18.4 degrees Celsius on December 5. This follows a steep drop in temperature in Mumbai since Monday evening, when the maximum temperature dropped to 32.1 degrees Celsius (down from 35 degrees Celsius a day prior).“There has been a sudden drop in temperature, but it will be temporary. Prevailing wind speeds are still easterly to north-easterly, whereas Maharashtra requires strong northerly winds to have a good winter. If you look at places in Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada, the minimum temperatures are between three to four degrees above normal still. So we cannot say that winter has arrived. The north Konkan region on Tuesday morning received some lower-level winds from the north, which is why Mumbai, Dahanu and other areas felt cool,” said KS Hosalikar, scientist (surface instrument division) at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Pune.Hosalikar added that there will be “a gradual reduction in temperatures after two days, but there are no significant changes in minimum temperature expected immediately” in Mumbai. As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, the maximum temperature is expected to hover around 30 degrees Celsius for the next week, while the minimum temperature could dip to as much as 16 degrees Celsius by December 21.Despite the dip in temperature, however, pollution levels in the city have improved thanks to stronger than usual winds, up to 16kmph in some places. From an air quality index of 225 (poor) on Saturday, when Mumbai also recorded a maximum temperature of 34.2 degrees Celsius, the city’s AQI on Tuesday afternoon was 120 (moderate). “Higher wind speed leads to a higher ventilation index, which means that the wind can disperse a greater amount of particulate matter. Typically, wind speeds slow down in the winter, but the drop in temperature today is actually because we have got some cool winds from the north” said a scientist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/city-records-sharp-dip-in-temperature-but-winter-isn-t-here-yet-101639490955230.html

The department was asked to examine the feasibility of attaching reflectors on transport vehicles at the time of passing the vehicle. The minister also directed the department to install traffic signage in both Punjabi and English across the state. Of 797 black spots, 289 rectifiedPSRSC director general R Venkatratnam informed the minister that the transport department study had identified 391 black spots across 12 districts in 2019, out of which 264 were on National Highways passing through the state. Of these 264, 218 have been rectified and work is in progress on the remaining 49. Meanwhile, of the 127 blackspots on state highways and other roads, 71 had been rectified.In the second phase, more than 406 spots have been identified in remaining 11 districts, for which rectification process would begin soon, he said.

According to the Samta Nagar police, the incident occurred at 6 pm on Monday, when the complainant - identified as Sandeep Gujjar, 40, was on his way from his office in Malad to Mira Road in his Fortuner. A few men on motorcycles had been following his vehicle. While two motorcyclists tailed his car, the other two overtook it and blocked it from the front. Gujjar stopped his car to find out what was the matter. When the car halted, one of the motorcyclists got off the two-wheeler and asked him to get off the car. Gujjar did what was told to him. As he got off, the other motorcyclist broke the window glass of the seat next to the driver and flicked the bag containing cash. After the motorcyclist fled in different directions, Gujjar called up the police control room. At that time, he also realised that he was being followed by a car. A team of policemen attached to Samta Nagar police station reached the spot and detained a few suspects travelling in the car that tailed Gujjar’s vehicle. The police are now tracing the four motorcyclists who fled with cash. “We believe that it was an insider job as the robbers were aware of Gujjar’s car, time he left for Mira Road and also about the money he was carrying along,” said Anandrao Hanke, senior police inspector of Samta Nagar police station. The police are also scanning the CCTV recordings of the roads leading to the spot to identify the robbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gang-on-bikes-rob-rs-35l-from-businessman-travelling-on-weh-101639488315000.html

However, for the current fiscal, the state’s share of ₹800 crore and Centre’s share of ₹1200 crore has not been received, he said.For the last financial year, he said, as of October 30 this year, the state’s share of ₹762.81 crore and Centre’s share of ₹1,144.21 crore were required while the state’s share has not been received, ₹843.81 crore from the Centre’s share was received, he said.Under the scheme, the target of 1,51,073 houses was allotted for the financial year 2019-20, of which 69,097 houses have been constructed while 81,976 were still incomplete.Singh Deo said the state had sought time from the Centre to release its contribution, but it was not entertained and the allotment was withdrawn (for 2021-22).The minister also further claimed the state was due to get around ₹20,000 crore under various funds from the Centre and said if the Centre will not provide funds to the states then how will the development activities take place.Subsequently, Chandrakar said if the state government can take hefty loans for other schemes and had already crossed the fiscal discipline in terms of state debts, then why can’t it take a loan for housing schemes for the poor?“Whether the state government would return all the schemes to the Centre in which it has a contribution of 40 per cent?” Chandrakar said.Parliamentary affairs minister Ravindra Choubey alleged the Centre has been biased with the state and asked why it was not giving due funds to the state.The ruling party MLAs accused the Centre of meting out step-motherly treatment in the allocation of funds to Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uproar-in-chhattisgarh-assembly-over-pmay-g-scheme-shortfalls-101639486216229.html

It later transpired that a few men on motorcycles had been following his vehicle, while two motorcyclists tailed his car, the other two overtook and blocked his vehicle from the front, officials said. The police are now tracing the four motorcyclists who fled with cash.“We believe that it was an insider’s job as the robbers were aware of Gujjar’s car, the time he left for Mira Road and also about the money he was carrying along,” said Anandrao Hanke, senior police inspector of Samta Nagar police station.Gujjar stopped his car to find out what was the matter. When the car halted, one of the motorcyclists got off the two-wheeler and held the driver’s collar and asked him to get off the car. Gujjar did what was told to him. As he got off, the other motorcyclist broke the window glass of the seat next to the driver and flicked the bag containing cash.After the motorcyclist fled in different directions, Gujjar called up the police control room. At that time he also realised that he was being followed by a car. A team of policemen attached to Samta Nagar police station reached the spot and detained a few suspects travelling in the car that tailed Gujjar’s vehicle.The police are also scanning the CCTV recordings of the roads leading to the spot to identify the robbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bikeborne-miscreants-rob-businessman-of-rs-35-lakh-on-western-express-highway-101639484595796.html

Kejriwal made this announcement during his one-day visit to Kashipur area of US Nagar in Kumaon. US Nagar is the home district of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. Kejriwal said, “By evening, all will start cursing him on TV channels where I will get the money for this. I will tell you where the money will come from. Uttarakhand budget is around ₹55000 crore. Isn’t corruption there in the state? In any work, how much corruption is there? Some say there is 60%, 80% corruption in the state. Let us say there is 20% corruption, so, 20% of 55,000 crores is around ₹11000 crore, which goes into pockets of politicians and then to Swiss banks,” he said Kejriwal said the announcement will have a financial implication of ₹3000 crore. “I will stop the money going to Swiss banks. So, the money going to Swiss banks will go into the pockets of women here. Tell this to all,” he said. This is Kejriwal’s fifth visit to the hill state this year. On November 21, during his one-day visit to Haridwar, Kejriwal announced that if AAP is elected to power in Uttarakhand, it will provide free pilgrimage service to people in the state as is provided by the AAP government in Delhi. During his visit to Nainital district in September, Kejriwal announced that if AAP is elected to power in the state, it will give employment in every household of the state (Har Ghar Rozgar) and ₹5000 stipend to unemployed youths till they don’t get jobs. He had also announced that AAP will provide 1 lakh government jobs within six months of coming to power in the state. On August 17, when Kejriwal visited the state, he announced Colonel Ajay Kothiyal (Retd) as the chief ministerial face of the party for the 2002 assembly polls.

14-12-2021||Mumbai||Cyber police arrest man from Goa for duping doctor of ₹21 lakh||West region cyber police station in Mumbai has arrested a 35-year-old man from Goa for allegedly duping a city-based 31-year-old doctor to the tune of ₹21 lakh by using a fake identity on a popular matrimonial site, officials said. Police suspect that he might have targeted other women in a similar fashion as the bio-data of five other women were found in his possession. The arrested accused, Zorin Anil Solanki aka Kshitij Desai, is a Borivli resident. Police officials said the class 12 drop-out created a profile on a popular matrimonial site, posing as a stock trader. Solanki would upload his photographs on the sites and lure women to fall for his handsome looks, they added. “He got connected to the Andheri-based doctor on the matrimonial site a few months back. He emotionally trapped her and would always show that he cared a lot about her. Promising to marry her, he, under the pretext of investing money in the share market for their future, collected ₹21 lakh from her over a period of time,” said DCP (cyber) Dr Rashmi Karandikar. The complainant woman recently read news articles about the arrest of Pune-based conman Yuvraj Bhosale, who has duped many women registered on matrimonial sites and suspected that she might have also been a victim of such fraud. At her request, the cyber police carried out a preliminary enquiry and her suspicion turned out to be true. Cyber police found out that the person she was interacting with for months was indeed a cheat after which the medical profession lodged a formal police complaint, leading to the registration of an FIR against Solanki, on December 8. “The very next day we arrested Solanki from Goa where he was splurging the victim’s money on gambling in casinos along with his friends,” said Karandikar. The doctor saved money to gift a car to her elderly father but the accused defrauded her of all her savings, the DCP added. “Solanki would play his game very smartly and give bank account details of his friends to receive the fraud money to avoid any police action. His background check revealed that he has two criminal cases registered against him in the past – one at VP Road police station for cheating and an assault case. It was found that he has spent time in jail as well,” said assistant police inspector Shubhangi Holkar. “Solanki’s matrimonial account was deleted by the service provider as he failed to comply with the KYC norms. But, by then he had already managed to get the doctor’s phone number by using the chatting feature on the matrimonial site. The service providers must introduce more security features to prevent misuse of their platforms from such cheats who just come on their sites to look for contacts of gullible women. Bio-data of five more women have been found in his possession,” said DCP Karandikar. “Solanki has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act for cheating and impersonation. A city court has remanded him to police custody till December 15,” said Holkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyber-police-arrest-man-from-goa-for-duping-doctor-of-rs-21-lakh-101639479195101.html

In this initiative, the complainant needs to click a picture of a non-functioning or damaged streetlight and send it on any of the numbers — 9289401408 or 9289386409 — through WhatsApp, along with a message containing the location of the streetlight and his/her name and address. The officials said that the two helplines will be operational 24x7 on WhatsApp, while calls regarding queries and other related issues would be addressed on these numbers by MCM staff between 9am and 5pm on all working days.“We are exploring various modes through which we can connect with residents, not only to resolve their issues but also help us determine the extent of civic problems. We are planning to introduce more such helplines for other matters,” said a senior MCM official privy to the matter.The official quoted above further said that the initiative was launched on Saturday and the civic body has received around 10 complaints so far. “All officials concerned have been notified about the helpline numbers and directed to make residents aware of it. We have also alerted residents through our official social media handles. Officials have been directed to fix all complaints of streetlights within a 48-hour window, otherwise they will have to submit in writing the reasons behind the delay,” said Parveen Dalal, executive engineer (electrical), MCM.Prior to this, the only other time the MCM launched a helpline number for residents was in April for the lifting of biomedical waste during the second Covid-19 wave.Residents have welcomed the civic body’s decision to launch helpline numbers. “Apart from the social media and making a visit to the MCM office, there are limited ways to take up civic-related matters with officials. Such helpline numbers would be extremely convenient for residents,” said Ajit Yadav, a resident of Sector 81.
14-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: 20 ponds to be developed in Aravallis by March||To ensure availability of water for animals during the summer months, the wildlife department will dig at least 20 ponds in the Aravallis by March, said officials on Monday. These ponds will be developed in Faridabad, Gurugram, Nuh, Rewari, and Mahendragarh districts, the officials said, adding that these ponds were being developed in the winter months so that they are ready before summer. MS Malik, chief conservator of forests (wildlife),Gurugram circle, said, “We have sent a proposal to the state wildlife department for developing ponds in the Aravallis so that drinking water is available to animals. We have proposed to develop 20 ponds and we will also work on rejuvenating the existing ponds in the forests.” Officials said a final approval is awaited but they are aiming to complete the work by February-March next year. Officials from the Gurugram wildlife department said water bodies will be developed in the shape of a pan and the sides of the pond will not be concreted so that animals may approach or leave the watering hole easily. These ponds will be replenished using water tankers, officials said. Even during the winter months, the Aravallis tend to dry up faster because of less rainfall. The sandy soil also makes it difficult to hold water. Wildlife experts said developing ponds will help animals in the region, but the location of these ponds is crucial. Sunil Harsana, a Faridabad-based ecologist, said, “In the Aravallis, there are many old mining pits where water is available both during the winter and summer months and the movement of animals shifts according to the availability of water. But during summers, there are places where water is not available but animal movement is still noticed there. Smaller animals such as rabbits or herbivores are found in certain patches, due to which carnivores also follow them but these areas might be out of their range of water sources. So, ponds must be developed after studying the movement patterns of animals so that the distribution is equal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-20-ponds-to-be-developed-in-aravallis-by-march-101639475594478.html

The stretch holds importance as it also provides connectivity to the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, besides linking newer sectors 36, 88, and 89, among others, with the Dwarka Expressway. Overall, 12 projects were given administrative approval and the tender allotment of 11 other development projects was approved during the meeting held at the Sector 34 office of the civic body. The 800-metre portion of the Pataudi Road, from near the Oriental Bank of Commerce branch in Sector 88 till Saint Paul’s School adjoining the Dwarka Expressway, will be reconstructed.Due to plying of heavy commercial vehicles, the stretch has developed potholes over time and the MCG decided to reconstruct it with materials such as dense-bituminous macadam, medium-curing asphalt cement, and ready-mix concrete used in the construction of national highways so that it can sustain the weight of heavy vehicles, said the officials. “We are aiming to start construction as soon as the ongoing ban across the NCR is lifted. It will take us around three weeks to complete the work, provided it proceeds uninterrupted,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.A ₹1.45-crore estimate for the project was approved during the finance and contract committee meeting in October. On Monday, the tender allotment for the project was approved at ₹1.12 crore, the officials said. The 12 projects that got administrative approval in the Monday’s meeting included construction of streets in Saraswati Enclave at a cost of ₹2.35 crore, construction of road and footpath from Khatushyam temple to Wazirabad dam at ₹1.53 crore, and construction of 18-metre wide roads in Sector 46 for ₹2.46 crore. Tender allotment of 10 other development projects approved in the meeting included constructing a ₹2.20-crore stormwater drain alongside the railway track in the ward 3 area, ₹2.14 crore for construction of internal roads in Sector 38, and ₹2.10 crore for construction of 10-metre, 12-metre, and 15-metre roads in Sector 43.“Administrative approval for 12 development works and tender allotment of 11 other projects were approved in the meeting after adequate deliberation. With these projects, the citizens of Gurugram will get better facilities.

14-12-2021||Other||Faridabad: Govt flats allotted to Khori residents in shambles||The residents of Faridabad’s Khori village, which has been demolished over the past few months as it encroached on the protected Aravalli land, said on Monday that the government flats allotted to them under a rehabilitation plan are in a dilapidated condition and lack basic amenities. The colony that came up illegally on 150 acres of Aravalli forest land was razed by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) on the order of the Supreme Court passed in June this year. According to a drone survey of the civic body, at least 6,600 houses had come up illegally in Khori. The residents were later offered flats made for the economically weaker section (EWS) at Dabua Colony and Bapu Colony in Faridabad.Most of these flats, constructed for slum dwellers, have been lying unused for over 10 years, officials from the MCF said, adding there are 1,776 flats in Dabua Colony and 779 in Bapu Colony.An HT team visited the two colonies on Monday and found that doors and window grilles were missing in most of the flats. Besides, there is no power, water and sewage connections in the colonies. Heaps of garbage were found strewn all around the area.Residents said that about 200 families have been living in the two colonies legally for several years now, but most of the other flats lack facilities. Some people have even moved into unoccupied flats and live without any civic amenities, they said.Some people who worked as security guards when the colonies were being developed 15 years ago said that thieves had stolen the water pipes, toilet fittings, window panes, and grilles. Cases have been registered but no arrests have been made so far, they said. Shovran Singh (62), who worked as a security guard, said he has been illegally staying now as the area is not guarded and anyone can occupy a flat and live with the present condition. “Three people have been murdered in the area in the past seven years. The area is not safe for families to live in. We don’t leave children to play in other vacant blocks. Some groups come here for meetings in the vacant flats and leave late at night,” he said.Ramesh Kumar, who moved into a flat because it was unoccupied, said that they have to pay for water as there is no connection yet. “We can’t even question or complain about it to anyone, as they will throw us out. I live with my family and drive an auto-rickshaw to make ends meet. It’s a free shelter for us,” he said. There are residents like Kumar who said that they don’t come out of their flats after 7pm. The children are not even allowed to play outside the clusters, they said. Some children who were playing in a ground said that they are allowed to play only till 2pm. “My parents fear that someone will kidnap me from here as several such incidents have been reported,” said a 13-year-old boy who lives with his parents in Dabua Colony for the past over 10 years. Balraj Sharma, who works as a driver and has occupied a flat illegally, said that the area has no facility but is for free due to which he along with his family lives here. “Except 202 families, the rest are living here illegally. There is no light so we cook in the afternoon for both times and sleep by 7pm. We often hear tiffs and scuffles but we don’t go out. People who are in dire need of shelter can manage to stay here as we did with help of a few other families,” he said. According to the MCF officials, they counted 6,664 roofs when they did an aerial survey before the demolition of Khori village. “Our e-portal has 5,011 applications for the rehabilitation scheme, and we have provisionally accepted 1,178,” said an officer.Yashpal Yadav, municipal commissioner, Faridabad, said as per the plan, a family is considered eligible for allotment of flat if the income of the family does not exceed ₹3 lakh annually, and the name of the head of the family should be on the voters’ list of the Badkhal assembly constituency of Haryana as of January 1, 2021. The officials said that any slum dweller from Khori village under the prescribed criteria will be given a flat worth ₹3,77,300. Initially, ₹17,000 has to be deposited for the flat allotment and after that an amount of ₹2,500 will have to be given in monthly instalments for 15 years, they said. Dwellers from Khori who were evicted said they are presently staying on rent in other areas and paying ₹4,000 a month. Some people who visited Dabua Colony on Monday were carrying their allotment letters and flat numbers but were shocked to find the dilapidated condition of their flats. “The MCF is asking to pay ₹17,000 as down payment but we are left with no money as we could not work for months due to the demolition drive. If we don’t pay, we will not get the flat. But even if we pay, we cannot stay here and it will take at least a year to make this place liveable,” said Manjur Alam, a tailor. Hadish Ansari, a resident of Khori for 15 years, said that he has taken a loan from relatives and ready to pay but how will he shift here. “I will have to start paying instalments the day I take possession, but at the same time will have to pay rent. The bathroom has been dug up by thieves. At least ₹20,000 is required to repair each flat. We are poor people and can’t spend such an amount on repairing works,” he said. The municipal commissioner said that they have offered flats to the Khori slum dwellers but they are not ready to take possession. “The flats need repair and they will get completed in April 2022 as construction work is banned presently. We have found that there are nearly 900 families who have legal documents and are eligible to take possession,” he said. Yadav further said that they have nearly 2,200 flats in their possession. “Though we have started cleaning the area, a lot more needs to be done,” he said. Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar from faculty of architecture, building and planning at the University of Melbourne, who has been studying Khori village, said, “It has been five months since the demolition, but the housing units under the rehabilitation scheme are in a deplorable condition. They are not fit for any human to reside,” she said. Vimal Bhai, a social activist who has been helping Khori residents to complete their documentation and process of allotment, said, “The government first made the people of Khori poor by breaking homes that they built on land bought by their life earnings and then asked them to buy these unhabitable flats in the name of rehabilitation,” he said. 
14-12-2021||Patna||Former bureaucrat wins mukhiya seat in Bihar following wife’s footsteps||Arun Kumar, a former commissioner at the Chief Vigilance Commission (CVC), is the new mukhiya of the Raj Singhwahini panchayat in Sonbarsa block in Bihar’s Sitamarhi district following a comfortable victory in the panchayat elections. He succeeds his wife Ritu Jaiswal, a mukhiya and winner of Champions of Change and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar (DDUPSP) 2019, who narrowly lost the assembly elections last time.In a state known for the stereotype of power-wielding men fielding women as proxies in politics, the former officer has truly followed into his wife’s footsteps in the political arena. “The fact that I got almost two-third votes cast, while the rest of the nine candidates together polled just one-third, shows the trust my wife was able to build with her work in the panchayat. Now, I will try to build on that,” he said, adding he would focus on increasing farmers’ income, while his wife would continue to work for women’s empowerment.Kumar said that farmers were the worst sufferers as the cost of agriculture was consistently going up. “They don’t get the minimum support price (MSP) and have to sell their produce at throwaway prices. On the other hand, they have to purchase fertilizers from the black market at exorbitant price, as even DAP is in very short supply and to make matters worse, there is smuggling across the border,” said the officer, who still runs his Magnum online classes for IAS (Indian Administrative Service) aspirants.Also Read: Over ₹37,134cr GST compensation due to states for 2020-21His wife, who won her debut panchayat election last time from a non-reserved seat, is elated that her husband will now take care of the panchayat she nurtured in the last five years. “Earlier, he helped me to work for the betterment of the panchayat. Now, I will help him,” she said, adding the 2021 panchayat polls has brought many new enterprising men and women into rural governance, which would help the state achieve faster and inclusive growth.Son beats fatherIn Madhopur panchayat of Gopalganj, which polled in the 10th phase, Santosh Kumar defeated his father Vijay Kumar Prasad for the post of mukhiya. There were six candidates in the fray. “Earlier, I helped my father in whatever development work has been carried out in Madhopur. Now, I will do it myself. I am happy that the people have chosen me this time,” Santosh Kumar said.Many sitting mukhiyas bite the dustThere have been several upsets in the Bihar panchayat polls with contesting youth and women winning widespread support. Women have been winning even from the 50% seats that are not reserved for them. Similarly, youth participation and victories have risen too. The state election commission (SEC) is now planning a survey to study the new trends in the Panchayat elections, said an official of the SEC.
14-12-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka MLC polls: BJP, Cong neck and neck, Suraj Revanna set to win||Suraj Revanna from the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), who is the eighth member of former PM HD Deve Gowda’s family to enter electoral politics, was all set to be elected to the Upper House of the Karnataka legislature, according to trends emerging from the counting of votes for the biennial election to the council’s 25 seats from 20 local authorities’ constituencies on Tuesday.Suraj is the elder son of Gowda’s son and former minister, HD Revanna. Suraj’s younger brother is an MP from Hassan, and his mother was a former zila panchayat member who is likely to seek re-election in the local body polls early next year.Gowda’s other son, HD Kumaraswamy, was the former chief minister of Karnataka and is the JD(S) legislator from Channapatana. Kumaraswamy’s wife is the legislator from Ramanagara and their actor son, Nikhil, unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Mandya, a stronghold of the regional party.The MLC polls were conducted on December 10 for 25 seats in the 75-member Upper House of the state legislature with the terms of 14 Congress, seven Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and four JD(S) MLCs set to end on January 5. All three major parties are looking to win big in the MLC polls which is key to controlling the Upper house or the Vidhana Parishad.According to preliminary reports, the BJP and the Congress are leading in 11 seats each while the JD(S) is expected to win in Hassan if the current trends hold till the end of counting, underway in about 20 centres across the state, A clear picture is likely to emerge by post noon or evening, poll officials said.The Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government is hoping to overcome the loss suffered in the October 30 bypolls in Hanagal.

His ascent to the top post in the state was hotly contested by members of his own party when a replacement for former chief minister BS Yediyurappa was being searched for earlier this year.The results would also help the Congress asses their chances in upcoming polls like zilla and taluka panchayat, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) polls and the 2023 assembly elections.The JD(S) has found it hard to bounce back after it won only one out of the 28 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The regional outfit has allowed its local leaders to ally with any party they think would “benefit the JD(S)”--tacitly extending support to the BJP as both parties consider the Congress as their “common enemy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/suraj-revanna-set-to-win-seat-bjp-cong-neck-and-neck-in-karnataka-mlc-polls-101639470794196.html

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik had earlier claimed that Wankhede was given the licence despite being ineligible for it. The Thane excise unit’s superintender Nilesh Sangde said the notice was issued on December 10 following an inquiry into Malik’s allegations claiming that Wankhede was 17 years old when he received the licence for the bar in Hotel Sadguru in Navi Mumbai. “It has come to light that Wankhede did not provide any proof of his age at the time of applying for the licence. We have asked him to respond to the notice in writing by or before December 17. After that, we will schedule a hearing before the Thane collector and further course of action will be depend on the outcome of the hearing,” Sangde said. He added that inquiries are also being conducting internally to find out how the license was issued when no proof of age was furnished by Wankhede. Wankhede’s father Dnyandev maintains that the application for the licence was submitted based on the assumption that the age eligibility was 18 years. Also Read: Sameer Wankhede to appear before caste certificate scrutiny committee today“Sameer was 17 years and 10 months old at the time, and the license is granted by a committee after deliberations. We had assumed that this process would take a couple of months during which time Sameer would turn 18. How is it our fault if the committee issued the license immediately?” the senior Wankhede asked. Excise officials, however, maintained that the permissible age had always been 21 years. Dnyandev added, “If the excise department wants to cancel my licence, they should return the lakhs of rupees I have paid as licence fees every year. I am prepared to go to court for this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/excise-dept-issues-notice-to-sameer-wankhede-over-bar-license-101639468933738.html

President Ram Nath Kovind also gave his assent to the bill that completed the process of repealing the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-to-launch-3-day-sit-in-in-singur-today-to-press-for-7-point-demand-charter-for-farmers-101639448249815.html
14-12-2021||Mumbai||NCB's Sameer Wankhede to appear before caste certificate scrutiny committee today in religion-caste controversy case||Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede is on Tuesday set to appear before the Mumbai district caste certificate scrutiny committee, which is investigating the allegations regarding the officer's caste certificate.The summons was issued by the commission late last month based on a complaint lodged by Ashok Kamble, the president of the Maharashtra unit of the Bhim Army,. Kamble alleged Wankhede provided false information about himself to obtain a ‘Mahar’ caste certificate for a government job.In addition to Kamble, Dalit activist Manoj Sansare has also joined in as another complainant in the case.According to allegations raised by both of them, Wankhede is Muslim by birth and got married in accordance with Sharia and the officer allegedly obtained a bogus certificate to further his professional gains.The Mumbai district caste certificate scrutiny committee took cognizance of the complaints and held its first hearing on November 30.Advocate Nitin Satpute, representing both the complainants, presented two documents before the committee—a photocopy of Sameer Wankhede's birth certificate and another photocopy of his caste certificate issued by the Greater Mumbai executive magistrate.Based on these documents, the committee then decided to initiate a probe into the caste certificate issue and summoned Wankhede for its next hearing at 3pm on December 14.The religion-caste controversy against Sameer Wankhede, the man behind the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan in a high-profile drugs-on-cruise case in October, was first raised by Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, whose son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested by a team led by the NCB officer.Malik pointed Wankhede married Shabana Quraishi in 2006 according to Islamic rituals, and alleged that despite being a Muslim, the NCB zonal director “forged” a Scheduled Caste certificate to get a government job in the SC quota.Though Wankhede's first wife did not comment on the issue, his former father-in-law Dr Zaheed Quraishi said he knew the NCB officer's family as Muslims. He also confirmed that Sameer Wankhede practised Islam at the time when he married Shabana. The government job came a year after the Wankhede's first marriage, his former father-in-law said.It is, however, to be noted that the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) had earlier found that Sameer Wankhede's caste certificates were original and that there were no mal-intentions involved.Sameer Wankhede's father Dnyandev Wankhede also approached the Bombay high court asking it to pass an order prohibiting Nawab Malik from tweeting about the controversy at hand.In a major win for the Wankhede family, the minister later tendered an “unconditional apology” before the court for remarks in violation of a previous undertaking of his promising not to make any comments on Sameer Wankhede's past conduct in the discharge of official duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncbs-sameer-wankhede-to-appear-before-caste-certificate-scrutiny-committee-today-in-religion-caste-controversy-case-101639443841623.html

Both (Jammu and Kashmir), including Ladakh, have to move together. We are linked with our history and common interests”, CPI (M) leader and spokesperson of the PAGD MY Tarigami told scribes here. The PAGD, commonly called Gupkar Alliance, is an amalgam of regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir, including the National Conference, People’s Democratic Party and the CPI (M), which has moved the apex court challenging revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A, which divested Jammu and Kashmir of its special status. “We must identify the areas where we can agree and we have every right to disagree as well but while disagreements are there, there can be possibilities of agreements as well. We must explore the possibilities where some sort of a commonality emerges, which can be a binding force for all of us and we move together so that some relief is provided to the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” said Tarigami and informed that for this purpose he has come to Jammu to reach out to the civil society and political activists. When asked about no representation of Jammu in the PAGD, he said, “As far as constituents of the PAGD are concerned, there is a strong feeling that without the representation of Jammu and involvement of people of Jammu, without any credible dialogue with a cross-section of Jammu, including civil society, there will be no headway. Kashmir cannot go alone we have to move together…this is an article of faith (Article 370) for us.” In this context, the former legislator cited the instance of Kargil and Leh, which despite the difference of opinion over Articles 370 and 35-A, have joined hands for having constitutional safeguards over jobs and lands.

This has over the years resulted in disputes about the demarcation of boundaries and identification of rights in the dwelling and other areas, besides causing hardship in the effective transfer of rights. The object of this Bill is to make a law to identify the record and resolve the existing rights of the proprietors within the “abadi deh” by a process of ascertaining the person(s) best entitled to be recorded as proprietor, besides, demarcating, delineating the boundaries and areas of each survey unit. It also aims at creating a presumption of truth in the records so prepared. The preparation of this record would provide for the development of the “abadi deh” that preserves the heritage of the village to the extent possible and provide and upgrade civic services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bill-to-enable-rural-folks-to-use-properties-as-financial-assets-tabled-in-himachal-assembly-101639430290806.html

Whereas, there is hardly any forestland in the state where local communities do not have forest usage and dependence for livelihood needs,” she said. In the last five years, communities from Kangra, Chamba, Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti, Sirmaur and Mandi have been raising the demand for the implementation of this law in the state. It was after this that the state government was forced to announce that it would implement the Forest Rights Act in a mission mode in 2018. However, these are yet to be properly distributed at the village level. The FRCs have submitted both individual and community claims under the FRA, 2006, some as early as 2014. Still, no final decision has been taken on these claims. During the ongoing Vidhan Sabha winter session, a joint delegation of representatives of organisations from Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur, Chamba and Kangra briefed MLAs of opposition parties on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/expedite-implementation-of-forest-rights-act-lahaul-and-spiti-tribals-101639430232017.html

As soon as the House assembled for the day’s proceedings, Congress member Ram Lal Thakur sought to know about the adjournment motion notice given by the opposition members under Rule 67. The Speaker, Vipin Singh Parmar, denied the discussion citing a question on the same issue listed for December 15 and started to give a ruling. Interrupting him, Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the Speaker should not give a ruling without listening to the opposition members. “You should listen to at least one of the five members who have given the notice,” Agnihotri told the Speaker adding, “The Opposition needs the protection of the Speaker and he should not act partially.”Continuing with his ruling, the Speaker said as per Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly, not more than one matter shall be made on the same motion.“The notice given by the members contains more than one issue,” he said.Further, the Speaker said that as per Rule 69 (6) the motion shall not anticipate a matter, which has been previously appointed for consideration.“A question is already listed on December 15 on the same issue. Hence, the notice stands rejected,” he ruled and announced the Question Hour.The agitated Opposition members then moved to the well and started a mock assembly. With Ram Lal Thakur as their speaker, the mock assembly also passed several resolutions. Later, the Opposition staged a walkout.Speaking to the media outside the House, Ram Lal Thakur alleged that the government was running away from discussion on the important issues. He said the Opposition had sought adjournment of business of the House to discuss the ‘backdoor entries in various government departments and issues of outsourced employees and jobs on compassionate ground. He said the government was doing backdoor entries on outsourcing without following the due procedures and rules. He alleged that the appointments were being done through a Shimla-based company that belongs to the BJP and the employees through the company were not being given their dues which is a big scam.He said the government has also failed to formulate a policy for outsourced employees.“Also, the government had announced that if an employee dies on the last day of duty, his kin would be given a job on compassionate ground,” said Ram Lal.He said more than 5,000 people were awaiting appointments on compassionate grounds. However, now the government is stating that appointments on the compassionate ground could be given only on 1% posts of the total vacancies. “If it was so, why did they make a promise,” asked Thakur. He also accused the Speaker of being biased, who, he said does as directed by the government. He also questioned chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s absence from the assembly and said if he was not to attend, why did the government call the session. Meanwhile, Jal Shakti minister condemned the behaviour of the Opposition members and alleged that it was their old tactics to disrupt the proceedings of the House.

As she brought home the crown after a gap of 21 years, her friends, family and teachers all joined in to celebrate the achievement. The 21-year-old had moved to the tricity in 2008, after spending two years in England. Her father, Pritampal Singh Sandhu, 56, a realtor, says the family has always encouraged her to pursue her dreams.“When she participated in her first pageant, her mother and brother hid it from me. It was only after she won that they told me of this interest of hers. I immediately told my daughter that there was no need to hide her interests. Times have changed and she must do what she is good at,” he said proudly while talking to reporters at the family’s residence in Shivalik City, Kharar. He added that as he comes from a ‘simple’ Jatt family, he wasn’t sure people from his village may approve of his daughter’s career choices. But he is overwhelmed by the congratulatory messages pouring in ever since the 21-year-old won the crown.Her mother Dr Rabinder Kaur Sandhu, a gynecologist and senior medical officer at Sohana Hospital, Mohali, reveals how her father dotingly calls Harnaaz “Sherni”. “I never forced her to become a doctor or an engineer.

14-12-2021||Delhi||North MCD staff withdraw stir after salary assurances||North Delhi Municipal Corporation employees withdrew their agitation against non-payment of salaries on Monday within hours after civic body officials assured them to clear their dues within a given time frame.At least 10,000 employees that included doctors, paramedical staff, nurses, teachers and sanitation workers announced a 24-hour strike on Monday against non-payment of salaries and dearness allowance for several months even as they alleged that the civic body has failed to live up to previous assurances.The teachers, however, on Monday said they will continue their boycott of online classes until they get their salaries.A meeting was held on Monday between the civic body officials and members of various employees’ unions following which the agitation was called off, North MCD mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said. “We had a positive meeting with confederation of employees’ unions today. We have accepted most of their demands. As their main demand was related to notification of enhanced dearness allowances (DA), the North MCD has already issued a circular regarding that,” he said.According to a circular issued by the corporation on Monday, all the drawing and disbursing officers (DDOs) were directed to ensure 31% DA is given with the regular salary of December. HT has seen a copy of the circular.The three municipal corporations are facing a crippling financial crunch with all of them running huge budgetary deficits, and struggling to pay salaries to their employees. The crisis has come at a time when the national capital is going to face civic polls in three months. Though the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has governed the corporations for three straight terms, has claimed that it was being devoid of funds by the Delhi government, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — which is in power in the state — has maintained it has cleared all dues under all heads, and in fact has given extra to help the corporations pay salaries to their employees.The north MCD has a deficit of over ₹8,000 crore while its total budget for the next financial year is around ₹5,500 crore, according to the budget documents.Jogi Ram Jain, chairman of the North MCD’s standing committee, said the salaries of teachers will be released within a week, and that of the group-D employees, including the safai karmacharis, will be released within two weeks. “The other demands of the employees have also been taken into consideration by the corporation and efforts are being made to resolve the pending issues at the earliest,” he said.AP Khan, the convener of the Confederation of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Employees Union (CMCDEU), who attended the meeting with the corporation officials, said they have withdrawn the agitation considering the “positive approach” of the civic body administration. “Since municipal authorities have asked for three weeks’ time, to redress all our grievances, all unions of the confederation have unanimously accepted their proposal. If they do not fulfil their promises within the stipulated time, we’ll decide the further course of protest,” he said.The AAP decried the BJP-ruled North MCD’s assurances, and added that the civic body was fooling the employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-staff-withdraw-stir-after-salary-assurances-101639429858267.html

14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission asks insurance company to pay ₹1.24L||For failing to pay the complete covered medical insurance amount to a 65-year-old patient while being admitted in the hospital, District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Ludhiana, has directed United India Insurance Company Limited to pay the remaining amount of ₹1.24 lakh and ₹5,000 compensation.Manmohan Singh of Doraha, Ludhiana, submitted that he along with his wife was a joint holder of individual health insurance policy valid from December 30, 2013 to December 29, 2013, whereby he was covered upto an amount of ₹2. 25 lakh.The complainant was hospitalised in Satguru Partap Singh Apollo Hospital on December 01, 2013 following chest pain and was operated the next day and discharged on December 05, 2013.Singh claimed that the hospital raised a bill of ₹4,69,253 out of which he paid ₹3,04,253 while the insurance company paid just ₹1.05 lakh. Alleging deficiency of service, Singh sought the remaining amount from the insurance company along with ₹5 lakh compensation with interest @18% per annum.As per insurance companyThe counsel for the insurance company pleaded that the complainant was entitled to ₹ 1,00,910 only. He added that the complainant was suffering from DM and HTN (diabetes mellitus and hypertension) for the last 20 years.“The complainant was treated for CAB-PCI and pre-existing disease was not covered after 48 months of the policy. The sum insured in the year 2008 was ₹1.50 lakh as per the terms and conditions of the policy. In case of major surgery, only 70% of the amount was payable. The complainant submitted a claim of ₹ 4,69,253 but he was entitled to 70% of the sum insured of ₹ 1.50 lakh which has already been paid to the complainant,” added the counsel for the insurance company.Commission’s orderThe commission observed that plea by the insurance company was not tenable since the policy of insurance was taken by the complainant for the first time in the year 2007.“The condition of 48 months cannot be said to be applicable during the policy period of December 30, 2012 to December 29, 2013 as four years had already passed. The respondents have further claimed that the sum insured in the year 2008 was ₹ 1.50 lakh which also does not seem to be correct as no document has been produced on record. Even otherwise the sum insured mentioned in the year 2008 cannot be taken into account as during the currency of the current policy the claim was lodged, when the sum insured was ₹ 2.25 lakh,” stated the commission.The commission further ordered the insurance company to pay the remaining amount of ₹ 1,24,090 to the complainant along with interest @7%per annum from the date of filing of complaint till the date of actual payment and an additional amount of ₹ 5,000 as compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-consumer-disputes-redressal-commission-asks-insurance-company-to-pay-124l-101639429450831.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Govt schools in Ludhiana at capacity, students take exam sitting on floor||Bursting at the seams due to a clash between the date sheets of board and non-board classes, government schools were seen struggling to accommodate students on Monday so much so that several students were made to sit on the cold and grimy floors to take the exam. Class 10 and 12 students took the Punjabi board exam on Monday, while Classes 3, 4 and 9 sat for the mathematics exam; Classes 6 and 7 for English and science exams, respectively; and Class 11 students appeared for economics and chemistry exams, as per their stream.At Government Senior Secondary School, PAU, hundreds of students were seen haunched over themselves as they struggled to write their exam without a table to support their book on the basketball court and the backyard of the school. Not only were floors coated with a thick layer of dust, but the area was unhygienic with a pool of stagnant muddy water in close vicinity. Irate parents said that the least the school authorities could have done was provide them with mats and carpets and have the area cleaned before seating the students. Not enough invigilatorsTeachers blamed lack of infrastructure and shortage of teachers for the decision to seat students on the floors. A teacher, requesting anonymity, said, “We have seven sections for Class 6 students, and around 70 students study in each section. During exams, two students cannot be seated together to take their exam. Therefore, the entire class was made to sit on the floor”, said a teacher.“To make matter worse, the education department deputed 40 teachers from GSSS, PAU, schools for exam duty and provided inadequate replacements. Of the remaining teachers, a few were busy with election duty, which made it hard to invigilate the exam. Two teachers were deputed to monitor the Class 6 students,” said a teacher. A senior official in the local education department, who did not wish to be named, said the board should not have clashed the exam dates of board and non-board classes, which ultimately led to chaos in schools.Meanwhile students of class 11th had to wait for a long outside the gate of the PAU school since they were only allowed to enter the exam centre after class 10th students finished their exams.The situation was no different in GHS Giaspura as students of classes 6th, 7th and 9th were seated around the school grounds because of inadequate number of supervisors.“There are six sections each of classes 6th and 7th in the school and we have five sections for Class 9 students. Our 18 teachers from the school are busy with the board duties in other schools. With mere 12 teachers available in the school we had to make the students seated together in the ground on the mats,” a teacher from the GHS, Giaspura, said. Class 11 exam delayed “Our exam was supposed to start at 11:45am but we were kept waiting outside the school gates till 12:30pm,” a Class-11 student said.This is the first time PSEB students received multiple-choice questions in board exams, and the exams have been divided into two terms of 50 marks each.Karamjit Kaur, a Class 10,student said the MCQ pattern made the exam easy and quick.Another Class 10 student, Siman Deep Kaur, said that a thorough reading of the chapters was required so as to choose the right answer in the examination.

In a candid interaction at an event organised by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry Ladies Organisation (FICCIFLO), Dutta said, “All youngsters dreaming of making it big must never stop dreaming, and should work hard to realise their goals.” “Girls! Do that you want to do, and if you can make a living out of what you love to do, there is nothing like it,” she said as the audience broke into thunderous applause. To carve a niche in Bollywood in a ‘dog-eats-dog world’ was no mean feat. “It was not easy, but my mother was always supportive of me. In life, you need one person who always keeps you grounded and makes you realise that what is happening is for the good, and is destined to be as long as you do your karma. My mother was that person for me,” she said.‘Wanted to be on stage since school’ She also thanked her teachers from her alma mater, Sacred Heart Convent School and Government College For Girls, for shaping her. “I knew I needed to be on stage right from my school days. I am so happy to be where I am today,” she admitted. Her teachers, Kusum Sharma and Rashmi Grover, who taught her biology and English in school and college respectively, were stoked to be in the audience. “She was an extremely bright student. She always stood out from the rest. She has maintained contact with me over all these years. Despite her busy schedule, she takes time out for us, which is most touching. She is still the same bubbly student for us, and is a megastar for a reason,” said a proud Sharma.‘A city brimming with love, warmth’ So, what is the first thing that Dutta does on returning to her city? Make a list of people I want to meet. “Returning to the city is always a nostalgic experience. The traffic may have grown, and there may be one or two new bridges, but for me Ludhiana is always brimming with people’s love and warmth and loads of memories, which I will always cherish,” she said.On her latest book ,The Stars In My Sky, the actor said, “It is about 32 of my co-actors and directors, who have been my stars, brightening my journey in the film world. From Amitabh Bachchan and Shabana Azmi to Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Dharmendra, Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre, the book tells and extraordinary story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-daughter-homecoming-never-stop-dreaming-says-divya-dutta-101639429151026.html

14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali’s Pancham Society: After 15 years, 448 flat allottees to get ownership rights||In a major relief for around 448 flat allottees of Pancham Cooperative Society in Sector 68, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) is all set to give them ownership rights after 15 years, with the builder finally clearing the pending land dues to the tune of ₹15 crore.Currently, the owners are unable to sell the flats as they do not have the ownership rights. GMADA had allotted the land to the society in the year 2000, and possession of flats was given in January, 2006. At the time of possession of flats, the members were asked to pay an additional amount of ₹1.15 lakh for HIG flats and ₹72,000 for HIG super. The allottees paid the amount to the builder, who was to further pay it to GMADA but the latter failed to do so. As a result, the ownership rights were held up.As per records, Pancham Society was to pay ₹4.49 crore as land dues to GMADA in 2005. With addition of interest, the figure rose to ₹7.79 crore in October 2006 and is now estimated to be around ₹15 crore. In 2012, GMADA had issued a public notice regarding resuming land of Pancham Society, and in the same year, 225 members filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court against GMADA, registrar society, secretary housing. In 2019, the court ordered the registrar, cooperative society that recoveries be made from all those found guilty in various inquiries.A senior GMADA official said, “We have already made the proposal to give ownership rights to flat allottees by charging the cost of land proportionate to the land it is occupying. The proposal will be sent to the chief minister of Punjab this week for final approval and hopefully, by the end of this month, it will be done.”On the amount paid by the allottees to the builder, the official said, “The allottees have already filed a recovery suit, and the court has allowed them and the registrar of cooperative society to execute it. It will be a major boost, as most of them have not been able re-sell the flats for all these years.” Wing commander Charanjit Singh (retd), a resident of the society, said, “It is a welcome step as we have been fighting for ownership for more than a decade. Though as of now, we haven’t got any official intimation.”

Ever since it announced its tickets, earlier this month, for the forthcoming Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) elections, the BJP has been facing rebellion within the party. Around a dozen dissidents had even filed nominations as Independents against the party’s official candidates.There was anger on how the party “ignored” the claims of the dedicated party workers and made decisions based on internal party groupings. Sood group was seen as taking the major chunk of tickets. Sood, though, has maintained that it was the extensive surveys conducted by the party and the merit of individual candidates that dictated the selection of the candidates.Party efforts to manage dissidents Senior party leaders from Delhi, former city chief Sanjay Tandon and local office bearers, including Sood, were put into action to convince the rebel candidates to align themselves with the party’s decision on ticket allotment. Party leaders met the dissidents and even offered alternative senior party post to them; it is learnt.The party was successful in convincing four rebel candidates including Rashmi (ward 9), wife of party leader Devendra Singh, and Yashpal Yadav (ward 25) and Ramesh Kumar Nikku (ward 32) to withdraw their nominations. But the party failed to bring most of the dissidents back into party’s fold.Tandon, said, “Their initial disappointment is understandable and the party was in constant communication with them. But party’s discipline is paramount, and so action has to be taken against dissidents.” Responding to his expulsion, a former BJP national Kisan Morcha member and three-time Daria sarpanch, Gurpreet Singh Happy, said, “I have already resigned from the party. I was with the party since 1992, and served the party with dedication at different levels. I have nothing more to say on the issue just that party will learn a lesson on December 27 (MC poll result date).” Happy’s wife Harpreet Kaur is contesting from Ward No 9.Another long-time party worker, Narender Pal Chaudhary, a former state coordinator, Swachh Bharat Vibhag, and a former member of the SC Morcha national executive committee, said, “For more than 30 years, I have dedicatedly worked for the party. But now, people with criminal background are being given tickets. This is the reason I resigned from the party and am contesting as an Independent.”Congress, BJP face Azad Front challengeNotably, the challenge of the rebel leaders has become stiffer for the party after an “Azad Front”, comprising of independent candidates, primarily rebel candidates from Congress and BJP, came together. These candidates have decided to form a united grouping and offer each other help in the elections.The main opposition party, Congress, is facing nearly 12 rebel candidates in different wards. Three of its functionaries even joined the AAP as its candidates after the grand old party rejected their claims to party tickets. Also, nearly 22 candidates in the Aam Admi Party (AAP) are former Congress leaders. They had recently left the party after former Congress city president Pardeep Chhabra resigned from the party and joined AAP.The Congress got a fresh setback on Monday when its three-time councillor Sheela Phool Singh joined the BJP. Singh was denied Congress ticket. A Congress rebel candidate and party’s former organisational secretary Prem Pal Chauhan also joined BJP.

Animal husbandry commissioner Dr Praveen Malik, who was in Jagraon to attend a fair organised by the progressive dairy farmer association, said, “Unique identification will allow us to track the overall production pattern of cows, and buffaloes, which is vital for business and planning.” Recently, the Union minister of state fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy Parshottam Rupala had unveiled the National Digital Livestock Mission (NDLM) blueprint at the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).Malik said that the central government had taken many initiatives, but departments in the state should also make full use of these policies.Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University vice-chancellor Inderjeet Singh said, “There are an estimated 65 lakh cows and buffaloes in the state. The Aadhaar-based tagging of these animals will help us in maintain a record of their vaccination, insemination, and milk and also help us detect outbreaks.”“The dairy sector in the United States and New Zealand flourished only after livestock was linked with the digital network and the government got the record of animals as it helped them maintain the quality of the breed,” said Singh.Progressive Dairy Farmers’ Association president Daljit Singh Sadarpur says there is a trust deficit among dairy farmers. “Many farmers nurse a misconception that the government would keep a check on their livestock to assess their earnings, which is why farmers are not getting their livestock registered,” said Sadarpura.‘Murrah Man’ elected buffalo society prez (EMBEDDED) Guru Angad Dev Veterinary And Animal Sciences University vice-chancellor Inderjeet Singh was elected president of the Indian Society for Buffalo Development on Monday, while GADVASU college of veterinary science secretary SPS Ghuman is the new secretary.Inderjeet Singh, who is famous as the Murrah Man, will succeed SS Dahiya.

14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Chadha claims four Congress ministers want to join AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday claimed that four ministers and other big leaders of the ruling Congress in Punjab were in touch with them and wanted to join the party. The claim was made by AAP Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha, who said the party had refused to induct these ministers and leaders because of allegations of links with sand mafia against them. “These four ministers of the Channi government are constantly approaching us, but we have decided not to include them in our party. The party has no need for such leaders,” Chadha said at a virtual press conference, while withholding their names.AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab state president Bhagwant Mann also put their weight behind Chadha’s claim by retweeting his statement. Kejriwal claimed that the AAP would form the government in Punjab after a few months and many leaders from other parties were approaching to join it. “We will not include any corrupt and criminal leader (in the party) under any circumstance. We will give a clean and honest government to Punjab,” he posted on Twitter. Mann also posted that the Congress was about to go and only one month was left. “That’s why many of their big leaders are voraciously looting Punjab. We will not include any dishonest leader in our party,” he alleged. A few days back, Arvind Kejriwal had also made a claim that 25 MLAs and two MPs of the Punjab Congress were approaching him to join the party, but he refused to include them, saying that he did not want Congress’ waste. Channi hits backMeanwhile, hitting back at Chadha, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi accused him of spreading rumours. He warned the AAP to desist from mouthing lies in order to create unnecessary hype. “The AAP only wants to create its nuisance value by indulging in misleading and malicious talk, but these tactics would backfire,” Channi said while interacting with reporters in Morinda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-chadha-claims-four-congress-ministers-want-to-join-aap-101639427901110.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt to hold meeting with protesting state transport staffers||Senior officials in the Punjab government will hold meetings on Tuesday with representatives of contract and outsourced employees of the state transport undertakings who are on an indefinite strike for the past one week. Bus services across the state remained crippled on Monday as nearly 8,200 employees of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), Punjab Roadways and PUNBUS, stayed away from work for the seventh consecutive day.The contract and outsourced employees have been seeking regularisation of their jobs for over 10 years. With 80% of the staff on strike, the three transport undertakings are suffering losses in crores daily. PRTC has been able to operate only 10% of its 1,100-strong fleet in the past one week. With the daily revenue dropping to ₹65 lakh, it alone is facing ₹1.2-crore losses every day. PRTC managing director Parneet Kaur Shergill said meetings are on with protesters, but they are reluctant to end their strike.“The protesting employees are also going to hold key meetings with top officials at the government level on Tuesday,” she said, adding that the authorities are appealing to them to end the strike and continue it on rotational basis, so that the services don’t suffer.Harkesh Singh Vicky, vice-president of the Roadways/PRTC contractual employees union, said they have also garnered the support of several farmer unions, who have assured them of help to build pressure on the state government.“If the state government fails to take any decision pertaining to our demand of regularisation, we will block national and state highways across the state,” he said, adding that the government was threatening to relieve them from jobs. Among other demands, the union wants stringent measures to keep check on transport mafia, streamlining of daily hourly roster, and implementation of equal salary for equal work law.“It will be difficult for PRTC to overcome the losses in coming days. Already, we were working hard to bridge the gap between daily income and expenditure,” said a PRTC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-to-hold-meeting-with-protesting-state-transport-staffers-101639427899830.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab rice millers demand compensation, lifting of curbs||At least 400 rice millers facing curbs by the Punjab food and civil supplies department since 2010 on Monday demanded compensation and lifting of sanctions imposed on them. According to mill owners, they are being made to suffer for no fault of theirs. They claimed they were supplied paddy variety PAU 201 from 2007 to 2010, which had a higher quantity of discoloured grain and broken rice than the permissible limits, due to which the Food Corporation of India (FCI) refused to take the delivery of rice and the mills were told to bear the loses. “Failing to pay for the losses, the state food department has imposed sanctions by blacklisting our firms. Since 2010, we are not allotted paddy for custom milling and we are without business for almost 11 years,” said Davinder Bansal, who used to run a mill in Malerkotla. The blacklisted mills that were supplied PAU 201 have outstanding dues of at least ₹500 crore, he said, adding that despite repeated requests at all levels in the state government, “no one is concerned about our cause”.According to Vijay Jindal, who owned a now blacklisted rice mill in Dhuri: “Procurement agencies were fully aware of the dubious quality of PAU 201. They knew that this variety will not meet FCI specifications, yet it was pushed to us for shelling. Even standard procedures like proper sampling and lab testing were not conducted.”It was in 2007-08, when Punjab Agricultural University introduced this variety as the one which needed less water and had a better yield. At the same time, it had certain disadvantages like greater percentage of breakage and discolouration of the rice. As both the state government and PAU pushed its cultivation, it was grown on large areas by farmersThe rice millers added that a committee from the Centre visited the state to take feedback about the variety and recommended its discontinuation and compensation to rice millers. “The Centre agreed to share the compensation with the state government and released ₹277 crore, but the proposal was never moved forward by the state government,” said Bansal. According to him, two governments have changed in the state, but there is no solution to their problem. Can offer one-time settlement: Minister“We have offered the millers one-time settlement schemes in the past on repeated occasions. At this juncture, the department can’t do more. We again can open the OTS scheme for them,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Reacting to the minister’s proposal, the rice millers said that the OTS scheme was not a solution, as the millers had no role in the cultivation of the poor variety, which was imposed on them. “Even earlier the response to the OTS scheme was poor,” said Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-rice-millers-demand-compensation-lifting-of-curbs-101639427898030.html

He said people in the state must follow all guidelines of the health department besides getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Replying to a question regarding announcements made by Delhi chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Soni said the health model of Delhi is a “complete failure” as thousands of people lost their lives in the national capital during the second wave and many rushed to Punjab hospitals for treatment.Death toll climbs to 16,620Meanwhile, Punjab on Monday registered one death and 26 fresh cases of Covid-19, according to a medical bulletin.

Dropped cabinet ministers included Besides state unit working presidents Kuljit Nagra, Pawan Goyal and Sukhvinder Singh Danny, former ministers Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Sham Sunder Arora, Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot have also been included. These former ministers were considered close to former CM Capt Amarinder Singh and were dropped from the new cabinet led by Charanjit Singh Channi after the change of guard in the state. Capt Amarinder has since quit the Congress to form his own party. The panel also features MLAs Ajaib Singh Bhatti, Raminder Awla, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Navtej Singh Cheema, Punjab Mahila Congress president Balbir Rani Sodhi, Punjab Youth Congress chief Barinder Dhillon, NSUI president Akshay Sharma and state seva dal chief organiser Nirmal Kaira.

The state has 23 administrative districts, of which Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Patiala and Bathinda, have more than one committee of the ruling party. The PPCC chief had last month proposed the names of DCC presidents and working presidents after several rounds of discussions with party leaders. “The leadership has gone with the composition suggested by the PPCC chief but made a few changes to take everyone along and give representation to all castes and communities in the state poll panel and the appointments in district heads,” said a senior party leader. Only two women working presidents However, few women have found place in the Congress list of district heads. While there is not a single woman district president, only two have been appointed working presidents.

It further wants directions that the CBI be tasked with continuing the probe into these FIRs from where it was left. It also demands that probe by the special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police be stayed.Ram Rahim is currently lodged in a Rohtak jail following his conviction in two rape cases and two murder cases, all dating back to 2002. He was questioned by the Punjab Police on November 8 in its probe into sacrilege cases. Recently, many other Dera functionaries have also been quizzed by the SIT. According to the Punjab Police, the dera head has emerged as the main conspirator.As per the Dera head, the statement which is being cited as basis for launching this probe against him was obtained in July 2020, but “now suddenly”, the SIT had swung into action. The SIT probe is for the sole purpose of “implicating” the petitioner and members of Dera Sacha Sauda and gain electoral benefit, the plea claims, adding that he is not in any manner demanding closure of the probe but only fair and impartial probe, which is “devoid of mala fide, malice and ulterior motives as a result of any political vendetta or political colours so as to punish the culprits for this criminal act”.The plea says Vidhan Sabha has no power to enter into working of executive and resolution of August 2018 on withdrawal of cases from CBI is hit by separation of powers between legislators and executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ram-rahim-moves-hc-wants-cbi-to-probe-punjab-sacrilege-cases-101639427891496.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Money laundering: HC seeks status report in case against Khaira||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday directed the enforcement directorate (ED) to file a status report in money laundering case against Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira.The high court bench of justice Sureshwar Singh Thakur acted on Khaira’s plea seeking bail. The notice on behalf of ED was received by SV Raju, additional Solicitor General of India, who was directed by the HC to file a detailed reply within a week. The case has been listed for further hearing on December 21. The ED had arrested Khaira on November 11. On December 6, a Mohali court had dismissed his bail plea, observing that the allegations are of serious nature and bail cannot be granted under these circumstances. Khaira has claimed that the ED’s action was a case of “witch hunt” as he has been vocal against the three farm laws. The ED had initiated proceedings under Prevention of Money Laundering Act in January, even as there was a stay from the Supreme Court in the 2015 matter, it was claimed. Raids were conducted in March, and even as the matter was pending before the high court, the arrest was effected though he was summoned 11 times since raids, the Congress leader claimed.Khaira won the assembly election in 2017 from the Bholath assembly seat in Kapurthala district on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket. He later floated a party, before joining the Congress in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-hc-seeks-status-report-in-case-against-khaira-101639427832544.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Letter bomb: Asthana objects to action against ex-Punjab minister Majithia in drug case||In a new twist to the Congress government’s move on the political-sensitive drug cases ahead of the Punjab assembly elections, a letter purportedly written by the Bureau of Investigation( BOI) chief AS Asthana surfaced on social media on Monday in which he expressed himself against booking Shiromani Akali Dal leader --- former minister Bikram Singh Majithia --- on the basis of a 2018 special task force (STF) report lying in a sealed cover with the high court. Four pages of the letter addressed to director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota on December 11 were also shared with the media from an anonymous foreign number. Senior police officials, privy to the development, confirmed that the pages were from Asthana’s confidential note to his boss in which he has sought more legal scrutiny of the facts before registering an FIR as follow-up to a 2018 report of STF head Harpreet Singh Sidhu which was submitted to the HC. The Channi government has lately been under a mounting pressure, notably from state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, to act on the STF report on alleged complicity of certain political leaders and police officials in the drug racket. In his letter, Asthana stated that a perusal of the relevant orders of the high court shows that certain statements were recorded by the Enforcement Directorate of some accused in the NDPS cases namely Jagdish Bhola, Jagjit Singh Chahal and Maninder Singh Bittu Aulakh. The HC had entrusted the ED report to STF head Sidhu with direction to examine the same. “Therefore, the report prepared and submitted by STF chief was essentially for the assistance and benefit of the high court. It was not a report made in course of investigation in NDPS cases in the exercise of the STF in the usual course of action,” the letter reads. He added that the record suggest that this very report was, on one hand, handed over to ED and, on other, was handed over to AG, Punjab, for consideration and hence, the state government, under the high court orders, constituted a committee of Punjab DGP and additional chief secretary (Home) to examine it. ‘Drug report only a link in the chain’ “The report of the STF head is only a link in the chain. It is essential to seek permission of the HC to get subsequent report of the committee reopened to verify as to whether the report of STF head has merged into the subsequent reports,” the BoI chief said. He has sought clarity if it would be legally tenable to act upon the report of the head of STF, when the same lies sealed in custody of the high court and despite presumably requesting the HC by AG, Punjab, to return the same it has not been returned to date. Curiously, Asthana wrote the letter to DGP before availing two-day medical leave which ended on Sunday and the same evening he was admitted in the Mohali hospital amid reports of pressure on him to give nod to take action against Majithia. Notably, Asthana was especially brought in by Channi government as BoI head couple of weeks back. He was the third officer to get posting of BoI chief in just one month. Sahota did not respond to Hindustan Times’ calls and text messages to get his version. Asthana read all the text queries sent on his mobile phone but did not respond about the letter. Takes on STF chief In his letter, Asthana also said that STF chief Harpreet Sidhu has conceded that Majithia is his close family relation. “In all fairness, Sidhu should have recused himself from carrying out any probe against Majithia, which less submit his opinion-cum-status report before the high court,” the findings said. The letter said the STF report was not based on any investigation and cannot also be treated as any fresh evidence or new material to enable further investigation, especially in the FIRs whose trial have already been concluded long time ago. “The said report therefore cannot be taken as a source report for the purpose of the further investigation,” said Asthana’s note. The ED, Asthana said, has filed one prosecution complaint and five supplement complaints in the case. “No prosecution complaint has been filed even by the ED against Majithia. The Special court conducting trials of all these cases also at no stage has summoned Majithia as an accused by invoking provisions of the law. Some of the accused, in the money laundering trials in the cases have approached Supreme Court and even their trials have been stayed,” said the letter. “What is weight of three statements recorded by ED to further investigate Majithia when the agency itself chose not to proceed against him?” Legal advice to AG The BoI chief has also mentioned about some latest legal advice of AG in the case. “Can this latest advice be relied upon in the light of the fact that the same may be completely contradictory or in consonance to the previous legal advices by former AGs as this case has been deliberated upon since long,” he wrote. Asthana’s letter has been leaked in the wake of SAD’s shrill allegations of witch-hunt against the ruling Congress. On Sunday, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal publicly accused Channi, Navjot Sidhu and home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa of conspiring with the police to book him and Majithia in different cases.

Farm leaders Balbir Singh Rajwal, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Harmeet Singh Qadian and Manjit Singh Rai, also got a hero’s welcome. Flowers were showered on them amid resonant chants of ‘Sat Sri Akal’ and ‘Kisan-Mazdoor Ekta-Zindabad’ slogans at the Golden Gate, the entry point to the city. Replying to a query, Tikait added, “The fight for the Minimum Support Price (MSP) has not ended yet. Now, we will fight the battle of the MSP, and we will not stay home.”In expectation of the arrival of farmers from 32 organisations, which spearheaded the agitation under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an Akhand Path (uninterrupted recitation of the holy Sikh scripture of the Guru Granth Sahib) was started in the complex of Golden Temple on Saturday. The bhog (concluding ceremony) of the Path was held on Monday. It was followed by a religious function held at Manji Sahib Diwan Hall in the shrine complex.Rajewal performed ardas at the Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal seat, to thank the Gurus. Farm leaders were honoured in the presence of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Harjinder Singh Dhami with ‘siropas’ (robe of honour) and by presenting them with the replica of the Golden Temple. US-based Dr Swaiman Singh, who gave free medical aid to protesters at the Singhu border, was also felicitated.Dhami, who delivered an emotional speech, said, “In Sikh history, it was Sardar Baghel Singh who had conquered Delhi. After that, these farmers have conquered the government.” “Farmers’ deeds have brought to life 300-year-old Sikh history,” Rajewal said, addressing a massive gathering at the Diwan Hall. In the ardas at the function, 700 farmers who died during the agitation, were also remembered. Some groups of farmers, including leaders, reached the shrine later on and could not attend the function; the SGPC also honoured many farm leaders from Left-leaning parties. Farm leaders did not conduct any joint press conference to disclose their future course of action, but separately pronounced that the struggle will continue. Rajewal, who visited the Jallianwala Bagh, also made it clear that the agitation had not been called off, but only suspended.

Manpreet represents the adjoining Bathinda Urban seat.At a rally that Laddi had organised at Naruana village, Sidhu took potshots at chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi over police cane-charging unemployed teachers in Mansa last week, and the delay in disbursement of compensation to farmers whose cotton was damaged due to the pink bollworm pest attack. He added that new low sand rates announced by the state government were not reflected on ground, as mafia was still active in Punjab. District Congress leaders considered close to Manpreet stayed from their state president’s political visit.Laddi has been accusing Manpreet and his aides of interference on his (former’s) political turf. Sidhu said Laddi, who had finished third in the 2017 state polls, would be fielded as a candidate in the forthcoming polls.“He braved all political and administrative odds during the Congress-led government. I will fight back all those who created hurdles for Laddi. Being the state Congress president, I will be there for Laddi’s victory,” Sidhu added. The Congress has not announced any candidate so far.“I am aghast that the Punjab government’s grant of ₹15 crore for the development of this segment has still not been released by the district administration to the panchayats,” he added.State transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said public sympathy was with Laddi, as over the past four-and-a-half years, the leader was unable to get even an SHO or a panchayat secretary transferred in his segment of Bathinda RuralVEILED ATTACK ON CM CHANNILater at a press conference, Sidhu said the incident of thrashing teachers demanding jobs was lamentable.

Teachers are protesting as part of a statewide “education bandh” under the banner of Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Federation (PFUCTO).The theory exams of undergraduate courses will start from December 22 and for PG courses from December 27. A varsity official, on condition of anonymity, said that if the protest of teachers continues then they will have to postpone the semester exams.Two demands of teachersLast month, PFUCTO had announced that teachers across five universities, 48 colleges and 145 aided colleges will go on an indefinite strike from December 1 and suspend all academic activities. The teachers are demanding the immediate implementation of revised UGC Pay Scales and withdrawal of the Punjab Government’s decision to delink the scales of teachers of universities and colleges from UGC.President of Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) Mritunjay Kumar, said, “We do not wish to disrupt the exam schedule. We are not only fighting for the pay commission, but larger issues, which involve the future of our students as well. Also, these are the legitimate demands of the teachers.”PU’s controller of examination Jagat Bhushan, said, “We had received requests from colleges to postpone the practical exam, as they are facing difficulty in conducting it due to the ongoing strike of teachers. Regarding the theory exams, the university will discuss the matter in coming days and decide accordingly.”General secretary of PFUCTO, Jagwant Singh, said, “We are extremely concerned that because of the delay in resolving the issue, GNDU and Punjabi university had to postpone their exams and PU may also have to postpone the exams.

14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Political slugfest ensues over decision to not use VVPAT||A political slugfest has started over the state election commission (SEC) decision to not use voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) along with the electronic voting machines (EVM) in the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections.VVPAT are intended to be an independent verification system for voting machines, designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly. The Chandigarh Congress has fired a letter to the SEC and a party’s delegation also met the SEC officials here on Monday complaining about the non-use of VVPAT. In the letter, Subhash Chawla, president, Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee, said, “Denial of use of VVPAT machines with EVM and also the proposed use of outdated M-2 EVMs for voting on December 24 is causing anxiety among the Chandigarh voters.”“SEC allowed the use of VVPAT in local body elections in West Bengal, scheduled for December 19 but surprisingly ordered the use of EVMs without VVPAT here. We have demanded that VVPAT must be used with the EVM to ensure free and fair elections.”AAP convener in Chandigarh, Prem Garg, said, “VVPAT should be used in elections. The SEC should also ensure there is no favouritism in its conduct and total transparency.”BJP meanwhile, termed the Congress’ letter as admission of its “defeat in the MC election”, and asked the Congress to let the “independent constitutional body (SEC)” do its work.BJP state president Arun Sood said, “All these baseless allegations only show that the Congress has accepted defeat in the MC polls even before a single vote has been cast. EVM and election commission are all right when the Congress wins but when BJP wins, it is the fault of EVM and election commission. Congress has nothing to show for its 15-year rule in the city; so now, it is indulging in such shameful tactics.”Stating that Congress can evaluate, examine and inspect the machines, Sood, said, “The election commission allows all parties to check machines thoroughly. If the Congress has doubts it can take its experts and get the machines examined.”On the demand of VVPAT with EVM, Sood, said, “It is for the election commission to decide. BJP goes by the election commission directions and doesn’t interfere in its working.”Confirming that VVPAT will not be used with the EVMs, K Bhandari, officer on special duty (OSD) to the state election commissioner, said, “The decision not to use the VVPAT was taken in a meeting of state election commissions in 2019. In the MC bypoll recently held in Delhi, VVPAT was not used.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-political-slugfest-ensues-over-decision-to-not-use-vvpat-101639425850875.html

The shortfall of previous years that it has been carrying forward is ₹1,611 crore, taking the total to ₹1,912 crore. The annual revenue requirement (ARR) has been worked out at ₹36,484 crore and revenue receipt on the basis of the present approved tariff has been worked out as ₹36,702 crore. With the regulator, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) always, as a matter of convention, reducing the PSPCL’s expenditure, there may not be any power tariff hike, experts say. Due to the recent poll sops, the subsidy burden on the state government, however, for 2021-22 is estimated at ₹12,245 crore and for 2022-23, at ₹13,929 crore. Initially, the figure for 2021-22 was ₹10,621 crore but the current announcements by government have resulted in an additional burden of ₹1,624 crore.Last year, the total subsidy, including arrears, was ₹17,796 crore and the proportionate dues in November stood at ₹11,786 crore. The default amount on November 15 is ₹4,120 crore. The pending subsidy for the year was ₹10,130 crore. “Overall, the subsidy bill for next year will be whopping, which once clubbed with the arrears of previous years will touch ₹20,000 crore,” said an official, adding that latest ARR had been framed to seek minimum hike. In the ARR, the major expenditure is for power purchase, with ₹24,910 crore being kept for it, including interstate transmission charges. The other major expenditure is of employee salary and pension at ₹5,552 crore.PSPCL has also not included any payment to employees against pay revisions. If the pay commission is implemented, the total arrears will be between ₹3,000 crore and ₹3,500 crore. Of this, around ₹1,000 crore are payable in 2021-22 and the balance over the next few years. On its part, the PSERC has initiated the process of finalising the ARR and has started the process of hearing public objections on the PSPCL’s petition.

Residents of ward 34 of Chandigarh rue that there are several vacant plots in the area, which can be used to solve the parking woes here, but most of these have turned into garbage dumps, much to their chagrin. The ward includes Sector 45 (excluding Burail) and Sector 46. Sector 45 and Burail were earlier part of Ward 14, while Sector 46 was included in Ward 21, along with Sector 32. Residents say the ward lacks basic civic infrastructure and cleanliness is a far cry. The ever-increasing population of stray dogs makes them wary of stepping out. Vikram Sharma, a resident of Sector 45, says, “Door-to-door garbage collection is irregular and sweepers never seem to clean the roads or market areas.” Kedarnath Sharma, president of the Sector 46-D residents’ welfare association (RWA), says, “Though MC claims sterilisation of stray dogs is being carried out, the canine population seems to be increasing day by day. Every month, several cases of dog bites are reported in our area. It is due to the garbage dumps here that the stray dogs stay put here.”Stating that most neighbourhood parks lack basic facilities such as lighting, drinking water provision and clean washrooms, residents ask where the taxes collected by MC are going. Jasvinder Singh, a resident of Sector 46, says, “We are made to pay for garbage collection even when we don’t get the facility. Sweepers rarely clean the upper floors and due to irregular garbage collection, some people dump the garbage on vacant plots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-vacant-plots-used-as-dumps-in-ward-34-101639425371500.html

But the battle for seeking rights of farmers will continue. The issues of MSP, increase in sugarcane price, payment of sugarcane dues and high electricity tariff will be raised for the benefit of farmers,” he said while addressing a mahapanchayat in Kairana on Sunday. Tikait said: “There was neither defeat nor victory in the movement. We accepted what farm leaders decided. The government has time till the announcement of model code of conduct before Assembly elections and they should execute proposals given to farmers.” “Nobody can compel people to vote in favour of a party or government,” he emphasized. The BKU leader cautioned people not to be swayed away by the government’s attempt to shift their attention to the alleged issue of exodus from Kairana town of Shamli district during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.Tikait denied that there was an issue of “palayan” (exodus), saying that people go to other towns in search of jobs and business and this couldn’t be categorised as exodus. “The government should provide people better jobs and business opportunities to stop them from going away,” he added. Tikait also suggested that the government should include those people in the proposed committee on MSP who genuinely think about farmers and not professors who are “associated with colleges of capitalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/13month-movement-is-training-for-farmers-tikait-101639424830277.html

14-12-2021||Lucknow||Agitating pharmacists may lose salary for work boycott||On the fifth consecutive day of work boycott by over 7000 pharmacists in Uttar Pradesh, the director-general medical and health has said that the agitating pharmacists could lose salary for their work boycott. The D-G health has written to the agitating pharmacists to call off their strike as it was troubling patients across state.The letter was sent to all heads of health facilities in the state on Monday. “The ESMA has been imposed in the state that makes the strike a punishable offence and also strike of any kind can hamper efforts to check the spread of Covid-19 infection. Hence, all pharmacists under your health facility should be asked to work as routine,” read the letter from the D-G, medical and health, Dr Ved Vrat Singh.“Pharmacists holding work boycott shall be liable to face no-work no-pay by calculating hours of protest every day. So in four days of two hours of work boycott they will lose salary for one day,” said Dr Ved Vrat.The agitating pharmacists said they shall continue their stir. “Instead of writing such a letter, the department or the officials could have told us the status of our pending demands. We would have called off the work boycott ourselves,” said Sunil Yadav, executive president, Diploma Pharmacist Association, Uttar Pradesh, which has over 7,500 members.Pharmacists are demanding wage revision, right to prescribe drugs, filling up of vacancies, creation of new posts and standardisation of their work. Posts of pharmacists are less against the guidelines and at some places there are no pharmacists deployed, said Yadav.“Pharmacists have a significant role in hospitals right from getting the correct dose of drugs administered to injecting certain medicine as per requirement to assisting in minor procedures,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general, Association of International Doctors.Yadav said, “We will not come under pressure by the ESMA letter. We shall go for an indefinite strike from December 20 if our demands are not addressed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/agitating-pharmacists-may-lose-salary-for-work-boycott-101639423810282.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Year on, toll plazas in Haryana resume operations at revised rates||Almost a year after the toll plazas located on highways in Haryana resumed operations on Monday with revised rates.The toll companies resumed operations after the farmers protesting under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farm unions, ended their protest.As per reports collected from different parts of the state, the toll plazas were reopened with revised rates in charges for heavy vehicle including buses, trucks, and multi-axle vehicles.Last year, when operations were stopped at the toll plazas, ₹440 was charge from buses or trucks for one-way trip, while ₹660 was charged for a return trip or for multiple journeys within 24 hours. Now, ₹445 is being charged for single journey, and ₹665 for return trip within 24 hours, said a toll official.The charges for multi-axle vehicles have also been increased from the earlier ₹705 to ₹715 for single trip and from ₹1,060 to ₹1,070 for multiple journeys within 24 hours.The rates of monthly passes have also been increased for different categories of vehicles. However, there are no changes in the charges for light vehicles including cars, jeeps and vans. Officials said the rates have not revised due to the agitation and are based on the adjustment of annual wholesale price index.Hundreds of farmers, led by local BKU (Charuni) leader Jagdip Aulakh, gathered at the Bastara toll plaza at NH-44 on Monday morning as the farmers reopened the toll services after a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony.Workers and security staff also returned to their jobs after a year as most toll companies had sacked their employees after the farmers had opened the toll gates allowing free passage of vehicles. “It’s almost after a year that the toll services are being resumed and we have rejoined duty. It is good that the agitation has ended,” said a toll collector at the Bastara toll plaza.The exact figures of losses to the toll plazas due to the farmers’ agitation are still not available but officials said the concessionaire of Bastara toll plaza on NH-44 is among the biggest sufferer as the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) had suffered a loss of around ₹1.20 crore per day due to free movement of vehicles from this toll plaza. Officials of the toll plaza said per day collection of Bastara toll remains around ₹1.20-1.30 crore as around 40,000 to 50,000 vehicle cross the toll plaza every day.Nitish Malik, manager at the Dighal toll plaza on Rohtak-Jhajjar road, said the revised toll fee for cars is ₹45 (an increase of ₹5), buses and trucks is ₹160 ( ₹5 hike), multi-axle is ₹250 ( ₹10 hike) and oversize vehicles is ₹305 (a hike of ₹15) on one side.“We have taken control of the toll plazas and these will become operational from December 15. Those not equipped with fast-tag will have to pay double the amount,” he added.Similarly, the Shambhu toll plaza on Haryana-Punjab border resumed services after more than a year on Monday. Toll manager Arvind Chauhan said the traffic is moving smoothly but there are occasional snags during operations.At Yamunanagar’s Milk Majra toll plaza, the services are expected to resume from Tuesday as the manager of the toll, Lokender Sharma, said they are yet to receive an official letter from their circle office and cleaning of toll apparatus is underway.Officials said the toll fee of commercial vehicles of all categories have been raised as per yearly increase norms, while there has been change in fare of private vehicles. According to this, the light commercial vehicles (LCV) will have to pay ₹5 extra and heavy trucks ₹10 more, they added.(With inputs from Rohtak and Ambala correspondents)
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Tikait, other farm leaders to attend agitation’s ‘Sampan Samaroh’ at Jind, Hisar today||Farmers camping at Delhi borders and other protest sites are clearing out the venues since Saturday after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) announced to suspend the farm agitation but farmers at Jind’s Khatkar toll plaza and Hisar’s Ramayana toll plaza are still at the sites and will formally clear the areas on Tuesday after holding ending ceremonies.Khatkar toll plaza committee in-charge Satbir Pehlwan, who also heads the Khera Khap, said senior SKM leaders including Rakesh Tikait, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Gurnam Singh Charuni and representatives of various khaps will take part in the ‘Sampan Samaroh’ on Tuesday to formally lift the dharna.“After the Republic Day violence, Tikait had held his first mahapanchayat in Jind’s Kandela village in February this year and the last ceremony after the historic win was held at Khatkar toll plaza in Jind. Farmers from Jind remained at the forefront of the agitation – from clearing paths for Punjab farmers through Khanauri border last year to blocking roads after Tikait cried at the Ghazipur border,” Pehlwan added.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) youth state president Ravi Azad said the contributions of Haryana and Punjab farmers cannot be expressed in words.“On one call, the Jind and Hisar farmers protested against the BJP-JJP leaders and blocked roads after every brutal incident. We have not ended the protest but changed the way of the protest. If our demands, on which the Union government has agreed upon, won’t be implemented, we will bounce back with a bigger agitation across country,” he added.The Jat-dominated Hisar and Jind districts had emerged as the epiccentre of the farmers’ agitation in Haryana after the Republic Day violence at Red Fort. When the protest began in November last year, Kuruksehtra, under the leadership of BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, was at its core in Haryana, with massive support from neighbouring districts of Yamunanagar, Ambala and Karnal.Later, the agitation’s centre shifted to Jind where many mahapanchayats were held, besides overwhelming support from khaps.And after that, Hisar became the core of the agitation with farmers protesting visits of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, his deputy Dushyant Chautala, deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa, BJP state chief OP Dhankar and others.Dr Anant Ram, a retired political science professor from Bhiwani, said people of Hisar, Jind and Bhiwani had led the state in the farmers’ agitations.“The farmers had uprooted governments of Bhajan Lal, Bansi Lal and OP Chautala after farmers’ death during protests at Kadma (Bhiwani), Mandyali village in Mahendragarh district (on Bhiwani border) and Kandela in Jind, respectively. The farmers of these districts have a history of standing up against governments and holding agitation until their demands are met,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tikait-other-farm-leaders-to-attend-agitation-s-sampan-samaroh-at-jind-hisar-today-101639423270341.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Political pressure forced govt to repeal farm laws: Yogendra Yadav||Farm leader Yogendra Yadav on Monday said political pressure forced the Prime Minister to repeal the three contentious agriculture laws.“Had they worried about the farmers and the Constitution, they would have repealed these anti-farmer laws a long ago. It is clear that the laws were repealed due to political pressure and the Uttar Pradesh elections forced the government for a course correction,” said Yadav during his visit to Karnal.“They are only concerned about the vote bank, elections and their chair. Nothing else,” he said without naming anybody.He said farmers have won the battle by forcing the government to repeal the three laws but the fight for guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) is not over yet and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) will keep a close eye on every step of the government in the future.Reacting to SKM member Gurnam Singh Chaurni’s announcement to field candidates in the Punjab elections, Yadav said everybody is free to fight elections but nobody will be allowed to use the SKM banner for polls.“Unity and formation of SKM are the two major achievements of this farm agitation and from now on, governments will not take a decision about farmers without consulting them,” he said.He requested the Haryana government to fulfil its commitment of withdrawing cases registered against farmers and give compensation to families of the famers who died during the agitation, without any further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-pressure-forced-govt-to-repeal-farm-laws-yogendra-yadav-101639423090330.html
14-12-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s Gurugram, Ambala top in administering both Covid vaccine doses, Nuh, Hisar lag behind||Haryana has administered more than three crore doses of coronavirus vaccine to its population, including about 1.89 crore first doses. As per the vaccination data, the state health department has inoculated 92% of the state’s 2.04 crore eligible population with the first dose and 55% eligible population with both the doses.Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula and Ambala are the top four districts having achieved more than 100% administration of the first dose. Three districts, Gurugram (96% vaccination), Ambala (88%) and Charkhi Dadri (81%) are the top three ranked districts in terms of administering both the doses.The laggard districts in terms of administering the first dose are Nuh (63% vaccination), Jind (75%), Palwal and Hisar (78% each).Nuh (13%), Hisar (37%) and Fatehabad (38%) figured as the bottom three districts in terms of administering both the doses.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said emphasis is being laid on stepping up administration of the second dose in a campaign mode.“The Haryana chief minister has directed the deputy commissioners that the entire eligible population should be inoculated with the second dose by December 31,” Arora said.Active infection count reaches 219Data shows that the active case count on Monday was 219, with 10 districts reporting zero active infections. Only Gurugram (99), Faridabad (41) and Panchkula (33) have active cases in double digits.Statistics show that while the number of infections reported from 22 districts has gone up from 108 to 200 in five weeks from November 8 to December 12, experts said the increase is not alarming.“Statistically speaking, five districts have reported a negative growth rate in the last two week. Gurugram and Faridabad districts which have the maximum active case count have registered a growth of 31% and 28%, respectively, in the last two weeks,” said a health official.
14-12-2021||Mumbai||Only 40 out of 920 minors enrolled for paediatric vaccine trial at Nair Hospital||Mumbai The civic-run BYL Nair Hospital has enrolled 40 children in the age group of two to 17 years for the clinical trial of Covovax, a Covid-19 vaccine developed by American biotechnology firm Novavax and produced by the Serum Institute of India. While the trial aims to enroll a total of 920 candidates, hospital authorities said that it has been struggling to get paediatric volunteers. “We started in mid-October and have managed to recruit only 40 candidates till now,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, the only site in Mumbai conducting the paediatric trial. As per the Clinical Trials Registry- India (CTRI) as many as 23 sites across the country are trying Covovax on adults as well as paediatric cohorts. “The paediatric trial has been progressing very slowly. Largely, there is reluctance among parents to enroll their children. We get many inquiries, but they don’t convert into enrollments,” said Dr Bharmal. A seroprevalence survey carried out in Mumbai has shown that more than 50% of children had antibodies against Covid-19 infection. Children with a known history of Covid-19 or the presence of antibodies cannot be enrolled for the study. “Many candidates become ineligible because of existing antibodies,” said Dr Bharmal adding that some parents willing to enroll their children have been demanding an assurance that they will be given the real vaccine and not a placebo, which is not possible in a trial. “It’s a blind trial and even we don’t know who receives the real vaccine and who receives a placebo till we unblind it. We counsel the parents, but it’s hard to convince them,” he said. The hospital had received a poor response for the Zydus Cadila’s Zycov-D vaccine candidate for children and had culminated it only after 12 participants. Paediatric vaccine trials have been generating poor responses across the country. Covovax trial being conducted at the PGI Chandigarh has also been struggling to get candidates. “It’s obvious that parents are reluctant to let their children be a part of an experiment,” said paediatrician Dr Bakul Parekh, who is a member of the state’s paediatric Covid-19 task force. “Communication is therefore crucial. We need these trials to gather evidence, and to be able to cope with the Sars-CoV-2 virus in the coming days,” he said. The state’s task force has already given a green signal to start paediatric vaccinations in a staggered manner, rolling out the initial doses for children in the age group of 12 to 17 with comorbidities and then to children in all age groups with comorbidities. “Once the vaccines are available abundantly, we can roll them out for all children, similar to the adult vaccination drive,” said Dr Parekh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-40-out-of-920-minors-enrolled-for-paediatric-vaccine-trial-at-nair-hospital-101639422429967.html

However, soon after admission, the mother-daughter duo, who arrived from Singapore, fled the hospital as they “felt uncomfortable”. Sources in the know of the matter said the incident sparked panic in the hospital administration and the health department. A police team in PPE kits was sent to the housing society in Sector 137 at the address provided by the family. However, the woman and her daughter had not reached home. Sources said that the police team found the woman’s parents at the given address and informed them that legal action would be taken against her for breaking Covid protocols if she did not return to the hospital.

14-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram Muslims to approach Supreme Court against namaz vigilantes in Gurugram||The Gurgaon Muslim Council on Monday said that they are preparing a petition to be filed in the Supreme Court “this week” against the vigilantism and hate crimes by right-wing Hindu outfits who have been opposing the Friday namaz in open spaces in the city.Hindu outfits said they will file a counter petition, if the Muslims approach the apex court.Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson for the council, said, “We are approaching the apex court against the vigilantism and hate crime that is being witnessed every Friday.”A delegation of the council went to meet the Guruguram deputy commissioner Yash Garg, but when they couldn’t meet him, they said that their next course of action would be approach the apex court and seek its intervention for getting spaces in Gurugram to establish mosques, Ahmad said.Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (West), said the council members came to meet him as well, and asked him about allocation of open spaces for offering namaz coming Friday. “I have no idea since it will be decided by the district administration, so I asked them to meet the deputy commissioner, and get clarity regarding the sites,” he said.Deputy commissioner Garg could not be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.The protest against Friday namaz in open public spaces has been taking place in Gurugram for the last three years. In 2018, the administration designated 37 sites for Muslims to perform the Friday prayers. However, in November this year, the number of sites was cut down to 20 after members of the right-wing outfits continued to protest and disrupt prayers.However, these sites were also cancelled after Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said that offering namaz in public places cannot be tolerated. The chief minister directed that the administration should resolve the issue, and assign other sites.Mohammad Adeeb, a former Rajya Sabha member, who is leading a 21-member committee to resolve the ongoing issue, wrote to the deputy commissioner on Monday, and said that after Khattar announced that the permission for prayer in the open places has been withdrawn, new places were to be discussed and provided. “We would like to know whether the administration has allotted new places for Juma namaz, if so then which are these places,” he said in the letter.As a resident of Gurugram, I wanted to know how many places in the 113 sectors of the city have been allotted to Hindu temples and community centres; how many to churches and gurudwaras and how many places have been allocated to mosques, Adeeb said in the letter.Council spokesperson Altaf Ahmad said if the administration will now provide them the details of places allotted to places of worship in the city, they will file a right to information plea. “We need cooperation and support of the administration for reaching an amicable solution,” he said.Community members have claimed that there are nearly 500,000 Muslims who stay or work in Gurugram, and there are only two mosques in new Gurugram and 11 in the old city with a total capacity of 15,000 people. So, even if Juma namaz is performed in several jamaats (shifts), it would not be enough for all.Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor to Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, an umbrella organisation of Hindu bodies leading the protests against Friday namaz, said, “We are not aware of any petition. If they are filing a petition, then we will reply to the notice, and will also file petition against them,” he said.

No theft took place but an FIR under Section 356 (attempt to theft) of the IPC has been lodged against unknown persons,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police (central), Gautam Budh Nagar police.  The police recovered a blunt cutter and a ladder from the spot.“A complaint has been filed by the manager of the Metro security staff. The case is being investigated and CCTV footage is being examined to nab the suspects,” said Vivek Tripathi, station house officer of Phase-3 police station.The snapping of the cables affected the Metro services. “Delay in services between Noida City Centre and Noida Sector 61. Normal service on all other lines,” posted the official Twitter handle of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation at 8.53am on Monday.The DMRC did not issue any official statement over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/suspects-attempt-to-steal-metro-cable-wires-in-noida-booked-101639421471367.html
14-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi looks to take yoga to doorsteps, offers citizens free classes, teachers||tarting January, the Delhi government will offer free yoga classes to people within their housing societies, colony parks or community centres.In a bid to make yoga a “mass movement” by making it a community practice, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched the “Dilli Ki Yogshala” programme, in which 400 certified yoga instructors will impart yoga lessons to at least 20,000 people at their doorsteps in the city next month onwards.“Yoga is India’s gift to the entire world. I asked many people why they do not actively practise yoga. To this, the most common answer was that people either don’t have anyone to teach them, or the classes are very expensive and unaffordable. Then, the lack of discipline also posed a problem – practising for a couple of days and then slacking. Keeping these obstacles in mind, we formulated the idea to launch the Dilli Ki Yogshala programme which will provide you with classes and teachers free of cost,” Kejriwal said at the launch event at the Delhi secretariat on Monday.“All you need to do is arrange a group of 25 people who are willing to learn yoga, decide on an open space near your house, like a park or a community hall, and then give us a missed call on 9013585858. The Delhi government will assign a teacher to you. I believe people will enthusiastically take part in large numbers in this programme,” he said.People can also visit the website www.dillikiyogshala.com to register for the programme. The process includes filling the individual’s details, and the venue chosen by the people. One the registration is done, an instructor will be sent to the applicant’s locality and classes will start six days a week.The first International Day of Yoga was celebrated on June 21, 2015 after its inception at the United Nations General Assembly. In Delhi alone, the event saw the participation of nearly 36,000 people, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, CM Kejriwal, then Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and dignitaries from 84 nations, who performed 21 asanas for 35 minutes at Delhi’s Rajpath.The International Day of Yoga created two records, a Guinness World Record for the largest yoga classes at a single venue and the other for the highest number of nationalities to have participated in such a programme.The Delhi government’s yogshala programme was conceptualised in the beginning of this year, and it was passed in the budget in February. For the trainers, the Delhi government has roped in the Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University (DPSRU) and its own training and technical education (TTE) team. The Center for Meditation and Yoga Sciences (CMYS) was established in collaboration with the DPSRU. CMYS launched diploma and certificate courses and enrolled more than 650 students. These students were trained and certified to be yoga instructors, and they will now teach the Delhi residents, a senior government official said.The instructors will coordinate with a member of each group, who will be called “group coordinator”, to organise the classes. The group coordinator will talk to the instructor and fix the time and venue (as deemed suitable by all participants) for the yoga classes. To participate, citizens will have to register themselves on dillikiyogshala.com, the official explained.“An integral component of this initiative is to inculcate an enhanced sense of community within citizens. This initiative will also utilise public spaces like parks, community centres and so on, to their best potential by turning them into venues for community yoga sessions. By transforming these spaces into zones of meditation and positive thinking, the initiative will spread greater awareness about yoga as a means towards creating a happier individual. The concept behind Dilli Ki Yogshala is to make yoga reach door-to-door and to transform it into a mass movement by providing a certified yoga instructor to the public, free of cost,” Kejriwal said.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi residents welfare association joint front, welcomed the move. “No doubt it is a good initiative. It will give a boost to the health as well immunity of Delhiites... RWAs must get involved to encourage citizens to join yoga training,” Vohra said.
14-12-2021||Delhi||In ‘faceless’ Delhi Jal Board, help centres to replace offices||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) will soon be shutting its existing zonal revenue offices and replacing them with “sahayta kendras” or help centres and also launching a new phone application “DJB4You”, for streamlining the grievance redressal system, a senior official of the water utility, overseeing the implementation of the faceless services project, has said.According to an internal order of the DJB on Friday, finalising the modalities of the faceless offices project, a 15-day limit has been fixed for sanctioning of services after which the applications will be deemed approved.Among a host of other changes, the board has decided to rejig its entire zonal level administrative structure in order to facilitate closure of zonal revenue offices (ZROs). All existing ZROs will be closed and only processing work will take place in revenue offices without any public interaction, the order from additional CEO and director (revenue) Akriti Sagar said.“The 70 zonal revenue officers will operate in 11 pools, each headed by joint directors. Eleven joint director offices will be set up and the pool of officers will work on monitoring, inspections, audits etc. Now the primary mode of communication between the 2.4 million consumers and the DJB will be the mobile app DJB4You, the 1916 helpline, the doorstep delivery service and the new shayata kendras,” a DJB official said, requesting anonymity.Eight new offices with help desks are being set up in Bawana, Palam, Patel Nagar, Badli, Burari, Rohtas Nagar, Tilak Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar to ensure availability of adequate sites, the project report stated.The DJB official quoted above said orders have also been issued for facelifting all DJB offices to turn them into good customer service facilities with waiting area, token machines, cubicles, computers, furniture and improved internet connectivity.Last month, Hindustan Times reported that water minister Satyendar Jain has issued orders for shifting all existing DJB services to the online mode — a move first made by the transport department that took the functions of several regional transport offices (RTO) online earlier this year.The order from the additional CEO also said several changes have been made in the service delivery and that services must be sanctioned/ approved within 15 days or they will be deemed approved on the 16th day. Moreover, field inspections will be discontinued for new connections to plots measuring up to 200 square metres (sqm).A DJB official said separate orders have been issued to ensure that in cases of house-lock meters — property remains locked for a prolonged period — bill will be generated only for service charge and not consumption.Atul Goel, who heads URJA (an umbrella body of resident welfare groups), suggested that while the 15-day limit for deemed sanction of services is a good concept, the water utility should ensure that computer generated automatic certificates of deemed sanction is a part of the system. “If the user does not have a document proving sanction , it will still leave scope for harassment,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/app-helpline-help-centres-in-faceless-delhi-jal-board-reforms-101639421171397.html
14-12-2021||Delhi||Detained boy hit victim with brick repeatedly: Delhi Police||The teenager who was apprehended for murdering a 79-year-old woman in Rajendra Nagar hit the victim several times on the head with a brick — on immediately entering the house and then while leaving when she regained consciousness and was about to raise the alarm — investigators said, quoting disclosures by the accused, a day after he was caught for the crime.Kusum Singhal, who lived alone at her house in the Old Rajendra Nagar area, was killed on Friday and her body was found by a neighbour on Saturday. The teenager, according to the police, sold vegetables near her house and used to deliver vegetables to Singhal’s house.Investigators said the boy first hit Singhal with a brick on entering the house, when she was talking over the phone. She lost consciousness immediately and the teenager thought she had died. He then ransacked the house for valuables and stole ₹6,500 cash, some jewellery and a purse. Meanwhile, Singhal regained consciousness and was about to raise the alarm when the teenager picked up the brick again and hit her several times in the head, inflicting severe injuries that led to her death, the officers said, adding that the boy also took away Singhal’s phone.On Monday, the police said they have also arrested two men, identified by their first names as Ajit (24) and Aakash (21), for allegedly purchasing the elderly woman’s mobile phone, a pair of earrings and a metal ring. The teenager sold the phone and pair of earrings to Ajit, while Aakash bought the metal ring.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sweta Singh Chauhan said the murder took place on December 10, a day before the woman’s body was found by her neighbour, who had gone to check on her after being contacted by one of her daughters, who was worried as her mother was not answering calls.As there were signs of the house being ransacked, a case of murder for robbery was registered. During inquiry, it was learnt that Singhal was last seen nearly 20 hours before her body was discovered.It was learnt that Singhal had undergone some diagnostic tests on December 10 and because of that, she was wearing a holter monitor (a wearable device that tracks heart rhythms).“The reading on the machine (observed through a remote server) showed that her heartbeat increased excessively between 3.30pm and 4pm on December 10, suggesting that she was murdered during that period. Investigators examined the footage of nearly 90 CCTV cameras installed in the neighbourhood during that half hour and one of the cameras captured the suspect in the lane, with a brick in his hand,” said another investigator.The suspect was apprehended along with the woman’s stolen cellphone, ₹2,000 cash and two pairs of earrings. While he was being examined, the investigating team found that Singhal’s Facebook account was still active.“The teenager told us he stole another cellphone from the woman’s house on December 8, two days before the murder. He sold that phone to Ajit. We arrested Ajit and recovered the phone,” the investigator said.The teenager told the police that he planned to rob Singhal when he came to know that she lived alone while delivering vegetables to her home.

It also resolved to meet the Chief Justice and apprise him about the stand of OBA on the issue. On November 18, 2021, a bench headed by Chief Justice Rajesh Binda had ordered to submit a list of cases pending in both the benches (Lucknow and Allahabad) on the same issue so that they could be clubbed and heard together. In another order dated December 9, 2021, a bench headed by the chief justice pointed out that a number of petitions were pending before this court (Lucknow) and also the principal bench (Allahabad) on similar issue related to payment of cane price or interest on account of delayed payment. “In a meeting convened by the Oudh Bar Association on December 10, it was resolved to oppose any move to transfer ‘any case’ or ‘class of cases’ from Lucknow high court to Allahabad high court,” said Rakesh Kumar Chaudhary, president, Oudh Bar Association. “The association has further resolved that any notion of ‘Principal Bench’ attached to the seat of the high court at Allahabad is wrong and is strongly condemned and opposed,” added Chaudhary. “We have also decided to meet Hon’ble Chief Justice and apprise him about the stand of the Oudh Bar Association on the issue of transfer of cases and wrong notion of principal seat of the high court in Allahabad,” said Chaudhary. “Firstly, it is clear that there is no power vested with the high court to transfer case(s) from its seat at Lucknow to the seat at Allahabad,” said the resolution passed by the OBA. “The only power vested is with the chief justice under Article 14 of the amalgamation order that too after hearing the affected parties and determining on objective criteria and upon investigation whether the case was (a) transferable and (b) should be transferred,” said the OBA’s resolution. “Secondly, the notion that seat of this court at Allahabad is ‘principal bench’ is fallacious and is against the dictum of the constitution bench judgment of the Supreme Court,” claimed the OBA’s resolution. Moreover, lawyers of Lucknow have also demanded to increase jurisdiction of the Lucknow high court. 
14-12-2021||Delhi||Cops list 64 snarl points in Delhi, to draw plans to ease traffic, pollution||The Delhi traffic police have identified 64 congestion points from where long tailbacks and regular snarls are being reported, resulting in increased vehicular emissions that worsen the overall pollution levels in the national capital.A senior officer said the department has drawn up a list of 64 places that are most prone to congestion, and the traffic police, in coordination with the city’s environment department, will now identify reasons behind these traffic hold-ups and make individual plans to ease the jams.The need for urgent solutions couldn’t have been more evident than it was on Monday, when Delhi’s air quality was back in the ”very poor“category, with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 331, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. In comparison, the air was much better on Sunday, when the AQI was 254, in the “poor” category.“In September, we first identified a list of 30 congestion points when the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) held the first meeting with all agencies in the Capital, before the onset of the pollution season. But now we have identified more stretches and junctions where jams are reported on a regular basis,” the Delhi traffic police officer cited above said.Some of the areas that have been included in the new list are Qutub Road, Delhi Gate, Nirman Vihar (Vikas Marg), Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal, Khajuri Chowk, Palam flyover, Delhi Cantonment flyover to Dhaula Kuan, Outer Circle Connaught Place, Bhairon Marg (Ring Road), Gulab Singh Road, Azadpur Mandi, Madhuban Chowk, Ashram Chowk to Maharani Bagh, Khanpur T-point, Okhla Mandi, Lodhi flyover, Uttam Nagar Chowk to Dwarka Mor, Kapashera Chowk, Shadipur Chowk and Peeragarhi Chowk.Officials said each of the six traffic ranges identified the most congested stretches in their respective jurisdictions. The criteria for inclusion on the list were consistent traffic jams and increased vehicular volume. The long waiting time at traffic signals was also treated as an indicator of increased vehicular emissions, the officer said.Senior officials of DPCC also said the identification of these congestion points was important to control vehicular pollution, which is the biggest source of local pollution in the national capital.Action on these stretches will provide a dual benefit — reducing commuter distress while also bringing down the local pollution, the officials said.“After the Covid-19 pandemic, vehicular emissions have become a bigger problem. A lot of commuters, who were earlier travelling via public transport modes, have now switched to private vehicles. Many from economically weaker backgrounds have purchased two-wheelers or second hand cars for their commute, fearing contraction of infection on mass transit systems. The negative impact of this can be seen in the form of increased jams and its effect on pollution,” a DPCC official said.The official added that each of these stretches will be inspected and the reason behind the snarls will be assessed and solutions worked out accordingly.“For instance, if broken roads are causing a traffic hold-up, then we will forward the complaint to the public works department (PWD) or the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) so that the necessary action is taken. The solutions could be either short or long term, but we will try to resolve the maximum number of issues and reduce the list,” the DPCC official said.A study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), released in November, showed that vehicular emissions contributed the highest share to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), in terms of local sources of pollution.

Banerjee, whose party is keen to establish a presence in the state ahead of the upcoming assembly elections expected to be held early next year, addressed the first of her three public rallies in the Christian dominated constituency of Benaulim where she also welcomed local MLA Churchill Alemão into the party. “Mother Teresa was very affectionate to me. Once when the Left Front government was there (in power). At midnight she rang me up and said, ‘Mamata those leftists are capturing one house of ours. Can you help me?’ I went there and settled it and saved her,” Banerjee told the gathering. “I must remember that day when the Babri Masjid was demolished. There was a big communal riot in Kolkata everywhere. I was there on the road. No government (presence) was on the road. Then I met Mother Teresa in Loretto school, which is run by Catholics and all. Mother told me, ‘Mamata, what are you doing here? And I asked her, What are you doing here? That relationship we maintained,” Banerjee said, adding that she was invited to the Vatican for the canonization ceremony of Mother Teresa, an invitation she accepted. “After our government came (to power), we celebrated the Christmas festival in Kolkata in a big way. I am going to inaugurate that festival later this month where Derek O’Brien will be with me and the Archbishop will be with me and some fathers (priests) also. Every year I go to Church, not a single year I have missed,” she said, adding that Christmas midnight mass was something she attended since she was very young. Banerjee is in the state for a second visit and made her intentions clear that her aim was not to ‘split the vote’ against the BJP, rather ‘unite the vote against the BJP.’ “Everyone wants that BJP must go politically. Everyone has seen the (reality of the) performance of zero tolerance (to corruption) and zero governance. They are trying to finish the country, democracy, the constitution, heritage. It is not only in Goa but in every part of this country,” she said. “They have only one narrative that they only are (real) Hindus and the rest (of us) have fallen from the sky. (Everyone) who has a big heart is a real Hindu. My parents never told me ‘You are a Hindu so you must never like a Muslim or never like a Christian,’” she said. Taking a dig at the Congress, she said that no party had the right to claim ownership of the opposition space. “We have seen in India that some political parties consider themselves zamindars. They do not do anything and do not let others do anything. How many days did we wait? I do not want to speak against the Congress. If the Congress thinks of working to defeat the BJP, we have no objection. We have formed an alliance in Goa along with MGP. This is the alternative. You want to join, join us. Just because you (Congress) are not doing it, no one else will do it, this is not right. In a democracy... nobody is a zamindar in that way,” she added. Earlier in the day, Alemao, in a representation before Speaker Rajesh Patnekar, said he as the lone MLA of the Nationalist Congress Party in the Goa Assembly was ‘merging’ his legislative party and should henceforth be considered an MLA of the TMC. The state unit of the NCP hit back saying that they were contemplating legal action as Alemão’s unilateral decision had no authorization from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-goa-rally-mamata-flaunts-christian-credentials-vows-to-fight-bjp-101639420510479.html
14-12-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram increases hospital beds to prepare for possible Omicron wave||Since the second wave of Covid-19 in April-May, hospital beds in the district have been increased by almost 50% across both private and government hospitals, said officials. As on Monday, the district has a total of 5,532 beds — up from 3,700 beds during the second wave — including oxygen beds, intensive care unit beds and ventilator beds, health officials said as concerns mount over a countrywide rise in cases of Omicron, the new Covid-19 variant. The district health department, on December 1, had asked all private and government hospitals to update details of bed availability, as part of preparations to tackle a new spread of the pandemic. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “Hospital bed capacity has been increased in the district by at least 50% since the second wave. Apart from the beds available in private and government hospitals, there are almost 1,000 beds available in temporary hospitals that were set up during the second wave — like the facility at Tau Devi Lal Stadium, M3M and other government facilities. All these beds also have oxygen support. Of these beds, 350 can be used for paediatric cases of Covid-19.”According to the data shared by the health department, of the 5,532 beds, 3,427 are in private hospitals and have oxygen support, 434 are ventilator beds, and 952 are ICU beds. A total of 367 beds available in government hospitals, all of which are oxygen supported. Of the 367, six are ventilator beds and 19 are ICU beds. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “We have taken an update from all hospitals to see how many beds are available and we are continuously monitoring the situation. There are enough beds in both government and private hospitals in the district, in addition to those in the temporary hospitals that were built during the second wave of Covid. We also have 25% of beds in all hospitals reserved for treatment of Covid-19 patients at any given point of time.” In the district, 101 hospitals with 20 beds or above, are associated with the health department and authorised to treat Covid-19 patients. A total of 38 hospitals have 50 beds and above. The district has also increased testing to a daily average of 4,000 samples. The district health department is also sending 30 samples at random every month for genome sequencing as part of monitoring process for Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-increases-hospital-beds-to-prepare-for-possible-omicron-wave-101639420390337.html
14-12-2021||Delhi||Pollution in Delhi creeps back to ‘very poor’, temperature stays low||Temperatures continued to remain low in Delhi, with the mercury at 6.6 degrees Celsius on Monday morning at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base observatory. While this was two degrees below normal, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 22.4°C, a notch below normal.The cooler days and nights did, however, adversely affect pollution levels, pushing the air quality index (AQI) into the ‘very poor’ zone.Delhi recorded this season’s lowest minimum temperature — 6.4°C — a day earlier, and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the city can expect a similar chill for the rest of the week.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said the minimum temperature will hover between 6°C and 8°C till the end of the week, with two western disturbances in the northern plains likely to marginally influence Delhi.“These are feeble western disturbances, so the impact will not be too significant. The minimum temperature may rise to 8°C, but a drop in mercury is expected from December 17,” said Jenamani.At 6.6°C, Safdarjung in south Delhi was the coldest spot in the national capital on Monday morning, while Mayur Vihar in east Delhi recorded the city’s lowest maximum at 20.8°C.The IMD’s forecast for Tuesday showed that the maximum temperature is likely to hover around 23°C, while the minimum is likely to remain around the 6°C mark.The drop in temperatures, particularly at night and in the early hours of the day has also pushed Delhi’s air quality back into the ‘very poor’ category, with a 24-hour average AQI of 331 at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. In comparison, it was 254 (poor) on Sunday.Experts said wind speeds are again expected to pick up from December 15.“The AQI will hover between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ during this period. Low temperatures are unfavourable for the dispersal of pollutants, but an increase in wind speeds from December 15 may once again bring down the AQI to ‘poor’,” said Gufran Beig, founder and project director, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) — a forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.The Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, which also falls under the ministry of earth sciences, also forecasts Delhi’s air quality to hover between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ during the next seven days, with severe air unlikely at the moment.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said Delhi’s air quality generally tends to return to the ‘severe’ category by the last week of December, as low temperatures combine with dense fog to trap pollutants. “Low temperatures slow down the air and the moisture content from the fog also traps pollutants. We may once again see a spell of severe air towards end December and early January,” said Roychowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/temperature-in-delhi-dips-air-pollution-slips-in-very-poor-zone-101639420330098.html

14-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Delhi govt asks CAQM to reopen schools||The Delhi government will send a submission to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas that educational institutions for students from Class 6 be reopened with immediate effect, while physical classes for primary schoolchildren be resumed from December 20 since pollution levels in the Capital have improved this month, Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday said.Rai also said the government will continue the ban on entry of diesel and petrol trucks to Delhi until further directions are issued, and hold a review meeting for the ban on construction activities on December 16.“Delhi’s air quality has started to improve and the situation is not as severe as it was post-Diwali. Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) levels between December 1 and December 12 have been hovering between 250 and 300 and therefore, a review meeting with all the departments was held today (Monday) to analyse the possible measures that can be taken around the restrictions imposed to curb air pollution,” Rai said.The minister said a proposal was sent by the education department, which will now be sent to CAQM through Delhi’s environment department.The commission is expected to hold a review meeting later this week to decide when and how to lift the existing curbs on air pollution that have been imposed across NCR, including the closure of schools and colleges, ban on construction activities, and the closure of some thermal power plants, among other restrictions.The Supreme Court on Friday directed CAQM to take a decision on relaxing the restrictions imposed within a week’s time, noting that the air quality had “started improving” in the region.Schools have been shut four times since March last year – twice owing to concerns over Covid-19, and twice since November because of the pollution problem. Schools were allowed to call all students for in-person classes from November 1 but the classes were suspended again for a week on November 13, after the apex court pulled up authorities over the city’s poor air quality. Schools then reopened on November 29 as pollution eased marginally, but were shut again on December 2.The next day, on December 3, the Supreme Court clarified that it did not ask the government to shut schools, but had simply asked the reasons for change in the government’s stance in regard to schools.Delhi’s air quality has shown a slight improvement since the start of December, with only one ‘severe’ air day during this period. The air quality has largely hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’. In comparison, Delhi recorded 11 ‘severe’ air days in November.A CAQM official said they were also listening to applications for possible exemptions to be given to various industries, with a meeting to decide relaxation to be taken this week. “All such applications will be analysed and the Supreme Court has given us a week’s time to look at the best way to reopen. A decision will be taken accordingly,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.For construction activities, Rai said the government met several construction agencies on Monday, but added that the decision to exempt them will lie with the commission. “We have asked these agencies to write to CAQM, but we will also be holding a detailed review on December 16 at 12pm, where agencies can submit reasons for a possible exemption to resume construction work. We will then be sharing this with CAQM,” he added.The minister stressed that other campaigns to control pollution locally will continue in Delhi, with 6,953 inspections carried out so far as part of the anti-dust campaign. Out of these, 597 locations were issued notices, with fines of ₹1.65 crore imposed so far. “As part of the campaign against open burning, we have inspected 16,580 sites so far, with 2,490 notices and a total fine of ₹46.96 lakh issued so far.” the minister said, adding that agencies in Delhi will also continue to sprinkle water on roads.Rai said as part of the Green Delhi app, 6,975 complaints had been received so far by the Delhi government since its launch on October 5, with 5,686 (81%) resolved. “Our campaign against polluting cars has meant 19.5 lakh cars have been inspected this winter season and around 49,000 cars have also been fined for not having a valid PUC certificate,” he added.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has over 120 private Delhi schools as its members, said prolonged closures had thrown the academic cycle out of gear and hurt learning. “We don’t know by when will we able to start teaching the students in class 10 and 12...With so many school closures, we are left with little time to prepare students for the remaining part of the board exams,” said Acharya, who is the principal of ITL School in Dwarka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-delhi-govt-asks-caqm-to-reopen-schools-101639420029828.html
14-12-2021||Delhi||On the wane: Delhi logs less than 300 new dengue cases||With temperatures dropping consistently in Delhi over the past one week, the number of dengue cases being reported in the national capital during the week has also declined to below the 300 mark, for the first time since mid-October (there were 243 cases in the week ending October 16).According to the weekly report on mosquito-borne diseases, released by the municipal corporations of Delhi on Monday, the city recorded 285 dengue cases and zero malaria and chikungunya cases. No new death due to dengue has been reported during the past one week, the report said. The figure is quite low, health officials said, adding that in the two weeks preceding that, Delhi had recorded 699 and 1,148 new cases of dengue, respectively.Overall, Delhi has so far registered 9,260 dengue cases and 15 deaths — figures second only to the 60 fatalities recorded during the 2015 outbreak when nearly 16,000 people were infected.A senior public health official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), the nodal agency for data compilation, said the city is well past the peak of dengue infections and the mosquito activity is likely to reduce even further in the coming weeks as the daily temperature drops. On Monday (December 13), Delhi registered a minimum temperature of 6.6 degrees Celsius (°C), which is two degrees less than normal for this time of the year. The maximum temperature on Monday was 22.4°C, one degree less than normal.SDMC officials said both the anopheles (malaria transmitting) and aedes aegypti (dengue transmitting) mosquitoes prefer warmer environs, ideally above 30°C. “Once the temperature drops to about 20°C, they become less active in open environments and stop functioning entirely once the mercury drops below 10°C. People still need to be careful as adult mosquitoes have a life of one month. Fumigating and cleaning the house and premises thoroughly will help remove adult mosquitoes that will otherwise live in ambient house temperatures,” the public health official said, asking not to be named.This year, Delhi has recorded the most number of dengue infections and deaths since 2015. A bulk of these came in November, when the corporations logged 6,739 cases. In Delhi, the number of dengue cases usually peak in the month of October and the delayed peak of the infection was attributed to a delayed withdrawal of the monsoon and the slow arrival of winter, officials said.“Three more deaths related to dengue are under investigation by the death audit committee and a final decision is pending,” an official said, on condition of anonymity.Once a dengue or malaria related death is reported by a hospital, a nine-member expert committee audits all documents related to that patient to ascertain whether it was indeed the infection that killed the person and whether the origin of the infection was Delhi. The committee also takes a look at other aspects like co-morbidities before attributing the death to vector borne diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dengue-cases-tally-now-below-300-mark-101639419729800.html
14-12-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav takes jibe at PM’s Kashi visit; BJP hits back||KANPUR In a loaded remark on the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath corridor in Varanasi, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav taunted him, saying people stay in Kashi when the end is near.Yadav was apparently suggesting that the BJP government was in its “final days” in Uttar Pradesh.“It is very good, he (PM) can stay there for not one month, but two or even three months. That is a good place to stay; people spend their final days in Banaras,” he said when asked by reporters that the PM is in Varanasi and the government has planned month-long cultural events to mark the event.The elections to the UP Assembly are due within three months and the SP claims that it will oust the BJP from power. In Hindu religion, spending last days of life in Kashi is considered auspicious.The SP chief also took a swipe at the BJP, saying they should “avoid telling lies” before God. He hit out at the BJP for claiming the credit of developmental works, which he claimed were done by his government.On Sunday, Akhilesh had claimed that it was during his tenure that the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project was approved, for which he has “documentary evidence”.“The three farm laws should have been repealed long time ago. But the government did not do that and as a result 600 farmers lost their lives. The BJP government has withdrawn the laws fearing a backlash from farmers who will not forgot the inhumane treatment they were meted out and will give a befitting reply during the elections,” said Yadav in his native village Saifai in Etawah district on Monday. He said the government had made electricity so costly that farmers struggled to afford it while they also had brave long queues to get urea.Alleging discrimination against his native district Etawah by the ruling dispensation, Yadav said: “The cricket stadium in Etawah could have hosted IPL matches had it not been slow pace of development. The lion safari, our dream project, is incomplete while the astro turf is also being neglected.” Meanwhile, the BJP government and the party hit out at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav over his remark that “Kashi is meant for stay during one’s last days” that he made in response to a query on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Slamming the SP chief over the remark, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh sought an apology from Akhilesh and also demanded that the SP chief should visit the KV temple to seek forgiveness for his comment. “His remarks against the visionary Prime Minister were disgusting and in such bad taste. I pray to God to put some sense in Akhilesh ji. The SP chief must apologise and visit Kashi Vishwanath (temple) to seek forgiveness for his sins,” the UP BJP chief said.

Also, a monthly assistance of ₹2,500 to those families that have lost their only breadwinner and for children orphaned due to the pandemic.Meanwhile, Delhi saw 56 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday and no new related deaths as the total caseload reached 1,441,718 and the death toll remained at 25,100, a bulletin from the health department showed. The active caseload stood at 397 in the city.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that his government would introduce new restrictions in the city to check the spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant if the need arises. “We are ready to tackle the Omicron threat. If required, we will impose necessary restrictions. Currently, there is no such need to impose any restrictions,” news agency ANI quoted the chief minister as saying on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-21-235-families-in-delhi-received-rs-50-000-one-time-financial-aid-says-aap-minister-101639394798868.html
14-12-2021||World||US ambassador-designate Eric Garcetti vows to help strengthen India||Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador-designate to India, on Tuesday said he plans to “double-down on our efforts to strengthen India’s capacity to secure its borders, defend its sovereignty, and deter aggression” when he takes office and, at the same time, raise with Indians the issues of Indian purchases of Russian arms, specially S-400 missile defence systems, and human rights and democratic values.A long-time Democratic operative and Los Angeles mayor, 50-year-old Garcetti is President Joe Biden’s nominee for ambassador to India and appeared before a US senate committee for confirmation along with ambassador-designates Donald Armin Blome for Pakistan and Amy Gutmann for Germany.“If confirmed, I intend to double-down on our efforts to strengthen India’s capacity to secure its borders, defend its sovereignty, and deter aggression - through information sharing, counterterrorism coordination, joint freedom of navigation patrols and military exercises (which I have participated in as a naval officer alongside my Indian counterparts), and sales of our best defence technologies in order to realise the full potential of our Major Defence Partnership,” Garcetti said in his opening statement for the hearing.SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TIES WITH INDIAGarcetti lauded the progress made in the relationship from 1992, “the year I graduated from college after studying Hindi and Indian cultural and religious history”, and now. Annual trade stood at a paltry $2 billion then (it’s over $145 billion now) and defence trade was zero ($20 billion in 2020). He also spoke of his visit to India as a teenager, along with his parents.Senators from both parties pressed Eric Garcetti during questioning to raise several issues with India, even as they appreciated the close nature of the partnership between the two countries and the upward growth trajectory. Two key issues they sought to task Garcetti - India’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defence missile systems that could trigger sanctions under a US law that seeks to punish Russia by scaring away its big defence clients, called the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA); and “democratic backsliding”, as one senator put it, and human rights.“I don’t want to prejudge the Secretary’s decision about sanctions or a waiver and I do want to tell the chairman and all the members, I do fully support the law of the land, implementation of CAATSA as law and here and part of that is the waiver provision as you mentioned,” Eric Garcetti said in response to a question about his stand on the India’s purchase of S-400s.“If confirmed, though, I would advocate following the continued diversification of India’s weapon system, the threats to our own weapon systems if that diversification doesn’t occur, because we have to protect our data and our systems and work towards really growing this Major Defence Partnership.”COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACYOn questions about “democratic backsliding”, a phrase used by Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and questions about the Citizenship Amendment Act, Garcetti said, “There’s no question that the US-India relationship should be underpinned by our common commitment to democracy, to human rights and to civil society (as enshrined) in our constitutions, both the oldest democracy in the world and the largest democracy in the world.”“And human rights, defence of democracy is a pillar of our foreign policy but to answer specifically, if confirmed, I will actively raise these issues or raise them with humility. It’s a two-way street on these, but I intend to engage directly with civil society.”Eric Garcetti has been the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles since 2013, following 12 years as a member of the City Council, including six as Council President.Garcetti co-founded Climate Mayors and led more than 400 US mayors to adopt the Paris Climate agreement, according to the announcement. He is the current Chair of C40 Cities - a network of 97 of the world’s biggest cities taking bold climate action and has led the organisation’s engagement and expansion in India as well as C40’s global response to the Covid pandemic through the sharing of best practices and resources, said the White House.Garcetti’s familiarity with the region owes also to his 12 years as an Intelligence Officer in the US Navy Reserve Component, Garcetti served under the commander, US Pacific Fleet and the Defence Intelligence Agency, retiring in 2017 as a Lieutenant.He is a Rhodes Scholar and studied at Queen’s College, Oxford and the London School of Economics and Political Science. His website as LA mayor says he is also a jazz pianist and photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ambassador-designate-eric-garcetti-vows-to-help-strengthen-india-101639503960635.html
14-12-2021||World||Not against boosters, but inequity and vaccine hoarding: WHO chief amid rapid Omicron spread||The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday expressed its concerns over global inequality in Covid-19 vaccine distribution even as several developed economies continued to press ahead with a booster programme amid the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant in several countries.As many as 77 countries have reported cases pertaining to the Omicron variant and it is probably already there in more countries, the WHO said. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the UN health body, in a press briefing on Covid-19.While explicitly stating that it was not against the administration of boosters, the WHO chief said vaccine hoarding and the ensuing inequality were its main concerns.Also read | Omicron Covid-19 variant more transmissible, reduces vaccine efficiency: WHO“The emergence of Omicron has prompted some countries to roll out Covid-19 booster programmes for their entire adult populations, even while we lack evidence for the effectiveness of boosters against this variant,” Ghebreyesus said, even as he spoke about a key role boosters could play in fighting against the pandemic."WHO is concerned that such programmes will repeat the #COVID19 vaccine hoarding we saw this year, & exacerbate inequity.

The WHO also said that it saw “significant inequities” between various population groups within the same country.“If we end inequity, we end the Covid-19 pandemic. If we allow inequity to continue, we allow the pandemic to continue,” the WHO chief said.Further, the WHO stressed on Covid-appropriate behaviour such as facemasks, distancing and hand hygiene along with vaccinations. It also called upon vaccine donors and manufacturers to prioritise supplies to COVAX, the global vaccine sharing programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-against-boosters-but-inequity-and-vaccine-hoarding-who-chief-amid-rapid-omicron-spread-101639503107001.html

14-12-2021||World||Over 100 former army personnel killed in Afghanistan since August, Taliban responsible for at least 72: UN||More than 100 former members of the Afghan security forces and others have been killed after the Taliban took the reins of Afghanistan in August and most of them have been killed by the hardline Islamist group, the United Nations said on Tuesday.“Between August and November, we received credible allegations of more than 100 killings of former Afghan national security forces and others associated with the former Government, with at least 72 of these killings attributed to the Taliban,” UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif informed the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).“In several cases, the bodies were publicly displayed. This has of course exacerbated fear among this sizable category of the population,” she further said.In her speech, Al-Nashif said that the country witnessed the highest civilian casualty this year even before the Taliban took over. Women and children represented close to half of all those deaths. While the harm to civilians, due to the fighting, has declined to a degree after August, they continued to remain at risk, she said. “... ruthless campaigns of lethal attacks are still being carried out by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) armed group as well as by other armed groups,” she noted.Also read | India’s move to send medicines for Afghan kids draws praise from Taliban“In Nangarhar province alone, there also appears to be a pattern of at least 50 extra-judicial killings of individuals suspected to be members of the ISIL-KP. Brutal methods of killings, including hanging, beheadings, and public display of corpses have been reported,” she added.Expressing concerns about the risk of children being recruited by Taliban and other networks such as ISIL-KP, she also noted that boys were becoming “increasingly visible” among security forces in checkpoints and as bodyguards.Regarding women’s rights, she said that the Taliban’s decree earlier this month left many questions unanswered. “It does not make clear a minimum age for marriage, nor refer to any wider women and girls' rights to education, to work, to freedom of movement, or to participate in public life,” she said.She cited a report by Unicef and said that 60% of the 4.2 million school children, who are out of school, were girls. In provinces where the Taliban had allowed girls to attend schools, absence of women teachers was a problem.“The continued participation of women in all aspects of life will be fundamental to Afghanistan's future. UN partners have estimated that restricting women from working could contribute an immediate economic loss of up to US$1 billion – or up to 5% of the country's GDP,” she highlighted.Drawing attention to the issue of threat from the Taliban to the civil society in Afghanistan, she said, “The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has documented 59 apparently arbitrary detentions, beatings, and threats of civil society activists, journalists, and staff of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, attributed to the de facto authorities.” She also said that the safety of legal professionals, particularly women, was a matter of “particular alarm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-former-army-personnel-killed-in-afghanistan-since-august-taliban-responsible-for-at-least-72-un-101639485339122.html
14-12-2021||World||China calls for UN-led regulation of military application of AI||China has for the first time submitted a proposal to the UN to regulate military application of artificial intelligence (AI) as its competition with the US over the dual-use technology intensifies.The document focuses on the “research, development, deployment and use of AI for military applications and proposes solutions on how to develop and use AI technology in the military field”, Li Song, Chinese Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs, said on Monday.The document was submitted to the sixth review conference of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva on Monday.China has pumped in billions in the sector over the years, and especially since the government unveiled the “New General AI Development Plan” in 2017, aimed at making China the leader in the field by 2030.Experts say AI will be the foundation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) mission to become a “world class” military capable of rivaling the US in the next few decades.The inclusion of AI means the increasing “intelligentisation alongside mechanization and informatisation” of the PLA as per Chinese government documents.The PLA has already begun to deploy AI-driven technologies.The PLA Air Force has started to deploy AI as simulated opponents in pilots’ aerial combat training so pilots can sharpen their decision-making and combat skills against fast-calculating computers, the tabloid Global Times reported in June this year.“In addition to training pilots efficiently, AIs are expected to be an integral part of China’s future warplanes that would assist pilots with their combat decisions,” the tabloid reported.In the document submitted to the UN on Monday, China seems to be trying to create a level-playing field among countries with advanced AI technologies.“In terms of strategic security, countries, especially major countries, need to develop and apply AI technology in the military field in a prudent and responsible manner, refrain from seeking absolute military advantage, and prevent the deepening of strategic miscalculation, undermining of strategic mutual trust, escalation of conflicts, and damaging global strategic balance and stability,” the document said.“One particular concern is the long-term impacts and potential risks of military applications of AI technology in such aspects as strategic security, rules on governance, and ethics,” the position paper said.“We need to enhance the efforts to regulate military applications of AI with a view to forestalling and managing potential risks,” it said.The US Department of Defence highlighted the role of AI in a report on China’s armed forces released in November,“The term “intelligentised” describes “the PRC’s concept of future warfare based on emerging and disruptive technologies, particularly AI”. This includes intelligent technologies, systems, and operational concepts such as “attrition warfare by intelligent swarms, cross-domain mobile warfare, AI-based space confrontation, and cognitive control operations,” that facilitate information processing and decision-making on the battlefield. The report added that China is also updating its doctrine and warfighting plans to incorporate these capabilities.Quoting the report, the Council on Foreign Relations said: “China’s Academy of Military Science (AMS) has a mandate to ensure “that the PLA’s warfighting theory and doctrine fully capitalise on disruptive technologies like AI and autonomous systems” Through an emphasis on emerging technologies, China seeks to become a “global innovation superpower”.In the submitted document, China called for joint regulation of the sector and to establish an “universal international regime”.It called for countries to “adhere to the principle of multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness. In order to track technology development trends and prevent potential security risks, countries need to conduct policy dialogue and exchanges, strengthen communication with international organisations…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-for-un-led-regulation-of-military-application-of-ai-101639467373955.html

14-12-2021||World||Donald Trump’s inner circle was horrified by Jan 6 insurrection: US probe panel||Former US President Donald Trump’s eldest son and several Fox News anchors had begged the White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to get the president to call off the hordes of his supporters ransacking the US congress on January 6, contrary to their strident public defence of it.A committee of the US House of Representatives that is investigating the January 6 insurrection also recommended the criminal prosecution of Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows on Monday and released text messages from approximately 9,000 documents turned over by him.“He’s got to condemn this shit ASAP,” Donald Trump Jr, former president’s eldest son, had texted Meadows. “The Capitol Police tweet is not enough.”“I’m pushing it hard. I agree,” Meadows replied. “We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,” Trump Jr texted back.Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingram, who are both loud Trump supporters, had also texted Meadows pleading with him to persuade Donald Trump to call off his supporters, which is quite the opposite position they have taken since, downplaying the insurrection. “Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home,” Ingram wrote, adding, “This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.”Liz Cheney, the top Republican on the investigation committee, read out these texts before she and the eight members of the panel voted to recommend criminal prosecution of Meadows for defying a congressional subpoena to testify about his role and what was going on at the White House at the time.The full House will vote on the panel’s recommendation sometime this week and if approved, Meadows will become the second witness to face contempt in this case.Steve Bannon, a former Trump aide, was the first when he refused to testify citing the former president’s executive privilege, a claim that was struck down by a court.Meadows also tried the same trick: Trump’s executive privilege - which, however, has been waived by President Biden. Only the sitting president can claim executive privilege, to retain the confidentiality of their communications, including of certain members of the administration.Meadows, who is a former member of the House of Representatives, had agreed to testify initially but changed his mind later. It was possibly because of pushback from Donald Trump triggered, among other things, by uncharitable revelations in a recently released tell-all book by the former chief of staff about his time in the Trump White House.Meadows had turned over approximately 9,000 documents and records to the committee already before he sought to shut down his cooperation by refusing to testify. They include the text messages US Rep Liz Cheney read out, blowing open the hypocrisy of Trump supporters who were privately revolted by the event they have publicly defended or downplayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-inner-circle-was-horrified-by-jan-6-insurrection-us-probe-panel-101639462693820.html

Anand is just the second woman to hold the post of Canada’s defence minister after Kim Campbell in the 1990s.The country’s chief of the defence staff (CDS), General Wayne Eyre also issued an apology.Trudeau was asked during the course of a press conference why he had not delivered the apology himself. He reacted, “We profoundly regret what has happened and we apologise to all the survivors in the Canadian Armed Forces who should have never experienced the things that they did, when these people offered their services to our country.”The crisis came to light in February this year, as the outlet Global News reported that General Jonathan Vance, who had been replaced as CDS just a month prior, was facing charges of sexual misconduct. Vance’s successor Admiral Art McDonald stepped aside from the post before the end of February as he faced allegations of impropriety. In May, the head of Canada’s vaccine rollout programme Major-General Dany Fortin, was removed from that position as the military announced an investigation into similar allegations. At the time, he was seconded to the Public Health Agency of Canada as its vice-president for logistics and operations. And just last week, reports emerged of Vice-Admiral Haydn Edmundson, facing such charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-defence-minister-apologises-for-sexual-misconduct-in-armed-forces-101639462573581.html

Actual satellites are not used.During a visit to Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks saw the 'Space Flag' simulated space training exercise hosted by US forces. It was the 13th such exercise, and the third to involve partners such as Britain, Canada and Australia."It happens in rooms like that ... people at a relatively junior level in many cases. Collaborating and thinking through challenges and trying to figure out concepts that seem to make sense and discarding ideas that go astray," Hicks told reporters en route to Hawaii.Pentagon leaders are touring US bases this week while the Biden administration's draft 2023 budget takes shape. The Department of Defense hopes to move budget dollars toward a military that can deter China and Russia.After Russia successfully conducted an anti-satellite missile test last month, US officials believe there is an increasing need to make the U.S. satellite network resilient to attack and to use opportunities like 'Space Flag' to train.Satellites are vital to military communications, global positioning navigation, and timing systems that are needed in the event of war.The 10-day-long space war game attempts to simulate the cutting edge of the US capability in space. The training exercise involved an adversarial group working to simulate an aggressor nation with space capabilities like Russia or China.Russia is not the first country to conduct anti-satellite tests in space. The United States performed the first in 1959, when satellites were rare and new.In Hawaii, Hicks will meet with Pacific military commanders and visit Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam where she will hear about water contamination issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-space-force-holds-war-game-to-test-satellite-network-under-attack-101639455723677.html

It is still widely regarded as one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.In 2018, another massive earthquake shook the island of Lombok. Several more tremors followed over the next couple of weeks, killing more than 550 people on the holiday island and the neighbouring Sumbawa.In the same year, another 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tsunami-warning-issued-after-magnitude-7-7-earthquake-hits-indonesia-101639453706036.html

Claiming open seas as their own. Distorting open markets through subsidies to its state-run companies. Denying the exports or revoking deals for countries whose policies it does not agree with,” he said.“Countries across the region want this behaviour to change – we do too,” he added.He added that Washington was “determined to ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea”, and said Beijing's actions there threaten the movement of more than $3 trillion worth of commerce every year.China claims almost all of the resource-rich sea, with competing claims from four Southeast Asian states as well as Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-out-at-china-s-moves-in-indo-pacific-seeks-allies-in-asia-101639453106122.html
14-12-2021||World||Since last December, 199 million new Covid cases, 3.4 million deaths logged globally||In the span of one year, about 199 million people have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) globally, with more than 3.4 million succumbing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The coronavirus pandemic has not subsided even as vaccines have become widely available and the infectious disease protocols more ingrained in everyday life.Omicron, a new variant of SARS-Cov-2, said to be even more infectious than Delta, the key driver behind the second and third waves of the pandemic, has recently escalated concern among countries and experts. Omicron is inherently capable of undergoing frequent mutations that need extensive studies yet.According to the updates provided weekly by the WHO there were more than 70 million Covid-19 cases and almost 1.6 million deaths reported globally, on December 13, 2020.A year later, the coronavirus tracker of the international public health body on December 14, 2021, shows that 269 million Covid-19 cases and five million related deaths have so far been reported.“Globally, as of 4:51pm CET, 13 December 2021, there have been 269,468,311 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 5,304,248 deaths, reported to WHO,” the UN agency noted on its dashboard.“As of 12 December 2021, a total of 8,200,642,671 vaccine doses have been administered,” it said.Around this time in December last year, the Americas and Europe were the regions primarily shouldering the burden of the pandemic.According to the WHO epidemiological report of December 13, 2020, the continents combined accounted for 85 per cent of all new Covid-19 cases and 86 per cent of new deaths that week.The African and the Western-Pacific region also showed a renewed rise in cases during November and December and the number of hospitalisations and fatalities in Southeast Asia declined following a peak in September.The five countries reporting the highest number of cases globally that week were the United States, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Russia, with the rising infections being partly attributed to the selective reopening of economies and the approaching holiday season.In India, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan were then among some of the most affected areas by the coronavirus pandemic.The world was, of course, much less equipped to deal with the pandemic as it is now. The first vaccine against Covid-19 was administered on December 9, 2020, marking what the then UK health secretary Matt Hancock called “the start of the fightback against our common enemy, the coronavirus.”Since then, leading pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson have partnered up with researchers to churn out millions of vaccine doses and world governments have distributed them throughout the globe.As of this day, 8.47 billion doses of Covid‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies.Countries have also selectively reopened their economies, with ‘vaccine passports’ put in place in certain jurisdictions as part of efforts to control the spread of the infectious disease. According to data issued by public health authorities, around 56 per cent of the world population presently remains vaccinated with both doses of the shot.However, it is also true that the threat of the pandemic continues to linger, with countries now instituting booster doses to replenish the waning immunity delivered by the Covid-19 shots.The Americas and Europe continue to add more Covid-19 cases, with the continents collectively reporting around 98 million and 91 million confirmed infections, respectively. Southeast Asia, with its 44 million cases, is close behind, amid fears of emergent strains of the virus.Amid all this, WHO recommends strict adherence to all necessary pandemic-related protocols.The following are the norms that need to be followed:• Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.• Keep a physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.• Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.• Clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.• Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly.• If you develop symptoms or test positive for Covid-19, self-isolate until you recover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/since-last-december-199-million-new-covid-cases-3-4-million-deaths-logged-globally-101639447885454.html

Since then, warnings have been issued by several national cybersecurity agencies, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Germany's federal cybersecurity watchdog, the BSI.Also read | Log4j vulnerability sends cyber defenders scrambling“To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk,” CISA director Jen Easterly said in a statement Friday. “We are taking urgent action to drive mitigation of this vulnerability and detect any associated threat activity,” Easterly said.She added vendors “must immediately identify, mitigate, and patch the wide array of products using this software.”What is Log4j?Log4j is open-source software maintained by a group of volunteer programmers as part of the nonprofit Apache Software Foundation and is a key Java-logging framework. Through Log4j, which security experts said is used by millions of applications, that developers can put into applications to monitor, or 'log’, which can help programmers debug software.Also read | SolarWinds hack: US weighs ‘seen and unseen’ responses to major cyber attackApache noted in its security advisory the issue was first publicly disclosed by a security researcher working for Chinese technology company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The flaw in the Log4j software could allow hackers unfettered access to computer systems. Reports have said the initial exploitation was spotted on December 2, before a patch rolled out a few days later. While a partial fix for the vulnerability was released on Friday by Apache, the maker of Log4j.What are companies doing to fix software exploit?Major global companies, including Microsoft Corp and Cisco Inc, are facing pressure to fix what experts are calling one of the most serious software flaws in recent memory. Microsoft and Cisco have published advisories about the flaw, and software developers released a fix late last week. VMware has also released patches for its affected products respectively. Also read | 4,000 cyber-attacks on India’s Botanical Survey website in 2 monthsOracle has issued a patch for the flaw, too. "Due to the severity of this vulnerability and the publication of exploit code on various sites, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible," it said. AWS, which has detailed how the flaw impacts its services, said it is working on patching its services that use Log4j and has released mitigations for services like CloudFront.     IBM, which has confirmed Websphere 8.5 and 9.0 are vulnerable, said it is "actively responding" to the Log4j vulnerability across its infrastructure and its products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/log4j-vulnerability-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-software-bug-101639442698904.html
14-12-2021||World||Log4j vulnerability sends cyber defenders scrambling||A newly discovered vulnerability in a widely used software library is causing mayhem on the internet, forcing cyber defenders to scramble as hackers rush to exploit the weakness.The vulnerability, known as Log4j, comes from a popular open source product that helps software developers track changes in applications that they build. It is so popular and embedded across many companies' programs that security executives expect widespread abuse."The Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution Vulnerability is the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade," said Amit Yoran, chief executive of Tenable, a network security firm, and the founding director of the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team.The US government sent a warning to the private sector about the Log4j vulnerability and the looming risk it poses on Friday.In a conference call on Monday, the leader of CISA said it was one of the worst vulnerabilities seen in many years. She urged companies to have staff working through the holidays to battle those using new methods to exploit the flaw.Much of the software affected by Log4j, which bears names like Hadoop or Solr, may be unfamiliar to the public at large. But as with the SolarWinds program at the center of a massive Russian espionage operation last year, the ubiquity of these workhorse programs makes them ideal jumping-off points for digital intruders.Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, principal threat researcher with cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, called it "one of those nightmare vulnerabilities that there’s pretty much no way to prepare for."While a partial fix for the vulnerability was released on Friday by Apache, the maker of Log4j, affected companies and cyber defenders will need time to locate the vulnerable software and properly implement patches. Log4j itself is maintained by a few volunteers, security experts said.In practice, the flaw allows an outsider to enter active code into the record-keeping process. That code then tells the server hosting the software to execute a command giving the hacker control.The issue was first publicly disclosed by a security researcher working for Chinese technology company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Apache noted in its security advisory.It is now apparent that initial exploitation was spotted Dec. 2, before a patch rolled out a few days later. The attacks became much more widespread as people playing Minecraft used it to take control of servers and spread the word in gaming chats.So far no major disruptive cyber incidents have been publicly documented as a result of the vulnerability, but researchers are seeing an alarming uptick in hacking groups trying to take advantage of the bug for espionage."We also expect to see this vulnerability in everyone’s supply chain," said Chris Evans, chief information security officer at HackerOne.Multiple botnets, or groups of computers controlled by criminals, were also exploiting the flaw in a bid to add more captive machines, experts tracking the developments said.What many experts now fear is that the bug could be used to deploy malware that either destroys data or encrypts it, like what was used against U.S. pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline in May which led to shortages of gasoline in some parts of the United States.Guerrero-Saade said his firm had already seen Chinese hacking groups moving to take advantage of the vulnerability.US cybersecurity firms Mandiant and Crowdstrike also said they found sophisticated hacking groups leveraging the bug to breach targets. Mandiant described those hackers as "Chinese government actors" in an email to Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/log4j-vulnerability-sends-cyber-defenders-scrambling-101639440064386.html
14-12-2021||World||Canada could see uptick in Covid cases as Omicron spreads: Report||COVID-19 cases in Canada may rapidly rise in the coming days due to community spread of the Omicron variant, mirroring the situation in the country's most populous province of Ontario, Canada's top health official said on Monday.The surge of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, which accounts for almost 40% of Canada's population of 39 million people, has prompted the provincial government to suspend easing of restrictions that were planned to be lifted ahead of the holiday season.The province reported 1,536 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, a more-than 70% jump from a week ago, including 80 cases of the Omicron variant, which has spread across over 60 countries since being first detected last month.The World Health Organization has said that the Omicron variant poses a "very high" global risk, with some evidence that it evades vaccine protection, but clinical data on its severity is limited.At least one patient has died in Britain after contracting Omicron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.Ontario has directed government staff, who started gradually returning to their offices in November, to go back to working from home at least until early-February, CTV news reported Monday.Provincial capital Toronto, which employs about 25% of the city's workforce, said its staff would continue to work remotely in accordance with new guidance from health officials.Toronto-based Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third-largest lender, also decided to pause an earlier plan for employees working remotely to return to its head office starting on Jan. 17.In the Ontarian city of Kingston, to the east of Toronto, authorities imposed restrictions to combat Omicron infections. In a temporary order on Monday, they said no more than five people could congregate, while restaurants must not allow indoor dining after 10 p.m."So what we're seeing in Ontario, I expect to be seen in other areas of the country, as has been seen in Europe and other areas of the world," chief public health officer Theresa Tam told a news conference."But for sure we are seeing community transmission, possibly in its early stages, but this can rapidly escalate in the days to come," she added, after announcing recommendations to improve the Canadian public health system in a report to the parliament.Canada needs to hire more health workers, improve technology and governance, as well as provide more stable funding, she said in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-see-uptick-in-covid-cases-as-omicron-spreads-report-101639438557350.html

A trait distinguishing Omicron from the dominant Delta variant suggests a much higher total, said the National Public Health Emergency Team."Using this methodology, we estimate that 11% of cases are now due to the Omicron variant, an increase from less than 1% only one week ago," Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said in a statement.Just over 90% of Ireland's eligible 3.9 million people over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated - one of the highest rates of protection in Europe - and it has administered a further 1.2 million booster doses.The government, which has shut nightclubs and placed limits on the capacity and opening hours of bars, restaurants and indoor events, has promised to speed up the booster campaign this week.It will also cut the gap between completion of the primary schedule of COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose to three months from five months, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said on Monday,While the number of COVID-19 infections have stabilised at near-record levels in recent weeks, the proportion of people testing positive is falling gradually, along with the numbers in hospital and in need of critical care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-says-omicron-accounts-for-11-of-its-covid-19-cases-101639437477929.html

Gavin Newsom’s administration announced the new mandate will start Wednesday and last until Jan. 15. The order comes as the per capita rate of new coronavirus cases in California has jumped 47% in the past two weeks.“We know people are tired and hungry for normalcy. Frankly, I am too,” California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Monday. “That said, this is a critical time where we have a tool that we know has worked and can work."California lifted its statewide mask mandate on June 15 for people who were vaccinated, a date Newsom heralded as the state's grand reopening. But since then, county governments covering about half of the state's population have imposed their own indoor mask mandates as case rates surged with new variants.The state's new mask mandate will cover everyone else, but state officials on Monday were unclear about whether it would be enforced. Ghaly said enforcement would likely be stronger in some places than others, but he urged Californians to heed the warnings and wear masks.“We know that t here's going to be people who don't necessarily agree with this, who are tired, who aren't going to mask,” Ghaly said. “We hope that those are few and far between, that most people see the purpose of doing this over the next month as something to protect them and their communities during a very tough time.”California also is tightening existing testing requirements by ordering unvaccinated people attending indoor events of 1,000 people or more to have a negative test within one or two days, depending on the type of test. The state also is recommending travelers who visit or return to California to get tested within five days of their arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-reinstates-statewide-mask-mandate-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-101639434247219.html
14-12-2021||World||Kentucky tornadoes: US to probe Amazon warehouse fatal collapse in Illinois||The US workplace safety watchdog is investigating the circumstances around the collapse during Friday night's storm of an Amazon.com Inc building in Illinois in which six workers died, an official at the U.S. Department of Labor said on Monday.The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has six months to complete its investigation, issue citations, and propose monetary penalties if violations of workplace safety and/or health regulations are found, Scott Allen, a US Department of Labor regional director for public affairs, said via email. He added that compliance officers have been on site since Saturday.Six workers were killed when the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, buckled under the force of a devastating storm, police said. A barrage of tornadoes ripped through six US states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km).Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said the company would cooperate with the investigation. "OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities and we are supporting them," she said.Responding to a reporter, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker said officials are investigating the condition of the warehouse before it gave way."Already there has been an effort to determine some of the challenges ... if there were any structural issues, what exactly the storm's trajectory was coming in and affecting the various pieces of the building," Pritzker said.Tornado timelineThe National Weather Service said a tornado hit the area around 8:30 p.m. CST on Friday, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse. Peak winds were estimated at 150 miles per hour (241 kph), causing severe damage.The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., Amazon said.Several employees told Reuters over the weekend that workers had been directed by Amazon managers to shelter in bathrooms after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities. At least one worker died there, according to his co-worker.Amazon said employees were directed to shelter in place at a designated assembly area at the front of the building, which was near a restroom.Some of the workers told Reuters they had mobile phones with them despite what they believed was an Amazon policy preventing them from having the phones in their possession while at work. Amazon said there was no policy preventing employees or contractors from having phones at work.Edwardsville, a city of 27,000, is about 18 miles northeast of St. Louis, Missouri.The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm, as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers.The site, a compound comprised of a few buildings, has been under heavy private and police security through the weekend, accessible only to relief teams and some Amazon and government officials. The remains of the destroyed warehouse were mostly dismantled, reduced to rubble.“It was crazy – I was on my way into the warehouse from Pontoon Beach (Illinois) when it happened. I saw the storm and was trying to get in as quickly as possible," said Brady Robison, 22, an Amazon van driver who works at the facility."I just saw the roof completely tilted up ... it’s messed up that people had to lose their lives while they were at work.”At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kentucky-tornadoes-us-to-probe-amazon-warehouse-fatal-collapse-in-illinois-101639434326230.html

14-12-2021||World||Thousands without water, heat after tornadoes kill more than 88 in US' Kentucky||Residents of Kentucky counties where tornadoes killed dozens of people could be without heat, water or electricity in frigid temperatures for weeks or longer, state officials warned Monday, as the toll of damage and deaths came into clearer focus in five states slammed by the swarm of twisters.Kentucky authorities said the sheer level of destruction was hindering their ability to tally the damage from Friday night's storms. At least 88 people — including 74 in Kentucky — were killed by the tornado outbreak that also destroyed a nursing home in Arkansas, heavily damaged an Amazon distribution center in Illinois and spread its deadly effects into Tennessee and Missouri.In Kentucky, as searches continued for those still missing, efforts also turned to repairing the power grid, sheltering those whose homes were destroyed and delivering drinking water and other supplies.“We’re not going to let any of our families go homeless," Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in announcing that lodges in state parks were being used to provide shelter.In Mayfield, one of the hardest hit towns, those who survived faced a high in the 50s and a low below freezing Monday without any utilities.“Our infrastructure is so damaged. We have no running water. Our water tower was lost. Our wastewater management was lost, and there’s no natural gas to the city. So we have nothing to rely on there,” Mayfield Mayor Kathy Stewart O’Nan said on ”CBS Mornings.” “So that is purely survival at this point for so many of our people.”Across the state, about 26,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, including nearly all of those in Mayfield. More than 10,000 homes and businesses have no water, and another 17,000 are under boil-water advisories, Kentucky Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett told reporters.Kentucky was the worst hit by far in the cluster of twisters across several states, remarkable because they came at a time of year when cold weather normally limits tornadoes. At least 74 people died in the state, Beshear said Monday, offering the first specific count of the dead.Still, Beshear warned that it could take days longer to pin down the full death toll, with door-to-door searches impossible in some places.“With this amount of damage and rubble, it may be a week or even more before we have a final count on the number of lost lives,” the governor said.Initially as many as 70 people were feared dead in the Mayfield Consumer Products candle factory, but the company said Sunday that eight deaths were confirmed and eight people remained missing, while more than 90 others had been located. Bob Ferguson, a spokesman for the company, said many employees gathered in a tornado shelter, then left the site and were hard to reach because phone service was out.Debris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted sheet metal, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows were blown out and roofs torn off the buildings that were still standing.Five twisters hit Kentucky in all, including one with an extraordinarily long path of about 200 miles (322 kilometers), authorities said.In addition to the deaths in Kentucky, the tornadoes also killed at least six people in Illinois, where the Amazon distribution center in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where the nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri.The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced Monday that it has opened an investigation into the collapse of the Amazon warehouse in Illinois.Amazon’s Kelly Nantel said the Illinois warehouse was “constructed consistent with code.” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said there would be an investigation into updating code “given serious change in climate that we are seeing across the country” that appears to factor into stronger tornadoes.Not far from Mayfield, 67 people spent Sunday night at a church serving as a shelter in Wingo, and 40 more were expected to arrive Monday. Organizers were working to find a mobile outdoor shower facility and a laundry truck, expecting many of the displaced to need a long-term place to stay. Volunteers were scrambling to meet more immediate needs, too, such as underwear and socks.Lifelong Mayfield resident Cynthia Gargis, 51, is staying with her daughter after the storm tore off the front of her apartment and sucked out almost everything inside. She came to the shelter to offer help and visit with friends who lost their homes.“I don’t know, I don’t see how we’ll ever get over this,” she said. “It won’t ever be the same.”Glynda Glover, 82, said she had no idea how long she would stay at the Wingo shelter: Her apartment is uninhabitable since the wind blew out the windows and covered her bed in glass and asphalt.“I’ll stay here until we get back to whatever normal is,” she said, “and I don’t know what normal is anymore.”On the outskirts of Dawson Springs, another town devastated by the storms, homes were reduced to rubble and trees toppled, littering the landscape for a span of at least a mile.“It looks like a bomb went off. It’s just completely destroyed in areas,” said Jack Whitfield Jr., the Hopkins County judge-executive.He estimated that more than 60% of the town, including hundreds of homes, was “beyond repair."“A full recovering is going to take years,” he said.Tim Morgan, a volunteer chaplain for the Hopkins County Sheriff’s Department, said he’s seen the aftermath of tornadoes and hurricanes before, but nothing like this.“Just absolute decimation. There is an entire hillside of houses that are 3 feet tall now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-without-water-heat-after-tornadoes-kill-more-than-88-in-us-kentucky-101639433024432.html
14-12-2021||World||US president Biden to tour tornado damaged Kentucky on Wednesday||President Joe Biden said Monday that he will travel to Kentucky on Wednesday to view damage from last week's devastating tornadoes that killed at dozens of people and displaced thousands more.Biden announced the upcoming trip following a briefing with homeland security and disaster response officials in the Oval Office to discuss what more the federal government can do to support those affected by the natural disaster. The White House said he would visit Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for a briefing on the response operations, and then to hard-hit Mayfield and Dawson Springs to survey the damage.Biden said he was developing the itinerary in consultation with local officials to ensure that his presence doesn't distract from the ongoing emergency response.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Biden is not expected to give a speech when he visits Kentucky, but will rather be focused on meeting with local officials and “trying to be a source of comfort to people who have gone through a devastating couple of days in their communities.”“That visit is really about him receiving an update of the work that’s happening on the ground, hearing directly from leaders on what they need more from the federal government, if anything, and he’s going to be very responsive to that,” she said.Biden, who has already signed emergency declarations for Kentucky, said he stands ready to do the same for Illinois. He added that he has ordered his administration to make every resource available to local and state officials in Kentucky and the other states impacted by the storms.The president said his message to governors was that the federal government would help them get “Whatever they need, when they need it.”“We’re going to get this done,” Biden added. “We’re going to be there as long as it takes to help.”Speaking on the Senate floor, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who hails from Kentucky, said, “This is the worst storm to hit Kentucky in my lifetime." McConnell said he'll travel “at the end of the week” back to Kentucky — an indication he would not be joining Biden’s trip Wednesday.McConnell earlier Monday thanked Biden in a tweet for his actions to help the state.“Thank you @POTUS for your rapid approval of Kentucky’s Major Disaster Declaration,” he said. “Our entire congressional delegation came together to support @GovAndyBeshear’s request. I appreciate the Administration’s quick work to speed resources to help deal with this crisis.”Biden said he was worried, beyond the lives lost, about the emotional toll the disaster is putting on all those impacted.“I worry quite frankly about the mental health of these people,” he said. He said his administration was working to help people gain “peace of mind” so that they can “actually put their head on a pillow, lie down and be able to know their kids are going to be okay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-tour-tornado-damaged-kentucky-on-wednesday-101639432816952.html
14-12-2021||World||US troops to go unpunished over deadly August Kabul drone strike||The Pentagon said Monday that no US troops or officials would face disciplinary action for a drone strike in Kabul in August that killed 10 Afghan civilians, including seven children.Spokesman John Kirby said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had received a high-level review of the strike which made no recommendation of accountability."He approved their recommendations," Kirby said. "The secretary is not... calling for additional accountability measures."The August 29 drone strike took place in the final days of the US-led evacuation of Kabul after the Taliban seized control of the country.US officials said they had intelligence of a possible Islamic State attack on the evacuation operations at Kabul airport, and launched a missile from a drone at a target that, in reality, was a family that included an Afghan man who worked for a US aid group.In early November an initial report carried out by the US Air Force inspector general, Lieutenant General Sami Said, called the strike tragic but "an honest mistake."The review by Central Command head General Kenneth McKenzie Jr. and Special Operations Command chief General Richard Clarke made use of Said's report and detailed recommendations on procedures for future drone strikes.But it made no call for anyone to be punished for the mistake."What we saw here was a breakdown in process, in execution and procedural events, not the result of negligence, not the result of misconduct, not the result of poor leadership," said Kirby.If Austin "believed . . . that accountability was warranted, he would certainly support those kinds of efforts," Kirby added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troops-to-go-unpunished-over-deadly-august-kabul-drone-strike-101639432468438.html
14-12-2021||World||Spyware firm NSO planning to shutdown Pegasus, sell company||NSO Group Ltd., the scandal-plagued spyware company that’s in danger of defaulting on its debts, is exploring options that include shutting its controversial Pegasus unit and selling the entire company, according to people familiar with the matter.Talks have been held with several investment funds about moves that include a refinancing or outright sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The company has brought in advisers from Moelis & Co. to assist, and lenders are getting advice from lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the people said.The prospective new owners include two American funds that have discussed taking control and closing Pegasus, one of the people said. Under that scenario, the funds would then inject about $200 million in fresh capital to turn the know-how behind Pegasus into strictly defensive cyber security services, and perhaps develop the Israeli company’s drone technology, one of the people said.A spokeswoman for Herzliya-based NSO declined to comment. A representative for New York-based Moelis said the company declined to comment. A representative for Willkie Farr didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Elements of the potential transaction were reported earlier by Debtwire.Pegasus software can track a user’s mobile phone, and its misuse has landed NSO at the center of high-profile privacy and human rights abuse cases. The product allegedly was supplied to governments that used it to spy on political dissidents, journalists and human right activists. Pegasus was also reported to have been used in recent months to hack the mobile phones of at least nine State Department employees. The company has said it sells the technology to law enforcement and government agencies to prevent crime and terrorism, and that it has ended contracts with clients that abused it. The US Commerce Department nevertheless blacklisted NSO, which said in November it was seeking to reverse the decision, “given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies.” Apple Inc. has sued NSO, seeking to bar the spyware firm from using its products and services, and said it would start notifying users targeted by state-sponsored hacking.The US restrictions put added pressure on NSO, which needs to pay back about $450 million in debt, just two years after a management buyout that valued the company at about $1 billion. Moody’s Investors Service said last month there’s an increasing risk the company will violate the terms of its loans.A loan with a face value of over $300 million that NSO issued in 2019 was trading in November at an all-time low bid of 70 cents on the dollar. It was quoted Monday at a bid of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the prices. A shutdown of Pegasus could leave NSO as a much smaller and potentially less valuable company, because the unit accounts for about half of NSO’s revenue. The company expects to record about $230 million in sales this year, one of the people said, 8% less than in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spyware-firm-nso-planning-to-shutdown-pegasus-sell-company-101639432229284.html
14-12-2021||World||George Floyd death: Chauvin expected to plead guilty||Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of the murder of George Floyd, plans to change his not guilty plea to separate civil rights charges, according to a court filing on Monday.Chauvin, 45, appears likely to change his plea from not guilty to guilty to the federal charges of violating the civil rights of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.A change of plea hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in US District Court in St Paul, Minnesota.Chauvin was sentenced in June to 22 and a half years in prison for Floyd's May 2020 death, which sparked protests against racial injustice and police brutality across the United States.Chauvin and three other police officers who were on the scene during Floyd's fatal arrest -- Tou Thao, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- were charged with violating his constitutional rights and failing to respond to his medical needs.All four pleaded not guilty to the federal charges. They are scheduled to go on trial next year.Chauvin, who is white, was captured on video kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes, until he fell unconscious and died.Keung and Lane helped to restrain the handcuffed Floyd, while Thao kept away bystanders who were pleading with the officers to get off of Floyd as he complained he was unable to breathe.A jury took less than 10 hours to convict Chauvin in April at the end of a high-profile trial. The verdict was greeted with relief by many Americans amid fears an acquittal could trigger further unrest.cl/sw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-chauvin-expected-to-plead-guilty-101639432036441.html

It would be the United States, China and Republic of Korea and North Korea. And I believe, in principle, everybody agrees to the declaration,” Moon said during a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison after bilateral talks in Canberra.Moon also said that the declaration should establish a peace regime in the Korean Peninsula and put an end to the “quite unstable” armistice, stressing that it was important to initiate talks between North and South Korea and between the US and North Korea.The Korean War de facto ended in 1953 after the US and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ratified an armistice without signing a peace treaty.Morrison and Moon also agreed to upgrade the formal ties between their nations to a “comprehensive strategic partnership”.The two countries signed a 1bn Australian dollars ($720mn) defence deal as Moon became the first foreign leader to visit Australia since the pandemic began.The deal will see South Korean defence company Hanwha provide the Australian army with artillery weapons, supply vehicles and radars.It’s the largest defence contract struck between Australia and an Asian nation, and comes at a time of heightened tensions between Australia and China.Moon rules out joining Beijing Olympic boycottSouth Korea’s president on Monday ruled out joining a US diplomatic boycott of February’s Beijing Winter Olympics, citing the need to work with China.Moon said he was “not considering” snubbing the Olympics to protest China’s human rights abuses, as several Western nations have done. “We have not received a request from any other country including the United States to participate in the diplomatic boycott,” he said.China has warned the US, Australia, Britain and Canada that they will “pay the price”.The boycott was prompted by China’s abuses against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang and its smothering of democracy in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-korean-war-agreed-to-in-principle-moon-101639420435917.html
14-12-2021||World||UK confirms 1st Omicron death; first case in China||Britain on Monday confirmed what is thought to be the first confirmed death after infection with the Omicron variant, as the country launched an ambitious Covid booster shot programme to stop the virus spiralling out of control. Meanwhile, the first case of the Omicron variant infection in China was detected in the northern city of Tianjin on Monday night, health authorities said.The infection was discovered in a traveller who arrived in the city from overseas on December 9, Chinese official media reported, adding that the patient is currently being treated in isolation in a city hospital.Separately, a sub-strain of the Covid-19 Delta variant has triggered a new cluster of cases in eastern China’s industrial powerhouse province of Zhejiang, causing many of the 190 cases in a week, locking down more than 500,000 residents and shutting down factories.Several infections diagnosed until Monday afternoon were of the Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4, prompting large-scale travel restrictions in the province, mass nucleic acid tests with more than 52,000 people sent to centralised isolation.Rush to get booster shots in the United KingdomLong lines formed at vaccination centres in Britain as people heeded the government’s call for all adults to get booster shots to protect against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.On a visit to a vaccination centre in west London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Omicron accounted for about 40% of the cases in the British capital, and hospital admissions were rising.“Sadly, at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron,” he told reporters, a day after warning that the country faces a “tidal wave” of infection.Scientists in South Africa, where Omicron was first identified, say they see signs the variant may cause less severe disease than Delta but cautioned it was too soon to be certain.Health authorities around the world are watching Britain closely to see what an Omicron surge looks like in a country with an older, more highly vaccinated population than South Africa’s.The British government raised the country’s official coronavirus threat level on Sunday, warning the rapid spread of Omicron “adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and health care services” at a time when Covid is already widespread.Denmark pushes third vaccine dose, Norway to tighten restrictionsDanish health authorities said on Monday a third dose of the vaccine would be offered sooner to everyone over 40 to curb the spread of the Omicron variant.Norway will further tighten restrictions in a bid to limit an expected surge of the Omicron variant, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told news agency NTB on Monday.Omicron poses ‘very high’ risk but data on severity limitedThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday said the Omicron variant, reported in more than 60 countries, poses a “very high” global risk, with some evidence that it evades vaccine protection but clinical data on its severity is limited.Considerable uncertainties surround Omicron, first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, whose mutations may lead to higher transmissibility and more cases of Covid-19 disease, the WHO said. “The overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high for a number of reasons,” it said, reiterating its first assessment made on November 29.Meanwhile South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has postponed getting a booster shot of a Covid-19 vaccine because he has tested positive for the disease and is recuperating from mild symptoms, his office announced on Monday.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-confirms-1st-omicron-death-first-case-in-china-101639420205021.html

The CDS’ shocking demise is likely to have implications for the ongoing military reforms, including theaterisation, and the government will have to move swiftly to announce a succession plan, officials said.Singh’s comments indicate that the current vacuum created by Rawat’s demise will not hit India’s theaterisation plans.Singh said the process of “integration and modernisation of the tri-services” was initiated with the creation of the post of CDS and the department of military affairs (DMA), and it will be carried forward to achieve the goals as early as possible.Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as the army chief for a full three-year term. He held the four-star rank for almost five years, making him the longest-serving four-star general in India.As the CDS, he wore multiple hats --- he was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), headed DMA, and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.In November, Rawat asked the three services to expedite their ongoing studies on the creation of theatre commands and submit comprehensive reports within six months. The deadline for submitting the reports was advanced from September 2022 to April 2022.The current theaterisation model to enhance tri-service synergy seeks to set up four integrated commands --- two land-centric theatres, an air defence command and a maritime theatre command.All eyes are now on who will be appointed as Rawat’s successor at a time when the theaterisation plan is at a critical juncture and needs a man with a vision to carry it forward. The next CDS has his work cut out for him.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane became the senior-most military officer in the country after Rawat’s demise. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him.There is a strong possibility of Naravane being named the new CDS if the government follows the seniority principle, the officials said. Army vice chief Lieutenant General CP Mohanty and Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi, who are both course mates, are the most senior officers in the army after General Naravane.Naravane is due for retirement next April but that may not happen in the changed circumstances, as previously reported. Many in the security establishment believe that the first two or three CDS appointments should be from the army as the security challenges the country faces are along the borders with China and Pakistan.However, making top appointments is the government’s prerogative. The possibility of deep selection cannot be ruled out as was done when Rawat was appointed army chief almost five years back. He superseded two top generals --- Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz.

The threat of the coronavirus pandemic and its new variant Omicron was taken into consideration before arriving at this decision,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Jagtap added that a call on fresh dates will be taken after the Omicron situation improves in Mumbai.A day ago, Jagtap had moved the Bombay high court against the Uddhav Thackeray government for not granting permission to the rally. In the petition, the Mumbai Congress chief had sought nod to use the park ground between December 22 and 28 for the meeting on the occasion of the 137th foundation day of the party. Congress is one of three constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra. Jagtap withdrew his plea unconditionally on Tuesday.Last week, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said the state administration needs to think about granting a nod to Gandhi's visit and rally in Mumbai amid the spread of the new strain.Meanwhile, eight more cases of Omicron were reported in Maharashtra on Tuesday, with Mumbai accounting for seven of them. With this, the cumulative tally of the Covid-19 variant in the state has risen to 28 - the highest in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-postpones-rahul-gandhi-s-proposed-dec-28-mumbai-rally-amid-omicron-spread-101639499870395.html

Japan, the only country on which nuclear bombs have been dropped, is a key member of the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). India seeks a waiver of NSG legislation to permit it to begin civilian nuclear with NSG nations.The nuclear issue is one of the main points on the Prime Minister's agenda during his visit, and his forceful exhortation in the Japanese Parliament seems to have ensured that Japan will announce its stand on Friday - the penultimate day of the PM's tour. "Like Japan, India sees nuclear power as a viable and clean energy source to meet its growing energy needs," Singh said in his address to the House of Representatives and House of Councillors. After stressing India's need for nuclear energy, he said: "We seek Japan's support in helping put in place innovative and forward-looking approaches of the international community."Singh then deviated from his pre-written speech to point out that "India's commitment to universal nuclear disarmament remains unshaken". The deviation seems to have been prompted by a remark of the Speaker of the lower house, Yohei Kono, asking India to "mutually cooperate to abolish nuclear weapons", and seems to have been aimed at pre-empting pressure from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting on Friday.Singh then deviated from his pre-written speech to point out that "India's commitment to universal nuclear disarmament remains unshaken". The deviation seems to have been prompted by a remark of the Speaker of the lower house, Yohei Kono, asking India to "mutually cooperate to abolish nuclear weapons", and seems to have been aimed at pre-empting pressure from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,with whom he is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting on Friday.Singh was warmly received in the Diet, and his speech was preceded with and succeeded by a standing ovation. Former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso and Minister for Economics, Trade and Industry Akira Amari were among those present. Singh's comments on India and Japan's shared values, their commitment to multi-polarity in world affairs and efforts to promote peace and stability in Asia and the world also drew applause.In his speech, Singh touched on terrorism, UN reforms and the need to enhance bilateral defence and economic cooperation. Describing terrorism as a common threat to peace and harmony in open societies, he said "We cannot prevail in the fight against terrorism unless we work together".Besides energy security, both countries have an equal stake in promoting defence cooperation, including for protection of sea-lanes to secure trade and energy flows, Singh said. He emphasised that economic relations must remain the bedrock of Indo-Japan relations. He said the two countries share many complementarities, which they are seeking to use to forge a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.The speech addressed all the issues articulated in the eight-fold Initiative for Japan-India Global Partnership that was announced when Koizumi visited India in April 2005. Some major announcements are expected on Friday after the delegation-level discussions. But the most important announcement is likely to be of Japan's stance on the nuclear issue, and indications are that it will be positive.Pointing out that the idea of a "new partnership" between India and Japan has "found its moment today", Singh said he was truly inspired by Japan's progress each time he visited this country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-dec-15-2006-pm-addresses-diet-seeks-nbacking-101639503076532.html

This would reach a total of ₹8.02 crore lakh crore if the amount earned in the last three fiscals from taxes is calculated.The excise duty or value added tax (VAT) on petrol was hiked from ₹19.48 per litre as on October 5, 2018, to ₹27.90 as on November 4, 2021. During the same period, the VAT on diesel rose from ₹15.33 per litre to ₹21.80, the finance minister said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha."The central excise duties, including cesses collected from petrol and diesel, during the last three years are - ₹2,10,282 crore in 2018-19; ₹2,19,750 crore in 2019-20 and ₹3,71,908 crore in 2020-21," Sitharaman informed Parliament.Also Read | Over 8.5 lakh Indians gave up citizenship in past 7 years till Sept 30: GovtBetween October 2018 and July 2019, the excise duty on both fuels, however, witnessed a dip.

The man was shot twice on the leg and has been hospitalised.The incident took place at Chamtilla area of Lakhipur assembly constituency in Cachar district at about 11am on Tuesday.Kulapradeep Bhattacharya, sub divisional police officer, Lakhipur, said the firing was reported by local residents who complained that some NSCN (IM) cadres tried to get them to pay up.“A 21-year-old resident named Gaimei Pao sustained severe leg injuries after NSCN (IM) members open fired. He has been rushed to a nearby tea garden hospital,” Bhattacharya said. Senior Cachar district police officers including superintendent of police Ramandeep Kaur rushed to the spot and spoke to local residents about the incident.The Chamtilla area where Tuesday morning’s firing was reported is located near Barak River along the Assam-Manipur border.Kulapradeep Bhattacharya said there are reports that these groups from Manipur attemp to come into Assam mostly to collect food. “We are investigating the reason behind today’s firing incident,” he said.NSCN-IM, which is known to extort money that it calls a ‘tax’, recently started raising its demands ahead of Christmas. Some residents on Tuesday opposed the higher ‘tax rate’. The shooting was aimed at scaring people into paying, a local resident said on condition of anonymity.Rajdeep Goala, a former legislator who lives in Lakhipur constituency, said, “Insurgent groups have been active from the Bhuvan Hill range to Dima Hasao border. Local traders are victims but they cannot oppose it because of security reasons.”Goala said there was a need to establish more camps of security forces along the border with Manipur to stop extortion and illegal trade.“There are areas along the border where illegal trade is possible and even drugs can be supplied from Manipur to Assam. In the past, there were camps of security forces but later those were withdrawn. We have written to the home department several times and requested them to open camps here. Today’s incident shows that our demand is legitimate,” Goala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-resident-shot-twice-by-nscn-im-near-manipur-border-hospitalised-police-101639497984427.html

He noted that he and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi had agreed earlier this year to “work closely on technology and the rules that will shape the coming age”.India and the UK are working together on many projects, including on 5G and telecoms, and Britain is working with the Tata Group and Godrej on green technologies that will power both countries to net zero, Johnson said. Technology is also a key part of the India-UK Roadmap for 2030 and the two sides will help shape a “new technological age based on the principles of freedom, openness and peace”, he added.Jaishankar described technology as a “double-edged sword” and said, “Democracies in particular are facing some unique challenges stemming from technology. “As we contemplate the future of technology, the role of innovation, the importance of sustainability and inclusion, and the needs to localise emerging technologies, it is also worthwhile to reflect on the difference that international partnerships make.” While technology has opened up new vistas of progress, it also helped create greater vulnerabilities and threats, he pointed out. “A recurring theme in global governance has been to find the right balance,” he said. In a globalised and technology-driven world, the mastering of key domains has become an expression of power and technology is now a “metric to measure a nation’s standing like never before”, Jaishankar said. With the growing importance of technology, it is important to ascertain whether the technology is “trusted, transparent, reliable and resilient”, he noted. “A country with the size of ours and with the potential and ambitions that we have, it cannot be that we do not have robust reliable national capacities, which are continuously upgraded,” Jaishankar said. “If you are open to a point where those capacities get hollowed out...it actually makes you a less effective player.”The number one purpose for technology partnerships for India is to increase capabilities, and at the same time, the country needs to continuously strengthen its domestic supply chains. “We cannot have economic growth without these strengths and without commensurate employment growth.

This was the first meeting. We'll meet again tomorrow. Sharad Pawar will also be there,” the Sena MP was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Regarding the Parliament logjam over suspension of 12 Rajya Sabha MPs and the government asking them to express regret over the matter, Raut said, “No apologies, no regrets, we will fight.”Abdullah said the meeting was about the country. “We talked about how we can work together and move forward and how we can take the country out of this difficulty. A good agreement has been formed among us,” he added.News agency PTI quoted sources as saying that the Congress chief had invited Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray and DMK’s MK Stalin. Both deputed their leaders, Raut and Baalu, respectively.Earlier in the day, opposition MPs in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha held a protest march from the Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex to Vijay Chowk with Rahul Gandhi alleging that the Opposition is not being allowed to raise issues in Parliament, which is now merely a building and a museum."Wherever the Opposition is trying to raise issues, they are suppressed. The government does not allow us to raise issues. This is the murder of democracy. We want to raise issues against the government, but we are not allowed to do so," he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-holds-meet-with-oppn-leaders-over-parl-strategy-pawar-raut-in-attendance-101639495967310.html

He also warned against a situation that might emerge when vaccines may become less effective to fight the virus.“There is a potential scenario that our vaccines may become ineffective in emerging situations. In the wake of the Omicron (in the last three weeks) we have seen how such doubts have come up,” he said.“Therefore, there is a need for us, and I think that is a scientific underpinning for which there must be attention and resources and focus, that we have to be sure about having vaccine platforms that are adaptable quickly,” he further said.“This is the possibility that we need to tweak for us to remain in the game, with changing nature of the variants remains valid. How soon can we create a vaccine which is using the same platform but is now targeted at the variant of the day,” he added. He made the remarks while addressing a summit by the industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).Also read | Maharashtra reports 8 new cases of Omicron. None had int'l travel historyFurther, he termed the global access to vaccines as a “core and fundamental” issue. “The foremost priority right now is to make sure that there is universal coverage of the vaccine and no one is left behind,” he said.He also said the production of vaccines to meet global demand was still possible. “We have 3.6 billion people who are still not vaccinated. I guess they need 7.2 billion doses (of the vaccine) together and at the current rate of production, it is well within our grasp,” he said.Noting that the development of drugs “will not go out of fashion” for the Covid-19 pandemic or the next potential pandemic, he said the pharmaceutical industry should press more towards developing drugs.“Drug development will not go out of fashion for the next viral epidemic or pandemic that we may face and of course the antimicrobial resistance challenge is also crying for drug solutions. We should examine how and in which way our drug industry/pharmaceutical industry can have a roadmap and thinking and risk-taking attitude to move towards developing drugs,” he said.Dr Paul said the previous pandemics could be localised because of the lack of travel a few decades ago but the current disease had a “devastating effect”. He also called upon the industry to invest more in science. He commented that the national investment in science in India was “all public money” and called upon the industry to create an ecosystem for more investments in science.The senior doctor said non-pharmaceutical interventions such as facemasks, social distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviours were critical in fighting the pandemic along with vaccines. “I think the emphasis on Covid-appropriate behaviour and such social interventions must also continue. Mask wearing has to become a habit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quickly-adaptable-vaccine-platforms-key-as-new-variants-emerge-niti-aayog-member-vk-paul-101639495815734.html

Kovind is scheduled to interact with Bangladeshi freedom fighters and a visiting team of Indian military veterans who fought in the 1971 war that led to the emergence of Bangladesh from erstwhile East Pakistan.Kovind, who will be accompanied by a delegation that includes Union minister of state for education Subhas Sarkar and MP Rajdeep Roy, will visit places of cultural and historical importance and interact with civil society and the Indian community, Shringla told a media briefing.The president’s first foreign trip since the Covid-19 outbreak “signifies the importance both countries attach to this visit”, Shringla said. The visit comes at a time when Bangladesh is celebrating the golden jubilee of its independence and the two sides are commemorating 50 years of diplomatic ties and the “great victory over the Pakistan Army and their unconditional surrender to our joint forces” on December 16, 1971, he noted.“Bangladesh is a central pillar of our Neighbourhood First policy. It is also a relationship where this policy intersects with elements of our Act East policy,” Shringla said.India was the second country to recognise Bangladesh as a nation even before the formal declaration of independence. A total of 1,660 Indian troops died in the campaign to liberate Bangladesh. Bangladesh is India’s largest trade partner in South Asia, and two-way trade grew by 14% despite the pandemic, going from $9.46 billion in 2019-20 to $10.78 billion in 2020-21.Kovind will start his visit on Wednesday by paying tribute at the National Martyrs Memorial. “The Pakistan Army in its genocidal campaign during the nine-month struggle for liberation killed three million people and committed horrific atrocities. The memorial honours those who died and suffered during this period,” Shringla said.The president will also visit the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation, before holding a delegation-level meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart. This will be followed by the meetings of the Bangladeshi prime minister and foreign minister with Kovind. The Bangladeshi president will host a banquet for Kovind on Wednesday.On December 16, Kovind will be the guest of honour at the Victory Day Parade at the national parade ground in Dhaka. A 122-member tri-services contingent from the Indian armed forces will participate in the parade. Kovind will also be the guest of honour at a Victory Day reception hosted by the Bangladesh president at the Parliament to mark the conclusion of Mujib Borsho or the year-long celebrations to mark the birth centenary of Mujibur Rahman.The last visit by an Indian president to Bangladesh was made in 2013 by the late Pranab Mukherjee. Shringla noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar had also visited Bangladesh this year.In response to a question on whether India’s controversial citizenship law and sectarian violence during this year’s Durga Puja in Bangladesh had impacted ties, Shringla said the relationship was currently going through a “golden chapter”.“Having visited the country just a short while ago, I would completely dispel any sense or any perception that there is any unease in the relationship...The relationship is an extraordinary one,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-kovind-to-visit-bangladesh-his-1st-foreign-trip-since-covid-19-outbreak-101639495585431.html

14-12-2021||India||Passengers from ‘at risk’ countries to 6 cities need Covid test booking from Dec 20||NEW DELHI: Passengers from over a dozen ‘at risk’ countries landing in India’s six metros after Sunday midnight should have booked RT-PCR tests before they take off, the ministry of civil aviation said on Tuesday. The new rule will apply to passengers to arriving in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata from December 20.The ministry has told aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to advise airlines to check that passengers have made the RT PCR test booking when they board the aircraft. According to new measures introduced at airports from 1 December, travellers from countries notified as ‘at risk’ have to follow additional measures on arrival in India, including post-arrival testing. The list of countries classified ‘at risk’ are South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Ghana, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Hong Kong, Israel and countries in Europe including the United Kingdom.The aviation ministry, however, underlined that passengers should be allowed to board the flights even if they haven’t booked the RT-PCR tests in advance but it will be the responsibility of the airline concerned to escort them to the registration counter for RT-PCR testing at the destination airport.“Air Suvidha portal will be modified to allow passengers to mandatorily pre book the RT-PCR test if they are coming from the countries ‘at risk’ or have visited ‘at risk; countries in the last 14 days. Link to the concerned airport website would be provided in the Air Suvidha platform which would be displayed to passengers while filling up the self declaration form (SDF),” read the civil aviation ministry order said. HT has reviewed the document.The document indicated that the requirement will be rolled out at other airports at a later stage. “To stabilise the system and to ensure that the passengers would not have any problem in pre- booking , payment etc, it may be implemented in six metro cities namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad in the first phase,” the order said.“In case any passenger is having any difficulty in pre- booking, they may not be denied boarding, but would be the responsibility of the airlines to identify and accompany such passengers to the registration counters at the airport for testing,” the ministry directive said.The aviation and health ministries have mandated contactless self-declaration at Air Suvidha Portal to minimise the risk of passengers infected with Covid-19, particularly the Omicron variant, entering the country.These passengers are mandated to declare their current health status prior to boarding on the Air Suvidha Portal along with the required documents (copy of Passport, PCR negative certificate from a test conducted within 72 hours of departure and their vaccination certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passengers-from-at-risk-countries-to-6-cities-need-covid-test-booking-from-dec-20-101639493423712.html

The West Bengal chief minister made the remarks while addressing a gathering in Goa where she is on a two-day visit ahead of the assembly polls in 2022.Maintaining her attack on the BJP, Banerjee said that she wants the party to "end in Goa" and also stressed on everyone coming together to defeat the ruling dispensation in the western state.“I didn't come to counter you, I don't want outsiders to control Goa…I also belong to a Brahmin family, I am a Brahmin. I don't need to take a character certificate from [the] BJP,” Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.She also took to her Twitter account and posted a small video in which she was seen chanting Hindu hymns. “I pray to God for my dear Goans and for the people of our beautiful country…Come, let us unitedly fight all divisive forces and usher in a New Dawn for Goa!” Banerjee tweeted along with the video.
14-12-2021||India||Armed forces get new anti-airfield weapon, counter-drone systems||In a needed push to self-reliance in India’s defence manufacturing sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday handed over to the armed forces locally developed military hardware including a smart air-launched weapon, anti-drone systems and an advanced radar countermeasure system, officials familiar with the development said.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) had developed the weapons and systems. Singh also handed over transfer of technology (ToT) agreements covering six systems, including the coastal surveillance radar, to seven public and private sector companies to bolster their defence manufacturing capabilities at an event organised in New Delhi as part of the ongoing country-wide celebrations to mark the 75th year of India’s celebration. This comes at a time when the government is encouraging self-reliance in the defence sector through a slew of policy decisions. The notable systems handed over to the armed forces include the smart anti-airfield weapon (SAAW) that can target enemy airfield assets such as radars, bunkers, taxiways and runways; and counter-drone systems to swiftly detect, intercept and destroy small drones that pose a security threat. SAAW has a range of 100 km. The anti-drone system would give the military both “soft kill” and “hard kill” options to tackle the new and fast-emerging aerial threats, the officials said. The first refers to jamming the hostile drone, while the second involves a laser-based kill system. The drone threat was highlighted by the June 27 attack targeting the Jammu air force station, the first-ever offensive use of drones to hit an Indian military facility. The steps taken by the government to boost indigenisation include increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) from 49% to 74%, notifying two lists of 209 weapons and systems that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware. Singh identified the development of a hypersonic cruise missile as a key focus area.Last year, India took the first steps towards developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence, with DRDO carrying out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time.Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-manoeuvring hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept. Mach 6 translates into a speed of 7,408kmph.India could develop hypersonic cruise missiles powered by air-breathing scramjet engines in about four years, the officials said. Such engines operate efficiently at hypersonic speeds and allow supersonic combustion.

14-12-2021||India||High court orders Odisha government to put off state film awards, review entries||BHUBANESWAR: The Orissa high court has ordered the state government to put off the film awards scheduled later this week after a movie director alleged that the organisers violated the rules and selected two movies that are remakes of a Korean and Punjabi movie.Justice Arindam Sinha on Monday stayed the 31st edition of Odisha film awards on a petition by Odia film director Bobby Islam who alleged that two films selected for the awards were ineligible under rule 3(b) in Orissa State Awards for Films Rules, 2010 that allows only original films to be considered.“The ceremony scheduled to be held tomorrow will stand postponed. State, through its concerned functionary, will re-evaluate all entries for awards. On such re-evaluation, the result will be made known to the petitioner and all concerned. In the event petitioner reports to this Court that his grievance has been taken care of or there is required adjudication, the ceremony will be held post order of disposal of the writ petition.” the court’s order on Monday said.A state government official said the awards ceremony was proposed for December 16 and 17.The film awards were announced last month.Two of them - ‘Khushi’ and ‘Golmal Love’ - named for awards in different categories were not original ones, Bobby Islam told the high court.“While Khushi is remake of 2013 South Korean film “Hope” directed by Lee Joon-ik, Gomaal Love is a copy of 2012 Punjabi film Carry On Jatta directed by Smeep Kang. Both films are carbon copies of the originals,” Bobby Islam said in his petition. He said the jury selected ‘Khushi’ for best actor, best actress, best editor and best child artiste while Golmaal Love was selected as best comedy movie.Like the Korean film ‘Hope’ in which the female protagonist, a young school girl named Hope, gets sexually abused by a male stranger and undergoes a major surgery, Khushi released in 2019, is based on the rape of a schoolgirl, Khushi, which leaves the survivor and her family completely shaken.Islam in his petition alleged that though his film ‘Chabirani’, was based on real-life events of 1980s and was an original, yet the jury selected two movies that werre in violation of the Orissa State Awards for Films Rules, 2010. His movie is based on the gangrape and murder of journalist Chhabirani Mohapatra in a riverbed of Jagatsinghpur district triggering a massive national outrage against the state’s JB Patnaik government.Last month, Islam and an actor of the movie ‘Chhabirani’ attempted suicide in front of Naveen Niwas to protest alleged favouritism in film awards.During the hearing, the state government said Islam’s movie contained immoral sexually explicit acts and had the potential of creating a furore if granted the award. “It could have spoilt the social harmony of the society as the so-called perpetrators of the story of the film belonged to a particular caste/community,” the state government’s reply said.The Odisha State Film Awards instituted in 1968 and given by state culture department has been dogged by controversies in the past.In 2017, noted film actress Mahesweta Ray questioned the choice of the jury to give her best supporting actor award for the movie ‘Dele Dhara Katha Sare’ saying her role in the movie ‘Chini’ was much more meaningful. “I believe that the role I played in Chini was more significant and robust than the other. There should be transparency in the selection procedure and lists of jury members for the last 15 years needs to be declared to understand the judging capability of the jury and bring some clarity about the basis on which the awards are decided,” said Ray.In 2015, questions were raised about the government asking former IAS officer Sanjeev Hota to head the jury though he hadn’t been associated with making films.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-orders-odisha-government-to-put-off-state-film-awards-review-entries-101639488075007.html

The 10 Rohingya, who belong to two related families, were arrested for entering India without valid documents and have been lodged in Tezpur jail in central Assam, which also lodges other foreigners, for several years. The petitioners, Saidur Rahman, his wife Tahara Begum and their three children, his brother Mahmad Ulla, his wife Rumana Begum and their three children, belong to Coundang village in Buthidaung of Myanmar’s Rakhine state. The petitioners had approached the high court in June 2017 seeking refugee status in India or deportation to Myanmar. The matter, which had come up for hearing six times, is being heard by the division bench of justices N Kotiswar Singh and Malasri Nandi. “It has been submitted that the present petitioners are admittedly citizens of Myanmar who have been convicted for entering this country without proper documentation, and had served out sentences imposed by the competent court, and have been languishing in jail for the last seven years,” the HC bench stated in its order earlier this month. “The plea of the petitioners is that either they be allowed to remain in India by granting refugee status or be deported to their country of origin, that is, Myanmar. However, the authorities are not taking any decision in this regard and the petitioners are languishing in jail,” the order said. Also Read: Facebook sued for $150 billion by Rohingya refugees over Myanmar violenceFollowing the court’s observation, Anita Verma, special counsel for foreigners’ tribunals in Assam, sought some time to take instructions on the course of action the state government may adopt for the petitioners. In another petition heard by the same bench this month, Azizul Haque, a Rohingya from Myanmar, and Mohammed Habib Ullah, whose nationality has yet to be ascertained, sought to be deported to Myanmar. They are both lodged in the Goalpara district jail.Both petitions have been listed for hearing on Thursday.According to the UN, there are over 16,000 registered Rohingya people - a Muslim minority in Buddhist-dominated Myanmar - currently in India who fled their country following multiple instances of violence. It is, however, estimated that the figure could be higher with many of them residing in India with any documentation.

The matter is under investigation,” an IndiGo spokesperson said.The baggage handler, also known as a loader, has been de-rostered by aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).“The cargo door was closed after the hold staff had marked the head count,” said Arun Kumar, director general, DGCA.The airline learnt of his presence in the aircraft only after the plane landed in Abu Dhabi about two hours later and and the cargo hold was opened.“A medical examination of this loader was conducted by Abu Dhabi authorities and examination revealed that he was physically stable. After getting the requisite clearances from local authorities at Abu Dhabi, he was sent back as a passenger to Mumbai on the return flight,” said Kumar.Mohan Ranganathan, aviation expert said the incident raises questions on not only the flight incharge of the airline, but also raises safety concerns. “If the airline would have taken head count of their employees before the aircraft’s doors closed, then they would have learnt about this absence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigo-baggage-handler-dozes-off-in-plane-s-cargo-area-reaches-abu-dhabi-101639481594636.html

They have been suspended now for two weeks. They are sitting outside. Their voices have been crushed. They have done nothing wrong,” Gandhi said during a protest march by Opposition leaders, who are demanding rollback of the suspension of the 12 Rajya Sabha lawmakers.Leaders from Opposition parties in both the Houses attended the protest march from Parliament to Vijay Chowk in New Delhi on Tuesday.Gandhi also criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government for passing Bills in the Houses of Parliament without discussion or debate. “This is not the way to run a democracy… It is an unfortunate killing of the democracy that is taking place,” he said. Also Read: Rahul taking Congress on new path with ‘India country of Hindus’ remark: SenaThe Congress leader accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu of not backing the country’s farmers.“A minister killed farmers.

These MPs were not suspended by the Rajya Sabha chairman or prime minister, but by the power that wants to steal the farmers’ income. The prime minister and the chairman are just implementers.”Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader Tiruchi Siva claimed that the Union government is behaving in a manner that is “undemocratic” and in “violation of all rules of procedure” of the Upper House.“On the day farm Bills were passed, the government flouted all the procedures on how Bills should be passed. The Bills were bulldozed, the motions were not put to vote, and the Opposition had no other way than to raise their voice and go to the well,” Siva claimed.He added that the Opposition wants Parliament to function smoothly and their only demand is the revocation of the suspension order.Rajya Sabha proceedings have been largely disrupted since the start of the winter session with Opposition MPs demanding revocation of the 12 lawmakers’ suspension. The MPs were suspended for the rest of the winter session for “unruly behaviour” during the previous session in July-August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-is-crushing-the-voices-of-the-people-claims-rahul-gandhi-101639478294543.html

14-12-2021||India||Ecostani | The farmer agitation may be over, but the politics has just begun||On December 11, protesting farmers started returning home from the Delhi borders --- Singhu, Gazipur and Tikri --- after a successful agitation against the three farm laws for 382 days. It was a year of grit and determination. These farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, showed to the country and the world that peaceful movements can win, provided the objectives are clear and there are no political overtones. But ironically, the end of the farm agitation does not mean the lack of political implications in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where assembly polls are scheduled for early next year. If anything, across these states, and across incumbent governments, there will be political repercussions, irrespective of the party in power.

The auction took place at the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC).Guwahati-based wholesaler Saurabh Tea Traders won the bid for the specialised tea branded as Manohari Gold and produced by Manohari Tea Estate in Assam’s Dibrugarh district.“This specialised tea is high in demand and production is very low,” said ML Maheshwari, CEO of Saurabh Tea Traders. “We were trying for long to procure this tea.

The authors of the study to be released in the capital on Tuesday by union minister for environment, forests and climate change and labour and employment, Bhupendra Yadav, most of the beedis are sold from microshops set up under trees and on pavements which will not be recognised by the municipalities or given licences. “Therefore, the entire sale of beedis will come to a grinding and abrupt halt. If the sale of beedis comes to a halt, then the entire beedi industry will come to a halt,” the study says.Also Read: How can female investors avoid being influenced by male investment patternsThe report further says that until skill building and alternative employment is provided on a large scale for their livelihood, beedi rolling “is the only viable occupation for millions of women across India”.Ashwani Mahajan of the SJM who has written the foreword of the report said, “We have been fighting for the rights of the workers since mid 1990s. When the excise duty on small cigarettes was reduced, machine made cigarette became cheaper and the employment of Beedi workers was affected. [When] we pleaded for the reversal, initially the government did not agree, [but] after we started the beedi rozgar rakshak aandolan, the then finance minister, Yashwant Sinha agreed to a gradual increase in the excise duty. Since then, we have been saying though the use of tobacco cannot be supported, there has to be an alternative means of livelihood provided to the 4.5 crore people who are dependant on the beedi industry, right from collecting of Tendu leaves to selling it.”The study also claims that beedis have 85% market share of all smoking products in India and the manufacturing process is highly labour-intensive. It says 96% of the total Beedi workers are home-based and only 4% work in factories, and a majority of the home-based workers (84%) are women.The study also claims there has been no allocation of funds for Beedi workers since 2017-18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cotpa-amendment-will-hit-women-in-beedi-industry-study-101639474094218.html

A decision regarding additional shots or booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be taken soon.The NTAGI and NEGVAC are the two expert bodies working in tandem to guide the National Covid-19 vaccination program. While the NTAGI examines technical aspects like usage of different varieties of Covid-19 vaccines, the interval between vaccine doses, contraindications, and the like, the NEGVAC, in turn, provides overall guidance and recommendations on all aspects of Covid-19 vaccination to the ministry of health and family welfare.The government also informed the Delhi high court that presently there are no guidelines for administering booster doses to those who are fully vaccinated, adding that the current priority is to cover the entire eligible population with both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.“It is humbly submitted that the current knowledge about the duration of immunity offered by Covid-19 vaccines in India is limited and will clearly be known over a period of time only,” the Centre said in an affidavit.It also told the bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh that since the biological characteristics of Covid-19 are not completely known, the appropriateness and necessity of a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine are yet to be decided.Earlier, the Delhi high court had asked the Centre to file a reply on the aspects relating to the booster disease of the Covid-19 vaccine.The court's remark had come in view of the growing advocacy of booster doses in the Western countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ntagi-reviewing-scientific-evidence-on-justification-of-covid-19-booster-doses-centre-to-delhi-hc-101639468103389.html

There is only one woman candidate in the fray and she is contesting from the Chickmagalur constituency.Experts have said the results will have a bearing on the power equation in the 75-member Upper House of the state legislature, where the ruling BJP wants to gain a majority.The BJP has said it is confident about winning maximum seats and needs to win at least 13 seats to secure a majority.

14-12-2021||India||Rahul taking Congress on new path with ‘India country of Hindus’ remark: Sena||Two days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that India is a country of “Hindus and not Hindutvawadis”, Shiv Sena has said that he was trying to take his party in a new direction. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that Gandhi’s wordplay on “Hindu” and “Hindutvawadi” showed that the party, which was stuck in “useless secularism”, has made an appeal to the majority Hindus after a long time.“This is a country of Hindus and not Hindutvavadis. Since 2014, it’s the Hindutvavadis who are in power, and not Hindus. We need to oust them and bring the rule of Hindus,” Gandhi said at a rally in Jaipur on December 12 to protest persistent inflation. It was not the first instance of Gandhi trying to suggest that Hindutva was a radical form of Hinduism. He had earlier attempted to draw a similar distinction while responding to the row over the controversial comparison between Hindutva and terrorist groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram, done in Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s latest book. “Rahul Gandhi has tried to give a new direction to the Congress, which was stuck in the useless secularism,” said Saamana, It further added that the presence of Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi in Jaipur has shown the way for the 2024 general elections.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who is also the executive editor of Saamana, said that Gandhi’s speech was a move in the right direction and that no one can move ahead by overlooking the Hindus in the country. “Even though the country belongs to everybody (to all religions), no one can overlook the majority Hindus and move ahead politically. I have had discussions over this [topic] many times with Rahul Gandhi. His speech in Jaipur meant that the soul of Congress was Hindu. The souls of several Congress leaders right from Mahatma Gandhi to Madan Mohan Malaviya and to Lokmanya Tilak was Hindu. I think Congress will move ahead in this direction now,” Raut told media persons in New Delhi.Also Read: Oppn leaders to hold march today to protest against suspension of 12 MPsThe Sena mouthpiece further slammed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying the “current rulers of Delhi do not match the Hindu culture” which is filled with “fake Hindutva as Uddhav Thackeray had said.” The editorial said, “When people say that ‘inflation has risen, living has become impossible, do something’, then a reply such as ‘Ram Mandir has been built and now the work on Mathura temple will begin’ does not fit in Hindu culture. The current government in Delhi does not match Hindu culture. As Uddhav Thackeray says it is filled it fake Hindutva.” As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP does not respond to remarks made in Saamana.The editorial argued that India was partitioned on the basis of religion in 1947 and since Muslims got Pakistan, “then what was wrong to think that the remaining Hindustan was for the Hindus?” It further said, “Since the beginning, Hindus got step-brotherly treatment in their own country in the name of secularism.”

14-12-2021||India||Agitation by resident doctors across India set to intensify||The agitation by resident doctors’ associations across the country is set to intensity this week with the threat of withdrawal from all services in government and civic hospitals looming if there is no resolution to their demand for immediately starting admissions to first-year of postgraduate medical courses. A stay on fresh PG admissions until January 6, ordered by the Supreme Court, stands in the way of the agitating doctors who plan to withdraw from all services if a quick solution is not found.“Multiple delays and postponement of admissions has resulted in no fresh intake of PG residents in 2021, despite the country facing one of the worst phases of the pandemic at the same time. Our agitation began with the nationwide withdrawal from outpatient department (OPD) services on December 9, but with no concrete measures taken by appropriate authorities, we will once again be forced to opt for withdrawal of all services in medical institutes,” read a letter addressed to the union health ministry, signed by the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) India.While several other resident doctor associations across the country started their strike on December 1, Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) started the withdrawal from OPD work on December 6 and also withdrew it on the same day following a meeting with state minister Aditya Thackeray.The agitating doctors have been complaining about the additional pressure during testing times on just two batches of resident doctors instead of three. “At a time when the country is witnessing the rise of a new Covid variant, the least that needs to be done is strengthening of the healthcare system and we need all hands on deck,” said one of the protesting doctors.NEET-PG 2021 exam which should have taken place in January was postponed to February first, then to April this year. It was then delayed indefinitely due to increasing cases of Covid-19 registered across the country.Also Read: Oppn leaders to hold march today to protest against suspension of 12 MPsThe entrance test was finally conducted in the month of September this year, but admissions post the exam has been stayed by the Supreme Court which is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of implementation of EWS (Economically Weaker Section) and OBC (Other Backward Castes) quota in all India quota (AIQ) seats.Thackeray assured the residents doctors in Maharashtra hospitals that the state will start pre-admission registration process for PG admissions soon. He also assured that he will request the Central government to push for the quashing of the stay on admissions. Last week, the union health ministry also approached the apex court requesting for this matter to be heard on an urgent basis.“The onus of any unfortunate incident due to withdrawal from services will be on the concerned authorities. We sincerely hope such a situation does not arise,” said a representative of FORDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitation-by-resident-doctors-across-india-set-to-intensify-101639465214486.html

Many of these are strategic feeder roads leading to the Indo-China border, according to officials familiar with the matter.The court was hearing the Centre's plea seeking modification of the September 8, 2020 order, which had asked the ministry of road transport and highways to follow the 2018 circular stipulating carriageway width of 5.5 metre on the ambitious Char Dham highway project, which goes up to the border with China.The defence ministry had urged the Supreme Court to modify the earlier order and allow the national highways from Rishikesh to Mana, from Rishikesh to Gangotri, and from Tanakpur to Pithoragarh to be developed to two-lane configuration.The Supreme Court noted that the recent past has thrown up serious challenges to security along the borders. “This court can't second-guess infrastructural needs of armed forces,” held the top court.The Supreme Court has, however, taken note of environmental concerns raised regarding the widening of the Char Dham highway project. An oversight committee, led by former Supreme Court judge AK Sikri, has been constituted to ensure that all remedial measures are taken in the interest of the environment and that the relevant recommendation of the high-powered committee is implemented while going ahead with the project.While modifying the September 8, 2020 order allowing only 5.5-metre-wide width for the Char Dham roads, the Supreme Court noted on Tuesday that the ministry of road transport and highways circulars do not forbid the double-laning of roads in hilly and mountainous terrains if they are of strategic and border importance. The judiciary cannot interfere either in defence requirements, the court added.The oversight committee shall receive all support from the defence ministry, the road transport ministry, the Uttarakhand government and all concerned district magistrates.The strategic 900km-long Char Dham project, worth ₹12,000 crore, aims to provide all-weather connectivity to four sacred towns in Uttarakhand – Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-centre-to-widen-char-dham-roads-in-view-of-security-concerns-at-indo-china-border-101639460039801.html

Post-mortem revealed that the pachyderms died due to “suspected poisoning”, forest officials said on Monday, adding that cases have been lodged under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The latest incident took the figure of elephant deaths in Assam this year to 70. As per official figures, while 24 of these deaths were due to the natural causes, three were due to electrocution, another three because of poisoning, four in train accidents, one due to injury, 18 due to lightning and 17 because of “unknown” causes. The elephant deaths show just one side of the human-elephant conflict which Assam witnesses every year, peaking in the winter when the tuskers leave forests in search of food. This year, 60 persons have been killed in the state by elephants till date, as per the forest department. “It is true that human-elephants conflict is on the rise in Assam and it causes lot of deaths on both sides every year. We have been urging public not to get into confrontation with elephants, and assuring them of adequate compensation for damages. But people don’t listen,” said Assam forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya. The minister highlighted last week’s incident when a two-year-old was killed and her mother was injured when forest staff fired shots to disperse a herd of wild elephants in Kamrup district. On Sunday, two forest guards involved in the incident were arrested for “accidental firing”. “Besides spreading awareness, we have increased compensation for human deaths due to elephant attacks from ₹1 lakh to ₹4 lakh. Damages to crop and houses are also compensated within weeks. Measures have been taken to reduce elephant deaths due to train hits. But more needs to be done,” said Suklabaidya. As per the forest department, in the past three years, several measures like constitution of anti-depredation squads, erection of solar-powered electric fences to prevent pachyderms from moving towards human habitations and intensive patrolling to monitor elephants’ movement have been undertaken to reduce human-elephant conflicts. Likewise, setting up of cordination committees comprising forest officials, railway authorities and local people in areas near animal corridors and monitoring of vulnerable sections of railways tracks is also done to stop the deaths of elephants due to train hits. But wildlife experts feel these measures are neither adequate nor implemented properly for a permanent solution to the annual human, elephant deaths in the state, which sometimes overtake the number of casualties due to floods, which plague Assam every year. “Elephants are national heritage, but while a lot of attention is given towards rhino conservation, similar focus seems lacking towards saving lives of elephants and also of humans. It’s an annual tragedy,” said Bibhab Talukdar, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Aaranyak, a Guwahati-based wildlife non governmental organisation (NGO). “Immediate and doable things like mass awareness, immediate and reasonable compensation for damages, proper coordination between forest and railways officials and adequate facilities to village defence personnel to monitor movement of elephants should be undertaken,” he added. Also Read: Rose-ringed parakeets crammed in nylon bag rescued in Lucknow, one arrestedRuling Bharatiya Janata Party legislator, Padma Hazarika, who is also an expert elephant trapper and trainer, said instead of short-term measures, the government should take long term initiatives to bring down the number of human-elephant deaths in Assam. “Elephants come out of forests during winter months in search of food. Trees which elephants feed on should be planted in protected forests. Instead of trying to disperse elephant herds by using firecrackers or firing shots in air, mahouts and domestic elephants should be used to address the issue,” he said. “Notified elephant corridors should be cleared of encroachments and addition of more areas to protected forests like Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) should also be done. I have raised this issue in assembly as well. We need to do more to address it,” said Hazarika. According to union forest and environment ministry figures, between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2020, a total of 129 elephants died due to electrocution, 62 due to train hits and 32 due to poisoning in Assam.

14-12-2021||India||MEA warning letter over Khalistan is fake, say officials||A letter being shared on social media platforms about a warning by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) against anti-India activities and propaganda of Khalistani extremists around the world is fake, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Officials mentioned above said the letter, reportedly issued on November 8 and was being shared on several social media platforms, was never issued. The alleged letter talked about measures to counter the threat posed by Sikh extremists.Security agencies suspect the involvement of the Pakistani deep state in generating the letter as Pakistan has been fishing in troubled waters during the farmers' agitation through pro-Khalistan elements.Last month, reports said an alert was issued after an intelligence input said banned terrorist organisation Sikh for Justice (SFJ) can gherao the Parliament House and hoist the Khalistan flag on it.Intelligence agencies asked authorities, including the Delhi Police, to remain on alert and make elaborate security arrangements around Parliament.This came after the Sikh for Justice’s Gurpatwant Singh Pannu released a video on YouTube, appealing to farmers to gherao Parliament and hoist the Khalistani flag during the Winter Session of Parliament.Pannu has said in the video that the one who hoists the flag of Khalistan on the Parliament will be given a reward of $125,000.In October, US-based Sikhs for Justice organised a so-called referendum to decide whether Khalistan should be carved out of Punjab. The SFJ called all Sikhs above the age of 18 to vote in the referendum held in Westminster.London-based diplomats said while none of the gurdwaras, except the three known Khalistan movement supporters, allowed the organisers a platform. Reports said those who did come to vote were a select group of Khalistanis and those with no particular leanings and were lured to the polling booths on some pretext or the other.On November 15, the UK police raided the office of Sikhs for Justice located in Hounslow. The Metropolitan Police took away all electronic devices and documents pertaining to the so-called referendum held by the SFJ.Reports said SFJ members were using electronic devices to create fake Identity cards and documents pertaining to bogus voters in order to push up the voting numbers during the referendum.

14-12-2021||India||Delhiwale: The Def Col secret||One doesn’t always want to stumble upon the past. After all, there is so much contemporary stuff to handle. But Delhi is littered with souvenirs from yesterday. And this miniature time capsule in south Delhi’s Defence Colony market is too delightful to be ignored.To a certain generation that came of age in the 1960s and 70s, this corner place might bring many emotions. During those times, many neighbourhoods in the city would have at least one lending library from where to borrow a novel at a very affordable rate.Today, such libraries have become history. But 3L Library (full name: Love, Laugh and Learn) is trudging along. Stepping into it is like entering a bygone decade. You rarely see people reading the kind of novels that are stacked in the shelves here. One wall is devoted to Mills and Boon romance novels. Enid Blyton paperbacks - so popular with pre-millennial era kids - are occupying another section of prominence. There are Archie comics, too, along with rows of Danielle Steel’s sentimental novels. Also spotted: Louis L’Amour, the writer of western novels.And this is just half the story.The library stores hundreds of old issues of foreign glossies such as (British) Vogue, Esquire, Elle, Architecture Digest, GQ and Hello! You must flip through the stacks of Hello! - every cover either has Princess Diana, or her sons, or their wives, or Princess Diana’s little grandchildren.The library was founded by Rajinder Kumar Sekhri in 1965. In his 80s now, he prefers to remain at his home in Vikram Vihar due to pandemic-related concerns, according to the gracious Surman Singh Rawat, who has been managing this landmark for 35 years.He says most of the collection belongs to the owner. “There was a time when we had 5,000 members, but now we are left with only 200-300.” The pandemic has further hurt the business, he says, shaking his head.In some ways, this place isn’t exceptional. The Defence Colony market has a fair share of long-time landmarks, such as Defence Store, Malik Store, Aka Saka restaurant, Moets restaurant, Quick Electronics, Mahindra Electricals, Commercial Dry Cleaners, Broadway Dry Cleaners and Bansal Stores.Even so, 3L stands out most elegantly in this esteemed crowd. Because, well, it is the only place in the entire market devoted to books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-def-col-secret-101639430238590.html
14-12-2021||India||BJP leader shot in MP by Bajrang Dal man, dies||A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, who was shot following an argument at a marriage function over a discourse of jailed self-styled godman Rampal being shown on an LCD screen in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur district, died on Monday, police said.According to the police, the incident in Bhainsoda village of the district, some 150km from Mandsaur district headquarters, took place on Sunday, and cases were registered against 11 persons, four of whom have now been arrested. Sunil Pandey, Mandsaur SP, said BJP leader Devilal Meena, who was a former sarpanch, was shot dead by Bajrang Dal leader, Shailendra Ojha, both residents of Bhainsoda village of the district.Rampal, who had an ashram in Haryana’s Hisar, was held in November, 2014 following allegations of murders in the premises and was later sentenced to life imprisonment without remission in 2018 for murder, wrongful confinement and criminal conspiracy. Rampal opposed the Hindu rituals and held a campaign to shun the ‘holy trinity’ of the Hindu pantheon — Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh. “Members of Rampal’s ashram had come to the village on invitation of Meena. Ojha, who is a regional president of Bajrang Dal, opposed it and asked Meena not to allow anti-Hindu activities in the village,” the SP said.“On Sunday, a large number of villagers opened fire and also attacked the attendees with rods and canes. Meena tried to stop them, but Ojha shot at him. Meena was rushed to a hospital in Kota where he died while undergoing treatment,” said Gopal Suryavanshi, town inspector of Bhanpura. “The main accused is still absconding.”

General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat, Lt Colonel Harjinder Singh and 10 others, all from the armed forces, were killed in the helicopter crash in Coonoor on December 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coonoor-residents-seek-memorial-at-chopper-crash-site-101639423091628.html
14-12-2021||India||Autonomy of universities: War of words between Kerala governor, state government intensifies||A war of words between Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and the state government on autonomy of state universities aggravated on Monday with the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its junior partner in government CPI saying Khan’s sudden outbursts remain a “mystery” to them. Both the parties said Khan was forced to come out against the Left Front government due to pressure from some quarters. Later, the Governor hit back at them saying they can call him a “Sanghi” or any other name but he will stick to what he said and no plan to take up the chancellor’s position, if universities were not given complete autonomy. Without naming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the left parties said the governor had a second thought after pressure from some quarters. “He approved a search committee and its findings and later signed appointment letters as well. Now, he has changed his stance all of a sudden. It is a mystery for us,” said CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. But he reiterated that the government has no plan to pursue a confrontationist line with the Governor. CPI general secretary Kanam Rajendran said by making a letter written to the CM public, the Governor crossed all limits. “It seems he’s after news. Legislature has right to set aside powers given to the Governor as chancellor. Hope he will not pressurise us to do this,” he said. The CPI mouthpiece “Janayugam” also carried a strong article against Khan. But the Governor reiterated his position. “They can call me any name but my intention is clear and there is no going back on it,” he said. He said the CM can assume the chancellor post and run varsities the way he wanted and he wouldn’t be a party to it. Khan said he was not a man to get pressurised or intimidated by anyone and people who knew him will understand this. The Governor had sent a strongly-worded letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Dec 8 in which he said he was really pained over “dipping standard” of higher education sector and blamed “brazen political interference” as reason for this. He also asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if political interference continued and he can’t bend further. On Sunday, though the chief minister asked the Governor not to take any precipitation action but the latter refused to budge. According to political observers, the real trigger (between Governor and government) was the reappointment of Prof Gopinath Raveendran as the vice-chancellor of Kannur University. He was reappointed for a period of four years in November after the government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee to select the new VC. The Governor also claimed that he was flooded with too many complaints about recurring political appointments in academic council and faculty. The appointment of the wife of CM’s political secretary, KK Ragesh, in a high position at Kannur University two months back had also kicked up a controversy. In April this year, the Kerala high court had quashed the appointment of CPI(M) legislator AN Shameer’s wife Shahala as the assistant professor in Kannur University. The opposition Congress and BJP asked the CM to drop higher education minister R Bindu from the cabinet. “She presided over everything and keeping quiet now,” said BJP state president K Surendran. “It is sheer misuse of power she can’t remain in the post,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. This is not the first time the Governor and government were crossing swords. During the Citizenship Amendment Act agitation, the Governor had questioned the resolution passed by the state assembly against the CAA and later opposed the government move to file a plea in the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/autonomy-of-universities-war-of-words-between-kerala-governor-state-government-intensifies-101639422910493.html
14-12-2021||India||Telangana police forms 2 special teams to trace missing armyman||Telangana police have deputed two special teams to trace the whereabouts of a 21-year-old army jawan who went missing while returning to his camp at Faridkot in Punjab on December 7 from his native village in Siddipet district, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Siddipet, M Srinivasulu said on Monday.Srinivasulu said that jawan Bukuri Sai Kiran Reddy, hailing from Pothareddypalli village of Cheryal block, had joined the Indian Army six months ago and undergone training at the Faridkot camp.After completing his training, Sai Kiran was given a 20-day break, and he visited his native village on November 16. He left for the Army camp on December 5 and was to report to his immediate superior, Captain Nikhil Sharma, on December 7, the police said.Based on the complaint lodged by the jawan’s father B Patel Reddy, the Siddipet police formed two special teams to track him down. “Based on our investigation, one team has left for Haryana and another for Punjab to know his whereabouts,” Srinivasulu said.On an intervening night, Sai Kiran boarded a 9 pm flight at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad in Hyderabad. Before boarding, he made a video call to his father at around 8 pm. On December 6, when Patel Reddy called his son in the afternoon, he found that it was switched off.“At around 8.30 am on December 7, Capt Nikhil Sharma called up Sai Kiran’s father and told him that his son had not reported to the duty. Based on Patel Reddy’s request, the Army authorities approached the Assistant Inspector General of police at New Delhi Airport to find out whether Sai Kiran boarded the flight,” Srinivasulu said.The airport police, who checked the CCTV footage, revealed that Sai Kiran got down at Terminal-2 of the airport and was seen leaving the airport around midnight. “Based on these inputs, Sai Kiran’s father complained with Cheryal police and an FIR was registered immediately,” the Additional DCP said.Further inquiries by the police revealed that Sai Kiran, along with another jawan Manish, boarded a train to Faridkot at Safdarjung railway station in Delhi on December 6 morning. “Both of them got down at Bhatinda in Punjab, but after that, Sai Kiran went missing. The last signals of his mobile phone were located at Jakhal Mandi town in Fatehabad district in Haryana on December 6 evening,” the police official said. The police is yet to determine whether Manish belonged to the same camp and if he is missing too, an official said. Enquiries with the villagers revealed no problems for Sai Kiran – either personal or family. “He voluntarily took up the job in Army and has always been very active. His father is a farmer and has no financial problems. Why he went missing is still a mystery,” Ajay Kumar, one of the villagers, said.State finance minister T Harish Rao, who represents the Siddipet assembly constituency, asked the police to take the issue seriously and intensify the search for the missing jawan.
14-12-2021||India||Probe against posts on late CDS Rawat’s death inconclusive so far, says Mangaluru police||A day after Bengaluru police arrested a 40-year-old man for allegedly posting a derogatory message about the death of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Facebook, Mangaluru police, which had also filed a similar case, on Monday said that their probe has been inconclusive so far.Mangaluru police on Saturday had booked a case against two Facebook users for uploading objectionable posts on social media about late General Bipin Rawat. CDS Rawat, along with 12 others, was killed in a fatal helicopter crash at Coonoor, Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. Even though the FIR had named two persons, police are not able to ascertain whether their Facebook accounts were real or fake.“We have booked a case under sections 505(1) (B) (with intent to incite, or which is likely to incite any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community) of the Indian Penal Code,” said Mangaluru city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar told the media. “We have not made any arrest so far in the case. We are still investigating these Facebook accounts, but so far, we have not been able to identify the second person,” he added. Mangaluru police commissioner clarified that the case has been registered against “two persons operating the Facebook accounts” and not against the persons named in the FIR. The officer said they are investigating whether these accounts are fake. Police are exercising caution since in a previous case the fake account was used to trap a person. An investigation by the Karnataka Police helped a man lodged in Saudi Arabia prison for over 600 days return home on August 15 this year. Thirty-four-year-old Harish Bangera, an air-conditioning technician, was arrested on charges of blasphemy, on December 22, 2019, for making contemptuous remarks about Mecca and the king of Saudi Arabia on Facebook. A subsequent investigation by Karnataka Police revealed that the derogatory messages were posted by a fake account created by two men - Abdul Huyez and Abdul Thuyez - in the Udupi district. Police arrested the two men in October 2020, who revealed that they impersonated Bangera on Facebook. Using the details of the investigation, Bangera’s family managed to get him released.Meanwhile, 40-year-old man Vasant Kumar who was arrested by Bengaluru police was sent to judicial custody on Monday. A native of Mysuru working, Kumar was working in a private hospital in Bengaluru as a lab technician.The arrests come after Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday issued a warning against commenting disrespectfully on CDS Rawat.“Offensive Tweets and Social Media posts about the tragic chopper crash in which we lost our #CDSGeneralBipinRawat will not be tolerated. I strongly condemn all such messages and have instructed our Police Officials to take strict disciplinary legal action against the offenders,” the chief minister tweeted. Talking to media on Friday, the chief minister said: “Some persons with perverted minds have tweeted derogative, celebratory messages about the death of Chief of Defence Staff Gen Rawat. The Police Chief has been instructed to take legal action against these elements.”Home minister Araga Jnanendra, too, issued a statement instructing the state police to take stern action against those who post derogatory remarks on social media on CDS Rawat’s demise. The minister had also spoken on the issue with the Karnataka police chief, Praveen Sood, and directed to take action. “We cannot tolerate such things, berating our brave officer, who had contributed his might immensely for the noble cause of our nation, and flutter our tricolour sky-high,” he said in a statement to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-against-posts-on-late-cds-rawat-s-death-inconclusive-so-far-says-mangaluru-police-101639422670024.html
14-12-2021||India||Govt may allow private labs to conduct genome sequencing||The government may allow private laboratories to conduct whole genome sequencing of Sars-Cov-2 positive samples to scale up testing facilities in the wake of the threat posed by the heavily mutated Omicron variant, people familiar with the development said.“There have been talks around it, but no final decision has been made yet on the issue,” a central government official said on condition of anonymity.There was mention of this in Parliament discussions in the ongoing winter session.“There are 36 laboratories for genome sequencing in the country currently. These laboratories can do whole genome sequencing of up to 30,000 positive samples, and the capacity is being increased with the help of private laboratories,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said last week while speaking on the Omicron variant during question hour on Friday.It would make sense to include private labs if the Centre intends to scale up genetic sequencing to detect mutations early, industry insiders said.“India is performing probably the lowest amount of genetic testing anywhere in the world. We are probably not doing (genome sequencing) of even 1% of the positive samples, whereas there are countries like Israel that are performing genome sequencing of all positive samples. Even the US is doing it for 20-30% of its positive samples. The next thing is to expand our genetic testing like we did for molecular testing,” said GSK Velu, chairman and managing director of Neuberg Diagnostics, one of the country’s largest diagnostic laboratories.
14-12-2021||India||Anti-conversion law in focus as House resumes in Karnataka||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government appears to be switching gears in the state assembly as ministers are set to propose laws on anti-conversion and ‘love jihad’ among others that suit the party’s core ideology with less than two years to go before the assembly polls in the state, leaders said. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the government would table a law that prevents forcible conversions in the winter session of the state legislature that commenced in Belagavi on Monday. “The Law Department is studying the proposed draft, and it would be introduced in the legislative session after clearance from the Law Department and the state cabinet,” Bommai said before the commencement of the session. “We are saying it from the beginning – We are committed to getting anti-cattle slaughter, anti-conversion laws. I will go one step further and say that in the coming days, we will introduce laws against Love Jihad,” V Sunil Kumar, Karnataka’s minister for energy, Kannada and culture, said on Monday. Kumar is a three-time legislator from Karkala, Udupi. “We are among those who grew up fighting these issues,” Kumar added. The statements come when the BJP has been pushing through contentious laws, which are core to its ideology and that of Sangh Parivaar, an umbrella term for right-wing organisations. The BJP high command has been trying to get its way in both the BS Yediyurappa and Bommai governments, which would help them fulfil goals in line with their ideology. Despite coming from the Janata Dal background, Bommai, who has been in the BJP for the last 13 years, has been pushing hard to help achieve right-wing goals, in line with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government, that would help seal his candidature as party’s chief ministerial candidate in 2023, people aware of the developments said. Yediyurappa, who was seen as a more secular face within the BJP, too, said that the law should be passed in the ongoing session. “There is a hope to bring this (anti-conversion law). Several other states have also brought this. For that the anti-conversion law should be brought and passed in this session,” Yediyurappa said. Since the proposal to bring in the anti-conversion law by the state government during the monsoon session between September 13 and 24, there has been a visible rise in the number of incidents related to moral policing, hate crimes and communally charged comments by several right-wing groups in the state, people aware of the developments said. The Christian community, especially, has alleged that there have been at least 40 incidents of such crimes against them across the state. According to the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), in their report titled ‘‘Christians Under Attack in India’, released on Sunday, there have been 305 incidents of violence in the 273 days of 2021 between January and September across the country. The report added that between January and September, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest monthly incidents with 66, followed by Chhattisgarh (47). Karnataka recorded 32 incidents, the report added. APCR said that a total of 1,362 calls were received by the United Christian Forum helpline. Belagavi, the host city for the winter session, has also witnessed incidents of crimes against minorities in the past few days, including an order by the police not to conduct prayers till the legislative session is complete. The order has since been withdrawn. “It is a political move. There was always a law against the forceful conversion of any religion or any community. But our Constitution says that it has given every citizen freedom to practice, prorogate he/she wants,” Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of Opposition, said on Monday. He added that the law proposed by the Bommai government ‘violates the provisions of the Constitution. “If there is forceful conversion, let them take action. But, where is the necessity to bring again the anti-conversion law? It is only targeting a particular community and religion,” Siddarmaiah said, adding that Congress will oppose the Bill in the House. “This law will encourage moral policing. Hinduism is strong in the country.

The High Grounds police had registered a case on December 5 under relevant sections of IPC and the provisions of the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020, after the government claimed the patient left the country, evading authorities, using a fake certificate.Senior police officials said while the employees of the lab located on Airport Road were arrested for creating the fake Covid negative certificates, the employees were arrested for facilitating the same on behalf of the South African national.“We have taken four people into custody, and we are investigating further,” said MN Anucheth, deputy commissioner of police, central. “We are investigating if they are part of a larger racket issuing fake certificates.”The 66-year-old had reached Bengaluru on November 20 and tested positive on arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakafour-held-for-helping-omicron-patient-leave-country-issuing-fake-report-101639422610021.html
14-12-2021||India||Two new Omicron cases in Maharashtra, India’s tally at 40||Two new Omicron cases were reported in Maharashtra on Monday, taking the state’s tally for the new variant of coronavirus to 20, the health department said, adding both patients were asymptomatic.With the new cases, India’s total tally of the new variant reached 40. The two cases were reported from Pune and Latur districts; both were fully vaccinated and had recently travelled to Dubai, the state health department said. The infected person from Pune has been identified as a 39-year-old woman, while the one who tested positive for Omicron in Latur is a 33-year-old man. Both the patients are asymptomatic and have been moved to isolation facilities in their respective districts, the health department said, adding they had returned from Dubai in the first week of December.The administration tested three close contacts each of the two infected persons and all have tested negative for Covid-19.So far, nine of the 20 Omicron variant cases have been discharged after testing negative for Covid-19. The state’s tally for Omicron, with the two new cases, jumped to 20, of which 10 cases were reported in Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporation area, followed by five in Mumbai, Pune (2), Kalyan-Dombivli (1), Nagpur (1) and Latur (1), the health department said.Between December 1 and Monday morning, 85,078 passengers, including 12,996 from ‘at risk’ countries, have arrived at international airports in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. The administration has detected 32 Covid-19 cases, including 24 from ‘at risk’ countries.Additionally, field surveillance of all international passengers who have arrived since November 1 is underway. Through airport and field surveillance, 107 samples have been sent for genome sequencing so far and results of 20 are awaited, the health department said.Maharashtra, meanwhile, added 569 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s tally to 6,644,452. The state also added five deaths, taking the toll to 141,264, the health department said on Monday, adding the active case count in the state stood at 6,507.Mumbai reported 160 new Covid-19 cases and two deaths, taking its tally to 765,442 and toll to 16,359. The active cases in Mumbai stood at 1,751, the health department said.Ahmednagar added 49 cases, while Pune district added 132 cases.
14-12-2021||India||Requests for aid exceeding Covid toll, cleared most: Gujarat to Supreme Court||Gujarat told the Supreme Court on Monday that it received 22,557 applications for Covid-19 ex-gratia compensation and sanctioned payment in 16, 175 cases, far higher than the official virus death tally in the state that stood at 10,099.The development came during a hearing in the top court, where judges directed Gujarat and Maharashtra to expedite the process of paying compensation, and noted the anguish of the common man who was made to wait to receive an amount of ₹50,000 as a one-time solatium. The top court had, on October 4, ruled that the money be given to the beneficiaries after due publicity.“Till date, 22,557 applications have been received for payment of ex-gratia compensation, out of which sanction order has been passed for 16,175 cases. Out of the 16,175 cases which have been sanctioned, direct benefit transfer (DBT) has been done for 14,215 cases,” said an affidavit dated December 9, filed by the commissioner of relief, Gujarat.As of Monday, Gujarat’s official Covid-19 death toll was 10,099.The one-time compensation is being disbursed according to the Supreme Court’s orders on June 30 and October 4, which detailed guidelines for disbursal of compensation. These norms are more accommodating than the stricter standards to determine Covid-19 deaths adopted by govenment-appointed death audit committees.The SC norms said that deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of being tested will be treated as Covid-19 deaths, as will those cases where the patient was admitted for more than 30 days in hospital and died subsequently. Moreover, even in cases where the death certificate didn’t mention Covid-19 as the cause of death will also be considered for compensation, provided the next of kin fulfilled other criteria.In contrast, death audit committees -- which were set up by many governments, including Gujarat -- didn’t consider deaths that occurred 30 days from the day of testing, and the reason of death in many death certificates wasn’t mentioned as Covid-19 if the patient had co-morbid conditions.These distinctions might have resulted in more compensation applications than deaths counted previously, as people excluded by the more conservative norms became eligible to claim payment under the ex-gratia guidelines, said experts.Maharashtra, which reported about 140,000 deaths, also filed an affidavit in the top court and said it managed to process claims of only 8,000 people .The court felt that Gujarat did not adequately publicise the online claims portal though the state said that the number of claims had risen from 12,718 on December 4 to 22,557 now. The portal was operative from December 3, said the affidavit.“The common man is waiting and struggling to get ₹50,000. How will you inform them? We find that all the publicity is only on paper. Advertisements have to be issued in all newspapers giving the address of the online portal. The same has to be also shown on local channels, Doordarshan, and local newspapers,” said a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna.The bench directed Maharashtra to process the nearly 84,000 claims received within a week, and asked Gujarat to ensure adequate publicity is provided about the ex-gratia scheme in local channels and newspapers.Maharashtra’s counsel Sachin Patil told the court that the state aimed to process claims of almost 50,000 families by the end of this month, and that publicity was done in 121 newspapers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/request-for-compensation-exceeding-covid-toll-cleared-most-gujarat-to-sc-101639422250057.html
14-12-2021||India||Lakhimpur SIT wants accused to be charged with attempt to murder||A Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence has filed an application before the area’s chief judicial magistrate to add new sections against 13 accused, including Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, making their offence punishable under attempt to murder charges.Vidhyaram Diwakar, the SIT’s investigating officer, filed the application on December 9 in the CJM’s court for adding new sections in the warrant, replacing sections 279, 338 and 304A of the IPC.In his application, the investigating officer pointed out that the October 3 incident in Lakhimpur Kheri was a well-planned and deliberate act, not an act of negligence or callousness.The investigating officer has requested to add sections 307 (Attempt to murder), 326 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code after replacing sections 279 ( Rash driving or riding on a public way), 338 (Whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently) and 304A (Causing death by negligence) of the IPC.Eight people, including four farmers and a local journalist, were killed in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 in the violence that erupted during a farmers’ protest.The SIT has so far arrested 13 people in the case. Those arrested are Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra, Luvkush, Ashish Pandey, Sekhar Bharti, Ankit Das, Latif, Sishupal, Nandan Singh, Satyam Tripathi, Sumit Jaiswal, Dharmendra Banjara, Rinku Rana and Ullas Trivedi.They are lodged in the Lakhimpur Kheri district prison.The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on December 10 gave two weeks’ time to the state government to file a counter-affidavit on the bail application of Ashish Mishra. During the hearing of the case, additional advocate general Vinod Shahi, representing the state government, apprised the court about the ongoing investigation in the case.Shahi said that statements of a large number of witnesses were still to be recorded. Accepting the plea, the court granted two weeks’ time to the state government to file a counter-affidavit on bail application of Ashish Mishra.
14-12-2021||India||BJP holds events across India to mark Kashi Vishwanath Corridor’s inauguration||New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday organised programmes at various temples across the country to celebrate the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with Union ministers calling the event “historic”.In New Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah said the PM had done unique work to revive the pride of the faith centres as the carrier of Indian culture and the protector of religion.“Kashi, the city of Baba Vishwanath, has been a shining symbol of sanatan (ancient) culture for centuries. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has written a golden chapter in the history of Indian culture by launching the grand form of Kashi Viswanath dham while re-realising his unique devotion to religion,” Shah tweeted.BJP president J P Nadda thanked Modi for the “revival” of Kashi and cultural and spiritual heritage of “sanatan” religion.In a series of tweets in Hindi, Nadda, who was also present at the ceremony in Varanasi, said the PM revived the “divine, wonderful, unimaginable and grand form of Kashi” besides the spiritual and cultural heritage of “sanatan dharma”.Union minister Piyush Goyal visited the Birla temple in Delhi and heard hte PM’s speech in Varanasi. “Kashi now will sparkle in its traditional charm and will present country’s history and culture,” he tweeted.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted: “The reconstruction of this Dham started in…2018…In its history, the temple alone was renovated many times…this is the first time the entire Vishwanath Dham has been rebuilt successfully. What PM Modi has done is phenomenal.”“PM Narendra Modi by inaugurating Kashi Vishwanath Dham programme today has added a new chapter in country’s cultural history. I thank PM from bottom of my heart for this,” Union defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted. In another tweet, he said, the PM’s name will be remembered any time someone mentioned Kashi Vishwanath.Many BJP-ruled states were represented in Varanasi either by chief ministers or deputy chief ministers. “Because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, the country is full of undefined energy and self-confidence. Without doubt, under your guidance the Indians will overcome every impossible challenge,” Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted.In Mumbai, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and senior party leader Pankaja Munde participated in a function at Babulnath temple while state BJP president Chandrakant Patil attended a function at a temple in Pune. In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP organised functions called ‘Divya Kashi Bhavya Kashi’ in different districts of the state, where live telecast of the inauguration and series of events by the PM was broadcast on big screens. In Tripura, BJP leaders performed special prayers at 150 temples.“This is the beginning of a new era,” Sharma said and added that the PM had shown new path on how to save culture and tradition with development. The mega project comprises 24 buildings including an emporium, a museum, a sacred kitchen, a Vedic library and centre to store ancient scriptures, a city gallery and a food court – all built around the temple that serves as one of the nerve centres of the Hindu faith, attracting seven million pilgrims annually. The showpiece of the project is the restoration of the link between the Ganga and the temple, an ancient connection that had been cut off by years of encroachment, construction and population.Modi reached the corridor by boat around noon, took a dip in the Ganga and offered prayers, before carrying holy water across the roughly 500m corridor and dedicating the complex, comprising 24 buildings built over 550,000 square feet, to the nation. In the evening, he watched the Ganga aarti from a boat at Dashashwamedh Ghat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-holds-events-across-india-to-mark-kashi-vishwanath-corridor-s-inauguration-101639421470044.html
14-12-2021||India||India opposes UNSC resolution that sought to 'securitise' climate change||India on Monday opposed a UN Security Council draft resolution on climate change on the grounds that it sought to “securitise” the issue and that the body was not the appropriate forum to discuss such matters.The draft resolution was framed by Ireland and Niger, who are members of the UN Security Council responsible for leading negotiations and drafting resolutions on climate change. Though it was backed by 12 of the council’s 15 members, Russia vetoed the resolution while China abstained. The resolution sought to portray climate as an issue that threatens global peace and security but people familiar with the matter said the UN Security Council was not the proper forum to discuss the matter.The Indian mission to the UN said in a tweet that the country voted against the draft resolution “that attempted to securitize climate action and undermine the hard-won consensual agreements” at the COP26 conference in Glasgow.“India had no option but to vote against [the resolution],” TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, said while explaining the country’s vote.“India is second to none when it comes to climate action and climate justice, but the Security Council is not the place to discuss either issue. In fact, the attempt to do so appears to be motivated by a desire to evade responsibility in the appropriate forum and divert the world’s attention from an unwillingness to deliver where it counts,” Tirumurti said.India, he said, is moving forward on climate change with “great courage and high ambition”, but the country also understands the challenges of developing nations and will “continue to voice their concerns and expectations”. There should be no confusion about India’s determination to combat climate change and the country will always support “real climate action and serious climate justice”, he added.Tirumurti said the Indian prime minister had unveiled an ambitious climate action vision with five elements at COP26 – taking non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, meeting 50% of energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030, reducing total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030, reducing the carbon intensity of economy to less than 45% by 2030, and achieving the target of “net zero” by 2070.India now ranks fourth in terms of installed renewable energy capacity and non-fossil energy has increased by more than 25% in the past seven years and reached 40% of the total energy mix. India has also taken the lead in initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).Affordable access to climate finance and technologies has become critical, and developed countries must provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest, Tirumurti said. “The reality is that developed countries have fallen well short of their promises. This is particularly important to recognise because today’s attempt to link climate with security really seeks to obfuscate lack of progress on critical issues under the UN FCCC (Framework Convention on Climate Change) process,” he said.India was also concerned about the manner in which the issue was brought before the Security Council, and there was “no real requirement for this resolution except for bringing climate change under the ambit of the Security Council”, Tirumurti said.The decisions were made without the involvement of most developing countries and without recognising consensus, he said. The UN Security Council members are “major contributors to climate change due to historic emissions” and the position that a few countries will have a “free hand” in deciding all climate-related issues is “neither desirable nor acceptable”, Tirumurti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-votes-against-climate-change-draft-resolution-at-unsc-101639421351157.html

14-12-2021||India||‘Matchless experience’: Locals on inauguration||The inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor on Monday was a matchless experience, said residents of the Hindu holy city of Varanasi basking in the festive glow on the occasion.The famed lanes of Varanasi, its ghats, temples, intersections and bridges were lit up with festive lights. Its usually dirty roads and lanes were spotless. The locals lighted over 1.1 million earthen lamps at the ghats, lanes and in front of their houses, residents said.“The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor’s inauguration was na bhuto, na bhavishyati (unparalleled) experience for us,” said Somnath Vishwakarma, a resident. “Baba Kashi Vishwanath is the centre of faith for crores of Hindus like us. The corridor, which is also known as Kashi Vishwanath Dham, is unique and so has been its inauguration.”“With Baba Kashi Vishwanath’s blessings, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has built the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project,” said Shailendra Mishra, a Bharatiya Janata Party worker deployed to make arrangements for the ceremony. “The project has added to the spiritual vibrancy of Kashi.” Varanasi is also known as Kashi, where the ruling deity is Lord Shiva, whose another name is Vishwanath.“The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and its unique features will transform the experience of the devotees visiting Kashi Vishwanath temple,” said Vijay Yadav, who visits the shrine daily to offer prayers.Many people voluntarily decorated their houses with ornamental lights, he said, adding that the earthen lamps imparted a glow only seen during the festival of lights.“The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is grand, divine and unique,” said Ashwani Pandey, co-convenor of the month-long cultural programmes associated with the inauguration. “The entire country watched the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. The inaugural ceremony was so grand that it left people enthralled. For us, it was once in a lifetime occasion.”Devotees will now get a taste of spirituality and comfort when they visit the Kashi Vishwanath temple through the spacious corridor, said Pandey. The corridor will help increase the earnings of boatmen as many devotees will likely visit the Kashi Vishwanath temple by boat because the corridor has connected the temple with the Ganga, he said.“Devotees may board a boat at any of the ghats and reach Kashi Vishwanath Dham while enjoying the scenic view of the ghats and the Ganga flowing calmly,” Pandey said. “The pilgrimage to Kashi will be an entirely new experience.”

He (Modi) should stay for two months, three months. It is a good place to stay,” he said.Modi represents Varanasi in Lok Sabha. The city is part of Uttar Pradesh’s Purvanchal region, which sends 160 MLAs in the 403-member state assembly. The most populous state will elect a new assembly early next year. SP is the main opposition in UP.Yadav took a swipe at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying its leaders should “avoid telling lies” before god. “They are good at telling lies in front of you and me. But one should avoid telling lies in front of god.”The BJP condemned Yadav’s taunts for PM Modi and equated the SP chief with Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Union minister Pralhad Joshi said, “If he had any empathy about Hindu beliefs, he would have welcomed the inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. But all he is bothered about is his vote bank. Political differences are one thing but to wish someone end is condemnable. People will teach him a lesson.” He added that“such cruel and uncivilised comments show his mindset”.The Congress blamed the BJP and the SP of playing politics.

14-12-2021||India||PM Modi to address national summit on zero-budget natural farming in Gujarat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a national summit to popularize zero-budget natural farming (ZNBF) on December 16 in Gujarat’s Anand, as policymakers prepare for a big push for the technique agricultural scientists say is unproven. The National Summit on Agro and Food Processing, in which Modi is set to make a valedictory address via videoconferencing, is being organized by the Gujarat government. Nearly 5,000 farmers are expected to take part, besides 80 institutes of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Krishi Vigyan Kendras, or state-run farm-extension centres. “In the summit, basic knowledge on how to adopt zero-budget natural farming will be showcased,” agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal said in a media briefing on Monday. “The purpose is to impart knowledge.”On November 19, Modi, while announcing a decision to cancel the three contentious farm laws after a year of protests, had said the Centre would set up a committee to ensure minimum support prices and promote zero budget farming. On November 11, addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur after inaugurating the Saryu Canal national project, Modi again called upon cultivators to adopt natural farming to save costs and increase yields. ZBNF, a technique of farming developed by Padma awardee Subhash Palekar of Maharashtra, aims to bring down input costs by making farmers rely on natural inputs, shifting away from agricultural chemicals. It mainly relies on an admixture of urine and dung of native Indian cows. The technique is not scientifically validated, and there is no evidence to show if it added any value to farmers, agricultural scientists say. In 2019, the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) wrote to Modi, expressing concern over the possible negative impacts of ZBNF on farm incomes and food security. In August 2019, the NAAS, which has nearly 650 fellows, had held a day-long brainstorming session of top scientists to scrutinize the scientific evidence around ZBNF. It was attended by Trilochan Mohapatra, director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and Ramesh Chand, member of the NITI Aayog, the government’s think tank.“We had recommended that unless there is scientific evidence about its efficacy and benefits, there is no need for the government to rush for it,” said Panjab Singh, a top farm scientist and former president of NAAS. “In our interaction so far, we have seen that in this technique, there is zero costs for inputs, such as fertilisers, since everything is available naturally and the produce also fetches higher prices,” secretary Agarwal said. At the heart of ZBNF is the idea that nearly 98% of nutrients needed by crops, such as CO2, nitrogen, water and sun, are available naturally and free of cost. The remaining nutrients need to be absorbed from the soil. They are converted from non-available to available form through the action of microorganisms and a special admixture of cow dung and cow urine. Farmers using the technique saw nearly 90% reduction in costs, Gujarat chief secretary Pankaj Kumar said. The agriculture ministry had ordered a study in XXX year by the ICAR led by Praveen Rao Velchala, vice-chancellor of Jayashankar Telengana State Agriculture University, to study the benefits of ZBNF. “The study is nearly over. We are going to submit out findings soon,” Velchala said. “All I can say is that with so many agro-climatic zones in our country, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work.” Although there is no scientific poof of its benefits, the Union government has promoted ZNBF on 400,000 hectares across eight states as part of the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, a scheme to promote organic farming. 
14-12-2021||India||India votes against UNSC draft resolution on the climate crisis||India on Monday voted against the adoption of a draft resolution by the UN Security Council on climate change sharply criticizing it as an attempt “to undermine the hard-won consensus which we reached in Glasgow” and would “sow the seeds of discord among the larger UN membership”.The draft resolution, which was written by UNSC members Ireland and Niger (penholders in this UNSC on climate change) and backed by 12 of the body’s 15 members, sought appropriate climate change discussions portraying climate as an issue that threatens international peace and security.India, China and Russia have opposed it and voted against it.“Climate change decisions are sought to be taken out of the wider international community represented in the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and given instead to the Security Council,” TS Tirumurti, Indian permanent representative to the UN, said in a statement explaining India’s opposition to the draft.He added: “Ironically, many of the UNSC members are the main contributors of climate change due to historical emissions. If the Security Council indeed takes over the responsibility on this issue, a few states will then have a free hand in deciding on all climate-related issues. This is neither desirable nor acceptable.”India is “second to none” when it comes to climate action and climate justice but the UN Security Council was not the platform for them. “Today’s UNSC Resolution attempts to undermine the hard-won consensus which we reached in Glasgow,” Tirumurti said, referring to the last UN climate change meet. “This resolution would only sow the seeds of discord among the larger UN membership.”The Indian ambassador to the UN went on to that the draft resolution “sends a wrong message to the developing countries that instead of addressing their concerns and holding developed countries responsible for meeting their commitments under the UNFCCC, we are willing to be divided and side-tracked under the guise of security”.The way forward instead was to provide affordable access to climate finance and technologies. “Developed countries must provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest. Climate finance must be tracked with the same diligence as climate mitigation. And the reality, Mr President, is that the developed countries have fallen well short of their promises.”Developed countries had committed decades ago to contribute to a climate fund of $100 billion every year to support climate action in developing countries, and they have not yet met the target. — the latest available data for 2018 is $79 billion.“This is particularly important to recognize because today’s attempt to link climate with security seeks to obfuscate lack of progress on critical issues under the UNFCCC process,” said Tirumurti.The ambassador listed out India’s commitment as laid out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Glasgow meet:: India will take its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; it will meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030; it will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now till 2030; cut carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45%; and achieve Net Zero goal by 2070.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-votes-against-unsc-draft-resolution-on-the-climate-crisis-101639420990730.html

The NDPS (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed by a voice vote after some amendments moved by opposition members were rejected by the House.In the House, several opposition members questioned the retrospective penal provision in the bill which seeks to rectify the anomalies, saying the amendments will not hold good in courts. BJD member Bhartruhari Mahtab, Congress member Manish Tewari were among those who opposed the retrospective applicability of the provision, saying according to law, criminal provisions cannot be brought into force on a retrospective basis.Sitharaman, however, said the amendments proposed only seek to correct certain “clerical error”. She said the bill has a very limited purpose and seeks to achieve “nothing more”. “Amendments with retrospective effect to substantive part of criminal law is not permitted, but clarificatory amendment that seeks to remove an obvious mistake is permitted,” she said.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndpsamendment-bill-gets-lok-sabha-approval-101639420450596.html

Both helped him manage the disability, and, Nain, a law graduate, set voyage on an uncharted course – to become a judge.On Monday, the Supreme Court declared the end of at least this phase of his journey, ordering his immediate appointment as a judicial officer in Delhi along with appropriate seniority. A bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, held that there is no impediment in Nain taking charge as a judicial officer in one of the district courts in the national capital and discharging his duties as a judge.The bench, which included justice MM Sundresh, relied upon the report from a medical board, constituted by it on November 17, while clearing the decks for appointment of Nain in what could be the first such order that breaks the glass ceiling in judicial appointments.The medical board, which comprised experts in psychiatry and physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) interacted with Nain, and also examined his medical records before informing the bench that “there is nothing to indicate that he will not be able to discharge his responsibilities to the post of judicial officer for which he has been selected”.Nain cleared the Delhi Judicial Service-2018 examination after applying under the category of persons with disability (PwD). He got through all three rounds of the examination, including the interview, but his candidature was rejected in May 2019 by the Delhi high court administration.When Nain challenged this decision before the high court on the judicial side, the administration argued that Nain would not be able to effectively discharge his duties as a judicial officer because of his mental illness; and that his disability cannot be construed as permanent or long-term in nature since Nain is under remission and his condition is likely to improve.Once the disability falls under 40% at some point in future, the high court argued, Nain would not be entitled to the benefit of reservation under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.A high court decision in May 2020 allowed Nain’s plea, underlining that the 2016 Act included mental illness as a form of disability for which reservation had to be accorded to the eligible candidates.“It appears that the Parliament granted reservation, inter alia, to PwD – who suffer from mental illness (which does not include retardation, as taken note of hereinabove), so that such persons get an opportunity to lead a normal life with encouragement and dignity. Merely because they may need medication and treatment throughout their lives, or may suffer setbacks from time to time, cannot be a reason to deny them equal opportunity to assimilate in the society, make their contribution and have a life of dignity,” the high court judgment noted.Firm on its views that Nain should not be inducted as a judicial officer, the administration challenged this order in the Supreme Court, arguing that he cannot be granted the benefit of relaxed standard admissible to candidates belonging to persons with disability since his disability is not lifelong, and that his condition could improve in future. The high court administration also raised serious questions over Nain’s ability to preside over a court and decide cases.In August 2020, the Supreme Court stayed the operation of the high court judgment but asked the administration to keep one post vacant for Nain in case it ruled in his favour.Nain, through his lawyers, told the top court that the very fact that he cleared the examination including the viva-voce buttressed the case for his ability to handle the judicial work, more so since bipolar disorder is a medical problem which can be tackled with proper medication.When the court, in its hearing on November 17, found it appropriate to constitute a medical board for ascertaining Nain’s capability to efficiently discharge his duty as a judicial officer, his lawyers highlighted the innate social prejudices which arise while considering such cases for appointment, besides absence of parameters to judge the capacity of a judge.At this, the court said that “the medical board will keep its objectivity, looking at the candidate, the task which he is required to perform on appointment, and his medical condition” while asking the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to set up a board for this task.The medical board’s report informed the bench that Nain indeed suffers from bipolar disorder but has been in remission (asymptomatic) since August 2018. The board also advised Nain to continue his regular treatment and follow-up with his treating psychiatrist.Taking on record the expert opinion, the apex court ruled that Nain “is entitled to succeed”, directing the high court administration to appoint him as a judicial officer and also give him notional seniority along with his other batchmates who joined after clearing the DJS-2018 exam.Saima Zaidi, a counselling psychologist and psychotherapist, said: “People who suffer from bipolar disorder can live an absolutely normal life while managing their personal and professional relationships. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong management with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective therapy, as it works on cognition and thinking pattern of a person. Medication for mood stabilizing and/or anti-depressants are usually prescribed with an advice to avoid triggers such as caffeine, alcohol and stress while having a balanced diet, regular exercise, consistent schedule and a good nights sleep.”
14-12-2021||India||PM Modi opens Kashi Vishwanath corridor||Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the ₹700 crore Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi on Monday, exhorting citizens to take pledges for cleanliness and self-reliance, and saying that a new India took pride in retrieving historical glory while striving for modernity.Modi reached the mega redevelopment project by boat around noon, took a dip in the Ganga and offered prayers, before carrying holy water across the roughly 500m corridor and dedicating the complex, comprising 24 buildings built over 550,000 square feet, to the nation. In the evening, he watched the Ganga aarti from a boat at Dashashwamedh Ghat.“This complex is a witness to our capability, of our duty. If it is determined and thought, then nothing is impossible,” he said. “Today history has been created by reviving the sociocultural history of this ancient city, which is vibrant with Hindu philosophy as enshrined in our religious books.”Addressing a gathering of 3,000 guests, the PM urged Indians to make three resolutions for the sake of the country: Swachhta (cleanliness), Srijan (creation), and continuous efforts for Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).In a 45-minute speech in his parliamentary constituency, Modi said India was focused on reviving its lost heritage and was stepping out of the “inferiority” complex brought on by centuries of “slavery”.“Tyrants attacked this city, tried to destroy it. History is witness to Aurangzeb’s atrocities, his terror. He tried to change civilisation with the sword,” he said. “But the soil of this country is different from the rest of the world. Here if an Aurangzeb comes, a Shivaji also rises,” he added, raising the chant of ‘Har Har Mahadev’, associated with Hindu god Shiva.“If any Salar Masud comes, then brave warriors like King Suheldev make him taste the might of India’s unity. And even during the British era, the people of Kashi knew what happened to Warren Hastings.”Modi started his visit by offering prayers at the Kaal Bhairav temple. Around 12.15pm, he took a boat to the Lalita Ghat entrance of the corridor, a project on which work began in earnest in 2019.He then took a dip in the Ganga, collected holy water in a kalash (a metal vessel used in rituals) and walked across the corridor – with devotees playing the damru (a two-headed drum) on either side. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda, Union ministers Mahendra Nath Pandey and Dharmendra Pradhan, and other dignitaries.After the ceremony, Modi and Adityanath had lunch with the workers who built the corridor, which aimed to transform the area around the centuries-old temple in Varanasi with state-of-the-art buildings and opening access to the Ganga.During his two-day visit – which comes months before high-stakes state elections – the PM will also participate in a conclave of chief ministers of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, along with the deputy CMs of Bihar and Nagaland.In his speech, Modi called Varanasi “imperishable” and a “class apart”, and took on his political opponents. He said when the corridor was conceived, some people, due to their vested interests and politics, used to say, “How will it happen? It will not happen. Many people like Modi have come and gone.”“But Kashi is Kashi. Kashi is imperishable,” he added. “There is only one government in Kashi, the government of Mahadev who holds damru in his hand”.“With blessings of Baba Vishwanath, the grand corridor has been built, and has been dedicated to the nation today. The inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Dham will give a decisive direction to India, and will lead it to a brighter future. This complex is a witness to our capability, our duty. If it is determined and thought, then nothing is impossible,” Modi said.“No one comes to Kashi, and nothing happens without Mahadev’s grace. Whatever happens here happens with the will of Mahadev. Whatever happened, Mahadev has done it.”Before inaugurating the corridor, Modi greeted workers with flowers and sat with them on the stairs of a platform. Earlier, petals were showered on him on the streets of Varanasi, and the PM accepted a “pagdi” (turban) from a man.“When you come here, you will not see only faith, you will also feel the glory of your past here — how antiquity and novelty come alive together, how the inspirations of the ancient are giving direction to the future. In Vishwanath Dham complex, all this is visible,” he said.“This entire new complex of Vishwanath Dham is not just a grand building, this is also a symbol of the sanatan (ancient) culture of India. This is a symbol of our spiritual soul, a symbol of India’s antiquity, traditions, India’s energy and dynamism,” Modi added.The mega project comprises 24 buildings including an emporium, a museum, a sacred kitchen, a Vedic library and centre to store ancient scriptures, a city gallery and a food court – all built around the temple that serves as one of the nerve centres of the Hindu faith, attracting seven million pilgrims annually. The showpiece of the project is the restoration of the link between the Ganga and the temple, an ancient connection that had been cut off by years of encroachment, construction and population.Modi said the complex has been expanded from 3,000 to 500,000 square feet, and between 50,000 and 75,000 devotees could gather at any given time. He credited the workers for finishing the project despite the pandemic.“Today, I would also like to express my gratitude to every labourer brother and sister, who shed their sweat in the construction of this grand complex and even in times like corona, they did not let the work stop here,” he said. “Along with all this, I also congratulate chief minister Yogi Adityanathji, who worked day and night.”The PM called cleanliness a way of life and called for the people’s participation in this enterprise, especially in the Namami Gange Mission, which aims to curb pollution and rejuvenate the Ganga.“The long period of slavery broke our confidence in such a way that we lost faith in our own creation. Today, from this thousand-year-old Kashi, I call upon every countryman — create with confidence and innovate.”The Opposition attacked the PM. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav taunted him, saying people stay in Varanasi when the end is near. “It is good,” he said when told that Modi was in Varanasi. “Why only a month? He should stay for two months, three months. That is a good place to stay.”

The officials were deployed in the Srinagar city and were returning to the headquarters when the bus came under attack.The area houses several camps of various security forces. Initially, officials said 14 police personnel were injured in the attack and were evacuated to various hospitals in the area.“Terrorists fired upon a police vehicle near Zewan in Pantha Chowk area of Srinagar. 14 personnel injured in the attack. All the injured personnel evacuated to hospital. Area cordoned off,” a tweet from the official handle of the J-K police spokesperson said soon after the attack.Assistant sub-inspector Ghulam Hassan from Ramban and selection grade constable Shafique Ali from Reasi died during treatment, the spokesperson later said.Some of the injured personnel were reported to be critical, the spokesperson said.Citing “credible sources”, Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said that the attack was carried out by Kashmir Tigers, an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). “In the retaliatory firing, one of the terrorists was injured and the group involved in this gruesome terrorist attack will be soon brought to justice,” he said.The area has been cordoned off and a search operation launched to track down the assailants, the officials said. At least three terrorists were involved in the attack, the officials said.The attack came on the 20th anniversary of the attack on the Parliament building in the national capital by JeM. On December 13 in 2001, terrorists attacked the Parliament complex, killing nine people. All five terrorists were shot dead.In a tweet, the Prime Minister’s Office said: “PM Narendra Modi has sought details on the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir. He has also expressed condolences to the families of those security personnel who have been martyred in the attack.”Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and top politicians also condemned the terror attack.“Strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist attack on J-K Police bus in Srinagar. My homage to our brave martyred police personnel. We are committed to ensure that perpetrators are punished. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” Sinha said on Twitter.“Directed the concerned authorities to provide best possible treatment to the injured. I pray for their speedy recovery. Our police and security forces are determined to neutralize the evil forces of terrorism,” he said.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti also offered condolences to the bereaved families.“Terrible news of a terror attack on a police bus on the outskirts of Srinagar. I unequivocally condemn this attack while at the same time send my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased & prayers for the injured,” National Conference leader Abdullah tweeted.Mufti, meanwhile, attacked the Centre for a “false narrative of normalcy” in Kashmir. “Terribly sad to hear about the Srinagar attack in which two policemen were killed. GOIs false narrative of normalcy in Kashmir stands exposed yet there has been no course correction. My condolences to the bereaved families,” she tweeted.The attack came days after two policemen were killed in an attack in Kashmir’s Bandipora district on December 10.This is the second major terror attack in the Valley after a string of targeted civilian killings along the Union territory.Earlier in September 2017, one policeman was killed and three were injured when terrorists attacked a police vehicle in the same area.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-dead-as-j-k-police-bus-hit-by-terrorists-101639420391072.html
14-12-2021||India||Opposition to hit the streets over MPs’ suspension||More than 18 Opposition parties have planned a march from Parliament to Vijay Chowk to protest against the suspension of 12 lawmakers from the Rajya Sabha — an issue that has already triggered daily protests inside and outside the Upper House since past two weeks.The march, to be joined by Opposition leaders of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, will be held on Tuesday noon. Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge told HT that protests will continue through different forms of Satyagraha. “We have to fight it. We have to tell the people why our people were suspended and how wrongly they have been kept out of the House. Our fight will continue and find other methods like a march or asking all political parties addressing to the press. We will continue our protests through different forms of Satyagraha,” he said.Trinamool leader Dola Sen, one of the 12 suspended MPs protesting daily in front of the Gandhi statue, said, “We have been suspended as we wanted to raise people’s issues. In the last session, Opposition MPs were suspended three times. Yet, the government dragged the last session’s incidents to this session to stop us again from speaking in the House.”While the Lok Sabha worked smoothly on Monday, Congress MPs walked out of the Rajya Sabha protesting against the continued standoff over the suspensions. Kharge said the government has not conceded to their demand to revisit the suspension.Speaking in the House, Kharge said the Opposition has repeatedly requested the chair to reconsider the suspension of MPs accused of disrupting the proceedings on the last day of the monsoon session.“You are the custodian of this house, the government cannot dictate what we should do or not do. Our deputy leader has already spoken to you and also to the leader of the house but they are repeatedly refusing to concede our request. They are putting blame on us…it is not good therefore,” he said.Later in the day, he wrote to the Chairman of the House, requesting him to withdraw external security forces that are posted in the lobbies, referring to the alleged harassment of opposition lawmakers during the monsoon session.In his letter, reviewed by HT, Kharge cited the August 11 incident wherein Opposition MPs were allegedly attacked and harassed by Delhi Police personnel. “These people were unknown to the members and that became the primary cause of suspicion, which led to unruly scenes..,” he said.Earlier, Anand Sharma of the Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) Tiruchi Siva urged the chair to revisit the action taken against the suspended MPs. CPI MP Binoy Viswam later told HT, “We are contemplating various ways of protests. We have also sought permission for a demonstration at Jantar Mantar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-to-hit-the-streets-today-over-mps-suspension-101639420331953.html
14-12-2021||India||‘RS chair has authority to revoke suspension’: Congress' Kharge||Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, has been spearheading protests over the suspension of 12 MPs for unruly scenes in the previous session of Parliament. Speaking to Saubhadra Chatterji, he said that the protests will continue through various forms of satyagraha.While the Rajya Sabha chairman has asked the government and opposition to sort out the issue of suspension, the government is adamant on an apology from the suspended members.Why should we apologize? Did we violate any business transaction or constitutional matter in the House? The incident took place in the last session, but just to insult the opposition, they brought the matter in this session and suspended 12 MPs. These members are vocal fighters always taking up people’s cause in the House. That’s why the government tried to suppress the voice of these people.The protest has been going on for the past two weeks. What is the next step?We have to fight it. We have to tell the people why our people were suspended and how wrongly they have been kept out of the House. Our fight will continue and we will find other methods like a march or asking all political parties addressing to the press. We will continue our protests through different forms of satyagraha.Any plan to meet the President, who summons all Parliament sessions?Now, one House (Lok Sabha) is running well. The problem is only with the Rajya Sabha. And it is pretty clear why the Rajya Sabha is facing daily disruptions. When the chairman has got full power, and he himself said that he can take any action and expel anyone, it is my appeal that the chairman should not listen to the government and revoke the suspension. He has the authority to do that.Remember in a recent incident in British Parliament, the speaker reminded the British Prime Minister that in the House the former is in charge.You made several legal arguments on why the suspension process is wrong. Is there any thinking to challenge this decision in a court of law?We had thought about it. But you know, the court procedure would be lengthy, and by the time it delivers a judgment, the session would be adjourned. Also, in these cases, the court is likely to maintain that the House is supreme and can take its own decisions. Our political fight will continue in various other forms.
14-12-2021||India||What we know about Omicron variant so far||The first fatality due to an Omicron infection has been confirmed from the UK, the variant has now reached China – where the Sars-CoV-2 was first found – and several countries are pressing on with large booster dose campaigns to blunt the threat from the heavily mutated virus.In the short time since it was designated as a variant of concern (VOC) at the end of November, Omicron is confirmed to have two of the three most threatening traits a mutated Sars-CoV-2 can pick up: it is more transmissible and resistant than any configuration of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The severity of the disease it leads to – the third characteristic being watched for – is yet to be confirmed, although anecdotally, it could be less severe.Several scientists see the arrival of Omicron as consistent with a prediction that the coronavirus will eventually become endemic, evolving every now and then to lead to some serious outbreaks, like what was seen in the annual flu outbreak in 2014-15.Two evolutionary biologists, University of Cape Town’s assistant professor Darren Martin and Temple University professor Sergei Pond, in a recent online discussion sketched out what they believe will be the main scenarios for Omicron’s evolution, building on what has been seen so far with the Sars-Cov-2.The assessments consider the immune or selection pressure the virus faced and is likely to face – this is the nature of collective immunity that can dictate the evolutionary landscape of a contagious pathogen, which naturally attempts to evolve to keep spreading.Scenario 1: No immune pressureIn this case, Omicron spreads with no selective pressure like the first version of the virus during the early phase of the pandemic. But such a situation is unlikely, since now many people worldwide have either been infected or vaccinated.In such a situation, Omicron is unlikely to “coast” across the global population like the virus that spread out of Wuhan did until December 2020 (when Alpha variant began taking over).Scenario 2: Weak or moderate pressureWhat happens when Omicron faces a weak or moderate selective pressure? The scientists estimate the virus will become the dominant strain, and evolve rather slowly without significant changes in how it inherently spreads, resists antibodies, and causes disease. Over time, some mutations may better these functions, but probably only in small pockets.Scenario 3: Strong selective pressureSeveral factors can strongly force Omicron to mutate, including competition with the fittest Delta sub-lineage; low genetic barriers that allow it to pick up certain mutations; and, if Omicron evolves with an alternative animal species, it could select additional mutations to better infect humans. This scenario is one to watch out for since it would “be expected to play out over a considerably shorter time frame”.Scenario 4: Recombination wildcardRecombination is when a concurrent infection with two different variants can cause the virus to take an evolutionary leap after the fittest of mutations from both make through.There are already two distinct Omicron lineages, and more may be discovered over time, which could recombine, the authors suggest. The increased infectivity of Delta and Omicron too “substantially increases the probability of mixed infections”, which could lead to such recombination.This scenario sounds grim but presently, the scientific community has “no idea whether the potential even exists” and what might happen if such a thing does indeed happen.Predicting Omicron’s evolution is difficult – Pond and Martin titled their arguments as a “Fool’s Errand” -- and only time will tell the route the virus takes, but the scenarios will help shape how sequences of the virus are analysed and, in the future, as more data emerges, predict which of the cases are likely to become reality
14-12-2021||India||Rise in attacks on Christians a worry in MP||St Joseph Parish, Ganj Basoda, in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha district, organized its first holy communion, a religious ceremony, for eight Christian catholic children at a local Church on October 31. But the organisers were not aware that publication of the event in a local Christian magazine would irk local Hindu groups so much that they would attack and vandalise the school where the function was held.On December 6, police said a group of people affiliated to the Hindu groups such as Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal, forcefully entered St Joseph School, attacked the staff and vandalised classrooms. School authorities alleged that the attack was the culmination of a series of attacks by Hindu groups since November 25.“On Sunday (December 5), they (Hindu groups) threatened the school administration with dire consequences. We asked for police protection and only two constables were deployed the next day. On December 6, more than 200 people reached the school shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Dharma ki raksha kaun karega hum karenge hum karenge’ (Who will protect religion? We will, we will) and started vandalizing,” said school principal Brother John Anthony.VHP’s Vidisha district president, Nileesh Agrawal, accused the school of not giving them names of eight children whose communion was organised. “We met school authorities at least thrice. We just wanted to verify the claim that communion was for Christian children,” he said. He refuted that VHP was behind the attack.After the incident, the police arrested 11 people and registered a case against 50 unidentified people for rioting and causing damage to property. Vidisha superintendent of police, Monika Shukla, said, “The school principal gave names of all the eight children, who are Catholic. Of the 11 arrested, three have been sent to jail while eight have been released on bail.”Not in isolationChristian community leaders claim the incident is the latest in a series of attacks on Christian priests, religious places and schools in the past few months. According to Christian body, United Christian Forum (UCF), 70 incidents, including 32 violent attacks, have been reported from Madhya Pradesh after the MP Freedom of Religion Act came into force in January 2021 while 22 incidents were reported from MP in 2020. “We would verify whether this number is correct,” said MP home minister Narottam Mishra.According to the state home department, 17 FIRs have been registered against Christians under the MP Freedom of Religion Act and 75 people, including 10 women, have been arrested. The department has no district-wise data on cases for assault or vandalisation.UCF national coordinator, AC Michael, said, “The right-wing activists are fiercely attacking our churches, prayer halls, schools and now even family gatherings just because they suspect conversion.”The UCF report also mentions that on November 11 in Jhabua, sub-divisional magistrate Anil Bhana cited VHP functionary Kamal Maharaj’s memorandum to issue an order banning any Christian events without permission of the district administration. The order, issued to police stations in the district, said there was a complete ban on “mass conversion” of tribals to Christianity without permission of the district magistrate and that “if any such event takes place under your jurisdiction, then take necessary action immediately.”After this order, local Christians claimed all Sunday prayers have been discontinued because Hindu group activists would interrupt and harass pastors and fathers. In October, the district administration stopped construction of a church after protests by Hindu groups. District collector Somesh Mishra said, “Construction was put on hold as we have sought land papers from the Church. They are yet to submit papers.” In Sagar, two nuns reportedly working with HIV infected children were arrested under anti-conversion law after some locals suspected them of converting the children to Christianity, Michael said.A local police officer, who was not willing to be named, said the nuns were arrested on complaints of local Hindu groups and have been released on bail.MP Catholic Church Association public relations officer, Maria Stephen, said, these groups “are getting the support of police, district administration and even ministers of state government.” Mishra refuted the claim and said he has assured Archbishop Rev Dr Sebatian Durairaj that churches would be protected provided they are running as per law.Education targetedHome department data shows three educational institutions -- St. Joseph School, Vidisha, Catholic Hostel, Raisen and Christ Jyothi School, Satna --have been attacked since October.In October, Hindu groups asked authorities in Christ Jyoti Senior Secondary School in Satna district, to place an idol of Goddess Saraswati in the school, according to Father Augustine Chittuparambil, school principal, who claimed to be “living under fear” after the incident and have appointed more security personnel.In Raisen district, a girl’s hostel being run by a Christian missionary organization was closed after National Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Priyank Kanoongo in an inspection on November 11 claimed a Bible was found in possession of Hindu girls. Following this, the hostel was closed, said local officials.On December 2, Kanoongo forwarded complaints by local Hindu group leaders to Vidisha collector against St Joseph School, alleging conversions. On December 8, he asked the Sagar police to investigate a complaint against Sevadham Ashram alleging that children were forced to eat beef and recite Bible. “NCPCR is taking cognizance of fake complaints. It is a national organisation and should behave sensitively,” said Stephen.Kanoongo said the NCPCR was doing its job. “If school and administration run by Christian communities have any issues, they can approach us,” he said. “They (Christian schools) should be transparent in holding prayers and issues related to conversion.”According to Christian bodies, missionary schools, especially in tribal areas, are under attack.They also claim applications for renewal of registration of seven missionary schools in Indore division have been refused. School education joint director of Indore division Hansa Arya rejected the applications on the ground that there was no clarity over land ownership. Arya refused to comment.Minister speaksHome minister Narottam Mishra refuted the allegation that he was supporting VHP and Bajrang Dal activists. “It’s my duty to save my culture and tradition. It is wrong to say that I am bearing Hindutva flag,” he said, adding that action will be taken against VHP and Bajrang Dal activists if they were found responsible.The minister said in MP the minority communities are not under fear and only those who are involved in wrong practices are scared.Hindu group functionaries such as Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh’s Dharm Jagran Smapark president, Omkaar Singh, said, “New schools, churches and hostels of Christian missionaries have come up to take advantage of the poor condition of people. This has been going on in the tribal districts of Jhabua and Alirapur for long.”The two pre-dominantly tribal districts are among the poorest in the country. In Jabhua, 68.86% of population is below poverty line and in Alirajpur, 71.31% is poor.
14-12-2021||India||Can’t blame Centre for delay in judicial appointments: Rijiju||The central government cannot be blamed for delay in judicial appointments because it is incumbent upon the government to do “due diligence” to ensure that a person is fit to be appointed as a judge, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju told the Rajya Sabha on Monday.Speaking during the debate in the Upper House on the bill to amend the judges’ salaries and services acts, the minister said, “The Department of Justice has to do due diligence. When we get names from High Court collegiums, a parallel list is sent to the Supreme Court collegium so that we can save precious time. There is a process for doing due diligence….if we find that a particular person is not fit to be a Judge, then how can we be forced to appoint him?” he said.The Rajya Sabha on Monday cleared and returned the bill to amend the High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 and the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958, to bring clarity concerning the date of eligibility of additional quantum of pension to retired judges of both Supreme Court and high courts.The High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021 was returned to the Lok Sabha as it is a money bill. The Upper House of Parliament has limited powers when it comes o money bills; these are passed by the Lok Sabha and sent to the Rajya Sabha merely for recommendations and suggestions; the Rajya Sabha has to send them back (with or without suggestions) within 14 days.The bill, passed by the Lok Sabha on December 8, will replace the high court judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 and the Supreme Court judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958.During the discussion on the bill, members of the Upper House raised issues related to vacant posts, the need to have a fixed cooling-off period for judges, inadequate representation of the SC/ST community in the judiciary, delays, and security of judges and inside courts among other issues.On the issue of inadequate representation of SC/ST and other backward classes, Rijiju said the government has written to chief justices of high courts stressing that while recommending names for consideration as judges, they should include names of candidates belonging to the “SC,ST or other backward classes and also women”.While placing the bill in the Rajya Sabha, Kiren Rijiju said, “This is a very limited amendment which we have brought in the said Acts and for a limited purpose. It is not going to affect in any manner the judges’ salaries. It is only related to a quantum jump in the pension of retired judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-blame-centre-for-delay-in-judicial-appointments-rijiju-101639419790201.html

14-12-2021||India||CBSE drops controversial passage, Sonia raises issue in House||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Monday decided to drop a controversial comprehension passage in the Class 10 English Board exam and give full marks to all students, following an uproar over the board allegedly promoting “gender stereotyping” and “regressive notions”.The passage, which featured in the exam on Saturday, drew sharp criticism as it appeared to draw a link between “lack of parental authority in the home” and “the emancipation of the wife”. “What people were slow to observe was that the emancipation of the wife destroyed the parent’s authority over children,” reads part of the passage to test comprehension of students in the examination. “It was only by accepting her husband’s sway that she (wife) could gain obedience from the young,” reads another part of the passage.In a statement, CBSE controller examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “The matter was referred to a committee of subject experts. As per their recommendations, it’s been decided to drop the passage No. 1 and it’s accompanying questions of the question paper series JSK/1. Full marks will be awarded for this passage to all students concerned.”“To maintain uniformity, full marks will be awarded to all students for passage No. 1 in all sets of the question paper of the Class 10 English language and literature exam,” he added.The clarification came even as Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in a rare intervention in Parliament, demanded an apology from the board over the “blatantly misogynist” passage and asked the Union education ministry to review gender sensitivity in its curriculum.Quoting from the controversial passage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha, “This contains atrocious statements such as ‘women gaining independence is the main reason for a wide variety of social and family problems’.” She further quoted the passage which claimed “wives stopped obeying their husbands” and that is “ the main reason why children and servants are undisciplined” , stressing on “children and servants” twice as she spoke.Claiming there is a “nationwide outrage regarding a shockingly regressive passage” in the comprehension section of the CBSE exam held on December 11, Gandhi said, “The entire passage is riddled with such condemnable ideas and the questions that follow are equally nonsensical.”In the Lok Sabha, Gandhi demanded that the CBSE should immediately withdraw this question and issue an apology. She also demanded a review to ensure such a mistake “never, never” happens again.The Congress president also sought a review on gender sensitivity standards in the curriculum.Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi also tweeted the controversial passage.

Just because you (Congress) are not doing anything, no one else will do it? this is not right....If anyone wants to defeat the BJP, then it’s up to them to support us.”During her speech, Banerjee on Monday also said that Mother Teresa was “very affectionate” towards her.“Mother Teresa was very affectionate to me,” Banerjee said in an election rally in the Christian-dominated constituency.“Once when the Left Front government was there (in power in West Bengal), at midnight she (Mother Teresa) rang me up and said, ‘Mamata, those leftists are capturing one house of ours. Can you help me?’ I went there and settled it and saved her,” said Bengal chief minister Banerjee, who is on a two-day tour of Goa ahead of the elections.Lone NCP MLA joins TMCThe NCP’s lone MLA in the state, Churchill Alemao, on Monday merged the party’s legislative wing with the TMC.“Why should I resign as MLA?

In light of low enrolments in the engineering and diploma programmes across the country, the committee in its interim report submitted in December recommended to continue the moratorium on approving new engineering colleges in the country barring a few exceptions,” Pradhan said in the statement.The committee’s recommendation comes at a time when engineering colleges in India recorded a 10-year-low in terms of the number of seats being offered this year. Officials cited the closure of over 340 colleges between 2018-19 and 2020-21 and the moratorium on opening of no new colleges as the reason behind drop in the number of seats. But despite this, the gap between admissions and capacity was significant.In his response in the Lok Sabha, the minister presented the data, according to which the total approved intake or capacity in AICTE approved engineering institutions declined from 26,95,333 from academic year 2012-13 to 23,66,728 in academic year 2021-22.The intake was 24,42,948 in 2020-21, and 25,39,682 in 2019-20.But according to the data, enrolment remained low . For instance, against the capacity of 24,42,948 in 2020-21, only 12,75,880 students enrolled, a capacity utilisation of 52.2%.In 2019-20, only 14,10,683 students enrolled against 25,39,682 seats, a capacity utilisation of 55.5% , and in 2018-19, only 14,16,319 did out of 27,11,068 available seats, a utilisation of 52.2%.

The high court on September 6 gave an interim direction staying coercive action against Adhikari even as it directed the state to file its response within four weeks.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said, “Since the high court is seized of the proceedings, and the special leave petitions arise from an interlocutory order, we are not inclined to exercise the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.”The Court allowed the state to file its response before the high court and move an application to lift the stay on the arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-interfere-with-calcutta-high-court-order-giving-relief-to-suvendu-101639418889717.html

Although airlines will be inducting new planes, it will mostly be replacements and not new purchases, experts said. However, the Indian aviation sector is likely to be benefitted both through fleet expansion and inducting fuel-efficient aircraft by replacing old ones, they said.Budget carrier SpiceJet will be inducting 50 B737Max aircraft by March 2023, chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said at a recent event, without specifying the total number of planes likely to be added to its fleet. Besides B737MAX, SpiceJet also uses Bombardier Q400 aircraft. Full-service carrier Vistara, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, aims to have around 70 aircraft by 2023, up from the current 49, industry insiders said, but declined to be named.Even so, it’s not certain that the recovery in domestic travel demand will hasten fleet expansions of Indian carriers because the pace was slackening even before the pandemic disruption, experts said.India’s scheduled airlines will together have over 1,000 aircraft, up from the current 710, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said last week.“Aircraft induction was essentially augmenting supply to meet growing demand,” said Dhiraj Mathur, former partner at PwC, a consultancy. “Currently, air demand has picked up and continues to grow.”“We plan to ramp up with the 350 plane order, which starts at the end of 2023 and, therefore, 2022 will be a sort of plateau,” said a spokesperson of budget carrier IndiGo.The Gurugram-based air carrier had announced plans to phase out all its A320 CEO planes with the more fuel-efficient A320NEO aircraft. IndiGo has 61 A320 CEOs in its fleet and has phased out around 60% of them between April 2020 and September 2021. All such planes will be phased out by financial year 2022-23, its spokesperson said. Vistara had leased nine Boeing 737 planes in 2019 from the lessors of Jet Airways after the latter was grounded in April 2019.The two airlines preparing to start operations are Akasa promoted by Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Jet 2.0 promoted by Jalan Kalrock Consortium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aircraft-deliveries-and-inductions-now-likely-to-resume-sayexperts-101639418649857.html

14-12-2021||India||New grouping of India, UAE, Israel, US to meet next year||The new grouping of India, Israel, the United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is expected to hold the first in-person meeting of foreign ministers in March 2022 to take forward an agenda focused on economic cooperation and infrastructure projects.The foreign ministers of the group, described in some quarters as a West Asian Quad, are expected to hold their meeting on the margins of Expo 2020 in Dubai, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The four countries have begun working on specific projects that could be taken up at the meet.The foreign ministers held their first virtual meeting on October 18 and decided to establish an international forum for economic cooperation.They also discussed ways to expand economic and political cooperation in the Middle East and Asia, and to enhance maritime security.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who was visiting Israel at the time, joined the meeting with his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid from Jerusalem. Jaishankar had said at the time that the four countries were looking to an “expeditious follow-up” to their first meeting.The four countries have insisted that the new grouping, which does not yet have a formal name, does not have a military element and is not directed against any country. Israeli ambassador Naor Gilon recently said there is no military angle to the ongoing cooperation and the four nations were pursuing a constructive agenda focused on the economy, especially infrastructure projects.The four countries have appointed senior officials to a joint working group that will come up with options for cooperation, the people cited above said.The meeting held in October had built on the momentum created by the Abraham Accords of last year.India has backed the Abraham Accords, through which Israel normalised relations with the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. India, Israel and the UAE have also stepped up trilateral cooperation, especially in trade and investment, since the US brokered the accords.It was inevitable that the new grouping would have a security overhang, said former ambassador Zikrur Rahman, who did several stints in West Asia. “Even when you discuss economic cooperation, shared security concerns are bound to come up,” he said.These concerns include money laundering and criminal activities, Rahman pointed out. “There is bound to be intelligence-sharing and closer coordination on the security front as economic cooperation and security are closely linked, especially in a region like West Asia,” he said.“The Abraham Accords have basically led to the opening up of the Gulf countries such as the UAE and Oman. A few countries, like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are proceeding more cautiously. They are not on the fast track as they will move after evaluating the pros and cons.“At the same time, countries that have opened up are looking to Israel to adopt more flexible views on matters such as the Palestinian issue in the hope that this could lead to some sort of rapprochement,” Rahman said.
14-12-2021||India||What is wrong with PM’s photo on vaccine certificate: Kerala HC||The Kerala high court on Monday questioned the credibility of a petition that challenged the use of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image on Covid-19 vaccine certificates.Hearing the petition, justice P V Kunhikrishnan asked the petitioner, who works at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Leadership, how the use of PM Modi’s photo on vaccine certificates differs from naming a university after former PM Nehru.“He (Modi) is our Prime Minister, not the PM of any other country. He came to power through a mandate. Merely because you have political differences, you cannot challenge this. Why are of ashamed of our PM? [If] 100 crore people do not have any issue with this, why do you? You are wasting judicial time,” the judge observed.The petitioner, Peter Myalparambhil, moved court in October arguing that using the Prime Minister’s image on Covid-19 vaccine certificates “has no substance, utility or relevance”.The counsel for the petitioner, Ajit M Joy, argued that the vaccine certificate was the petitioner’s private space and he has certain rights over it.He said that since the petitioner paid for the vaccine, the state can’t take credit for it. He also argued that it was a violation of the petitioner’s fundamental rights. The counsel pleaded that if the government insisted on using Modi’s photo on vaccine certificates, then there should also be an option to issue certificates without the PM’s image.The counsel argued that vaccination certificates in several other countries don’t have images of the head of the government. “They may not to be proud of their PM, but we are. He (Modi) became the PM because of the mandate of the people. We may have different political opinions, but still he is our PM,” the judge replied.The counsel for the Union government defended the use of the PM’s photo, saying Modi’s image along with his words on vaccine certificates will help create awareness about the inoculation drive against the coronavirus disease.Incidentally, when a question came up in the Upper House in August, Union minister of state for health and family welfare, Bharati Pawar, said that the PM’s image on vaccine certificates was ideal for promoting awareness of the vaccination drive.After hearing out both sides, the court said it needed time to go through the details and will issue an order at a later date.During a previous hearing on November 23 by a different bench, the court discouraged the petitioner, saying that his plea had larger implications and asked him how would it seem if someone came with a plea to remove Mahatma Gandhi’s image from currency notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-are-you-ashamed-court-to-petitioner-on-pm-s-image-on-vaccine-certificates-101639393688162.html
