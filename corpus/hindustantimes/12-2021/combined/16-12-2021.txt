16-12-2021||News||2021 in numbers: Inflation facing producers||The cost of producing goods is an important factor that determines prices for consumers. If the cost of production rises, producers are likely to pass on the additional cost to consumers, as long as it does not collapse the demand for the product to the extent that the volume of sales and profits don’t get adversely affected. It is this cost that producers face that the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) captures. How did WPI inflation fare in 2021? The following two charts explain this.

The issue they are worried about is her transportation to school. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the school bus fees have been hiked. As both of are working, they are completely dependent on the school bus for transportation of their child to school and back. “Our daughter is in Class 3 and the school is 8km away from our house. In the pandemic, I lost my job and all our savings are about to finish. My wife is working, but we have to manage our monthly budget. Now our regular van driver has increased the fees from the earlier ₹600 to ₹1,000. We are already struggling to pay the school fees and now every month, these bus fees are also going to affect our budget,” said Shastri. From December 16 onwards, schools in Pune city have been allowed to reopen for Classes 1 to 7, after consent from parents. Another parent Archana Singh said, “Both my sons used to go to school by bus. Now when the school is re-opening we have been informed to pay ₹2,000 per student initially for school bus transportation and then every month fees will be taken. Earlier we used to pay ₹800 per month for one student. School bus fees are going to increase due to the fuel hike.” Speaking anonymously, a principal of a prominent school in Pune said, “We have 20 school buses, but they have been parked for almost two years. Some have major repair works due as the vehicles not running for a long period. So obviously school bus fees are going to be increased from this academic year, looking at fuel hike prices.” The school bus owner’s association is demanding proper guidelines to start services for students.Kiran Desai, executive president, Pune bus owners’ association said, “The state government had issued the guidelines in October, but they didn’t publish it for the public. Now when we have the guidelines, and one of the major issues is of transporting 50 per cent of children at one time. It is not profitable for any of the bus or van owners and also now only five months of school is left. So starting the bus service at this point is very difficult for us and financially it will affect on our business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hike-in-bus-fees-adds-to-parents-worries-about-school-transport-101639677048925.html

16-12-2021||Pune||Pune’s ‘khau gallis’ buzzing again... with Covid norms the casualty||PUNE As universities and colleges in Pune reopened up for offline classes, students from across the country are also returning to the city. Food joints, snack centres and messes around the city are now seeing an increase in business. At the same time social distancing and Covid rules at these food outlets are not being followed. There are several eateries outside college areas – the areas now colloquially known as “khau gallis”, where crowds of youth can now been. Right from Bharati Vidyapeeth College area to outside the MIT college in Kothrud and around the Hatti Ganpati chowk in Sadashiv peth, the khau gallis are bustling again. “We daily hang with friends at the khau galli outside our college. I was missing the campus for the last two years, but now, as college lectures have begun all us friends are meeting up daily. As I stay in a rented flat with friends, we go to a food mess for lunch and dinner,” said Sagar Shukla, a student from Bharati Vidyapeeth college. Priyanka Karne from SP College said, “As the colleges were closed for last almost two years, we friends were not able to meet. Now as the offline classes have started, we now daily meet up at one of our favorite snack centres outside the college. The fun with friends and studying physically was missing.”At most of these khau gallis Covid norms are not strictly followed. Most do not wear face masks and even social distancing has gone for a toss. Despite action taken and penalties imposed on, the fear of Covid is gone and youth have become somewhat careless. Rohan Nalawade, owner of a food joint in Sadashiv peth said, “In the last 1.5 years there was hardly any business as most of the times the shop was closed due to lockdown and when we opened up, due to colleges closed few students used to come. After Diwali students have started coming back to Pune and now the number of my regular student customers has increased. It has given a boost to our business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-khau-gallis-buzzing-again-with-covid-norms-the-casualty-101639676812135.html
16-12-2021||Lucknow||‘Dowry’ was sought for giving a job in previous regime: UP CM||In a sharp attack on the previous Samajwadi Party (SP) government over the alleged corrupt recruitment process then, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said during 2012-2017, “dahej lekar naukri di jaati thi” (dowry was sought for giving a job). “Now, Uttar Pradesh has undergone a complete transformation and its image before the country and across the globe has changed,” he added.The CM made the statement while handing over appointment letters to 58 sub-divisional magistrates, 34 district basic education officers, 43 senior lecturers, District Education and Training Institute, 173 review officers, 398 sugarcane supervisors, 10 senior cane development inspectors, 208 assistant engineers and 236 stenos selected through Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) and Subordinate Services Selection Commission (UPSSSC).Congratulating the newly appointed officers, the CM was quoted as saying by a government statement: “You are the backbone of making the state number one economy in the country. If the backbone breaks, the entire system falls. The previous governments had made this state without a backbone. We intend to bring the state to number one place in the country with efficient people like you.”“Good governance is not possible merely by changing the government. Rather the entire system needs to be reformed,” he said. Underscoring employment generation under his government, the CM said his government had established an honest, fair and transparent work culture because of which the state was progressing fast.Comparing the Samajwadi Party with the characters of Mahabharata, he said earlier the recruitment process was compromised on the lines of caste and money alleging that as soon as any recruitment process used to start in the state, the characters of Mahabharata used to become active for “vasooli” (extortion).“Earlier, the appointment of an SDM was done in lieu of a sum of ₹42 to 65 lakh. A CBI investigation in this regard is still going on. Money was also extorted from eligible candidates,” the CM said. “UP’s economy that was on 6th position in the country four-and-a-half years ago, is India’s second-biggest economy today.” Yogi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dowry-was-sought-for-giving-a-job-in-previous-regime-up-cm-101639676748582.html

Strict action will be taken against those who flout the order, the government added, according to news agency PTI.The order has been given in view of such a notice issued by a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in 2020, which now is being challenged in the Delhi high court. Owing to the notice, the woman was restrained indoors by her parents, compelling her spouse to lodge a habeas corpus plea in the court, the PTI report stated.In August this year, a contempt petition was filed in the high court against the notice by the SDM to the parents of the couple.The high court in an order in 2009 had issued directions pertaining to the solemnisation of marriage under Chapter II of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. At the time, the court had particularly ordered against sending any notice to the residence of the parties getting registered under the Act or their parents.The latest order, filed by the revenue department of Delhi government on December 10, stated that court order from 2009 was earlier communicated to all deputy commissioners with a request to provide directions to the concerned registrar of marriages under their jurisdiction for strict adherence to the protocol, according to the PTI report. The marriage officer of the registrar could also exhibit the notice on the office notice board.The revenue department's order said that officials must abide by the high court order in “letter and spirit” and “in totality without fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-notice-to-couples-parents-registering-under-spl-marriage-act-delhi-govt-101639674532791.html

16-12-2021||Mumbai||State’s Mission 3,000 a failure||Mumbai: As cases peaked during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, (active cases touched 69,858 on April 22) the state government rolled out Mission Oxygen Swavalamban (self-reliance) in May in a bid to avoid oxygen shortage witnessed in many parts of the country during the second wave. The state set a target of augmenting oxygen production — needed in hospitals to treat severe cases — to 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) a day. In the first phase of the mission, the target was to augment production by 2,300MT within six months and the remaining 700 MT within two years. However, as of December, production has increased only by 350 MT — that’s a shortfall of nearly 2,000 MT of the required target. At the peak, around 10% of the active patients required oxygen supply and the total oxygen requirement was 1,800 MT a day. At the time, the state’s capacity was 1,300 MT a day, which forced the government to obtain oxygen from other states. This meant a loss of both money to the state exchequer and treatment time; the state also lacked infrastructure to store the oxygen. With cases of Omicron, the new variant of concern, detected in the state, experts said that self-reliance in oxygen production is the need of the hour. However, in order to reach its first-phase target of 2,300 MT, the state will need another six to seven months. Here’s why: the state hoped to generate 1,700 MT of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from private industrial units. Till now, it has achieved only 10% or 175 MT of that amount. “The third wave of the pandemic was predicted in September-October though it has fortunately not hit the state so far. With the emergence of new variant Omicron, a fresh wave may hit Maharashtra in the coming few weeks. If it is driven by Omicron or similar and multi-fold transmissible variant, the number of the active patients is expected to be much bigger. For such a scenario, we had set the target of reaching the production of oxygen to 2,300MT, but could not achieve it as the generation from the LMOs in the private sector is taking longer,” a state official requesting anonymity said. The current daily capacity of production from all sources (which includes private LMO units and Pressure Swing Adsorption or PSA plants) is 1,650 MT. The mission According to government officials, if the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic hits the state, the projection of the peak active cases is 1,295,211. To cater to this projected number, the state will need a concomitant number of beds and medicines as well as an oxygen supply. Of the final target of 3000 MT, 10% is expected to come from the local sources like supply through cylinders, while 20% (600 MT) is expected to be generated from PSA plants. In order to achieve this, the government calculated that 529 PSA plants will be needed, which will cumulatively generate 645 MT of oxygen daily. Of these, 423 are government-owned, including 68 funded from the PM Cares and 16 are owned by Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). The rest of the PSAs are owned by private entities. At least 366 PSA units have been operationalised which have a cumulative generation of 379 MT a day. The major quantum of the aspired production will come from LMO units run by private enterprises. The state industries department set a target of 1,700 MT and also rolled out a policy in May to encourage private industry to either expand their existing plants or build new ones. The state cabinet cleared the policy which allowed for tax waivers, incentives on terms of capital grants, and making land available at concessional rates among other things. The state government is expected to bear the burden of ₹1,100 crore towards these incentives and concessions. The state government has also decided to set up storage tanks at the district level to ensure that a stock of oxygen supply of three days is at hand. “We have received 200 storage tanks mostly with the capacity of 10 kilolitres from the Emergency Covid Response Fund of the Central government. Major thrust during the emergency is on LMO plants, as the pressure and purity of this form of gas is better,” an official from the public health department said. Other sources include 200MT from 57 proposed Air Separation Unit (ASUs). The current status Six months after it battled to obtain the required quantum during the second wave, the daily production capacity of the O2 is still at 1650MT. Harshadeep Kamble, development commissioner, industries department said that 30 of 70 units with whom the state signed an agreement have gone into production. “The 30 plants have started producing 175 MT in addition to the existing installed capacity of 1200 MT. Bigger units would be operational between March and July 2022 as they take a year to go into production. We expect the target to be achieved by then. One of the biggest plants among them is 75MT-capacity plant in Nagpur and another by a leading company in Aurangabad.” According to an official from the health department, though the state government has given nod to the private players, some of them are wary about the demand-supply gap if the production exceeded the demand. “It requires a huge investment and lot of time to set up the plant. Even though the industries have come forward to set up the plant, they are not sure if there would be demand to the generated oxygen for industrial use after pandemic is over,” an official said. Kamble said that the industries can sell their excessive production of the oxygen for the industrial use to other states in the country if they have excessive production. Industries minister Subhash Desai said that they expect the capacity augmentation by 1,700 MT once all the plants are operationalised. “We have signed MoUs with the industries for the generation of the LMO and the projects are at various stages of installation. They have identified/acquired lands, placed orders to import the machinery. Erection of the plants is underway. The production from many of them will begin soon. We have given an incentive of capital grants up to 150% on their actual capital investments and have received good response to the policy,” he said. Covid scenario The current oxygen production is around 1,100MT of which 750MT is used by industries and 300 MT is used for the medical use. Even if we augment our capacity, there is no demand for more than 1000 MT including all purposes, said an official from the food and drug administration (FDA). Dr Avinash Bhondwe, past president, Indian Medical Association said, “The third wave is predicted to hit the state in January. Looking at the transmissibility of Omicron which is 5-6 times more than Delta variant, the active patients number would be too high in the third wave. We however have not been prepared with the health infrastructure. The oxygen production capacity should have been three times or at least 3600MT by now, but we have failed to achieve it. Similar is the case with ramping up of the bed capacity and procurement of medicines.” Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government is prepared if the third wave struck. “Every hospital at the tehsil level has PSA plant installed with the captive capacity of the generation, which was not in place during the second wave. I am not aware about the status of the LMO plants, but we are in sound position as far as the oxygen production is concerned. We have 3-tier system in place for the oxygen supply by LMO plants, PSA and cylinders. We can always procure oxygen from other states as well in case of the need. There is possibility of the third wave in the month of February, but we are all prepared for it,” he said.

They may stay there for few months, interact with engineers and workers who were involved in construction of these magnificent temples,” she added.“It is for teachers and students to learn how the construction work at the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project costing ₹900 crore was accomplished within two years. Likewise, in Ayodhya the major challenge was of the soil beneath. Experts from various IITs worked hard to ensure that no damage is caused to the temple in the next 1000 years,” the governor said.“Similarly, Saryu Nahar National Project, which remained stuck for nearly four decades, was launched recently. Due to prolonged delay, the cost increased manifold which is a matter of regret,” she added. She also emphasised the use of technology, innovation, experience and knowledge in the construction of a strong and self-sufficient India.The governor called upon teachers of universities and degree colleges to visit primary schools and interact with students. Likewise, students may visit Aganwadi centres and spend time with children maybe on their birthdays. She congratulated the students on receiving their degrees and medals.Former IIT Kanpur director Padam Shri Prof Sanjay G Dhande, who was the chief guest at the ceremony, said, “The real world is a dynamic system. It changes. After Covid, it is changing rapidly. In this changing scenario, some skills become obsolete and some become new and such skills are the in-demand skills.”“Acquiring new skills on your own is the real skill that is required to today’s world. In this sense, I consider the story of Ekalavya very important. He learnt and acquired all skills of archery on his own. He also sacrificed his thumb as ‘Guru Dakshina’ and still acquired the skill of archery through his legs,” he added.“Education is a pull model and not a push model. Unfortunately, many students due to pressure of parents, friends and others feel as if they were forced to study something which they do not wish to study. There is certainly some hunger in each young person,” Prof Dhande said. State technical education minister Jitin Prasada and AKTU vice chancellor Prof Vineet Kansal were also present on the occasion.

16-12-2021||Pune||4 years after launch, ‘village of books’ Bhilar has 35 homes housing 30K books||PUNE The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to set up a ‘book villages’ in all the districts. The idea is inspired by Bhilar in Satara district wherein the concept of a book village was launched in 2017. Sitting between Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar, this little strawberry village is based on the concept of Hay-on-Wye, a Welsh village known for its book stores. The idea was floated by the Rajya Marathi Vikas Sanstha and state education minister Vinod Tawde, and, on May 4, 2017, the village was given its formal identity of Pustakanche Gao (village of books). In 2017, the village had a collection of 15,000 Marathi books in 25 homes. Now, in 2021, the village has 30,000 books in 35 homes. The collection has become more diverse with English and Hindi books making it to the shelves. Now, after four years of its launch, the government is now set to replicate this success model in other districts. According to Vinay Mavlankar, project head in Bhilar the response from the locals and the visitors has been exceptional and it is still growing. “We also conduct other activities related to literature, book readings and literature festivals. This community is growing. In our office in Bhilar there are 50-70 daily visitors. On weekends and holidays this number increases. We are hoping to have 50 homes to host the books. Gradually this number is increasing. Locals in Bhilar have shown exceptional commitment to this project,” he said. In the first phase one such village would be set up in five other revenue divisions in the state. Government has also allotted an annual budget of 19 crore 79 lakh for this initiative. “The process to identify such villages which may have potential to become the village of books is going on. While selecting the village we will have to consider many factors such as the commitment of the locals, cultural foundation and how much of the footfall it would receive. It has to be built through the participation of the people,” said Sanjay Patil, director Rajya Marathi Vikas Sanstha, a state government’s organisation which operates the project in Bhilar. Every road in Bhilar leads to different categories of the books. The brightly painted homes depict the genres they host and a curious reader can simply walk into the room full of books and explore the collection. According to Santosh Sawant, a local of Bhilar who has volunteered to give a room for the collection of books, the readers and the books have now become an integral part of his day-to-day life. “Home is open for the readers from 7 am to 7.30 pm. They can sit for as long as they want and read. This has now become an integral part of our lives. This project has given a new identity to our village and has enriched our lives,” he said. Bhilar is a village known for organically cultivated strawberries. There are mostly farmers in the village. “Books have helped our strawberries. Visitors who come from different towns rarely go without tasting the strawberries. Our children also like to read books. This concept has helped to sow the seeds of reading culture again in our village,” said Nilesh Bhilare, a resident of Bhilar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4-years-after-launch-village-of-books-bhilar-has-35-homes-housing-30k-books-101639674468232.html

16-12-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt presents ₹8479.53 crore mini poll budget||The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday presented a mini poll budget, seeking an additional sum of ₹8479.53 crore as the second supplementary demands for grants for 2021-22 to distribute largesse to the unorganised sector labourers, increase the pension of persons of old age and farmers and ensure 24-hour power supply ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in the state.An interim budget proposing an expenditure of ₹5,45,370.69 crore and estimated receipts of ₹5,44.836.56 crore, leaving a deficit of ₹534.13 crore, was also presented for 2022-23 to get a vote on account passed for the first few months of the next financial year to meet committed expenditure in view of the 2022 assembly polls.Minister for finance Suresh Khanna presented the supplementary demands for grants for 2021-22 even as the opposition members continued to shout slogans, demanding the dismissal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni, who they said, was responsible for the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that erupted as a vehicle mowed down farmers protesting against three farm laws there on October 3.The state government’s supplementary budget for ₹8479.53 crore includes central assistance of ₹660.00 crore. The supplementary demands would, therefore, cause a burden of only ₹ 7819.53 crore on the consolidated fund. This includes a demand of ₹4000 crore to provide assistance to labourers of unorganized sector. A sum of ₹3382 crore has been included in the demands in various heads under the power sector. A sum of ₹1000 crore has been earmarked for the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited to ensure 24-hour power supply in the state.An additional sum of ₹670 crore has been allocated for an increase in the pension of persons of old age and farmers’ pension in the state.

On August 18, 2021, it presented the first supplementary budget of ₹7301.52 crore for 2021-22 to provide large or even token sums for various schemes.“As expected, the UP government has used the opportunity of the second supplementary budget to impress and provide relief to important sections of voters like farmers and workers in the unorganised sector. However, the proposed aid to informal sector workers is to be appreciated as they are among the most vulnerable sections of people for whom there is hardly any social security. The government’s focus seems to be on the rural sector to which more than 70% of population and voters belong,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics, Lucknow University.HIGHLIGHTS ₹4000 crore has been earmarked to provide assistance to labourers of unorganised sector.  ₹1000 crore demanded for UPPCL to ensure 24-hour power supply. ₹372 crore for funding of power distribution companies under the UDAY scheme. ₹1350 crore has been demanded as compensation to UPPCL. ₹300 crore for carrying out power distribution works under Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti schemes.  ₹185 crore has been allocated for electricity under Pradhanmantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana.  ₹175 crore has been allocated for Saubhagya Yojana of Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti scheme for construction of high-tension infrastructure. ₹1 lakh has been allocated for construction of model road and different other works from Rajghat bridge to Ramnagar for smooth Kashi Vishwanath Jyotirling Darshan and Ganga Aarti Darshan. ₹167 crore has been earmarked for blind, deaf and dumb and physically disabled persons in the state. ₹670 crore has been allocated for increase in pension of persons of old age and farmers’ pension in the state. ₹100 crore has been allocated to increase the limit of the chief minister’s discretionary fund. ₹150 crore has been allocated to information department for publicity. ₹1 lakh has been allocated for maintenance of freedom struggle museum in Shahjahanpur. ₹1 lakh has been allocated for giving Uttar Pradesh Gaurav Samman to​ honour those who have brought laurels to the state at national and international level. ₹10 crore has been earmarked under different heads for sports department.

16-12-2021||Lucknow||Genome sequencing: Covid samples from Uttar Pradesh to be sent to Delhi||Covid samples for genome sequencing from Uttar Pradesh will now be sent to New Delhi to avoid wastage of testing kits.Health officials say this is being done to avoid wastage of kits that test a fixed number of samples, while the need at present is to test less of them.“One kit has the capacity to test 96 samples at a time. This means if less samples are tested, the remaining vials go waste. Hence, at present, samples are being sent to the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in New Delhi,” said Dr Ved Vrat Singh, director general medical health, Uttar Pradesh.The National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) lab in Lucknow that has INSACOG lab can test up to 96 samples for genome testing in one go and it costs around ₹ 2.5 lakh.Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium or INSACOG is a multi-laboratory, multi-agency, pan-India network to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 by a sentinel sequencing effort. Not all labs can conduct genome sequencing unless they are in the consortium.The first batch of 22 samples was tested at the NBRI lab. The decision to send samples to Delhi was taken for the second batch, said Dr Singh. If the samples increase, tests will be done in Lucknow only, he said.Genome sequencing is being recommended keeping in view the new Covid variant Omicron that has been reported in several countries and some Indian states. Travellers from other countries, including those marked as ‘at risk’, are coming to India and also Uttar Pradesh.“Since we are getting less daily Covid cases in the state at present, hence we plan the genome sequencing for all,” said Dr Singh.“We are ready to conduct genome sequencing as and when demanded,” said NBRI director Dr SK Barik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/genome-sequencing-covid-samples-from-uttar-pradesh-to-be-sent-to-delhi-101639673689691.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||No new Omicron case yet, Rajesh Tope warns of possible third wave||Mumbai The state did not record any fresh Omicron variant cases on Thursday; so far the state has 32 confirmed cases of the new variant of concern.A day after the state health department made a forecast that Maharashtra would see a large number of Omicron cases in January, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that Omicron may be the reason behind the third wave of Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra.“Looking at the experience in other countries, the third wave would be of Omicron. We have seen in other countries that the Delta variant was completely replaced... We can’t predict the exact numbers or how big [the wave will be], but the cases are expected to go up in January and February,” Tope told HT. Officials, however, are not calling it the beginning of the next wave. “These numbers have to maintain a week-on-week growth to say that the curve is turning upwards. These districts have been reporting a chunk of the state’s daily cases. There can be a weekly shift due to various factors including increased surveillance, more tests, etc.” a health department official said.The minister added that even though the state anticipates a surge in cases, there is no immediate plan to introduce any curbs and a call will be taken in due course. “To keep the transmission low, we have to ensure that the Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed and not just during the Christmas celebration and year-end festivities, but also otherwise,” he said. Tope added that the state is prepared to tackle the third wave. The state administration is prepared with the health infrastructure, including beds, medical oxygen supply, critical drugs, availability of doctors and frontline staff, etc.“We have the experience from the first two waves, and we have started preparations long before [Omciron]. Maharashtra can arrange about 1800-2000 MT of oxygen if required. We have 400,000 beds available, paediatric beds are also ready. We have doctors and nurses available. We cannot manufacture doctors... Like we did in the second wave, we can press in final-year students, but we do not anticipate a lot of hospitalisation. With the data available, so far, Omicron does not lead to mass hospitalisation and the death rate is also not scary,” he said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra added 877 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the tally to 6,646,938. It reported 19 COvid-19 deaths, pushing the death toll to 141,317. Mumbai added 272 fresh Covid infections, taking its tally to 766166.

According to police, the deceased has been identified as Shanti Devi and Amrendra Kumar and the reason behind the incident is suspected to be a property dispute. A suspect has been detained on the basis of statements by villagers, police added. Police further informed that on Thursday morning, the niece of the deceased, identified as Madhuri Devi (32) allegedly poured kerosene in the victim’s room and set it on fire while they were asleep, and bolted the room. As smoke started billowing, villagers rushed to the house in a bid to save them, but it was too late. They immediately informed the police about the incident. Angry villagers later caught the accused and her child and thrashed them. They were rescued only after police reached the spot. According to police, the husband of the deceased died five years ago and they had adopted a child, whose marriage negotiations were going on. Sharing more details, police said that the accused was forcing the deceased to register her entire property in her name. But after the deceased refused to do so, a scuffle ensued between them. One of the victim’s relative Sangita Devi said that the deceased received ₹5 lakh from the state government after her husband, who was an employee of Bihar Fire Services, died. On getting information, the accused reached the house of the deceased and forced her to withdraw the amount and hand it over to her. She also told reporters that the husband of the deceased had left behind some land and a house. Additional SP (Phulwarisharif) Manish Kumar while confirming the deaths, said that preliminary investigation suggests that the accused didn’t want the deceased to transfer her property to an adopted child. “The charred bodies have been sent for post mortem at the Danapur Sadar hospital. The real cause of the death will only be clear after the post mortem report,” the additional SP said.

Many schools reported that parent consent to send students is forthcoming, and attendance will increase gradually. According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), in 787 private schools in PMC limits, at least 24,114 students attended school, which is six per cent of the total strength. Whereas in 272 PMC-run schools, at least 19,047 students attended school on the first day, which is 23 per cent of the total students.A majority of students from private schools were in Kondhwa and Yewalewadi and in PMC run schools the maximum number of students who attended school were from Hadapsar, PMC officials said. Speaking about the enthusiasm of students, Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association said that the turnout was more than expected.“There was a good turnout at schools as the schools reopened almost after one-and-a-half year. The students were greeted with enthusiasm and happiness of teachers had no bounds,” said Gaikwad. Medha Sinnarkar, principal at Laxmanrao Apte Prashala said that 50 per cent of students attended school on the first day.“We are permitted to have 50 per cent students. So of the total capacity of 400 students, we can have 200 students. Of these,100 students were present from Class 5 to Class 7 on the first day. The turnout was unexpectedly good as earlier parents had their reservations due to Omicron cases in the city,” said Sinnarkar. She added that in the first few days, the focus of the curriculum will be to reacquaint students with offline classes.“We will for the next few days, focus on interactive and creative activities which will help students reacquaint themselves with school life. From next week, we are planning to start revision of important topics and slowly focus on the current syllabus,” said Sinnarkar. Archana Panch, vice-principal at Raman Bagh English School said that parent consent is increasing, but transport is an issue.“Till December 31, it is mandatory for parents to drop their children. Post that we have made it compulsory for rickshaw drivers who are using local transport to submit vaccination certificate with both doses. We had around 25 per cent attendance at schools and the turnout is likely to improve in the next few days. We have school for Class 5 to Class 7, from 3pm to 5:30pm, which has helped manage the inflow of children. Many parents have noted that transport is an issue at this point,” said Panch. Another teacher from Muktangan English School and Junior College said that the turnout was 10 per cent at every class.“The turnout was good. It will slowly rise as we go ahead. We have observed a similar trend for Class 8 to Class 10. Initially, parents are a little hesitant to send their children, but as others attend school the parents’ consent increases. We will be going ahead with a hybrid way of teaching with online and offline teaching simultaneously going on,” said the teacher, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/back-to-school-in-pune-attendance-better-than-expected-on-day-one-101639672908174.html

Notices have also been issued to family members from both sides (two members from each side),” he said The Supreme Court in 2018 read down Section 377 of the penal code and ruled that sex between consenting adults was not an offence. Anand said the top court also ruled that any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates fundamental rights.In June last year, the Uttarakhand high court underlined that while the law does not recognise gay marriage, consensual cohabitation between two adults of the same sex was not illegal or a crime. The observation was made during a hearing into a petition by a woman alleging that her partner, with whom the she was in a consensual relationship since 2016, was being wrongfully confined by her mother and brother.The high court did not issue any directions in this case after the person alleged to have been detained told the high court that she was not being held against her will.

16-12-2021||Mumbai||Panje wetlands in Uran returns to life with resumption of tidal water: Greens||With the resumption of free flow of tidal water, Panje wetlands in Uran have come back to life. The water started attracting migratory birds after a gap close to two years and the fishing community too has started having a good catch, claims environmentalist.“This signals the tremendous potential the wetland has. Crabs and fish are found in the saline water here and most importantly, they breed in the adjoining mangroves,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.The quality of fish caught here is so good that they fetch over ₹400 a kg in the market, crabs sell at over ₹1,800 a kg and lobsters at ₹700 a kg.“This wetland, with its fantastic biodiversity, can contribute to the socio-economic development of the fishing community-dominated four villages – Panje, Dronagiri, Funde and Boikadvira – surrounding the 289ha water body,” said BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation.BNHS studies have shown that over 50 species of birds land here during the October-May season of avian flights via the Central Asian Flyway.BNHS director, Bivash Pandav, said Panje is so beautiful and best suited for these birds that we must conserve it at any cost. He supported the NatConnect idea of conserving the wetland as a Biodiversity Park of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).In this context, NatConnect appealed to the State Government to implement its decision taken in December 2015 to maintain Panje (and NRI/TSC wetlands) as bird sanctuaries. The Wildlife Board, presided over by then CM Devendra Fadnavis had taken such a decision.The Shiv Sena, which leads the MVA government now, was also part of the BJP-Sena alliance government. Any delay would only cause damage to the biodiversity property, Pawar said and pointed out that vested interests have managed to block tidal water entry and exit at Panje wetland to render it dry to suit plans to convert the place into a concrete jungle. It was at Pawar’s instance that the National Green Tribunal had ordered clearing of the choke points at Panje.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/panje-wetlands-in-uran-returns-to-life-with-resumption-of-tidal-water-greens-101639669907672.html

The pod hotel saw 146 bookings in the month of November since being inaugurated on November 17. While the first two weeks of December saw 263 bookings by passengers.The railways’ first-ever pod hotel at Mumbai Central railway station has 48 capsule (pod)-like rooms. Full occupancy in a week means more than 300 bookings per week. Railway officials said that the response was less than what they anticipated but attributed the same to the fact that less number of people are travelling due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “People continue to be afraid which is why there are less passengers travelling by outstation trains. That is the reason for low bookings. We are anticipating more people to book the pods through the end of December and in January,” said a senior Indian Rail Catering Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) official.The railways’ first pod hotel was inaugurated by the minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve on November 17. The first floor of the Mumbai Central railway station building houses the pod hotel which has 48 capsule-like rooms including classic pods, private pods, and separate pods for women and persons with disability. n order to get more passengers to book the pod hotel, the IRCTC has reduced the prices of the pods and now pods are available for 24 hours at Rs.999 and for 12 hours at Rs.799.

The Ram Temple in Ayodhya is being built by Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The state government had constituted the DRA in December 2020, with its headquarters in Varanasi. In June 2021, senior IAS officer Deepak Agarwal, divisional commissioner of Varanasi, was appointed the first director of the DRA. He was given the responsibility to set up the DRA headquarters in Varanasi, select staff and prepare a full draft of role, responsibilities and domain of the directorate, as well as division of work. Agarwal said, “The Directorate of Religious Affairs will ensure development in areas around prominent religious places, including the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Beautifying the localities around the religious places and setting up facilities will be done on priority basis.” Agarwal said that the DRA had already started working on a plan. The development at these places would be as per the vision of the government. In association with the district administration and the development authority concerned, developmental works will first be done around religious places which draw huge crowd of devotees, like Ayodhya, Mathura, Naimisharanya, Chitrakoot and Vindhyachal, among others. Basic facilities like proper roads, rest houses, lighting, drinking water and tourist facility centre would be developed in the vicinity of the temples or shrines, said Agarwal. With its headquarters in Varanasi, the DRA will also focus on infra development around the prominent religious places of Kashi. In addition, there was a plan to development mini restaurants where the visitors and devotees may have food, added Agarwal. He said that the DRA was also working on a plan to develop facilities like online darshan and sugam darshan for the devotees. The directorate will have a staff of 19 people, including two joint directors, an accounts officer, two office superintendents, three stenographers, two establishment assistants, two computer assistants, three drivers and three instructors. Some of the officials would come on deputation from other departments, while the remaining staff would be recruited or outsourced, said Agrawal, adding that a building for the DRA office would be finalised soon. The state government has already released ₹2 crore to the DRA for setting up its office and procuring vehicles and other equipment. A handsome amount through the DRA has been transferred to the Ayodhya administration for infra development in the city, as per an official. To note, a separate Charitable Affairs Department was created on December 19, 1985 for works related to the administration of charitable institutions and temples. After 35 years, its directorate was created in December 2020. 
16-12-2021||Patna||After JD(U), RJD pitches for 'special status' to Bihar||The RJD on Thursday pitched for the Centre granting 'special status' to Bihar, making a common cause with the state's ruling Janata Dal (United) whose strident demand for it has drawn unenthusiastic response from its own ally BJP.RJD leader Manoj Kumar Jha moved a notice for adjournment motion in Rajya Sabha to discuss the issue.Though his plea was not admitted as is the case with almost all such adjournment notices in Parliament, Bihar's main opposition party's stand highlighted its convergence with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) over yet another issue after their shared pitch for caste census, even as the BJP has suggested its opposition on both counts.Also Read | Using Niti Aayog report, Bihar pitches for special status againNoting that Bihar was relegated to the bottom on most of the indicators by NITI Aayog in its sustainable development goals (SDGs) ranking for states, Jha said it should be a matter of collective anxiety and concern, and told PTI that the state's Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav asked him to raise the issue in Parliament to highlight the state's need for special status.He asserted that the RJD was the first party to make a pitch for it soon after Bihar was divided in 2000 and the then chief minister Rabri Devi raised it before the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who was "sympathetic" to the demand.It is the JD(U) which has shared the RJD's demand and not the other way round, Jha said, adding that Kumar made the issue a "political football".Biharis in any party should support the demand, he said, adding anybody who is concerned about national progress should realise that it cannot happen without the state's progress."You have to give wholesome focus on Bihar's transformation. And this cannot be without granting it special status," Jha said.Recently, BJP leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Renu Devi had drawn Kumar's ire for claiming that the demand is "meaningless" as the Centre has been providing all-round support to the state's development.Kumar has said she lacked detailed information, and the special status demand is totally justified.Jha made light of the BJP leader's assertion, alleging that the BJP is a "one-man party and even if its leaders feel it is needed they don't have the guts and wherewithal to speak their mind and open their heart".The Centre should revise its stand as India cannot become a USD 5 trillion economy if Bihar lags on all development parameters, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that his government has been working to make India a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024.For Bihar, Kumar has repeatedly sought special status, which grants various benefits and tax incentives for a state.Though former finance minister Arun Jaitley in 2015 had made it clear that the issue was no longer relevant after the constitutional award by the 14th Finance Commission for sharing of tax resources between the Centre and states, Kumar has been persistent about it despite the BJP's indifference.The latest NITI Aayog ranking has again fuelled the demand.The issue has again highlighted lack of cohesion between the JD(U) and the BJP, two parties which share power in the state, over key issues, with leaders of the two parties often making conflicting comments on different matters and even taking potshots at each other.Simmering differences between the two allies had come to fore in Lok Sabha on Tuesday as well when BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav during the Question Hour expressed disappointment with the Bihar government not being able to complete approved works under 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana'.Rural Development Minister Giriraj Singh, a BJP MP from the state like Yadav, cited data in his answer that backed his party colleague's claim, prompting JD(U) member Kaushalendra Kumar to ask if Singh had ever sought meetings with state government officials over the issue.Singh said he had held several meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/after-jd-u-rjd-pitches-for-special-status-to-bihar-101639667275729.html

The police firing at protesters gathered against sacrilege had also killed Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village“Political leaders have built their careers on this issue, but have done nothing to ensure the accused are behind the bars and justice,” Sukhraj said, adding, “Now, politicians are again using sacrilege and police firing for mileage in the assembly polls due next year. We are the ones who are suffering.”He targeted deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa for failing to ensure even as he had held the home portfolio for months. Initially, Sukhraj planned to carry out a protest march from Behbal Kalan to Kotkapura on Thursday. He was joined by Gurjeet’s father Sadhu Singh, Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann, AAP leader and Kotkapura MLA Kultar Sandhwan and Dal Khalsa spokesperson, Kanwar Pal Singh. Kanwar Pal said, “The victim’s son has resolved to go for an indefinite sit-in due to the total failure of the Punjab government. He is sitting at the same spot where his father was killed in cold blood, under a conspiracy. This is Sukhraj’s personal war, but we have endorsed it and extended moral support to the cause. Our members will join him on rotation. Sukhraj has relaunched the Morcha single-handedly,” he added. The SIT has named former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IGP Paramraj Singh Umranangal as accused, and filed a charge-sheet against them. Now, a trial is going on against them in a court at Faridkot. The Punjab and Haryana high court, however, has stayed proceedings against Saini till February 2022 following which the accused have filed a number of pleas, further delaying the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/behbal-kalan-police-firing-victim-s-son-starts-indefinite-sit-in-at-protest-site-for-justice-101639667627293.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Man arrested in Thane for duping 26 women on matrimonial sites||The Kapurbawdi police have arrested an alleged serial conman who is accused of duping at least 26 women to the tune of crores of rupees through matrimonial websites.According to police officials, the accused has been identified as Prajit Keje (44), a native of Pondicherry. The police said that inquiries were initiated against him after a Thane-based woman registered a complaint against him earlier this month. “Between August and December this year, the accused approached the victim through a matrimonial website and, over the course of frequent interactions, promised to marry her. Using this promise, he also had physical relations with her. He then told her that he had recently sold his hotel in Paris and the money that he was supposed to get was stuck due to some issue with the Reserve Bank of India. He further told her that he needed money urgently and would pay her double the amount after his money came to him,” senior police inspector Uttam Sonawane, Kapurbawdi police station, said.The victim paid Keje ₹16.86 lakh, after which he dropped out of contact. The victim subsequently registered an FIR and a team under police inspector Priyatama Muthe was tasked with investigating the case.After detailed inquiries with the victim, the police realised that money was Keje’s weak point. Acting on the police’s instructions, the victim conveyed to Keje that she had sold her flat and had got a lot of money. Keje immediately contacted her and she expressed willingness to ‘lend’ him some more. The victim, however, said that she could only give it to him in person as she had it in cash.Keje agreed and came to Thane on December 11, where he walked straight into the arms of a police team waiting for him. He was arrested and, after being produced in court, remanded in police custody till Thursday.“During further investigation, we have found that the accused has similarly cheated 25 more women based in locations like Mumbai, Kerala, Bengaluru and Kolkata, and made at least ₹2.58Cr using this modus operandi. The number of victims and the amount swindled is expected to rise as investigations progress. We have reason to believe that he has also cheated some people other than women that he met on matrimonial websites, and two of his associates are also under the scanner,” Sonawane said. Keje was produced in court again on Thursday after his custody period expired, and was further remanded in police custody till December 20, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-arrested-in-thane-for-duping-26-women-on-matrimonial-sites-101639666849881.html

16-12-2021||Other||2015 sacrilege cases: SIT files 2nd status report on Ram Rahim’s questioning in HC||Faridkot Two days after questioning Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim for the second time in five weeks, Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases on Thursday submitted a second status report on his interrogation in the Punjab and Haryana high court. The SIT, which inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar is heading, submitted the status report by way of an affidavit. An interrogation report, including the copies of the questionnaires as well as replies, of Ram Rahim and dera vice-chairperson Prithvi Raj Nain, was filed along with the affidavit. On December 14, the SIT had asked 90 questions from the sect head during his grilling for six hours at the Sunaria jail in Rohtak over his alleged role in the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of the Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015, and the subsequent sacrilege incidents. An official said the SIT had filed the report in the high court so that it can be taken up on Friday, during the hearing on Ram Rahim’s pleas seeking anticipatory bail and the quashing of production warrants that a Faridkot court has issued. Sources said that the SIT has claimed in the report that Ram Rahim, again, was evasive and did not cooperate with the probe team so his custodial interrogation is required. The SIT is likely to push for bringing him to Punjab on production warrants for custodial interrogation. The move is also seen as an attempt by the SIT to counter Ram Rahim’s another plea demanding that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) be asked to continue probe into the 2015 sacrilege cases and that the SIT probe be stayed. The SIT had prepared a new set of questions for Ram Rahim on the basis of 200 queries asked from Nain and documents collected from the dera headquarters in Sirsa. On November 8, the SIT had asked 114 questions from Ram Rahim during his 7-hour grilling in the jail and submitted a 65-page status report in the high court four days later. In the report, the SIT claimed that the conspiracy of desecration of Sikh scriptures was hatched at the sect’s administrative block in Sirsa and that the followers never acted without the permission of Ram Rahim.

16-12-2021||Pune||Political parties in sprint to claim bullock-cart race victory||PUNE All political parties and leaders have welcomed the Supreme Court’s interim decision to allow bullock cart races in the state, a major attraction in rural Maharashtra and Pune district. Bullock cart races are a major attraction in Pune district and western Maharashtr and were the key issue on which the Shirur Lok Sabha constituency elections were contested. For farmers in the district , winning a bullock cart race is a matter of pride and prestige. Shirur MP Amol Kolhe, who had promised to allow bullock cart races again, said: “It’s a very important decision and farmers are celebrating like Diwali. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government deputed good advocates. Now like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, Maharashtra can hold its bullock cart races .” Kolhe said, “It is half a victory, as the two-judge bench allowed organisation of races, but the integrated hearing for Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra will be held before a bench of five judges before the final ruling.” Former MP Shivajirao Adhalrao said, “When I was MP, I followed up the issue and even filed the petition.” Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, “it is a welcome decision and will bring happiness among farmers in rural Maharashtra.” Maharashtra’s animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar said, “Maharashtra government is supportive of bullock cart races. I also respect the opinions of animal lovers.” Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit president Chandrakant Patil said, “BJP was supportive of this decision and meetings were taken with Prakash Jawadekar when he was union environment minister. Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge is a strong supporter of the bullock cart races and always used to about this issue.” As the Supreme Court’s decision came, farmers in Pune district celebrated and social media was filled with photos of bullock cart races from the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/political-parties-in-sprint-to-claim-bullock-cart-race-victory-101639664927438.html
16-12-2021||Pune||SC lifts ban on bullock- cart races: Rural economy is likely winner||PUNE In a major reprieve for the Maharashtra government, the Supreme Court lifted the ban on bullock cart racing in the state on Thursday, four years after its stay. The races should be conducted in accordance with the rules and the amendments made by it to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, in lines with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the order stated.With the apex court now giving its nod, several parts of the state, especially Pune and the western Maharashtra region, where the decades-old tradition was prevalent, will once again experience the thrill of the sport, which according to those associated with the races, will also help boost rural economy. In many parts of western Maharashtra, particularly in Pune district, the bullock cart races are seen as a traditional sport where locals invest heavily. Those who participate in the race spend a lot of money on bullocks while the award also runs into lakhs of rupees. In many villages, those winning the race are seen equivalent in social stature with gram panchayat members. Following the SC verdict, the joyous bullock cart owners in Pune district decorated their bullocks and burst firecrackers in Khed, Rajgurunagar, Bhosari and other places. Akhil Bharatiya Bailgada Sharyat Sanghatna representative Ramkrishna Takalkar, said that the apex court has given the nod to hold the races by adhering to the rules and regulations made by the state government in 2017. “Since the Supreme Court has given the conditional permission, we appeal all the bullock cart owners to hold the races by adhering to the rules and regulations. Lakhs of bullock cart owners in the state are happy today. There were accusations against the owners that they mistreat the animals, but all these accusations were wrong. The fact is all the owners treat the bullocks as their own child. Today, with this decision the farmers have heaved a sigh of relief,” Takalkar said. Ramnath Waringe, one of the bullock cart owners from Maval region of Pune district said that all the bullock cart owners in the district are overjoyed after the decision. “Bullock cart owners and farmers never considered the races as means of entertainment. For them, these races were means of boosting the rural economy. Several livelihoods were dependent on these races. It involved the sale and purchase of the breed required for the races.” Waringe owns six bullocks (required for races) worth around ₹40 lakh and has won several races when the sport was allowed in the state. “When I say that these races bring prosperity to the farmers’ community, it means that farmers purchase the young male calf at ₹25,000 to ₹30,000, raise the animal with a lot of care, train it and prepare it for races. If the bullock runs fast, it then can be sold anywhere from ₹4 lakh to ₹5 lakh or even at a higher price,” he said.

16-12-2021||Mumbai||Kolhapur first to offer property tax rebates under state EV Policy||Mumbai Kolhapur has become the first city in Maharashtra to offer individuals and housing societies concessions on property tax for setting up charging stations for electric vehicles. This step is being taken under the recently notified Maharashtra EV Policy 2021 and was announced by the state minister for transport, Satej Patil on Thursday. Other cities are expected to follow suit, including Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivali, Nagpur, Nashik, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, and Aurangabad.“Kolhapur Municipal Corporation becomes the first to offer concessions in property tax for housing societies and individuals setting up electric charging stations... Recently, Maharashtra Govt. launched the EV Policy, with the primary objective to accelerate the adoption of BEVs in the state so that they contribute to 10% of new vehicle registrations by 2025. Kolhapur wants to lead by example in implementing this policy,” Patil tweeted.A spokesperson for the minister confirmed to Hindustan Times that the tax concessions would be made available starting immediately, and can be availed either by shared housing facilities (such as co-operative housing societies) as well as individuals residing within the Kolhapur municipal limits.“If an individual sets up an electric vehicle charging station on their property for personal use, they will be entitled to the two per cent rebate on property tax provided that the station is made available for commercial use as well. For co-operative housing societies, the rebate being provided is five per cent,” the spokesperson said.Maharashtra’s EV policy, which was first tabled in July this year, also provides a range of other SoPs for consumers who purchase EVs. These include subsidised vehicle costs, discounts for early adopters, exemption from road tax and registration fees.The policy aims to incentivise the purchase of 100,000 electric two-wheelers, 15,000 e-autos, 10,000 cars, 20,000 goods carriers (both three and four-wheelers and 1,000 e-buses. On the supply side, the state has proposed to incentivise as many as 15,500 public and semi-public EV charging stations across Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kolhapur-first-to-offer-property-tax-rebates-under-state-ev-policy-101639663853958.html

Adeeb is leading a 21-member delegation to resolve the ongoing impasse.The petitioner submitted that as early as April 2021, those coming to offer namaz in the open, but designated spaces, have been subjected to ‘malicious’ and hateful ‘campaigns’ at the prayer sites. “This nefarious design being given given effect to by propagation and dissemination of hateful content through social media spreading false narratives, terming the performance of Friday Namaz, which is being done in the open due to compulsion and the same is permitted by the appropriate authorities in the circumstances as being illegal and in a manner of some sort of encroachment,” the plea stated.The petition further stated that the contempt action has been sought as the authorities have failed to adhere to the apex court's 2018 directions in the Tehseen Ponawalla vs the Union of India case. “The continuous inaction, apathy of the State machinery and failure of the local law enforcement agencies to prevent such incidents before these spiral into a monstrosity, is precisely what had been indicated by this Hon'ble court in Tehseen S.Poonawalla case, and is thus clearly a contempt of this Hon'ble court's directions,” the petitioner submitted.In recent months, right-wing groups have escalated their protests against what they say is the practice of offering namaz in the open. Last week, Haryana chief minister ML Khattar said that namaz in public places ‘will not be tolerated.’ The Gurugram district administration, too, withdrew permission for Friday at 20 designated sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-namaz-row-former-mp-seeks-contempt-action-against-haryana-chief-secretary-dgp-101639660970372.html

The inconvenience to customers is regretted," UFBU convenor M L Singh said. In the Union Budget for 2021-22 presented in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to take up privatisation of two public sector banks. To facilitate it, the government has listed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, for introduction and passage during the current session of Parliament."We want immediate withdraw of the bill," Singh said. Protesting against the central government's move to amend the banking regulation law, Rintu Rajak, convenor of UFBU, Jamshedpur, said the privatisation of PSBs would "hit the backbone of the country's economy". Due to the strike, an average transaction of around ₹1,200 crore a day in PSBs could be impacted in the Kolhan division, considered as the mineral-rich area and industrial hub of Jharkhand, he said. Almost 1,300 bank branches and 800 ATMs stopped functioning in the Kolhan division, comprising East and West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharswan districts, after 4,000 officers and employees participated in the two-day strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/banking-services-hit-in-jharkhand-as-public-sector-bank-employees-begin-2-day-strike-101639660532060.html

Last time, our delegation was adamant that we needed a letter in writing by CIDCO and not just verbal assurance. Finally, CIDCO has given us the letter,” Mangesh Adhav from Kamothe Colony Forum said.He added that every time the societies faced water issues, water tankers were called for and the society used to make the payment to the tankers. “We have spread the word about free tankers among all WhatsApp groups, educating people that no one should pay for the tankers,” Adhav said.Kharghar Taloja Colonies Welfare Association (KTCWA) and Kharghar Forum were also part of the protests and have received similar letters. As per the CIDCO rule, 650 litres of water have to be supplied per flat per day.“Kharghar needs around 75MLD water every day while what they receive is around 65MLD. There is a shortage of 10MLD by the CIDCO. Hence, when we inform them about shortage on any particular day, the officers from the water department would come and check the water supply reading for three consecutive days. If the reading shows that there was less water supplied, then CIDCO would provide the difference water through water tankers free of cost. The shortage has to be established and only then we would get the water free,” said Mangesh Ranawade from KTCWA, adding, “Although this won’t be changing the scarcity issue of the city, it is a good initiative by the CIDCO officials and an achievement for the societies. Each water tanker is of 10,000 litre capacity.”KTCWA also plans to start a help desk for their area to address the water scarcity issue and then forward the same ahead to CIDCO. Meanwhile, Kamothe residents have also been promised a water tank at Sector 21, which would be completed in three years’ time. “CIDCO has now given us in writing that they have approached the State government to reserve 90MLD water from Morbe dam considering the future needs and would also be constructing a water tank in Kamothe,” Adhav said.“Sometimes, there is a shortfall of water and whenever there is, we would provide them with a tanker for free to balance the shortfall. We are working to find solutions to overcome the shortfall,” a CIDCO official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/housing-societies-of-kharghar-taloja-kamothe-need-not-pay-for-water-tankers-assures-cidco-in-writing-101639660366556.html

16-12-2021||Mumbai||Bombay Natural History Society to radio-tag flamingoes in Mumbai for the first time||Mumbai: The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is preparing to tag 10 flamingoes from Thane Creek with radio collars this January. This is being done in order to study the impact on avian biodiversity due to the construction of the Mumbai-Trans Harbour Link (MTHL). This is said to be the first-ever radio-telemetry study of the migratory birds by them.Researchers confirmed that pending permissions from the union telecom ministry, which were expected several months ago, were recently obtained.Dr Mrugank Prabhu, a lead researcher on the project shared, “We will be tagging around nine to 10 flamingoes with radio collars, sometime next month. It has been delayed by at least a year. This is the first time we are carrying out such a study in Mumbai, so we’ll start by experimenting on a small number of birds first to see what kind of data we get.”Researchers highlighted three broad aims of their ongoing study. First, they are trying to assess the true extent of the creek’s flamingo population, with recent estimates putting it between 100,000 to 150,000 annually. The second is to assess the availability and distribution of food in the creek’s intertidal mudflats. The third is to uncover the birds’ migratory routes. A total of 39 birds in the creek have already been tagged with aluminium rings bearing unique ID numbers. Two birds tagged in Mumbai have been tracked from Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in the last two years. Dr Prabhu further informed that it would be interesting to map the routes of the birds arriving at Thane Creek. “Birds are also coming in smaller numbers from places like Israel, parts of Africa, Kazakhstan and Iran. It will be very interesting to map the route that the birds are taking to reach Thane Creek. Where do they stop? How long does it take them to get here? How long do they stay here? We will be able to answer these questions better through real-time geo-tagged information,” Prabhu added. The program may later be extended to include a larger number of flamingos and other water birds that live in and around Thane Creek.BNHS’ study, which commenced in 2017, will conclude in 2027. It is significant because there has so far been a paucity of studies carried out on flamingoes and the ecology of Thane Creek. The ongoing research will form the basis for a conservation plan for avian biodiversity in the region, which was one of the conditions put forth by the Union environment ministry, without which the MTHL would have been denied the mandatory environmental clearance (EC) needed for work to take off. Environmentalists’ main objection to the MTHL has been its direct passage through the Sewri-Mahul mudflats, which provide a habitat for as much as 15% of the near-threatened lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor) in South Asia. In its preliminary assessment, the BNHS recommended that this section be re-routed, but the suggestion was not accepted by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-natural-history-society-to-radio-tag-flamingoes-in-mumbai-for-the-first-time-101639659586607.html

He is allowed to only give primary care. The accused had such a letter issued by the council in 1991, when Turbhe was a rural area. But in 1995, the corporation came into existence and Turbhe was no more a rural area and yet he continued the practice,” Kailas Gaikwad, Turbhe Urban Health Primary Centre head, said.In 2010 too, NMMC had raided and the accused was caught under Maharashtra Medical Practioners Act and was acquitted in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-turbhe-midc-police-raid-clinic-of-quack-arrest-him-101639658626831.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||HC asks court to defer defamation case against Rahul Gandhi till Jan 25||Mumbai The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday adjourned hearing of the petition filed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for quashing of the defamation case before the metropolitan magistrate court at Girgaum till January 18, and directed the magistrate court to defer proceedings before it till January 25. Gandhi has challenged the process issued against him stating that only a defamed person could have initiated defamation proceedings against him. The complainant has, however, referred to section 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and stated that it permits any aggrieved person to file a defamation suit and hence the magistrate had not erred in issuing summons to Gandhi based on his complaint. The single bench of justice Sandeep Shinde which is hearing the petition filed by Gandhi wherein he has sought quashing of the order of the Girgaum magistrate court, which has asked him to appear in person in a defamation complaint filed by a local politician was informed by advocate Nitin Pradhan for the complainant Mahesh Shrishrimal that he needed some time and hence the hearing should be adjourned. Based on the defamation complaint of Shrishrimal, the Girgaum magistrate court had initiated criminal proceedings against Gandhi on August 28, 2019. Gandhi was issued a summons on July 12, 2021 asking him to appear in person before the magistrate in connection with the complaint. Pursuant to the summons, Gandhi had approached the HC. According to the complaint, during a rally held in Rajasthan in September 2018, Gandhi had made a defamatory statement against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which had resulted in various news channels and social media platforms trolling the PM. The complaint also stated that Gandhi had purportedly posted a tweet and given a statement, wherein he referred to the PM as “commander in thief”, which was defamatory and made “direct allegation of theft against BJP members and Indian citizens connected to Modi.” In the previous hearing on November 17, Gandhi’s advocate Kushal Mor had submitted that the complaint was vexatious, baseless, unmeritorious and misconceived. Gandhi’s petition had stated that the complaint was nothing but a vehicle to drive the complainant’s own political agenda to tarnish the public image of the petitioner. The court had asked the complainant to file an affidavit in response to the petition. In the affidavit filed on December 13, Shrishrimal has stated that as per CrPC any “aggrieved person” can initiate criminal prosecution for defamation and as Gandhi had an alternate remedy to approach the sessions court and appeal against the magistrate court order, the HC should not allow Gandhi’s petition. The affidavit further states that as he is a BJP functionary, the defamatory words used by Gandhi has lowered his esteem in the eyes of the society and hence he has the right to initiate criminal defamation proceedings. The HC while adjourning hearing of the petition to January 18, has directed the magistrate to defer defamation proceedings against Gandhi till January 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-asks-court-to-defer-defamation-case-against-rahul-gandhi-till-jan-25-101639656168237.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Daily testing for Covid in Thane continues to be less than 2K||More than a week after the Thane municipal commissioner, Dr Vipin Sharma, claimed that testing would increase in the city, the number of tests conducted daily still continues to remain the same, at less than 2,000, across Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) limits.The civic officials claimed that reluctance among those vaccinated to get tested continues. TMC now plans to reach out to market areas and common places to test shopkeepers and vendors.Among the tests carried out, around 700 are RT-PCR while 1,400-1,500 are rapid antigen tests.On December 9, TMC had announced that they’d increase the number of antigen and RT-PCR tests in the city. Amidst the new variant Omicron’s increasing cases, a special meeting was held to ensure strict testing would be initiated at bus depots. However, the number of daily tests continues to be less than 2,000.“Now that many are fully vaccinated, especially those travelling on a regular basis, they seem to be reluctant to get tested. As they do not have any symptoms, the hesitancy to get tested continues. Hence, we have planned to test shopkeepers and provide facilities at common areas near market places and railway stations. We had a similar set up earlier and have spoken to the respective ward officers to follow the same procedures as earlier in order to keep a tab on the number of cases,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.In mid-April, when the second wave was at its peak, the city conducted more than 10,000 tests daily but as the number of daily cases saw a decline, the tests also became fewer in the city. As the daily positivity rate continues to be less than 1.5%, Thane had maintained the same testing figures until now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/daily-testing-for-covid-in-thane-continues-to-be-less-than-2k-101639656107641.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Ample proof available of the dual identities of Sameer Wankhede: Nawab Malik to HC||Mumbai Ample proof is available of the dual identities adopted by Dnyandev Wankhede and his son Sameer Wankhede, Mumbai zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for their personal benefit, NCP leader Nawab Malik has claimed in his affidavit in reply to the defamation suit filed by Dnyandev Wankhede before the Bombay high court. Malik, in his affidavit, stated that the tweets were intended to only expose the illegalities committed by Sameer Wankhede while securing a job through the reserved category quota and misusing his position in the NCB. The affidavit added that there was no malice intended on his part while making revelations on social media and the suit was intended to curtail his fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. Referring to the maintainability of the suit, Malik has stated that the reliefs sought against him by Dnyandev Wankhede are only intended to suppress the facts which he has been exposing about Sameer Wankhede. The affidavit states that the reliefs sought cannot be granted as they are intended to benefit persons who are not party to the suit. “All the material/evidence published by me shows the illegal manner in which Mr Sameer Wankhede has acquired his job and also the illegalities in the manner in which he has discharged his duties as a public official,” the affidavit states. Stating that the claim by Dnyandev Wankhede in the suit that he (Malik) had started the slur campaign against Sameer Wankhede after his son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB and released after being kept behind bars for almost eight months was false, he added that he has been questioning the working of NCB even before his son-in-law was arrested. Malik has stated that he had made statements as the national spokesperson of the NCP in November 2020 against the action being taken by NCB against consumers of drugs and not tracking down and arresting drug traffickers/suppliers for the sake of publicity. With regards to the posting of the birth certificate, school leaving certificates and nikahnama of Sameer Wankhede online, Malik’s affidavit states, “This material was published by me after reasonably verifying the truth of the same and believing the same to be true. The material available on record shows that Mr Sameer Wankhede is leading a dual life i.e. as a Muslim and as a Hindu. He has illegally obtained his job under ‘Scheduled Caste’ (SC) category thereby depriving a genuine SC candidate of the opportunity of employment and livelihood by suppressing that he was born a Muslim.” The affidavit while referring to the illegalities committed by Sameer Wankhede in the course of his duty as NCB zonal director states that during raids the officer has given a complete go by to the procedure and indulged in activities which are likely to compromise the investigations carried out under his charge. The affidavit states that he (Malik) has posted evidence to show that the pancha Mr Fletcher Patel called by Wankhede during raids was known to him and his family. The affidavit states that the revelation by Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the Aryan Khan case wherein he has alleged that Wankhede had made him sign 10 blank pages as a panch witness shows that Sameer Wankhede has been resorting to illegal procedures in the course of discharging his duties. Malik has further reiterated his stand that both Dnyandev Wankhede and his son have been involved in illegal activities by referring to the liquor licence issued to a hotel in Vashi in the name of Sameer Wankhede in 1997. The affidavit states that the licence was issued to Sameer by the excise department even though he was only 17 years old at the time and Dnyandev was also working as an officer in the said department. The affidavit states that the revelations made by him (Malik) regarding the illegalities by Sameer Wankhede has helped the appropriate agencies/authorities to initiate appropriate steps against the erring public servant. The affidavit states that the transfer of six cases being investigated by Sameer to NCB vigilance was an example of the effect of his revelations. The defamation suit by Dnyandev Wankhede is expected to come up for rehearing on his interim plea before a single judge bench in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ample-proof-available-of-the-dual-identities-of-sameer-wankhede-nawab-malik-to-hc-101639655806392.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Can’t cancel FIR just because cops invoked wrong IPC sections: Bombay high court||MUMBAI: A First Information Report (FIR) cannot be cancelled on the ground that the police invoked a wrong penal provision, the Bombay high court said on Wednesday, rejecting a petition filed by a Mumbai resident to cancel an extortion case registered against him.The petition filed by Hemant Banker, father of businessman Rupin Banker, contended that the FIR on charges of extortion registered against him by Worli police in August 2020 on a complaint of a builder Kailash Agarwal was liable to be cancelled since the allegation did not involve the delivery of property, an essential ingredient for the offence of extortion under Section 387 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The division bench of justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal ruled that “wrong application of a particular section cannot be the sole ground for quashing of the FIR”, holding that a case can be quashed only “in the eventuality that absolutely no cognisable offence is made out in the FIR”.In this case, the high court ruled, the accusation against Hemant Banker disclosed the offence of criminal intimidation since a person who identified himself as Vijay Shetty allegedly threatened the builder.“Therefore, it cannot be said that no cognizable offence is made out. Therefore, the FIR cannot be quashed,” said the court.The builder, Agarwal, alleged that he had some financial transactions with Rupin Banker who is later claimed to have used forged signatures to withdraw about Rs.35 crore from his account with Dubai branch of the Bank of Baroda, and that he lodged a police complaint in Dubai in this case. The builder further alleged that he received threat calls if he pursued the police case||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cant-cancel-fir-just-because-cops-invoked-wrong-ipc-sections-bombay-high-court-101639655026132.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Rehab centre in Thane sees more patients in 25-45 yrs age group recovered from Covid visiting it||Since its inception more than a year ago, more than 2,000 patients have been treated at the post-Covid care and rehabilitation centre in Thane till now.The second wave subsided months ago. However, people affected in this wave continue to deal with Covid-related complications, claim the doctors. In the first wave, the patients who sought help were mostly between 40 years and 60 years. However, post the second wave, those between 25 years and 45 years have been mostly seen visiting the post-Covid rehabilitation centre.The main aim of this centre situated at Lodha Luxuria in Majiwada is the physical and mental well-being of those who have recovered from Covid. Most recovered patients visit for yoga sessions at the rehabilitation centre. They also focus on breathing and building one’s strength.“After the second wave, 60% of the patients who visited here were for breathlessness and hardly 2% had lung fibrosis. Moreover, there were 20% who faced severe joint pains and another 20% who required counselling. The most common issues among post-Covid difficulties were palpitation and panting. We suggest yoga, lung physiotherapy and basic exercises for the body,” said Dr Mansi Doiphode, medical officer and in-charge of the post-Covid rehabilitation centre.For a 34-year-old Kalyan resident, the joint pain had not subsided even three months after recovering from Covid. He came all the way to Thane’s post-Covid rehabilitation centre and was suggested some simple exercises and physiotherapy. On following them regularly, along with basic medications, he has noted some improvement.“We have been treating such patients with orthopaedic-related issues. Even those who recovered a few months back are facing joint pains. This could also be because of the winter and the dip in temperature. We suggest some exercises and, if needed, basic medications for them to recover. In some cases, calcium and multi-vitamin medicines have also helped them to recover,” said Dr Mahesh Mhatre, orthopaedic, post-Covid rehabilitation centre.The centre also saw senior citizens who were staying alone and who found it difficult to manage daily chores and routines on their own after recovering from Covid.“One such case was of a 65-year-old Thane resident who also had asthma and found it very difficult to cope with post-Covid breathing problems. We suggested simple exercises that could be done at home to enhance the lungs’ capacity. Only every fortnight he would visit the centre and gradually he started finding it easier to cope,” added Dr Mhatre.As the sexagenarian stayed with his spouse on the third floor of his house with no lift, daily chores and even a visit to the doctor involved climbing and descending three floors. It would leave him panting and breathless even after three months post-Covid infection. He visited the post-Covid centre and based on the breathing exercises prescribed, he has now recovered and is able to manage his daily chores without support.As the virus affects the lungs and lowers the immunity, pulmonary physiotherapy to strengthen the lungs along with regular exercises and proper diet help revive one’s body. There are designated doctors for the same who guide those visiting the centre. Moreover, many find it difficult to cope up after being in isolation for long periods. There are counsellors who help such individuals as well.“We have noticed that in many instances, people who are working from home and have tested positive for Covid have led to Covid-related anxiety. This is often because they are confined to a single room, feel lonely, and hence are vulnerable to emotional upheaval. Medication is not the only solution in such cases. Hence, we recommend some kind of physical activity to encourage the mind. Also, we have counselling sessions at least once a week,” added Doiphode.With a gradual dip in cases, a part of the centre has now been converted to a vaccination centre. Moreover, patients visit with prior appointments. The yoga and counselling sessions are currently available only on call or prior appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rehab-centre-in-thane-sees-more-patients-in-25-40-yrs-age-group-recovered-from-covid-visiting-it-101639654787076.html

Over 600 traffic police personnel will be deployed across 103 major points in the city for the drive, officials said. Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said that it is mandatory for vehicles to have high security number plate, and the violation carries a fine of ₹5,500. Tomar said that HSRPs have helped reduce the number of vehicle thefts and also identify stolen vehicles.“The idea is to sensitise commuters about the importance of HSRP. An in-built chip on the HSRP helps scan the vehicle’s records and the number plate also reflects better at night,” said Tomar.According to the officials, till December 14 this year, they have issued 9,348 fines for driving without HSRPs and 1,926 for driving without a number plate. On an average, around 300 cases of vehicle theft are registered in the city on a monthly basis, they said. Experts said that along with issuing fines, traffic police also need to ensure that they have an arrangement through which an offender can procure an HSRP on an immediate basis “Traffic police can provide a slip through which the offender can visit the nearest authorised outlet to get an HSRP affixed,” said Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi.The Gurugram traffic police had launched a similar drive against vehicles without HSRP in March 2019.

Officials from the district health department said that a 69-year-old woman, who was not vaccinated, died at a private hospital due to Covid-related complications. The woman also suffered comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic liver disease, the officials said, adding that she tested positive for Covid-19 on December 3. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that the woman was admitted with high fever on December 6 and during treatment she suffered sudden cardiac arrest. “The patient’s family members told us that she had liver issues so they decided not to get her vaccinated. Such decisions, however, should be avoided as there is no restriction of vaccination for chronic liver disease. We have repeatedly asked people, particularly those suffering from comorbidities, to get vaccinated as they are at higher risk,” said Yadav. On Monday, a 73-year-old woman had died due to Covid-19 at a private hospital in the district. The deceased, however, had taken both her vaccine shots but she also suffered from comorbidities. According to the health department data, there are 99 active Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, with 18 new cases reported on Wednesday. The case tally in the district now stood at 181,887, including 927 deaths. The department on Wednesday also collected 4,222 samples for Covid testing, said the officials. Dr Yadav said that the department is keeping a close watch on the situation and testing would be ramped up when the situation demands. “We have the required capacity to manage the situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-reports-second-covid-death-this-month-101639653946242.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||HC asks magistrate court to defer defamation case against Gandhi till Jan 25||The Bombay high court on Thursday adjourned the hearing of a petition filed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for quashing of a defamation case before the metropolitan magistrate court at Girgaum till January 18, and directed the magistrate court to defer proceedings before it till January 25. Gandhi has challenged the process issued against him, arguing that only a defamed person could have initiated defamation proceedings against him. The complainant has, however, referred to Section 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and said that it permits any aggrieved person to file a defamation suit, and hence, the magistrate didn’t err in issuing summons to Gandhi based on his complaint. The single bench of justice Sandeep Shinde that is hearing the petition filed by Gandhi wherein he has sought the quashing of the order of the Girgaum magistrate court, which has asked him to appear in person in the defamation complaint filed by a local politician, was informed by advocate Nitin Pradhan for the complainant Mahesh Shrishrimal that he needed some time, and hence the hearing should be adjourned. Also Read: Congress calls out Centre for not mentioning Indira Gandhi’s name in Vijay DiwasBased on the defamation complaint of Shrishrimal, the Girgaum magistrate court had initiated criminal proceedings against Gandhi on August 28, 2019. Gandhi was issued summons on July 12, 2021, asking him to appear in person before the magistrate in connection with the complaint. Pursuant to the summons, Gandhi had approached the high court. According to the complaint, during a rally held in Rajasthan in September 2018, Gandhi had made a defamatory statement against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which had apparently resulted in various news channels and social media platforms trolling the PM. The complaint also said that Gandhi had purportedly posted a tweet and given a statement, wherein he referred to the prime minister as “commander in thief”, which was defamatory, and made a “direct allegation of theft against BJP members and Indian citizens connected to Modi”. In the previous hearing on November 17, Gandhi’s advocate Kushal Mor had submitted that the complaint was vexatious, baseless, not meritorious, and misconceived. Gandhi’s petition had stated that the complaint was nothing but a vehicle to drive the complainant’s own political agenda to tarnish the public image of the petitioner. The court had asked the complainant to file an affidavit in response to the petition. In the affidavit filed on December 13, Shrishrimal has stated that according to CrPC, any “aggrieved person” can initiate criminal prosecution for defamation and as Gandhi had an alternate remedy to approach the sessions court and appeal against the magistrate court order, the high court shouldn’t entertain Gandhi’s petition. The affidavit further says that since he was a BJP functionary, the defamatory words used by Gandhi had hurt his image in society, and hence, he had the right to initiate criminal defamation proceedings. The high court, while adjourning the hearing of the petition to January 18, directed the magistrate to defer defamation proceedings against Gandhi till January 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-asks-magistrate-court-to-defer-defamation-case-against-gandhi-till-jan-25-101639653225990.html
16-12-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Keventer’s “Poona experiment” gives cheese Indian stamp of authenticity||Edward Keventer revolutionised the dairy industry in India. A pioneer in the field of agriculture and animal husbandry, especially scientific cattle breeding, nutrition, and pasteurised dairy milk, he single-handedly built the ice-cream and milkshake industry in India. Keventer was recruited by the British Government to modernise the dairy industry in India in 1889. It was his task, as the expert, to initiate the processes – known in official correspondences as “experiments”. One such experiment was to make cheese in Poona. Known as the “Poona experiment”, it served as a template to make cheese locally and commercially available in India. In 1890, the Director of Agriculture, Dr Ozanne requested Keventer to give “instructions in dairy management” to students in the Bombay Presidency. Keventer readily agreed and started his classes at Tamarind Lane, Fort, Bombay, and later at the Dairy Farm in Kirkee. During one such class, Ozanne was asked by a student why cheese was not made locally and had to be imported. Ozanne asked Keventer to take up the challenge and make “good quality” cheese in Poona. The “Poona experiment” started in 1890 and continued for almost a year. Keventer initially wanted to try making the Stilton cheese, but then opted for Cheddar instead. The principle of cheese-making depends upon the casein of milk being artificially curdled by means of rennet. A small quantity will curdle a considerable quantity of milk. The casein entangles the butter fat globules and this sinks, separating from the whey. The whey contains sugar, albumen, and a small proportion of butter fat. The curd is manipulated in various ways to produce different kinds of cheese. The Cheddar system of cheese-making is perhaps the most common. Cheese varies in quality according to the quality of the milk from which it is made. It varies in character according to the system adopted in making it. The finest soft cheeses are made from milk, which has been improved by the addition of cream. Cheese made from pure milk is called whole milk cheese. There are numerous gradations of quality between cheese of this class, and that made from skimmed or separated milk. Keventer knew that the best cheeses were made from whole milk. The milk required for making cheese had to be fairly fresh and free from abnormal odours and as clean as possible. Poona mostly relied on Sangli for the supply of fresh milk. But Keventer wanted the milk delivered to the farm within a couple of hours after milking into absolutely clean utensils. Hence buffaloes were brought to the Kirkee farm. Keventer needed special vats to curdle milk, curd coolers on which curd was exposed and ripened after it was removed from the vat; the curd mill which ground the curd into granules before salting; hoops or moulds in which curd was squeezed free of whey; the cheese press, to press the curd in the hoops. He employed local carpenters and ironsmiths to make the equipment as per his specifications. Keventer knew that he could not use animal rennet if the cheese had to be marketed to Indian customers as well. He used an extract from the berries of Withania coauglans (locally known as Paneerphool) and found that they could not only coagulate milk but also digest and mellow curd into cheese. The use of the Withania rennet removed the cause of the “Hindu objection” to cheese. But it had some disadvantages. The curd from Withania rennet never developed the same desirable texture that the curd from animal rennet did; moreover, the smell of Withania was more powerful than the characteristic odour developed in the curd by a sufficient degree of acidity. Therefore, an expert cheese-maker could not detect by his sense of smell when the curd became sufficiently acidic. The blue-white colour of cheese made from buffalo milk was not attractive and reduced the market value of cheese. This of course could be rectified by artificial colouring, which was more or less practiced in all systems of cheese-making. The unusually higher percentage of butter fat in buffalo milk gave a peculiar consistency to the ripened cheese. The curd remained somewhat granular during the ripening process and a clean slice could not be cut with a sharp knife. But the cheese manufactured at Poona varied from fair to good, none could be classed as inferior. The “Poona experiment” proved that in India milk could be coagulated and the quality of curd developed had the flavour and texture which ought to make a “high class” cheese, but the maturing of the cheese afterwards could not be regulated to give the best results. Cheese-making could only be economically practiced in those districts of India, where the day temperature for a considerable portion of the year was moderately cool and where fresh milk could be procured at a cheap rate. Keventer’s success with making cheese at Poona spread like wildfire in India in the early 1890s. The Government of Madras, with a view to carrying out the “Poona experiment” in that Presidency, addressed the Government of India in December 1894 for the purpose of securing the services of Keventer. It was found, however, that his services had been secured by the Government of the North-West Provinces and Oudh. The Government of Madras then requested Keventer to lend them a “competent man” trained by him. A year later, Mr Schulz, an assistant of Keventer, went to Madras where he tried to repeat the “Poona experiment” of making Cheddar cheese. Whether he was successful or not is not known. After Keventer left Poona for Aligarh in 1891, he started making cheese at the farm there. Anyone willing to learn cheese-making could do so at his farm. A fee of ₹10 was charged. Later, when Keventer opened a branch at Darjeeling, he started a course in cheese-making there too. He would shuttle between Aligarh and Darjeeling, and train students. Keventer’s expertise was put to use again in 1917 when the agricultural department tried to make cheese in Poona and Ahmedabad. With a better supply of milk and control of temperatures, a better quality of the cheese was achieved at both the farms. It is not known why the enterprise was not continued in Poona, but Ahmedabad did become a hub for cheese-making. In 1927, The Royal Commission on Agriculture was constituted to find ways to better the output of milk and milk products in India. Keventer was the last witness to appear before the Commission. He stated that India required cheaper and reliable milk and ghee so that they might reach the poorer classes. He recommended the breeding of cattle by the establishment of pedigree herds of India’s best breeds of cows, buffaloes, and goats, and as to make the supply of milk and ghee more reliable, food laws should be enacted to protect not only the public but also the honest dairyman. He laid much stress on teaching modern methods of handling milk, manufacturing of butter, casing the milk and sugar and cheese. Keventer’s dedication towards his art and craft was exemplary. He might be better known for the Cassata ice cream he made at his dairies or his milkshakes, but his tireless efforts benefitted millions of farmers and dairymen in India.

16-12-2021||Dehradun||‘Rehablitate 229 Van Gujjar families from Rajaji Tiger Reserve’: Uttarakhand HC||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the state government to rehabilitate 229 families of Van Gujjars, or nomadic pastoralists, from Rajaji Tiger Reserve within one year and present a detailed report on its plans in this regard within two months. These 229 families were earlier left out of a rehabilitation plan because they were considered ineligible by the government.The division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice NS Dhanik also ordered district magistrates of seven districts - US Nagar, Nainital, Dehradun, Haridwar, Tehri, Pauri and Uttarkashi - to be present in the court on January 12 to discuss claims of Van Gujjars under the Forest Rights Act (FRA).The high court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Delhi-based NGO Think Act Rise Foundation through its secretary Arjun Kasana in 2019 to highlight the plight of the Van Gujjars. The court earlier clubbed other petitions related to Van Gujjars in this PIL.The court also directed the state government to arrange for food and healthcare for the animals reared by Van Gujjars still living in the tiger reserve. Kasana, who appeared in person, said the PIL seeks that the administration should declare Van Gujjars as beneficiaries under FRA, converting forest land occupied by them as revenue villages, providing land rights to them under FRA and quashing petty cases registered against them. Kasana said the state government in its report to the court earlier said 1,393 families from Rajaji Tiger Reserve have been rehabilitated while 229 families were illegible for rehabilitation. “These 1,393 Van Gujjar families have been rehabilitated in Haridwar district”, he said.Kasana said there are around 10,000 Van Gujjars living in the state who are facing different problems..“The high court was not happy with the report of the state government and as such, it issued summons to district magistrates of seven districts to remain present in the court on Wednesday. They were all present virtually except Dehradun which was represented by chief development officer”, he said. On March 17, 2021, the Uttarakhand high court directed the state government to re-constitute the committee set up earlier on its orders. “Until and unless a holistic approach is taken by including the competent persons/authorities within the committee, the constitution of the committee would merely be a mirage and merely an eyewash,” the high court noted in its March order The high court first ordered the state government to set up the committee on August 17, 2020 to come up with necessary steps needed to be taken for the rehabilitation and upliftment, and the rights, which can be given to the Van Gujjars under FRA. The state government on October 1, 2020 constituted the committee with chief forest conservator, wildlife as its chairman, but the court was not satisfied with the committee. Kasana said in accordance with the March 2021 directions, the state government reconstituted the committee in June this year, with the mandate to look into the issues of Van Gujjars in the light of various laws and their rights and give its recommendations to the state government and submit a copy to the court as well.

16-12-2021||Patna||Bihar: Traders worried over ban on single-use plastic items, thermocol products||A ban on the use of single-use plastic items and thermocol products came into effect in Bihar on Wednesday, leaving traders, especially members of the CAIT (Confederation of All India Traders), worried over its impact on business.The production, distribution and sale of these products are now a punishable offence even as Bihar enters the peak season of weddings, family functions and large ceremonies, when such items are in high demand. CAIT members said the ban on single-use plastic items and thermocol products will result in huge losses for traders. They have demanded that the ban should be pushed back.The ban comes following the Union government’s decision to eliminate single-use plastic items and thermocol products from the country from July next year. In June 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made the announcement, asking the states to draw up a comprehensive action plan for elimination of single-use plastics and effective implementation of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.In August this year, the ministry of environment, forests and climate change notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, prohibiting the manufacture, import, distribution, sale and use of multiple types single-use plastic items from July 1, 2022.“In our state, this ban has been made effective before the 2022 deadline. We need time to completely stop this trade and want the ban be implemented here in 2022,” said Kamal Nopani, the CAIT’s Bihar wing chairman. A memorandum was submitted to the forest department a couple of months ago and Bihar’s traders have made an appeal to the Centre to reconsider their request, he said.The CAIT’s Bihar chief said that the state forest department had announced its decision about the ban back in June this year. “Traders were asked to clear their stocks before the deadline. But things did not materialise. In fact, December is the season of weddings and celebrations, and so it’s also the time of business and earnings. Traders have for months been waiting for this season, “ Nopani said.Prem Kumar Gupta, a Patna-based trader who deals with plastic and thermocol items, also said the products are used mainly during weddings and celebrations. “We had to wait for the buyers. After all, wedding planners don’t purchase these materials long before the events,” he said.Aman Kumar, another trader, said business will now be hit hard due to the implementation of the ban. “After a long gap [due to the pandemic], traders were having a good time. The demand was high and income was good.

16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab DGP selection: UPSC calls meeting on December 21||The much-awaited meeting of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for the appointment of a regular Punjab director general of police (DGP) will be finally held on December 21 in New Delhi. Also read: ‘Will not contest any elections’, says BKU leader Tikait as farm protests endAccording to an official communication received by the Punjab government from the UPSC, the meeting will be held at 10.30am in the national capital for the selection of the three officers among the 10 senior Indian Police Service officers shortlisted by Punjab. The state government had sent the names of the shortlisted IPS officers on September 30, a few days after chief minister the Charanjit Singh Channi-led dispensation took over and removed 1987-batch IPS officer Dinkar Gupta as Punjab Police chief. Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, a 1988-batch IPS officer, has been officiating as the DGP since then. Bone of contention between Channi, Sidhu From Punjab, the chief secretary will also be part of the meeting with the UPSC panel and because Sahota, himself is a contender for the post, he won’t be attending the meeting. Otherwise, the incumbent DGP is also expected to take part in the meeting with the UPSC to shortlist the candidates. After this meeting, the UPSC will select three candidates and send this panel to the Punjab government to select one from them to appoint as regular DGP. The appointment of the Punjab DGP has remained a contentious issue in poll-bound Punjab between chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu. It is learnt that Sidhu is keen on S Chattopadhyaya taking over as the DGP. A 1986-batch IPS officer, he is the seniormost among the names sent in the panel. However, with Chattopadhyaya, who had challenged the appointment of Gupta as regular DGP during former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s tenure losing the case in the Supreme Court of India, it would be interesting to see if the UPSC considers him for the post or not. Why Sidhu is opposed to acting DGP Sahota Sidhu had criticised Channi’s move to appoint Sahota as regular DGP citing that as head of the Bureau of Investigation (BoI) he had conducted a probe at the time of the Bargari sacrilege during the SAD-BJP government’s tenure in which he had termed the act of sacrilege as the handiwork of foreign handlers and two local youngsters. The main contenders for the top job are officiating DGP Sahota and 1987-batch IPS officer VK Bhawra. The other names on the list are MK Tiwari (1987 batch), Prabodh Kumar and Rohit Chaudhary (both 1988 batch), Sanjeev Kalra and Parag Jain (1989 batch) and BK Uppal (1991 batch).

16-12-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A scholar on a mission||The bookish pursuits of Old Delhi scholar Abdul Sattar are as steadfast as the coronavirus pandemic. Just this morning, the venerable gentleman put on his beret cap and N95 face mask and stepped out of his home in Pahari Imli to walk to Kucha Challan, a few lanes away, where he met the computer typist in charge of typing the manuscript of his book-in-progress.“I’m compiling a collection of previously written profiles (by various authors) on the eminent personalities of Old Delhi,” says Mr Sattar, 77, sitting in his study. His sprawling house, filled with his children and his children’s children, is an amalgamation of many rooms (with a roof that, accessed by a series of staircases, shows a bird’s eye view of the Walled City). But this study is the elderly scholar’s true world. Here, he thinks, reads, writes, eats, meets visitors, and listens to old love songs at night - from a desktop computer on his writing table. Here, he sleeps as well. And here, he keeps his precious collection of ink pens collected from across the world over decades.Restrained by the pandemic, Mr Sattar has drastically reduced his outdoor excursions. His morning trip to the typist was one of the rare occasions when he permitted his frail figure to walk down the steep stairs and emerge into the mostly maskless masses of the chaotic Shahjahanabad.Already working on two other books, Mr Satttar decided to start this new project after coming across, in an Urdu Bazar bookstore, a yellowing volume on a centuries-old Sufi saint who lies buried in the Walled City. “Barely anybody remembers him today,” he says in a tone reminiscent of a college professor, although he is a retired government officer.Remarking on the urgency of his venture, Mr Sattar says, “I hope this book on Old Delhi personalities will help to keep the memories of those people alive.” After gazing for a long time upon his house cats, Laali and Silky, Mr Sattar explains that he collected archival pieces on the chosen figures for the book from old and rare Urdu volumes.He goes on to list some of the eminences who will appear. A few of these names are familiar, many aren’t. But by now, Mr Sattar has switched his talk to the other book he is working on. “Too much to be done,” he mutters, picking up the novel he has been reading these days - it’s the Urdu translation of Ahmad Ali’s classic Twilight in Delhi. With life as hectic as ever, Mr Sattar says he daily gets up at 8am and goes to sleep at 10.30pm. For now, it’s time for dinner - peas pulao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-scholar-on-a-mission-101639616819214.html

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) staff members deployed in the shrine complex apprehended the man, identified as Ranbir Singh, and handed him over to police, it is learnt. Terming the incident unfortunate, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said the man who committed the “sacrilege” had shorn hair and threw the gutka sahib into the sarovar after taking it out from his pocket. The gurdwara body staff claimed to have CCTV footage of the incident. Dhami added, “I rushed to the SGPC head office in the complex to take stock of the situation. The incident did not happen all of a sudden, but it seems to be a conspiracy hatched to provoke sentiments of the Sikhs and vitiate atmosphere of Punjab.” “Gurbani teaches everyone life’s ideals. If anyone still desecrates the book, it only shows the kind of depraved mentality they have. The police and the government should expose the forces behind such incidents and stringent punishment must be given to the culprits,” the SGPC chief said. Even as several such incidents have taken place, the government has failed to act, he said. The police said they are investigating the matter by questioning the man in their custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-held-for-throwing-holy-gutka-into-golden-temple-sarovar-101639602639566.html

A case under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was lodged against the accused.During questioning, Balram stated that Varun brought the plastic kite string from Delhi through road, following which police booked him too.The inspector added that Balram revealed that some traders had been buying the banned string from Delhi and selling it among kite lovers. He claimed that Varun had sent him to bring the cartons from Cheema Chowk.The police official added that the commissioner of police had already banned the storage and sale of plastic kite string under Section 144 of the CrPC, as it was dangerous for humans as well as animals.On November 13, the Division Number 3 police had recovered 1,795 spools of plastic kite string from a pick-up auto, but the driver had managed to escape from the spot.Earlier, in January, Jasvir Singh, 28, of Gobindpura village, had died after his throat was slit by a plastic kite string.

16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Finally, farmers’ dharna lifted from Adani Group’s dry port||The year-long dharna in Kila Raipur, which caused Adani Logistics Services, a subsidiary of the Adani Group, to shut its inland container depot (ICD), or dry port, was lifted on Wednesday. Nearly 500 employees had lost their jobs after the ICD was shut down in August due to the farmers’ dharna at the entrance of the facility.A massive rally was held at Kila Raipur before culmination of the protest, where Kalyan Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, Punjab, who had led the year-long agitation here, was given a grand reception. Protesters also paid homage to Mohinder Kaur, 70, who had died at the dharna site. Besides, tributes were paid to all farmers, who died during the protests at Singhu and Tikri borders.Harnek Singh Gujjarwal, SKM member and district secretary, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Naujawan Sabha, Punjab, said, “Since the day Adani left, we had been demanding that instead of lending the logistics park to any private company, the government should take its control and reinstate the employees to generate employment in the area.”The Adani Group had set up the depot in 2017 over 80 acres to facilitate the industries in Ludhiana by providing them cargo services through rail and road.In January, it became the target of SKM, when activists of farmer organisations placed tractors and trolleys in front of its gate and started an indefinite protest to oppose the three farm laws.This obstructed the movement of goods, completely halting operations of the ICD.An employee said the company was incurring a daily loss of ₹50 crore due to the closure of the depot: “The government incurred a loss to the exchequer in the form of GST, customs duties and other taxes to the tune of ₹700 crore and an overall economic impact of around ₹7,000 crore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finally-farmers-dharna-lifted-from-adani-group-s-dry-port-101639601020694.html
16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Toll charges hiked, farmers refuse to lift dharna from Ladhowal toll plaza||Miffed over the hiked toll charges, activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Kadian) and Kirti Kisan Union refused to call off their ongoing anti-farm law protest at the Ladhowal Toll Plaza on Wednesday.The unions also decided to keep all toll plazas across the state shut until further decision is taken following a meeting of 32 farmer organisations on December 17.Before it was shut due to the farmers’ protest, the National Highway Authority of India was earning an average of ₹50 lakh daily from Ladhowal toll plaza alone, translating to a loss of over ₹200 crore during the over 14-month-long protest.Earlier, BKU activists had decided to end the protest on December 15, and as per schedule, a Sukhmani Sahib path was organised for its culmination.In the morning, activists gathered at the protest site were asked to clear the toll passages and leave the venue after completion of the prayers.As such, toll plaza employees had also begun cleaning the toll booths and the revised rate list was set up.Meanwhile, Harmeet Singh Kadian, president, BKU-Kadian, and Santokh Singh Sekhon and members of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) joined the gathering.As the prayers concluded, Kadian announced that the dharna at Ladhowal and other toll plazas across the state will continue in protest against the revision of toll rates.“We have noticed that the toll rates have increased on all toll plazas across the state. This will not be tolerated as the government is penalising the people for no fault. At Ladhowal toll plaza, all monthly passes have been revoked and people have been asked to register these again. These are draconian measures and completely unconstitutional. We have decided that toll plazas across the state will remain shut and further action will be taken following the meeting between SKM members on December 17,” said Kadian. Sekhon said the rates had been revised from 125 to 135 for single journey and from 185 to 200 for return journey. “Further, the earlier monthly passes have been scrapped and people living in Phillaur and Ludhiana will have to visit to get the new passes, which is sheer harassment,” he added. He said people will also have to pay toll first at Ladhowal and then at Southern Bypass, which was merely 5km away. Later, Virender Singh, project director, NHAI, visited the venue with other NHAI officials. He had a discussion with the BKU members, which remained inconclusive.He explained that the prices had not been increased, rather adjusted as per the wholesale price index (WPI) and advertisement in this regard was also published in leading daily newspapers in September. He said farmers had raised certain issues. “We have tried to convince them. We hope that the matter will resolve soon and the toll plaza operations will resume,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianatoll-charges-hiked-farmers-refuse-to-lift-dharna-from-ladhowal-toll-plaza-101639601019368.html

Sharma has also lodged a complaint with the state vigilance department, demanding a thorough probe into the ‘corruption’ in the project. Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, however, termed the allegations as “weird and lacking substance”.Addressing the media, Sharma said the purchase was initiated during the tenure of then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and the deal was completed by his successor Brahm Mohindra. “It was for the first time in the history of the state that the government agreed to pay private players ₹1,520 crore over a period of 10 years for an investment of ₹60 crore,” Sharma said. He said if the SAD-BSP alliance forms the government in 2022, a case will be registered and recommendation for a CBI or central vigilance commission probe will be made. Releasing documents procured under the provisions of the RTI Act, Sharma gave details of the contract given to install LED lights in Patiala cluster. “The LEDs were purchased at inflated rates, putting a burden on the municipal corporations and councils across the state,” he added. “Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi should explain if he has become a party to the case or he is initiating action into the matter,” Sharma said. He also raised illegal sand mining in Zirakpur and illegal felling of khair trees over 90 acres of land in Lalru. Reacting to Sharma’s allegations, local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra said the department has no policy of centralised purchase. “All the local civic bodies are independent entities and have their own system of making purchases,” Mohindra said, terming the allegations as weird and without substance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-alleges-1-500-cr-scam-in-led-bulbs-purchase-in-punjab-s-local-bodies-dept-101639600239295.html

These establishments were identified after a special survey in all eight zones of the city.“It was a surprise when we got the data about 51,611 houses and 14,666 commercial properties never paying house tax to LMC. I have directed the tax inspectors of the zones to recover house tax from these property owners and initiate action if they don’t pay tax to LMC,” said Ashok Singh, chief tax fixation officer, LMC. “Initially, the LMC will persuade and motivate these property owners to pay their tax within the next one month after which recovery notices will be issued in accordance with LMC rules. Even then, if someone does not pay the taxes, strict action will be taken by the LMC.“If people think that they can escape paying tax to the government then they are wrong because we have advanced technology to track and trace properties, including satellite imaging and physical verification. The money from taxes is used for the civic development of the city. It is from this money that LMC constructs roads, places street lights, cleans the roads, maintains water supply, etc. So, people must pay their taxes to avail of the civic services.”Meanwhile, in a meeting of LMC tax inspectors, additional municipal commissioner Pankaj Singh has directed officials to increase tax collection by creating awareness but without any harassment of property owners. He said, “Due to the pandemic, several people are facing economic problems. That’s why LMC tax inspectors will have to be firm but polite during the recovery of taxes. They can take taxes in instalments, if required.”The additional municipal commissioner has directed zonal officers to serve notices to tax inspectors who have shown poor recovery. All the inspectors with less than 40% recovery were given show cause notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/67k-lucknow-properties-have-never-paid-tax-to-lmc-recovery-action-in-pipeline-101639599939066.html

16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhpal Khaira’s custody can’t be enhanced merely for indolence of ED: High court||Sukhpal Singh Khaira can’t be put to custody of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) merely for indolence and lethargy of the agency, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said while rejecting agency’s plea for his further custody. In the detailed order released on Wednesday, the high court bench of justice Sureshwar Thakur said that the application moved by the ED before a trial court seeking seven days’ remand of the Congress leader was only “cast in a most perfunctory and mechanical mould than in an iron cast required by the law”. It was on Tuesday that the high court had dismissed the ED plea for the custody of the Congress leader in the money laundering case. The ED arrested Khaira, a former Punjab MLA, on November 11 under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). He remained in the ED custody till November 18 but the central agency sought remand for seven more days from a trial court in Mohali, which was declined. The ED had appealed against this order in the high court, claiming that Khaira’s custody was required to determine the role of various other persons and to ascertain the trail of transactions. Further, it was argued that he is still to be confronted with the voluminous evidence and that he could not be questioned on some days due to public holidays. The ED had also alleged non-cooperation from him and termed it deliberate concealment of material evidence with the intent to jeopardise the investigation. Khaira had told the high court that even prior to his arrest, he had been repeatedly summoned on 11 occasions, and during that period, 88 hours were spent by the officials with him. During the eight days in custody, only 38 questions were put to him and that only 90 minutes per day were utilised by the ED officials to interrogate him. “The afore echoings borne in the impugned order, coupled with the factum that the learned court concerned has also traversed through all the relevant records appertaining to the bank accounts and statements of all concerned, rather naturally and tenably led the/remanding court, to make a valid conclusion, that the claim for police remand, as made by the special public prosecutor concerned, was unmeritworthy,” the high court said. The bench further observed that the ED has not been able to produce any material suggestive that any of the Khaira’s arguments, carried in the impugned order, are false. “The consequence of the afore, is that the learned court concerned had tenably declined the claim (of ED) ..., as prima facie it would give a tool to the ED to unnecessarily harass the respondent-accused,” the court said, adding that the ED was given abundant opportunities to question him but it failed. The ED initiated PMLA proceedings against Khaira in connection with a 2015 FIR. A court had convicted four persons and by the same order, Khaira was summoned as “additional accused”. In December 2017, Supreme Court stayed his summoning. Khaira, who joined Congress in June, has all along maintained that these proceedings are part of a “political vendetta”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhpal-khaira-s-custody-can-t-be-enhanced-merely-for-indolence-of-ed-high-court-101639599339043.html
16-12-2021||Chandigarh||HP assembly question hour: ‘Land for Mandi airport yet to be finalised’||The Himachal Pradesh government hasn’t yet finalised the site for construction of airport at Mandi or initiated the process for acquisition of private land for the proposed project, Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur said on Wednesday. Therefore question of displacement of families does not arise at this stage, he said, while replying to a question raised by CPIM legislator from Theog Rakesh Singha. He said the exact details of families to be displaced, identification of alternative land for their rehabilitation and compensation could be worked out once the process of the acquisition of land and social impact assessment study are completed. He said the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 in Chapter-III, Section 10(2) has a provision for acquisition of multi-crop land in exceptional circumstances for any public purpose. However, provisions will not apply in case of projects that are linear in nature. Singha had said that the government should also protect the interest of people who would be displaced by the project and also sought to know whether the airport will be constructed by a private company or the government. Meanwhile, issuing a suo-motu statement in the House, CM Jai Ram Thakur sought support of all legislators for the project, stating that the initiative will not only boost tourism but also be beneficial for coming generation in terms of employment opportunities and better connectivity. Citing lack of better road and rail connectivity in the state, the CM said the road connectivity has improved a bit with four-lane projects, but the railway expansion is uncertain. He said there were three small airports in HP, but the airfares were on the higher side due to load penalty which deter tourists from opting flights. “The cost of air travel to Shimla, Kullu and Kangra is more than tickets to many foreign countries,” he said, adding that it was not his individual project but for the larger benefit of the state. He said as of now, only OLS survey and LIDAR survey of the airport has been conducted, report of which is positive.Jai Ram said the state government had taken up the issue with Centre and the finance commission which had sanctioned ₹ 1,000 crore for constructing Greenfield airport at Mandi. “If we are able to build the airport, it will help tap into the vast tourism potential of the state and tourists will forget Kashmir after witnessing the beautiful landscapes of Himachal,” he added. Panel to ensure 70% jobs to Himachal youth in industryThe Himachal government on Wednesday announced to form a committee of labour and employment department to ensure 70% jobs to the youth of Himachal in industrial units of the state. Doon legislator Paramjeet Singh Pammi had alleged that directives of the government were being implemented only on papers and ground reality was different. He also claimed that industrial units befooled the government and labour and employment department officials by showing fake records of jobs given to locals.Replying to the question, rural development minister Virender Kanwar said a committee will be formed to probe the issue and ensure implementation of the directive. He was replying on behalf of industry minister Bikram Singh. He said the government has issued notices to 18 industrial units for not implementing the directive of providing 70% employment to the youth of the state. “If they are found to be violating the norms, the state government will withdraw benefits provided to these units,” he added. He said it has been seen that local youth were not keen on working in textile, cement and steel industrial units. However, the Doon legislator said there were few heavy industries in the state and maximum were pharmaceutical companies.The minister also informed that as many as 1,06,749 people were employed in industrial units, including 60,127 in Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh (BBN) belt.He said the legislator may give specific details of industrial units he knows were violating the norm and strict action will be taken against them.Kanwar said Himachal had notified industrial policy in 2004 in which provision of 70% employment to Himachalis was made and it had now been increased to 80% in the Industrial Policy 2019. Nalagarh legislator Lakhvinder Rana also alleged that employment norms were being violated. BJP MLA from Nagrota Arun Kumar sought the list of total industrial units functional in the state which the minister assured to provide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-assembly-question-hour-land-for-mandi-airport-yet-to-be-finalised-101639599046055.html

All the candidates who gave bribe, are also accused. Then why were their names not disclosed?” the senior Congress leaders asked.The Congress leaders said in the November 17 FIR and remand request, it was stated that bribe was taken to pass candidates in the Haryana Teacher Eligibility Test (HTET) conducted by the Haryana School Education Board (HSEB). “However, neither the HSEB was investigated nor any person who took bribe and paid bribe to pass the HTET exam was arrested or investigated,” they said.The Congress leader further said in recruitment of police sub-inspector (SI) male and female, the HSSC has accepted irregularities in recruitment of 41 male candidates and nine female candidates, but no FIR was registered against anyone.The HSSC has also admitted that in the recruitment of 516 police commandos, the fingerprints given at the time of paper are not matching with the biometrics at the time of paper checking.“It is clear from the veiled proceedings of the VB that the whole matter has been dumped. Even the candidates who took the job by paying bribe were not investigated. It is clear that the entire matter will be settled silently and no action will be taken by the government,” said Selja and Surjewala, pointing out that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar cannot escape the responsibility in this recruitment scandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/reveal-names-of-bribe-givers-in-cash-for-job-scam-haryana-cong-101639596999705.html

Col Singh, a Vir Chakra recipient, himself fought in the war as part of the 4 Rajput Regiment. A Major in the army at the time, Col Singh wanted to highlight the leadership skills of the junior-level officers through his book. Elaborating on the same, he said, “While most of the war books on the East Pakistan war have been written from the perspective of top military commanders, my book has been written from the grassroots level. The stress has been laid on battalion-level operations, highlighting junior commanders’ leadership.” “Majority of the books cover a specific unit or formation whereas my book covers the entire offensive operation by India’s Eastern Command and illustrates the war in its entirety,” he added.Recalling the military’s meticulous planning and strategy-making, Col Singh said, “The Indian Army had weaved a chakravyuh to ensure success. It was meticulous planning, which was relentlessly executed to perfection by all sub units, which I have mentioned in the book.”The 163-page-long book offers insights into the background of the war, its trigger point and actions prior to declaration of war by Pakistan on December 3, 1971. The book also includes detailed illustrations in the form of 38 maps and sketches.Among those present at the event were Lt General Bhopinder Singh, Lt General HS Panag, Lt General GS Sihota, Major General PC Puri, Major General JS Dhillon and Brigadier HS Lamba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/veteran-releases-his-book-on-1971-indo-pak-war-in-chandigarh-101639596830823.html

16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: No new taxes, promises Congress||With the promise to make Chandigarh the “No. 1” city in the country, the Congress on Wednesday released its manifesto for the municipal corporation elections scheduled on December 24.Among other key promises are no new taxes, water tariff hike rollback and separate budget for villages.The Congress, aiming to take back the MC’s reigns from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after six years, has proposed to generate alternative sources of revenue for the civic body instead of imposing any new tax on the residents.Releasing the manifesto at the Congress Bhawan in Sector 35, former Chandigarh MP and the party’s national treasurer Pawan Kumar Bansal said: “The BJP has burdened the city residents with unprecedented high taxes, and the Congress will ensure that this is rectified.”The party has also promised to permanently roll back the increase in water charges and other levies imposed by the BJP-run corporation. “The Congress will bring back the old rates of sewerage tax at ₹20 per toilet seat. The existing sewerage tax being charged at 30% of the water bill is the highest such tax in the country,” said Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla.The party also promised to demand the “rightful share” of the MC from the UT’s revenues, as allocated by the Delhi Finance Commission. It is a long-pending issue and has come up repeatedly in the previous election manifestos of both the BJP and Congress.“Funds for the capital expenditure, used for development works, will be increased. In the BJP rule, it has sharply declined, affecting the city’s development,” said Bansal, adding that the Congress has resolved to ensure the city’s growth and development with accountability, commitment, and transparency.Making city No. 1 in cleanlinessWith Chandigarh slipping in the Swachh Survekshan rankings, the Congress is promising to make the city “cleanest” again.Party’s state in-charge Harish Chaudhary said that if the Congress is voted into power, “the city’s lost glory as the best city in the country with impeccable standards in cleanliness, beautiful roads, exquisite parks and a good quality of life will be re-achieved”.The party will revamp the existing garbage management system, and a “new world-class garbage treatment plant with latest technology will be set up on priority”, states the manifesto. Under the new garbage collection system, maximum share of the revenue will be given to the personnel engaged in garbage collection, it said.Notably, the BJP has repeatedly blamed the Congress for the dysfunctional solid waste processing plant in Dadumajra, as it was set up during the Congress rule. “If it was so bad, then why didn’t the BJP do anything about it in the last six years?” said Chawla.Congress is locked in a three-cornered electoral battle with the BJP and Aam Admi Party (AAP). In the past few months, the party has seen senior party leaders, including former city unit chief Pardeep Chhabra, join the rival parties. The party is also facing challenge from around a dozen rebel candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-no-new-taxes-promises-congress-101639596828292.html

It has been almost nine years since Baljit and his family migrated to Melbourne, but his relatives back in Mohali have been following Harkirat’s game all this while and are over the moon as he is set to represent Australia in the upcoming U-19 World Cup to be held in the West Indies from January 14.“It is phenomenal to see my son do well for Victoria in age group tournaments and bag a berth in the Australian U-19 team, which will compete in the World Cup. It was my dream to see Harkirat play for Australia one day. The U-19 team is just a start for him,” says Baljit, 45, who was a construction engineer in Mohali and was part of the team that constructed the PCA Stadium. The family moved to Melbourne in 2012. As a seven-year-old, Harkirat had just played gully cricket in Mohali, but when he arrived in Australia, he joined Chelsea Cricket Club to hone his cricketing skills. An off-spinner with bowling action very similar to India’s Harbhajan Singh, Harkirat idolises both Harbhajan and Ravichandran Ashwin. “I am greatly inspired by both the Indian spinners. I have grown up seeing Harbhajan Singh’s videos and a bit of my bowling action resembles his. Learning the sport in Melbourne has been the best thing to have happened to me,” says Harkirat, who plays for Melbourne Cricket Club and has also played for Australia U-16 team before the pandemic. Harkirat says his father took up driving a cab to remain independent and take him to practice sessions when required. “He has been a tremendous support, pushing me from the start,” says Harkirat, a devout Sikh and a true Punjabi by heart.Many Indian-origin cricketers, such as Gurinder Sandhu, Jason Jaskirat Singh Sangha and Tanveer Sangha, went on to play for Australia senior men’s team after doing well for the Australian U-19 teams in the past. Harkirat has this fact in the back of his mind.“All of them have proved their mettle at the junior level before getting a chance for the Australian senior team. I am eyeing success in the Caribbean and want to do well for my team. My dream will come true the day I get selected for the Australian senior team,” he says, while adding that he admires Australian spinners Shane Warne, Nython Lyon and Stuart McGill.Australia last won the U-19 World Cup in 2010. They take on hosts West Indies in the opener on January 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/u19-cricket-world-cup-cabbie-s-son-with-roots-in-mohali-to-play-for-australia-101639596819649.html
16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Technical institutes’ faculty to retire at 65, not 58||In a big relief to the faculty of technical institutes in Chandigarh, the UT administration has withdrawn an appeal from the Supreme Court, which was filed to challenge a Punjab and Haryana high court ruling on enhancement of their retirement age from 58 to 65 years.The decision will affect the faculty at Punjab Engineering College and Chandigarh College of Architecture in Sector 12; Chandigarh College of Engineering and Technology, Sector 26; Government Polytechnic for Women, Sector 10; and Government College of Art, Sector 10. It was on March 1 when the high court had held that retirement age for faculty of institutes governed under norms of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will be 65 years, and not 58 as fixed by the Chandigarh administration, with an extension period of five years as in central government institutes. The court had also directed that the petitioners who were forcibly superannuated be taken back with consequential benefits.The UT administration had approached the apex court against this order on August 23.A lawyer associated with the case said that a statement was made before the Supreme Court on instructions from the UT administration that the petition be withdrawn. The lawyer said that the UT’s instructions were in pursuant to a communication from the Centre to withdraw the case. The SC’s website showed the case status as “dismissed as withdrawn”.“This decision will benefit approximately 300 teachers working in higher and technical institutions in Chandigarh. It will go a long way in solving teachers’ problems,” said Dr Manoj Kumar, general secretary, Chandigarh Government College Teachers’ Association.Litigation so far In 2020, a group of faculty members of Government College of Art and Government College of Architecture had moved the Central Administrative Tribunal, challenging the UT administration’s rules pertaining to their retirement. After they lost, they approached the high court.The teachers have been arguing that their institutes are governed under the AICTE Act, 1987, and rules with regard to regulations on pay scales, service conditions, etc, should apply as followed by all AICTE-governed institutes. However, the Chandigarh administration was of the view that services of these faculty members are covered by rules framed under a 1992 notification, according to which Punjab government service rules have been adopted in the UT, and the retirement age should remain 58 years.The high court was of the view that in the case of Union Territories, the rule-making power belongs to the President. This power under Article 309 and the rules framed will operate and will have a force of law, unless and until the Parliament chooses to legislate on the subject. “Once the Parliament legislates, such Act and the rules/regulations framed there under, would take over the field, resulting in the rules framed by the President under proviso to Article 309 seizing to operate forthwith,” the high court had said referring to the AICTE Act.The high court was also of the view that under the AICTE Regulations, 2010, the age for superannuation was 65 years, with a provision for re-employment up to the age of 70 years. To the argument that funds for the colleges are provided by the UT, the high court had said that these are central government funds and the UT is merely utilising them.Meanwhile, retirement age of teachers at Panjab University (PU) is 60 years. The PU faculty has lost first round of litigation on increasing the retirement age to 65, and an appeal against the same is pending before a division bench of the high court. The argument in this case is that PU is not a centrally funded institute as Punjab gives an annual grant to the varsity.
16-12-2021||Other||Cong poll campaign to centre around collective leadership||Chandigarh In a strategic move, the Congress has decided to run its 2022 assembly election campaign in Punjab with “collective leadership” rather than centering it on any individual leader, but remains concerned about answering tough questions on former chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh’s four-and-a-half-year stint. The first ground rule for the poll campaign, in which the party is seeking to retain power, was set at a meeting held by Punjab Congress campaign committee head Sunil Jakhar with state unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu, CM Charanjit Singh Channi, state affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary, among others, at the Punjab Bhawan, the state headquarters of the party, on Wednesday. Former Punjab Congress chief Jakhar, appointed the campaign in-charge by the party high command last week, began the brainstorming session by seeking suggestions from Sidhu, Channi and others on the campaign theme and whether it should be based on ideology, personality, vision or performance, according to party sources. Chaudhary, while asking everyone to work together, stressed on “collective leadership”, stating former Congress president Rahul Gandhi was in favour of this. Channi was taciturn, saying that he would go with the decision taken by the party high command; Sidhu emphasised the need to build a credible campaign. The PPCC chief spoke about the resentment among party workers over issues, such as appointments given to close relatives of ministers and MLAs, adding that these should be rolled back, said sources. He also took a dig at Channi by stating that the campaign was already on, with the CM’s photos on just about every rooftop. Concern over tough questions on Capt’s tenure At the meeting, Jakhar also asked his colleagues to be prepared to answer tough questions during the campaign on the first four-and-a-half years of Amarinder, who has since quit the Congress to float his separate political outfit. “We cannot run away from it,” he is learnt to have told them.Amarinder was made to resign as the CM by the Congress in September this year following revolt by four of his ministers and several MLAs over his “laid-back style of governance” and “non-fulfilment of key promises”. Another suggestion was to hold sessions with sections of society, such as NRIs, who were quite active and wooed by different parties during the 2017 polls. In these sessions, the CM or the finance minister can address their issues. “This was the first meeting and only preliminary discussions were held. The campaign in-charge will hold follow-up meetings before finalising the theme and strategy,” persons familiar with the discussions said. Jakhar is also likely to announce his campaign committee team in the next three-four days and may include some MPs in it. Congress joint secretary Krishna Allavaru, secretary Raminder Awla, Punjab Congress general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh and state working president Sukhvinder Singh Danny were also present at the meeting. Sidhu posts photo with Harbhajan, sets off speculations After the meeting, Sidhu tweeted a photo with former cricketer Harbhajan Singh with the caption, “Picture loaded with possibilities…With Bhajji the shining star”. The PPCC president’s tweet triggered speculation that the former Indian cricket team spinner was joining the ruling party. Earlier, there were also reports about his entry into the BJP, but Harbhajan had put out a tweet, calling it “fake news”. Later, Sidhu and Chaudhary addressed newly-appointed district presidents and working presidents of the party. State Election Committee meets today Sidhu has convened a meeting of the Pradesh Election Committee (PEC) on Thursday to set the ball rolling on the selection of candidates for the polls. The panel, which has Channi and his cabinet ministers, as members, will meet at the Punjab Bhawan. The PEC is tasked with shortlisting candidates. Rajya Sabha members Ambika Soni and Partap Singh Bajwa, former state president Jakhar, HS Hanspal and Mohinder Singh Kaypee, former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, former Punjab Congress senior vice-president Lal Singh and AlCC secretary KL Sharma are also part of the state poll panel, besides all MPs and state heads of the frontal organisations of the party.

Bhagwat was speaking at the inaugural session of the three-day long Hindu Ekta Mahakumbh organised with the theme ‘Chaahe panth anek ho, saare Hindu ek ho’ (Whether the sects are different, all the Hindus are one). He asked people to take a pledge for propagation and protection of Hindu culture and values, besides protecting and respecting the dignity of women. He also gave a call for ‘selfless unity’ among believers of Hinduism. “Keep making efforts to bring people, who had left Hinduism and ensure that they can rejoin the Sanatan Dharma. The fear could not hold you back for long. We will have to ensure no one leaves Hindu religion, those who have left, will be brought back to our family,” he said exhorting the participants. Jagatguru Tulsi Peethadheeshwar Swami Bhadracharya, who organised this event, in his address, also sought for the Uniform Civil Code by 2024. The Sangh chief further laid emphasis on the Hindu unity and said, “The followers of the religion should work selflessly and tirelessly with sacrificing the ego.” To make his point clear, he also narrated the story of constant wars between the gods and demons for the power of heaven. Meanwhile, during the discourse Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of living, said when the Hindu unite, they work for the country unlike those who unite to terrorize. He also endorsed the 12-point agenda that include ‘love jihad’ and religious conversion. Though billed as completely apolitical, the Mahakumbh has issues on the agenda that could give political overtone to discussion especially when assembly polls were weeks away. The topics of discussions include Shri Ram temple--a symbol of national respect; solution and problems related to control on temples and mutts; religious conversion-- an international conspiracy; love jihad--deviation of youths and the solution. Besides, uniform civil code, population control law, nationalism, education based on Indian philosophy, cow-protection, social harmony, de-addiction, and environment oriented cultural rejuvenation. CM likely to attend Mahakumbh today The Hindu Ekta Mahakumbh that started with simultaneous blowing of 1,100 conches would end on Thursday. Around one lakh seers and saints from all over the country are attending this event. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is expected to attend and address the event on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hindu-ekta-mahakumbh-bhagwat-calls-for-ghar-wapsi-hindu-unity-in-chitrakoot-101639596579851.html

Addressing people during his ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in Jalandhar on Wednesday, he added, “Jalandhar’s sports manufacturing is world-class and the AAP will set up India’s biggest sports university here in Jalandhar. The region is also the hub of NRIs, who want direct connectivity to Jalandhar, our party will develop an international airport too for their convenience.” The party’s Tiranga Yatra began from Valmiki Chowk and concluded at the Ambedkar Chowk in the city and was attended by locals and party volunteers. State party chief Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition, Harpal Singh Cheema and state affairs in-charge and Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh accompanied Kejriwal. “I would like to salute our farmers and people of Punjab as they led the protest against the farm laws. People from Punjab sat on the Delhi borders and the country’s farmers stood by them. Now, all of us have to win the battle for the glory of Punjab and form an AAP government,” Kejriwal added.The Delhi CM added that the AAP was following the vision of the visionary father of the Indian Constitution, BR Ambedkar, by emphasising education in the national capital and providing world-class education was the major responsibility of any state. AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann said, “Punjab has wasted too many opportunities on the Akali-BJP combine and the Congress parties, but the shamelessness of these parties knows no bounds as they are asking for another opportunity. In 2022, the people of Punjab will give a chance to their progress and form an honest government.” He added that the party will hold a rally in the Akali bastion of Lambi (Muktsar) baston on Thursday. After the procession, Kejriwal met all AAP candidates in Jalandhar, where, sources said, he clarified that only focus of the party during campaigning had to be multi-pronged development of Punjab. Earlier in the day in Amritsar, Kejriwal said, “Punjab is the land of martyrs. Our Tiranga Yatra is a tribute to all freedom fighters and martyrs.” He added that Punjabis had always been leaders when it came to serving the country.“Even today Punjab’s heroes are at forefront, sacrificing their lives while saving our borders and keeping our nation safe. That’s why hosting a tricolor procession in Punjab, is a salute to all those warriors. The yatra is dedicated to a better future for Punjab,” he added. On his arrival at the airport, Punjab leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema; senior leader Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, Jeewanjot Kaur, Seema Sodhi, Prabhjot Brar, Iqbal Singh Bhullar, Jagdeep Singh and other AAP leaders of state welcomed them.Tiranga Yatra a hoax, claims BJPThe Bharatiya janata party (BJP) on Wednesday claimed, in Chandigarh, that Kejriwal’s Tiranga Yatra was a hoax and was an attempt to mislead the public. Punjab BJP general secretary Subash Sharma said, “With elections approaching, Kejriwal has suddenly turned into a nationalist; not so long ago, the same Kejriwal had questions the Indian Army, even asking it to prove the Balakot air strike.”

Sources said the failure of the state police to present evidence in the murder case of gangster Lavi Deora led to the acquittal. It was alleged that in an inter-gang rivalry, these gangsters had killed 25-year-old gangster Deora on July 15, 2017, at a fair in Kotkapura town of Faridkot district. It was alleged that all these accused belong to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Initially, the police had booked Bhola Shooter and others for the crime. The remaining four accused were named after further investigation, and a local court had framed charges against them in October 2019. Defence lawyer Shiv Kartar Sekhon said the prosecution failed to substantiate the charges against his clients. “The prosecution lawyer could not produce any evidence against the accused. The circumstantial evidence and forensic reports produced by the probe agency did not prove the complicity of the five in the alleged crime. The prosecution failed to establish the chain of events,” he said. Citing lack of evidence, additional sessions judge Jagdeep Marok observed that the prosecution failed to establish the culpability of the accused. The only witness in the case had turned hostile during cross-examination. Deora’s killing was the fallout of two friends turning foes. Hailing from Kotkapura, Lavi and Bhola were earlier nominated as co-accused in many criminal cases in the area. Later, they went their separate ways over the establishment of their criminal supremacy in the region.

Some leaders of left parties and local workers also participated in the march titled ‘Mazdoor Vijay Yatra’. The farmers had been protesting against the farm laws at Rajiv Chowk for the last one year. Yudhvir Singh, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, who presided over the event, asserted that the protest movement of farmers led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) saved democracy in the country. “Farmers from all castes and communities came together in this fight. I just want to tell the people that farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP and across the country managed to defeat a powerful government due to their unity,” he said. Santokh Singh, president of SKM, Gurugram, said that backtracking on three laws was a political decision taken by the BJP government because of the upcoming state elections. “The government was expecting that farmers will get tired and return to their homes but we proved them wrong,” he said. “We will never surrender before the capitalists who are trying to monopolize the agriculture sector and industries in the country,” said SL Prajapati, secretary, Gurugram unit of CPI (M), who participated in the rally. The BJP said that the party believed in the ideology of nation first, and the Prime Minister had categorically said that he had brought the laws in the favour of the small and marginal farmers and he was taking these back in the interest of the country. “Political battles would be fought in political arenas. The small and marginal farmers for whom these laws were beneficial are also a family as are the ones protesting. It is our promise that upliftment of farming community would not be like garibi hatao slogan by those who ruined this nation for decades,” said Raman Malik, spokesperson, Haryana BJP.

16-12-2021||Other||Gurugram air quality remains ‘very poor’||The air quality in the city on Wednesday deteriorated marginally, but continued to be in the ‘very poor’ category for the second day. With wind speed slowing down, the dispersal of pollutants has reduced and this has led to higher levels of pollution, experts said. The air quality index of Gurugram at 4pm on Wednesday was 341, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, an increase from Tuesday’s reading of 306. At the four monitoring stations of the city, the AQI reading at Vikas Sadan station was 364, 313 at Teri Gram, 327 at Gwal Pahari and 355 at Sector 51 station. Sachin Panwar, city-based air quality expert, said that due to snowfall and rain in the Himalayan region, there is stronger thermal inversion in the plains. “It is due to this reason that air pollution rises after 5pm and peaks during the night,” he said. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Gurugram recorded a minimum temperature at 8.5°C, while the maximum was 22.2°C, according to the India Meteorological Department. The IMD said that air quality is likely to improve but will remain in ‘very poor’ category on Thursday and Friday. “After that the air quality will be in poor to moderate category for the next three days as wind speed improves,” the IMD predicted. Meanwhile, the air quality in neighbouring Faridabad also remained in very poor category with AQI at 334, while AQI in Delhi was recorded at 363. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), shallow foggy condition is likely to keep AQI in ‘very poor’ category for the next two days. “The partial cloud conditions and moderate mixing layer height are likely to ensure that dispersal of pollutants is less. But from Thursday onwards, the air quality is going to improve and from Friday significant improvement is likely due to high wind speeds that keeps AQI within ‘poor’ or ‘lower end of very poor’ category,” said the Safar forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-air-quality-remains-very-poor-101639594598138.html

16-12-2021||Delhi||Rating rise good reply to detractors: Jamia V-C says, two years after violence||Jamia Millia Islamia vice chancellor professor Najma Akhtar on Wednesday said the university’s improved NAAC rating was a “good response” to those who thought that the university would not recover after the violence on and near the campus on December 15, 2019, during protests against the Citizenship (amendment) Act. Jamia was accredited with an A++ rating by the NAAC (National Accreditation and Assessment Council) on Tuesday. The central university has improved its rating from 3.09 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and an ‘A’ grade which was awarded by NAAC in the last cycle in 2015. The new CGPA stands at 3.61. The ranking comes after a NAAC peer team review was conducted at the university between 6- 8 December. This was the second cycle of assessment by NAAC which gives an A++ grade to an institution that gets 3.51 and higher score. It is the highest grade in its CGPA range.“The NAAC rating is a good response to whatever injustice that had happened with us. This is a response of a civilized society,” Akhtar said at a press conference.“Jamia has moved on and stepped ahead since the day when students were thrashed on the campus. We were with our students back then, and continue to back them. This (improvement in NAAC rating) is an aggressive response that shows that we were not defeated that day,” she said.The Delhi Police stormed the Jamia campus on December 15, 2019, beating up students and damaging the varsity property after protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, in the nearby New Friends Colony area took a violent turn, leaving at least 200 people injured and several public and private vehicles as well as public property damaged. The police claim they entered the campus on the heels of a violent mob that took refuge inside it.Recalling the events that unfolded at the university campus, the VC said that the university stood strong despite the turmoil. “Today is a day of remembrance for us. Despite the events of December 2019, we stood up and stepped ahead. All students who got hurt that day have moved on. We will silently remember the day but will also celebrate the fact that we didn’t get demoralized that day. Police barged into the university and thrashed students that day but we were not defeated,” said Akhtar. Following the events of December 15, the university has strengthened security on-premises and regulated the entry of outsiders more strictly. The Delhi Police erased the protest graffiti last year, whatever little remained was wiped out earlier this month. Students say that through the erasure of the graffiti, the administration had removed the last traces that were a testimony to the events of December 2019. Tasneem Zehra, 21, a postgraduate student of the varsity, said, “Back in 2019, we felt that we could voice our concerns and take a stand for the things we believed in. Amid the pandemic, with classes happening virtually and students not being able to meet frequently, there has been a setback when it comes to the expression of political thought. The graffiti within the campus has been erased. It’s unfortunate and the university no longer feels like a space where we can freely express our political views,” said Zehra. When asked if the university had any space for political expression, Akhtar said that the university had only carried out a cleanliness drive ahead of the NAAC review. “The police got the graffiti removed in an unclean manner. So, right before the visit of the NAAC team, we carried out the annual cleanliness drive around the campus to fix things,” said Akhtar. She added that the university did not have a student union, but it continues to engage with students through an alternative mechanism. “I believe that there should always be a students union. Since the matter of students union is subjudice, we have an alternative arrangement in place. We have student committees for different courses and we continue to engage with these students,” said Akhtar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rating-rise-good-reply-to-detractors-jamia-v-c-says-two-years-after-violence-101639594478295.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||LG writes to Delhi CM, asks govt to release ₹328 cr to North MCD||Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal has written to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, requesting the state government to release ₹328 crore to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation so that the civic body can pay the salaries of its staff and reduce interruptions of essential public services on account of repeated strikes by the staff.HT has seen a copy of the letter. When contacted, a Delhi government spokesperson said that instead of recovering thousands of crores of rupees that the Centre owes to the municipal corporations, the civic body was “extorting” money from the state government.According to the letter, dated December 2, the LG said his office received a representation from North MCD commissioner Sanjay Goel explaining the critical financial condition of the corporation, and its inability to pay salaries of a majority of employees, “resulting in unrest and disaffection among the employees and thus affecting the delivery of essential services”.The cash-strapped civic body has faced protests and strikes by the doctors, nurses and paramedical staff, and it has adversely impacted the functioning of six major health institutions run by North MCD, the letter said.“It has been informed that while the Budget Estimates of 2021-2022 for North DMC have been reduced by ₹328.60 crore, additional financial liability on account of enhanced dearness allowance ( ₹240 crores) and pending salaries, pensions etc ( ₹600 crore) has accrued resulting in the present financial crisis. In view of the above, North DMC has requested that an amount of at least ₹328 crore, deducted as per the revised estimates, may be released on urgent basis for immediate payment of pending salaries, pension, terminal benefits, to the employees of the corporation to tide over the present crisis,” the letter said.The LG’s office could not be reached for a comment.Nearly 10,000 staff of the North MCD went on a 24-hour strike on Monday to protest non-payment of salaries for several months, but withdrew it hours later after the corporation officials assured the staff to clear their dues. All three municipal corporations are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and are going through a crippling financial crisis. They have not been able to pay salaries and implement any new projects.Reacting to the letter by the LG, a Delhi government spokesperson said that the state government does not owe any funds to the corporations. “It is the Centre that owes the corporations ₹12,000 crores. The Centre gives grants to all municipal corporations across the country, based on a formula of ₹488 per person of the population. However, it is not paying grants to the three MCDs for the last 17 years. Further, thousands of crores of property tax arrears are also pending from various central government agencies. The MCDs can pay salaries to its employees by recovering these dues. However, it is not doing so to extort and defame the Delhi government,” the spokesperson said.More than 7,000 municipal primary teachers of North MCD are still on the strike, who have refused to acknowledge the agreement reached between the civic body and the umbrella organisation of various staff unions.North MCD standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain on Wednesday said the Delhi government has not released funds despite the LG’s letter. “It is our share of transfer duty and basic tax assignment which is not being released by the AAP to create conditions which led to non-payment of salaries,” he alleged.Leader of the house Chhail Bihari Goswami said that the pending ₹328 crore include transfer duty for October and November, along with the tax shares for the second and third quarter.Vikal Goel, AAP councillor and leader of opposition in North MCD House, said the even the Delhi government faced revenue loss due to the pandemic. “On the one hand, the BJP argues that tax share (of the civic bodies) has been reduced in the revised budget, but we should also consider that the Delhi government has also faced loss of revenue due to the pandemic. They are just trying to deflect the blame of their failures on the Delhi government. Where is all the money from the redevelopment projects going?” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-writes-to-cm-asks-govt-to-give-rs-328-cr-to-north-mcd-101639594419646.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||SC: Re-notify OBC seats as general, go ahead with polls||Mumbai: Local body elections in Maharashtra this year will be held without any reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates, the Supreme Court held on Wednesday as it shot down the Maharashtra government’s plea to stay the entire poll process until empirical data on OBC communities can be gathered. In response, the state cabinet in its weekly meeting passed a resolution to request the State Election Commission (SEC) to postpone the polls, slated to be held in several local body seats on December 21. The cabinet resolved that the polls to urban and rural local bodies should not be held without polling in Other Backward Class (OBC) reserved seats. The SEC is however unlikely to concede to the government’s request. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar directed the SEC to issue a fresh notification, declaring 567 seats out of a total of 2,100 as general category seats instead of OBC seats. These 567 seats were identified by the SEC in its November 24 notification as OBC seats for election to Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis. In its order on Wednesday, the top court declared SEC’s November 24 notification “non est” (non-existent). “We direct that SEC notification with respect to OBC be treated as non est where elections have been notified, and renotify them as general category seats so that elections can take place as per the law. In other words, SEC must issue fresh notification for 27% seats reserved for OBC as general category and initiate election process for these seats along with the remaining seats,” said the court in its order. Noting that the election process for the remaining 73% seats is already underway, the court directed that the counting and declaration of results for all seats would, however, be done simultaneously and on the same day. This will also include bypolls, clarified the bench. The government is now keen to expedite the survey to collect empirical data on OBCs and request the State Election Commission (SEC) to postpone the local polls until the data is collected. Food and civil supplies minister and OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal said that state government will try to expedite the work to collect empirical data. A budgetary allocation will be made by the legislature in the upcoming winter session. The state cabinet also decided to appoint a dedicated officer to coordinate with the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC), which will conduct the survey, Bhujbal said. “The administration will work day and night and in close coordination with the MSBCC to ensure that the work has progressed significantly till the next SC hearing slated to take place on January 17. We are hopeful that by collecting data, we are able to convince the top court to allow us to hold the forthcoming elections in February and March with OBC quota,” he said. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given approval to appoint Sumant Bhange, secretary, general administration department, as the nodal officer to coordinate with various departments and the MSBCC for speedy collection of the data,” he said. The polls are to be conducted in 104 district council seats and 210 panchayat samitis seats in in Bhandara and Gondia, as well as 1,802 seats in 106 nagar panchyats (that govern smaller towns) and four seats in municipal corporations across the state on December 21. Another 7,000 seats from 4500 gram panchayats are going to polls. Advocate Nishant Katneshwarkar, former chief standing counsel of Maharashtra government, said that the state failed to do what 22 other states have done. “Other states collated data, but Maharashtra did nothing. There was no point in approaching the SC again to urge it to allow the polls without have collected data. It was ought to be turned down,” he said. “The government could not collate the data in last two years, even after the SC directed it for the same in December 2019. The state government should not hold any election until the Triple Test compliance was done. It is possible to complete the process of the collection of data in three months. The state government is blaming the Centre for not sharing the SECC data, but let me clarify that it was not meant for the OBC reservation and when our government demanded for it, we demanded it to justify the reservation over 50%,” leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said. “We will have to invite nominations from general category by drawing lottery for women’s reservation. This process will take at least four weeks. Now a call will have to be taken whether the polls for other than OBC segments will be held as announced or if all polls will be postponed for 3-4 weeks. It will be decided once the court order was received,” said an SEC official requesting anonymity. On December 6, the SC had stayed polling in OBC-reserved seats but allowed the rest to go to polls. It further directed the state government to complete its empirical survey on the socio-economic backwardness of OBC communities and grant political reservation based on fresh research. In June, Maharashtra constituted a committee to conduct the survey, but as it would take several months to complete, the state passed an Ordinance in September ensuring up to 27% reservation to OBC candidates so as to ensure that it did not breach the 50% ceiling on reservations. However, the SC struck down the Ordinance last week, and stayed polling in the OBC-reserved seats. The state filed an application on December 10 asking that polling be delayed all together instead of conducting it in what Bhujbal called “a piecemeal manner”. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the state on Wednesday, requested the bench to stay the entire election process for three months during which the commission will complete the exercise of collecting data on representation of OBCs in local bodies. “Instead of passing a partial stay only for 27% of OBC seats, grant a full stay. We are also responsible to OBC and cannot them tell them you are out. The commission will complete its exercise in three months. If the exercise satisfies the court, election can take place in one go for all seats. If not, the interim order can revive in April. Let there be a complete stay till March,” he urged the court. Senior counsel Dushyant Dave, representing OBC candidate Rahul Wagh, also pleaded that the election should not go on without reservation for OBCs. “A substantial population of the society which is marginalised will go unrepresented. I beseech this court to allow the existing administration to continue till the data is collected and exercise is completed by the commission,” Dave argued. Unimpressed with these arguments, the court responded: “You are taking us to a very complex exercise. What if the exercise of collecting data is not complete in the next three months? What if this collection of data becomes a subject matter of proceedings before some other court? There will be a lot of more confusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-re-notify-obc-seats-as-general-go-ahead-with-polls-101639594417951.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||Will take a call on reopening of Delhi schools on Friday, CAQM tells SC||The decision on reopening schools in Delhi-NCR will be taken by Friday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) informed the Supreme Court in an affidavit.The commission, which has eased several restrictions on industrial processes and operation of plants and factories over the past one week, further told the court in its affidavit filed on Wednesday that a review of lifting ban on construction would also be done by December 17.“The representations put forth by various project proponents and associations in the building and construction/ demolition sector, as also by the association of schools/educational institutions are under active examination and consideration by the commission and a decision on these would also be taken soon on or before December 17, based on the impact of the relaxations given above,” the CAQM’s affidavit stated.A bench comprising Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant will consider the commission’s affidavit on Thursday when it resumes hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) on air quality measures in the Capital.Schools in Delhi have been shut on four instances since March last year – twice owing to concerns over Covid-19, and twice because of air pollution. Expert have, however, underscored concerns over learning loss due to prolonged school closure while not preventing the air crisis that young people face even indoors.The Delhi government had on December 2 closed all schools in the city, hours after it was questioned by the top court for reopening schools despite high pollution levels. Later that day, CAQM came out with a fresh order expanding the closure order to all of NCR.The ban on construction was imposed by the top court on November 24. However, on December 10, the court permitted CAQM to consider requests for relaxing the construction ban in the wake of improvement in air quality.Meanwhile, CAQM apprised the bench of its order to allow resumption of operation of six thermal power plants within 300 kms radius of Delhi as per a letter from the Union ministry of power. It added the ban on entry of trucks into Delhi will continue except for those carrying essential commodities and running on cleaner fuels.The affidavit also informed the top court of further relaxations by allowing resumption of full-time operation of milk and dairy processing units, medicines, drugs and life-saving equipment industries.
16-12-2021||Chandigarh||Jeweller shot at in Pinjore by bike-borne snatchers||Three motorcycle-borne snatchers on Tuesday night shot a jeweller in Pinjore, before fleeing with a 45gram-gold chain worth ₹1.8 lakhs, a laptop and a wallet.The victim has been identified as Harish Ohri, a 55-year-old resident of Pinjore, who owns a jewellery shop, Mangalam, in Khera village.Detailing the incident in his complaint, the victim said, “On Tuesday, we shut the shop and my younger brother Narender left before me. I stopped at Hanuman temple and after paying obeisance, I left for my home on my Activa. At around 9.15pm, as I crossed Forest Complex and reached the bridge of Rathpur colony, three youths on a motorcycle stopped me. Two youths, who were pillion riders, had covered their faces and were holding pistols.” “They snatched my laptop bag, following which I fell on the road. When I resisted, one of them fired at my thigh and snatched my gold chain as well. They fled towards Kalka,” he added.Ohri revealed that the stolen laptop contained his business transactions, while the bag also had his wallet, which had all important documents, cards and ₹8,000 in cash.The victim called his younger brother Narender after reaching the Pinjore police station. He was taken to General Hospital, Sector 6, and later referred to the PGIMER.“The investigation is underway and we are yet to arrest the accused,” said a police official from Pinjore, adding that the victim is stable and undergoing treatment.A case has been registered at the Pinjore police station under section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959 and sections 34 (acts done by several people furthering common intention), 341 (wrongful restraint), 392 (robbery), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jeweller-shot-at-in-pinjore-by-bike-borne-snatchers-101639594177776.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Curbs imposed by agencies had little impact, say experts||Residents of the Capital breathed “very poor” air for the third straight day on Wednesday, even a month after the central air quality management panel imposed curbs on polluting activities across the National Capital Region (NCR), with experts blaming the coupled impact of inaction against active local pollutants and unfavourable weather conditions for the negligible effects of these restrictions on the city’s pollution indices.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) continued in the “very poor” zone on Wednesday, with a reading of 363 at 4pm, barely lower than 367 on Tuesday and worse than 331 on Monday, according to data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Over the last fortnight, Delhi has recorded one “severe”, nine “very poor” and five “poor” AQI days. The city recorded at least one “moderate” air day during the same period last year, as well as in 2019.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on November 16, after directions from the Supreme Court, put in place a slew of measures to check pollution levels, including a ban on construction across the NCR, stopping the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items into Delhi, as well as shutting schools and educational institutions.Experts, however, said that these measures have not had the desired impact due to a combination of “misdirected” orders and inconducive weather conditions.“After Diwali, Delhi has not received a proper western disturbance, which brings some rain and clears out accumulated pollutants. We received one spell of rain, but just 1mm, which was barely enough to clear the air. The accumulated pollutants since Diwali have also not been cleared off because of slower than usual winds. Winds from the northwest have seen several obstructions, which means that by the time they reached Delhi, they weakened and could not properly disperse pollution particles,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services.Palawat said that November and December usually see at least two to three western disturbances each. But this year, only one active western disturbance has hit the city over the two months so far. Maximum wind speeds have also only gone up to 15kmph in the period.Further, the delayed monsoon withdrawal this year also pushed back stubble burning season in Punjab and Haryana, which then peaked around Diwali (on November 4), creating a double whammy situation for the Capital. The remnants of pollution from this period are yet to disperse entirely, said experts.This, they said, can be seen in the severe concentration of aged organic carbon in Delhi’s air currently, according to the Union ministry of earth science’ air quality early warning system. Aged organic carbon (OC2) is an indicator of accumulated pollution in the air.The data showed that from November 3 to December 10, the OC2 levels were between 80µg/m3 and 150µg/m3, which indicates high accumulation.Experts meanwhile said that action against local air pollution sources needed to be amped up.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that several pollution analysis and weather forecasting systems in Delhi showed that vehicles were the biggest contributor to the city’s poor air.“We recently released an analysis studying the data from IITM’s (Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology) decision support system and found that after stubble burning season ended, vehicular emissions were the biggest contributor to Delhi’s pollution, and there has not been much focus on that. Yes, the truck entry has been banned, but after the construction of the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways, the share of non-destined trucks entering Delhi is anyway very low,” said Roychowdhury.She added, “We are yet to make any concrete call on increasing parking charges and improving our public transport systems to discourage the use of private vehicles, especially at a time we are witnessing an emergency situation.”CAQM spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.Other experts also agreed on the need for stronger moves against local pollution sources, while also working on the air shed as a whole.“Forecasts indicate that emissions from vehicles, road dust and biomass burning industries and regional emissions from nearby districts such as Sonipat and Jhajjhar (Haryana) are driving the pollution levels in the Capital. Therefore, actions must be taken to reduce emissions from year-round sources of pollution like transport, road and construction dust, and disposal of municipal waste. Further, restrictions on heavy vehicles entering the city should continue to be enforced,” said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)She added, “The Delhi government should also explore hiking the parking charge to limit the use of privately owned vehicles... Since a significant share of Delhi’s pollution burden can still be attributed to sources outside the city limits, it is important to ensure stringent enforcement and a close watch on its compliance of the CAQM directions in NCR districts as well.”
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Cabinet moves to curtail powers of governor in appointing V-C of universities||Mumbai: The state cabinet on Wednesday approved the appointment of higher and technical education minister to the newly-created position of pro-chancellor of universities and changed the procedure for the appointment of vice-chancellors. Put together, these decisions will curtail the powers of the governor, who is the chancellor of all varsities in the state, and mark another flashpoint in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) ties with state governor BS Koshyari.The state cabinet, which met under Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, cleared an amendment to the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, to create the position of the pro-chancellor. The rules for the appointment of vice-chancellors have also been changed. Earlier, a search committee appointed for the purpose would refer five names to the governor, who would shortlist one name. Now, this committee will suggest five names to the state government, which in turn, will send two names to the governor, further curtailing the governor’s powers.Similarly, the state will suggest three names to the governor for the appointment of a pro vice-chancellor. These decisions have been taken in line with the recommendations of the committee under Dr Sukhdeo Thorat, former chairman of the University Grants Commission. This was set up to suggest measures for the streamlined implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, and to raise the standard of education in the state.“The pro-chancellor will hold charge of the administration of the universities and will streamline their working,” a minister explained. The cabinet also decided to form an equal opportunities panel in universities to draft policies and ensure equal opportunities for underprivileged groups like those from the reserved categories, weaker sections, transgenders and others.While a Raj Bhavan spokesperson declined to comment, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar opposed the decision and called it an encroachment on the autonomy of universities. “We oppose this decision. It is an encroachment on the autonomy of universities. The original provisions were meant to keep them separate from the executive,” said Bhatkhalkar. The meeting also decided to rationalise and streamline the stamp duty that is charged on instruments like mortgage by deposit of title deeds, and simple mortgage. “Earlier, we had modified the stamp duty on some articles. The duty on transactions like hypothecation, pawn and pledge, were charged at 0.1 per cent for transactions up to 5 lakh and 0.3 per cent for documents above a value of 5 lakh. But, there were documents which involved similar transactions like mortgage by deposit of title deed, further charge, simple mortgage deeds and crop loans, but were charged at diferent rates. They will now be charged stamp duty at 0.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively,” said a state government official.The government has also capped the maximum ceiling of stamp duty to ₹20 lakh for individuals and ₹50 lakh in case of instruments related to mortgage executed to a consortium of banks. This is expected to boost the state government’s revenues by encouraging the banks to register these documents here instead of other states.Thackeray and Pawar also approved the appointment of three agencies, namely, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) and Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL) to conduct recruitments to various government agencies. This comes after the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) had to cancel its examination after a bid to leak the question paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cabinet-moves-to-curtail-powers-of-governor-in-appointing-v-c-of-universities-101639594058226.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||SC stands by Delhi government’s call to register only electric autos||Observing that the national capital is gasping for breath due to air pollution, the Supreme Court on Wednesday affirmed the Delhi government’s decision to give fresh registration only to e-autos as it dismissed a plea by Bajaj Auto complaining against the exclusion of CNG auto-rickshaws.“As it is, Delhi is gasping for breath, we don’t want to add another reason to it. How many contributors are already there? We can’t add one more on the asking of a manufacturer,” said a bench, headed by justice L Nageswara Rao.The bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna, rejected Bajaj’s application that challenged validity of an October 2021 advertisement by the transport department of the Delhi government, inviting online applications for registration of 4,261 new permits for e-autos.“Residents of Delhi are affected by air pollution. Undoubtedly, a part of this is attributed to vehicles. Even though CNG autos are BS-VI compliant, still there are some carbon releases,” noted the bench in its order, while adding that the Aam Aadmi Party government’s decision was also in compliance with the 2020 electric vehicle policy of the Union government.The court also junked Bajaj’s contention that the advertisement was arbitrary and discriminatory to manufacturers of existing CNG three-seater auto-rickshaws (TSR), besides restricting market opportunities to one class of vehicles over another, without rational basis or intelligible differentia.“We don’t agree with the applicant that the advertisement is in violation of their fundamental right, for there are 92,000 CNG autos on roads in Delhi. Replacement of those can be done by vehicle manufacturers,” said the court.It further clarified that exemption granted to e-autos and other battery-operated vehicles from registration under the amended Motor Vehicles Act and the rules framed thereunder cannot mean addition of e-autos can be done over and above the cap of 100,000, as fixed by the Supreme Court in its judgment in 2011.During the hearing, Baja Auto argued that the 2011 top court order did not intend to put a cap on number of TSRs running on clean fuel such as CNG or electricity. It added that the new TSRs are BS-VI compliant and has improved to 90% as compared to BS-I model.Opposing Bajaj’s plea, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said that CNG auto-rickshaws cannot be compared to e-autos, adding there is a proposal to switch to electric vehicles with a view to decarbonise the transport sector.“92,000 CNG auto-rickshaws have already been registered in Delhi and there is a continuous process of replacement of old CNG auto rickshaws,” Mehra said.Senior counsel ADN Rao, who assists the court as amicus curiae, also sought dismissal of Bajaj’s application, arguing that the amendment to the Motor Vehicle Act exempts registration of e-autos and talks only about payment of registration fees.The court took on record the submissions of the Delhi government and amicus, holding that the decision to register only e-autos “cannot be said to be arbitrary”. It also noted in its order that there have been requests to life the cap on CNG autos in Delhi but that issue will be decided in a separate proceeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scstands-by-delhi-government-s-call-to-register-only-electric-autos-101639593938036.html

In UT, there is no cluster or hot spot of infection as the transmission is being restricted to only close contacts. Usually, only the family members of one infected person are coming out to be positive,” said Dr Suman Singh, director health services, Chandigarh.Mini Covid care centre to reopenAs the daily infection count is rising in Chandigarh and neighbouring areas, the UT health department on Wednesday decided to restart the facility of Mini Covid Care Centre at Bal Bhawan, Sector 23.While directing the management body of the centre, UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “In last few days, the number of Covid cases are increasing and there are many cases where the required isolation facilities are not available within the respective homes of the persons. Hence, there is a need to start the centre again, especially for quarantine purposes. The authorities are requested to make necessary arrangements and ensure restarting the facility by December 20.”15 more test positive in tricityAs many as 15 fresh infections of Covid-19 were reported in the tricity on Wednesday, against 11 cases on Tuesday.

16-12-2021||Delhi||Uphaar tragedy: HC notice to police on Ansals’ plea against jail term||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the city police’s response on pleas by real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal seeking suspension of their seven-year jail terms awarded for evidence tampering in the Uphaar cinema fire tragedy case.Justice Subramonium Prasad issued notices to the parties, including the complainant, Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy, and also asked the jail superintendent to produce the medical records of the convicts on the next date.The Ansals had moved the high court challenging a December 3 trial court order refusing to suspend the conviction and jail term awarded to them in the evidence tampering case.The case is related to tampering with the evidence in the main fire tragedy case in which the Ansals were convicted and sentenced to a two-year jail term by the Supreme Court.Fifty-nine people lost their lives and several others were injured in the fire at the Uphaar cinema.During the trial in the main case, the Ansals, along with five others including a then court staff, had torn and defaced crucial documents of the prosecution evidence, to secure their acquittal.On October 8, the court convicted the Ansal brothers and three others for abetment of offence, causing disappearance of evidence, criminal breach of trust by a public servant and criminal conspiracy.On November 8, the magistrate court had handed over seven-year imprisonment to all the five convicts while imposing a fine of ₹2.25 crore each on the Ansal brothers.On Wednesday, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the seven-year term exceeded the maximum punishment that can be granted in the case. He submitted that the sentencing was on a “wrong legal premise”.He emphasised that even in the main case, the petitioners were convicted and sentenced to two-year jail term by the Supreme Court which subsequently released them on payment of ₹30 crore fine each, after taking into account the prison time already undergone.The matter will be heard on January 6.While dismissing Ansals’ plea for suspension of sentence till the appeal against the conviction by magisterial court is decided, the sessions’ court had said that the case was one of the gravest of its kind and the offence appeared to be the outcome of a calculated design on the part of the convicts to interfere with the course of justice.The sessions court had also refused to suspend the seven-year jail term each to former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma and two others -- P P Batra and Anoop Singh -- in the case and release them on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uphaar-tragedy-hc-notice-to-police-on-ansals-plea-against-jail-term-101639593758023.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||Nearly 10 million adults in Delhi fully vaccinated against Covid-19||Nearly 10 million residents of the national capital have been completely inoculated against Covid-19, showed government data, and the city is likely to cross that figure on Thursday, exactly 11 months after the nationwide coronavirus disease vaccination programme kicked off.According to data from the CoWin dashboard, as of 11pm on Wednesday, 9.94 million people in Delhi had received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine, roughly half of the city’s 20 million population, and just about 2/3rds of the city’s 15 million adults (according to January 2021 electoral data) eligible for shots. At the time of going to press on Wednesday, the city was just over 53,000 doses away from completely vaccinating 10 million adults.The landmark is especially significant in the wake of the Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which has sparked global fears of a resurgence of the pandemic, even as experts have reiterated that vaccines, masks and distancing are still the best protection against the infection. So far, 56 people across the country have been sequenced with the Omicron variant, of whom six are in Delhi. Experts, meanwhile, asked for a decision on booster doses of vaccines while the Covid-19 caseload stayed low.So far, around 14.5 million people in Delhi have got at least one shot of a vaccine, showed CoWin data, which means the city is days away from inoculating every adult with at least one dose.As of 11pm on Wednesday, the city administered 106,681 vaccine doses, showed the dashboard. The split between first and second doses was not immediately available. Delhi has over the past week administered an average of 109,362 vaccine doses per day. Between December 1 and 14, just over 72,000 people on an average got their second shot in Delhi, which means the Capital is set to cross the 10-million complete inoculations mark on Thursday.Daily vaccinations in the Capital have picked up in the past few weeks, especially since news of the Omicron variant of Sars-CoV-2 emerged globally on November 25.In the seven days that ended November 25, Delhi administered an average of 87,309 vaccines every day, according to the CoWin dashboard. A week later, on December 2, this number had shot up to 100,476 jabs a day. On December 9, it went up further to 128,120 doses a day. In the six days since then, this number fell marginally to 107,190, but is well above the rate the city logged three weeks ago.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “The Delhi government would like to congratulate all the doctors, nurses and health care professionals who have taken the baton of our vaccination program forward efficiently.”“The government is reaching out to each and every eligible resident and motivating them to come forward to get their doses as soon as they’re due and will continue to show the same resolve in protecting all the people of Delhi from Covid-19,” the statement added.The vaccinations are also another milestone for a city that has endured four separate Covid-19 surges since the virus first set foot in March last year, and so far lost 25,100 people to the infection, according to state government data. The most brutal of these waves was the fourth, between April and May this year, which left health infrastructure overrun, medical workers overwhelmed, and led to crematoriums running out of space. Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, while over 13,000 died of the infection in those two months alone. Cases in the city began to peter out towards the middle of May on the back of a lockdown, which the state government imposed from April 19.The Covid-19 caseload has remained at record lows since the fourth wave ebbed, and both the fresh infection count and test positivity rate have been well within control for much of this time, which experts have previously said is likely due to the steady rate of vaccinations and the sheer scale of the fourth wave, which would have left a vast majority of the city’s population infected.Delhi’s sixth serological survey, a preliminary report of which was released in mid-November, showed that 97% of the city’s population had antibodies that react with the Sars-Cov-2 virus.“We don’t know how the virus is going to behave in future. Therefore, we need to remain preparers and the preparations should start now when the numbers are low,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of respiratory medicine department, Fortis Healthcare.“Now is the time to take a decision on booster dose, especially for the high risk persons, and also begin vaccinating children. Children may not run the risk of developing severe disease but there is always a risk of them transmitting to others who may get severe symptoms,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nearly-two-thirds-of-delhi-s-adult-population-fully-vaccinated-against-covid19-101639593637722.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||Sisodia launches theme song of Ambedkar play by Indian Ocean||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday launched the theme song of the play based on the life of BR Ambedkar which will be organised at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium from January 5.“This musical play is being organised by the Kejriwal government in the 75th year of Independence so that the country can express its gratitude towards Babasaheb and his contribution in laying the foundation stone of modern India. The theme song, titled Bhimachi Jai, of the play has been composed by the famous music band Indian Ocean,” said Sisodia, while launching the song at the School of Specialised Excellence at Kalkaji with a performance by the band.The five-and-a-half-minute-long song exhorts Ambedkar’s contribution to the country: “Jab tak Jan Gan Man ka maan rahega, jab tak ye samvidhan rahega, Jab tak hindustan rahega…Babasaheb ka naam rahega”. The grand play based on the Ambedkar’s life will have 50 shows at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium. “Eminent people are involved in the direction, art and creation of this play. A 100-foot stage has been built in the stadium. Anyone can come to watch it and it will be absolutely free for the public. Its production is of international standards -- perhaps a first in India,” Sisodia said. The announcement about the mega play was first made by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-launches-theme-song-of-ambedkar-play-by-indian-ocean-101639593519498.html
16-12-2021||Lucknow||Commuters in a jam as traffic crawls in Lucknow||Lucknow: Commuters had a tough time on Wednesday, with severe traffic jams reported in most parts of the city. Traffic on Shaheed Path remained stuck for hours in the evening. People caught in the traffic snarls took to social media to raise complaints with the traffic police and Dial 112 to report about the situation, besides calling the authorities for help. “I was returning home from my office in Chinhat via Shaheed Path. It usually takes me 30 minutes to reach home but today it took me almost three hours to cover the same distance,” said Mahesh Pandey, who lives in Sushant Golf City. With vehicles stuck on Shaheed Path, traffic began piling on the service lanes and exits. The exits near Indira Gandhi Pratishthan, Arjunganj, Rae Bareli Rad and Awadh crossing remained jammed for hours with vehicles moving at a snail’s pace. People on their ways to the airport, hospital and railway station had a really hard time. Reportedly, many missed their evening flights out of Lucknow as they were caught in the traffic jams. The situation worsened between 5pm to 7pm when people returning from their offices further increased the volume of vehicles. Senior traffic and police officials were deployed across the city to clear the traffic. Additional director general (ADG), Law and order of UP Police Prashant Kumar also reached Arjunganj exit on Shaheed path to assist the traffic department. Senior traffic officials of Lucknow Police Commissionerate could not be reached for comment on the traffic situation. Many senior officials even switched off their phones and were unreachable. According to traffic police, the traffic congestion on Shaheed Path was caused after two trucks broke down and blocked traffic. A political event in Indira Gandhi Pratishthan and mismanagement of flow of vehicle exiting from the venue also contributed to the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/commuters-in-a-jam-as-traffic-crawls-in-lucknow-101639593517817.html
16-12-2021||Other||Grap violation: Gurugram civic body collected only 38% of total fine amount||In the two months since the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) was implemented in the city, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has issued penalties worth ₹29.15 lakh for Grap violations but managed to recover just ₹10.91 lakh, or around 38% of the total fine amount, shows the data obtained from the civic body. Between October 15 and December 14, the MCG issued 281 fines for Grap violations of which penalties have been recovered from only 106 violators, the data reveals.The MCG officials admitted that low recoveries are a cause of concern and they are working on ways to tackle the issue.“We have taken cognisance of low recovery of Grap challans. We are planning on either attaching the requisite fine to the property tax dues of the violator (building owner) or adding a clause that non-payment will lead to action against the violator by the Haryana environment court in Faridabad,” said Subhash Yadav, nodal officer of environment wing in MCG and the district forest officer.As per the MCG data, the worst recovery in fines is for violations related to construction ban and construction and demolition (C&D) waste left in the open. During the last two months, the MCG issued 144 fines for C&D waste violation, of which penalties from 60 violators has so far been recovered. Recovery for construction violations is even worse with the MCG only recovering penalties from four of the 20 violators, a mere 20%.After C&D waste violations, the highest number of fines were issued for uncovered vehicles which resulted in 52 people being penalised, shows the data.“The main reason behind the low recovery in Grap fines is that it does not allow on-the-spot payment. After issuing a fine, a violator has to make the payment either online or visit the MCG office to do so. Unless they are working or living nearby, most violators do not make the payment and as a result recoveries tend to remain low,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.On November 23, deputy commissioner Yash Garg had pulled up several public bodies, including the MCG, for lack of anti-pollution activities and directed them to increase its enforcement against Grap violations as well as initiate measures to check localised air pollution.The MCG has increased its water sprinkling activities by deploying 30 tractors and eight fire tenders for the task, each responsible for dispersing over 16,000 litres of treated water across 14km of roads in the city during an eight-hour window. The civic body is also using 13 mechanised sweeping machines to check dust pollution, the officials said.Experts said that without proper enforcement, including recoveries, efforts to check air pollution will be futile. “It has been almost a month since stubble burning season ended. However, pollution levels are still very poor across NCR. The prime reason for this is lack of enforcement on localised measures during the night. Pollution data shows a stark contrast between night and day figures,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert.Panwar said that the contrast in day and night time air quality index (AQI) levels indicated that Grap violations during the night are largely going unchecked. “Usually, there is no adverse change in weather pattern between night and day. The higher levels of AQI during the night indicate that localised air pollution violations as a major factor for the deteriorating air. Until night surveillance is done properly and fines are also recovered, violations will continue to go unchecked,” said Panwar.Grap was approved by the Supreme Court in 2016 and was first implemented in 2017 to check high levels of air pollution across the National Capital Region. Each year it is introduced from October 15 onwards.

Depending on the requirements, the fellows will be distributed across the forest and wildlife department and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) too,” said the official, on condition of anonymity.Officials said the fellows, a mix of professionals and young students, will free up a number of its technically qualified personnel who are currently forced to perform clerical office tasks due to shortage of staff.Reena Gupta, advisor to the Delhi government, told HT that the plan was to use these fellows under Delhi government’s flagship programmes. “We will utilise them for both field activities and in office, largely assigning them roles in some flagship programmes..., which includes the citizen engagement cell that will soon be made operational in the DPCC. There is also a plan to involve them in a tree census for Delhi,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-induct-fellows-to-help-forest-dept-officials-101639593278157.html
16-12-2021||Mumbai||Lukewarm attendance as schools reopen||Mumbai: Offline school for Classes 1 to 7 started to a lukewarm response on Wednesday as state board and civic schools opened their gates to students for the first time in nearly 20 months. A majority of schools started physical and hybrid classes for students from Classes 4 to 7 on the first day and are hoping to bring back younger students over the next few days, said school authorities. As per information shared by the BMC education department, 92.28% schools reopened for Classes 1 to 7 on Wednesday. Of the 6.53 lakh students attending Classes 1 to 7 across 2,300 schools, only 1.8 lakh students (27.5%) attended physical classes on the first day of school, despite parents of 2.35 lakh students giving consent forms. “There was a stark difference between the response by parents on the declaration form provided prior to reopening and the number of students that eventually turned up on Wednesday,” said the principal of a state board school in Mazgaon. In the last week of November, the state cabinet decided to reopen schools in the physical mode for Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and Classes 1 to 7 in urban areas starting December 1 while the older classes have already been following the hybrid model since October 4. This move was delayed by two weeks by BMC taking into account rising Omicron cases in the state. On December 14, the BMC released another notification clarifying that all schools will reopen for classes 1 to 7 starting December 15. Most schools started the week with necessary precautions including thorough sanitisation of classrooms and common areas. Stickers and posters were put up across the campus to reiterate social distancing norms and compulsion on wearing masks. Benches in classrooms were marked to ensure students sit at a distance from each other and temperature of staff and students were checked at the entry. Most ICSE and CBSE schools remained shut for Classes 1 to 7 on Wednesday as many are end of semester exams are on. Some state board schools were surprised with the student turnout on first day. “We started classes for students from Class 3 and 4 on Wednesday and plan to start classes for Class 1,2 and 5 to 7 from Thursday. The response has been very positive and nearly 45% students attended physical classes on day one. We ran the school in batches in order to accommodate all and ensure social distancing,” said Fr Norbert D’souza, principal (secondary section) Holy Cross High School, Kurla. Civic schools in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai witnessed the highest attendance among schools as nearly 75-80% students showed up for school on Wednesday. “As per the state guideline, schools were sanitized and we ensured that all teachers are tested and vaccinated. Students were allowed to enter classrooms only after their oxygen levels and temperatures were checked,” said Bhausaheb Dangde, Chief Executive Officer, Thane Zilla Parishad. The School Bus Owners Association (SBOA) revealed that none of the buses under the group ferried students on Wednesday. “Only schools with their own fleet of buses functioned. We are facing staff crunch as more than 1600 bus drivers have opted for higher paying jobs while the lady attendants too have found alternative jobs. We cannot start plying buses until the government allows us some tax rebate,” said Anil Garg, president of the association. Parents demand reopening of schools for non-state board students Meanwhile, associations of parents from ICSE, CBSE and other international schools in the city have started online petitions and have also approached BMC authorities demanding that physical classes reopen for all children. “State government rules should be applicable to every school. While state board schools have already started physical classes, why are ICSE and CBSE schools let off the hook? Our children are waiting to get back to school,” said Gayatri Sabhrawal, parent and member of Parents Association of Mumbai. Voices: Riddhi Salve, mother of a Class 6 student of Mumbai Public School, Dadar Nearly 80% parents are willing to send their kids for offline lectures as the school is taking care of safety of all students. Shiv Sawant, father of Class 3 student of Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar The school has not yet reopened for the smaller classes, hence my son could not attend school on Wednesday. We are keen on sending him to school Kalpana Dwivedi, principal, Balbharti Public School, KhargharOur initial plan was to reopen schools for younger students from December 1 itself but barely 20% parents had submitted consent forms. Now we are waiting for parents to submit their consent forms again and only then we shall reopen school for lower batches||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lukewarm-attendance-as-schools-reopen-101639593221487.html
16-12-2021||Lucknow||Yogi govt to UPPCL: Provide 24x7 power to all till March||Lucknow: The Yogi Adityanath government has directed the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) to provide 24X7 electricity to consumers of all categories in cities and villages from mid-December till March, apparently with an eye on the assembly elections that are only less than two months away, people in the know of things revealed. According to them, to make sure that the corporation has adequate cash flow to purchase additional power from producers, the government is going to make an allocation of more than ₹1600 crore in the supplementary budget as additional government subsidy apart from providing it ₹5,000 crore immediately. The supplementary budget proposals will be tabled in the state assembly on Thursday. According to the budget proposal accessed by HT, the energy department has proposed a financial assistance of ₹5,000 crore for the UPPCL immediately to execute the government’s directions for supply of uninterrupted electricity in the state from December 15, besides making a budgetary allocation of ₹1600 crore as additional government subsidy. “The UPPCL needs this much amount so that it may ensure uninterrupted power supply as directed by the government by clearing pending dues to power generating companies,” an energy department official said. The energy department has pointed out that the corporation’s revenue collection had been adversely affected since the second wave of the Covid-19 even as the power purchase cost was growing. “It is necessary to provide ₹1600 crore to the UPPCL in the form of supplementary budget or as the state grant for the current financial year in addition to the regular government subsidy,” says the proposal. Currently, UPPCL provides 24-hour power only to big cities while district headquarters and villages get electricity for 22 and 18 hours respectively. OTS extended Meanwhile, the UPPCL on Wednesday announced more extension of the one-time settlement scheme for defaulters till December 31, according to a spokesman. “The extended OTS that was to be over on December 15 has been extended till December 31 on the chief minister’s directives,” he said. 
16-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police move 280 beggars from CP to shelters||At least 280 people who were found begging in Connaught Place were shifted to different shelter homes in the past one month as part of the Delhi Police’s drive to make the popular market free of beggars, officials associated with the drive said on Tuesday.The market association and the Delhi Police said Connaught Place will become Delhi’s first market to be “beggar-free.”Records of the 280 men and women, who were picked up and shifted to shelter homes run by city NGOs, showed that almost 90% of beggars detained from CP lived outside the Hanuman Temple. Of them, there were at least seven families, who had been living on the road outside the temple for the last 15 years.Their children either begged or worked as street vendors in the outer circle of CP, according to their claims when they were interviewed by NGOs.Police officers aware of the action over the last one month said their investigation also led to the arrest of 10 drug traffickers, who were selling drugs such as heroin and marijuana to the homeless and some beggars in Connaught Place. All 10 have been booked under different provisions of the NDPS Act.“We found out that many beggars, who were living near Hanuman Temple had come from places as far as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and parts of south India. They were also drug users, who were exploited by the drug mafia. Some of them were forced to sell drugs distributed by the traffickers,” said a police officer, aware of the details.Rajesh Kumar, executive director of the Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses(SPYM), one of the NGOs rehabilitating the beggars and vagabonds, said that they have shifted around 300 beggars.“CP is the first market to be free of vagabonds and beggars. The Delhi government too helped us by providing shelter and food to these persons. During our one-to-one interaction with them, we also learnt that many children were told to beg by their parents. We have counselled both the children and their parents. The process of rehabilitating them will take around six months to a year. The work has started,” Kumar said.Kumar said that there were many persons, who were addicted to drugs. “They have been referred to the drug de-addiction centres. For the first time, we have seen that the homeless have not returned to the roads in CP.”The drive has also resulted in the decline of complaints by shoppers. Police records show that in the last 15 days (December 1 – December 15), there has not been a single distress call complaining about vagabonds or drug addicts snatching their cell phones or bags. In November, the police received there were six such snatching calls . There were 15 calls in October, 7 in September.“Until the clean-up drive happened, we would get calls related to shoppers being harassed by some vagabonds in the subways of Connaught Place. For the last 15 days, the number of such calls have also stopped,” a police officer, aware of the development said.Atul Bhargava, president of the National Delhi Traders Association, said that the market associations are holding regular meetings with police “to bring back the glory of CP”. “Among the many people living in the CP streets, there was an English speaking homeless elderly man too. I always saw him at A block. He too has been rehabilitated by an NGO roped in by the police. If there are no encroachments by vagabonds and beggars, we will successfully restore the glory of CP,” Bhargava said.
16-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi: North MCD seals 8 liquor vends, issues show cause notices to 10 others||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has shut five liquor vends and passed sealing orders for three others for alleged violations related to building by-laws and carrying unauthorised construction, civic officials said on Wednesday. A report on the action against liquor shops by North MCD revealed that showcause notices were also issued to 10 other liquor shops.Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said three liquor shops were sealed in Civil Lines and one each in Karol Bagh and Rohini. “Most of these units had illegal construction and unapproved amalgamation of properties. The provisions of unified building by-laws (UBBL) were not followed which has led to sealing action against them. The drive to check the building norms and property or conversion charges in the new liquor outlets...will continue in the coming days,” Jain said.Chhail Bihari Goswami, the leader of the house in North MCD, said the civic body will continue the crackdown: “Shops are being opened under new excise policy with no official intimation or NOC requirements being communicated to the local bodies. We have all the right to check violations in these shops.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.East MCD sealed three liquor outlets last Friday.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta on Wednesday said that the party will hold protests across the city on January 3 if the new excise policy is not withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhinorth-mcd-seals-8-liquor-vends-issues-show-cause-notices-to-10-others-101639592857691.html
16-12-2021||Delhi||Delhi airport: Phase 1 of smart project to revamp parking stands finishes||The smart apron project at Delhi airport’s Terminal-1 (T1), which proposes to revamp the existing 55 parking stands to accommodate a maximum of 82 aircraft, has completed phase one with 19 new stands made operational after statutory approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), said the airport operator Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) on Wednesday.The apron of an airport is the area where an aircraft is parked for boarding passengers or loading goods.While T-1 had 55 parking stands for aircrafts prior to the expansion work under Phase3A of the master plan, the new smart apron will revamp some of the existing structures to make space for 82 slots, including 22 ‘contact’ stands and eight Multiple Apron Ramp System (MARS), which can accommodate much larger aircraft. DIAL said the smart apron was being built in three phases, with 19 stands completed in the first phase.The airport operator also said that once complete, the smart apron will considerably reduce air traffic congestion as the new design will improve air traffic flow.“The new layout will facilitate improved air traffic flow and enhance airside safety. The creation of new contact stands will also lead to reduction in the number of Ground Support Equipment (GSE) required. This will ensure faster aircraft turnaround time and improve safety in the apron area, resulting in improved operational efficiency on the airside,” said a DIAL spokesperson.Under Phase3A of Delhi airport’s expansion plan, T1’s capacity is being doubled from 20 million passengers per annum to 40 million passengers per annum, with both departures and arrivals being brought under one roof. The airport expansion also includes creation of a new runway and elevated cross taxiways for better movement of aircraft. The initial deadline to complete the T1 expansion is towards the end of 2022.The airport operator estimates that with the new smart apron, there will be an estimated reduction in 70kg of CO2 emissions per flight and once the 22 ‘contact’ stands are made operational, a further reduction of 255kg of CO2 emissions per aircraft during the turnaround process for domestic airlines.“The completion of the first phase of works for the expansion of T1’s new smart apron is another step towards enhancing the infrastructure and passenger experience at the Delhi airport to make it future-ready. The new smart apron will not only facilitate improved passenger experience by improving operational efficiency and safety on the airside, but also contribute towards significantly reducing harmful CO2 emissions, underlining DIAL’s commitment to environment-friendly outcomes and initiatives,” said I Prabhakara Rao, Deputy Managing Director, GMR Group.After being shut for over 18 months due to the Covid-induced lockdown, airport operations resumed at T-1 from October 31 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-phase-1-of-smart-project-to-revamp-parking-stands-finishes-101639592379874.html

Actors Kareena Kapoor-Khan and Amrita Arora, and actor Sohail Khan’s wife Seema Khan had tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. Kapoor-Khan’s help tested positive on Wednesday. The buildings in which they reside were sealed on Tuesday. The fourth sealed building is where producer Karan Johar lives. The three persons found positive had attended a dinner event organised by Johar on December 8. “We have unsealed the buildings today,” BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said on Wednesday. He added that of the 145 high-risk contacts in these buildings, 108 tested negative. “The spread is not much. Hence, we unsealed the buildings. However, the respective floors of positive patients remain sealed,” he said. The reports of the remaining 37 contacts are awaited. Meanwhile, in Juhu, Maheep Kapoor, wife of actor Sanjay Kapoor, and her daughter Shanaya tested positive on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Maheep, too, had attended Johar’s dinner event. Shanaya posted on Instagram on Wednesday that though she had tested negative four days ago, she tested again as precaution and was found positive. “I have tested positive for Covid-19,” Shanaya said in her post. “As of today, I have mild symptoms, but I am feeling okay and I have isolated myself. I had tested negative four days ago, however, while testing again as a precaution the results came positive.” Dr Ajit Pampatwar, medical officer of health (MOH) from BMC’s K-West ward, said, “We have sealed only one floor in the building where the patients stay,” Dr Pampatwar said. Kapoor-Khan’s sister, actor Karisma Kapoor, was also tested as part of BMC’s contact-tracing protocol. Her report was negative. Johar and his family, too, tested negative. The reports of the remaining 37 contacts are awaited. BMC said it is trying to contact designer Manish Malhotra, who was also at Johar’s house on December 8. “My family and I and everyone at home have done their RT-PCR tests and with the grace of god we are all negative,” Johar posted on Instagram on Wednesday. “I would like to clarify that a (sic) 8 people intimate gathering is not a party… and my home which we maintain strict protocols in, is certainly no hotspot of Covid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-unseals-bollywood-star-buildings-101639587037175.html

Officials said 146 people infected with the coronavirus died between Wednesday and Thursday.UK officials have said the omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading at an “absolutely phenomenal pace,” with case numbers doubling every two to three days.The UK Health Security Agency said another 1,691 omicron cases have been identified in the country, bringing the total to 11,708, though scientists warn the number is likely to be much higher.England’s chief medical officer says it’s possible that daily hospital admissions from Covid-19 this winter will surpass the previous peak numbers, though he cautioned that “huge uncertainties” remain about the omicron variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-fresh-daily-record-of-covid-19-cases-after-88-376-infections-101639673279125.html
16-12-2021||World||India, Taiwan start talks on free trade agreement||India and Taiwan have begun talks on a free trade pact and creating a semiconductor manufacturing hub in the country as part of efforts to meet the burgeoning demand for the chips needed for products ranging from cellphones to cars.The two sides set up four groups earlier this year that are focusing on creating a semiconductor manufacturing hub, education and training of highly specialised manpower needed for the industry, a bilateral investment agreement and a free trade agreement, two people familiar with the matter said.The contacts on these issues gathered momentum around the middle of this year and the group on semiconductors met twice virtually, in August and September, while there was one round of talks on the proposed trade pact, the people cited above said.Both sides are eyeing the possibility of one of Taiwan’s semiconductor giants, a list that includes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), setting up a facility in India. The Indian side has proposed several sites for the facility though the two sides are yet to come to a final decision, the people said.“It is a very complicated process because a company like TSMC uses components from hundreds of other firms. Setting up a hub in India means convincing those firms to also set up a facility in India to ensure the supply of components,” one of the people cited above said.If the proposal is finalised, it will be only the second such manufacturing hub set up in a foreign country by a Taiwanese manufacturer. TSMC, which has a market value of more than $550 billion and accounts for about 54% of global revenues from semiconductors, has set up a $12-billion fabrication plant in the US that is expected to start production in 2024. TSMC is also eyeing possible facilities in Japan and Europe.For Taiwan, such investments are linked to strategic gains at a time when China has increased its pressure on the island, stepping up incursions into its air defence zone and taking tensions in the Taiwan Strait to a new high amid threatening talk of an invasion. The Taiwanese decision to create the semiconductor manufacturing hub in the US was seen as closely linked to military support extended by Washington to Taipei.Taiwan is also hoping such moves will translate into greater support for its efforts in other areas, such as a presence at the World Health Organization (WHO). As part of overall efforts to increase trade and investment, Taiwan is also eyeing the possibility of opening a representative office in Mumbai because of the potential for investments and manufacturing in Maharashtra and Gujarat.India and Taiwan established representative offices in each other’s capitals in 1995. A second Taipei Economic and Cultural Center was established in Chennai in 2012.As with most contacts with Taiwan, the Indian side has been proceeding cautiously, largely because of the tensions with China over the military standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).However, India’s rapidly growing need for semiconductors - expected to be around $100 billion by 2025, up from the current level of $2 billion - is the main reason for the government’s push in the field. On Wednesday, the Union cabinet approved a production-linked incentive scheme with an outlay of ₹76,000 crore ($10 billion) for development of a semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem.The government has also committed support of ₹2,30,000 crore ($30 billion) to position India as a global hub for electronics manufacturing, with semiconductors as the foundational block.Sana Hashmi, Taiwan fellow at the Institute of International Relations at the National Chengchi University in Taipei, said advancing economic ties falls in the framework of the unofficial relations between India and Taiwan.“One of the primary objectives of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Delhi and the India-Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei is to work towards strengthening commercial ties,” she said.Hashmi said though China objects to all contacts with Taiwan, there has been an understanding that cooperation on economic and cultural issues and science and technology doesn’t violate adherence to the “One China” policy by other nations.“Seemingly, it was fine for other countries as long as China was reaping the benefits of Taiwanese investments. Now with the growing cross-Strait tensions, Taiwan’s focus has been on pulling out investments from China and reducing its dependence. Cooperation in the semiconductor industry is one of India’s main interests vis-a-vis Taiwan,” she said.“Several agreements are already in place between India and Taiwan. So, another agreement in the economic field doesn’t violate the ‘One China’ policy,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-taiwan-start-talks-on-free-trade-agreement-101639673988033.html
16-12-2021||World||EU medicines agency recommends Xevudy, Kineret for Covid treatment||The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Thursday recommended the use of Kineret and Xevudy for the treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).EMA’s human medicines committee recommended the use of Kineret in adult Covid-19 patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure.Kineret, an immunosuppressive medicine, reduces the activity of the immune system and is currently used by the EU member countries for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions.“In Covid-19 patients, the medicine is considered to reduce the inflammation associated with Covid-19 and thus decrease lower airway damage, preventing development of severe respiratory failure,” the medicines agency said in a statement.The committee recommended authorising Kineret after evaluating data from a study that involved 606 hospitalised adults with moderate or severe Covid. In addition to 'standard of care', these patients were administered Kineret or placebo by injection under the skin. Standard of care includes the use of low or high flow oxygen and the corticosteroid medicine dexamethasone, with some also receiving remdesivir.EMA said the study showed greater clinical symptom improvements in patients treated with Kineret plus standard of care compared with those who received placebo plus standard of care.The committee also recommended the approval of Xevudy for treating the disease in adults and adolescents who do not require supplemental oxygen but are at increased risk of the disease becoming severe. Xevudy is the third monoclonal antibody to be recommended for Covid treatment in the EU.The committee evaluated data from a study involving 1,057 Covid-19 patients with at least one underlying condition, putting them at increased risk of severe Covid. The study showed that Xevudy significantly reduced hospitalisation and deaths, with 1% of patients being hospitalised for longer than 24 hours within 29 days of treatment with the monoclonal antibody, compared with 6% of patients on placebo.EMA said the majority of patients involved in the study were infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-medicines-agency-recommends-xevudy-kineret-for-covid-treatment-101639663588465.html
16-12-2021||World||China dismisses concerns over safety of Lithuanian diplomats||The Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday dismissed concerns over the safety of Lithuanian diplomats stationed in Beijing, a day after the Baltic country’s diplomatic corps and dependents left China over “uncertainty” of their situation.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said claims that Lithuanian diplomats faced safety issues were “purely fictitious”.Wang also denied that the Chinese government had forbidden the Chinese staff at the Lithuanian representative office from working.Lithuanian authorities said on Wednesday they had summoned their top diplomat back from China for “consultations” and that the embassy would operate remotely for the time being.A statement on the website of the Lithuanian foreign ministry, the country’s charge d’affaires ad interim in China, Audra Ciapiene, returns to Vilnius for consultations.”In all, 19 people, including diplomats and dependents, left Beijing on Wednesday.A diplomatic source told Reuters that they left due to “safety considerations” in response to “intimidation”.Foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis confirmed the diplomats’ departure in a press briefing in Vilnius.He responded to a question about the reports of Lithuanian diplomats facing pressure in China, saying, “Uncertainty creates various possible interpretations.”“The Lithuanian side also never raised the issue of personal safety to China,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.“If the Lithuanian side does not face reality, if it does not reflect and correct mistakes but instead shirks its own responsibility, then it will only challenge bilateral relations even more,” Wang added.The ultimate damage will be to Lithuania itself, Wang said.In November, China downgraded its diplomatic ties with Lithuania, expressing strong dissatisfaction after Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region, opened a de facto embassy in capital Vilnius.China views Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as its territory and opposes Taiwan having diplomatic ties with a third country.Earlier in November, Lithuania brushed aside China’s protests, to allow Taipei to set up a Taiwanese representative office in Lithuania in Vilnius, a first in the European Union.In the Lithuanian ministry’s statement, Vilnius said the representative office in Beijing would operate remotely for the time being and consular services for Lithuanian citizens in China would continue but in a limited capacity.“Lithuania is ready to continue the dialogue with China and restore the functions of the embassy to their full extent once a mutually beneficial agreement has been reached,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-concerns-over-safety-of-lithuanian-diplomats-101639655386359.html

16-12-2021||World||Taiwan President Tsai calls for greater unity against rising authoritarianism||Addressing a group of visiting French lawmakers, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen called Wednesday for greater unity among democratic nations in the face of rising authoritarianism.Tsai also said the self-governing island republic would take on greater responsibilities to contribute to regional and global peace and stability.“Democratic allies should strengthen cooperation when facing challenges such as swift changes in international affairs and expansion of authoritarianism," Tsai said during the meeting at the Presidential Office Building.“Taiwan will take on its responsibilities in the international society and expects to contribute more to the Indo-Pacific region’s peace and stability, as well as the world’s prosperity and development, along with France and other like-minded partners in the European Union,” she said.The visit by the six members of the French National Assembly offers a valuable opportunity for Tsai to address an international political audience in the face of China’s efforts to isolate the island it claims as its own territory with no right to diplomatic recognition.Chinese pressure has reduced the number of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies to just 14.Francois de Rugy, who heads the France-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, said the French government had been positive about moves to strengthen ties between the sides.He presented Tsai with a copy of a resolution overwhelmingly adopted last month by the Assembly supporting Taiwan's participation in international bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the World Health Assembly.The National Assembly aims to “encourage a constructive regional dialogue in order to ensure peace and dialogue over the Taiwan Strait,” de Rugy told Tsai.The French delegation is the second to visit Taiwan in recent months, following one led by Sen. Alain Richard in October, during which they met with Tsai, Taiwanese economic and health officials and the Mainland Affairs Council overseeing exchanges with China that have been all but suspended by Beijing.China sought to have that visit called off, despite it being part of regular parliamentary exchanges that had been ongoing for years.Despite Chinese pressure, Taiwan has been stepping up exchanges with countries that don’t officially recognize it as a country, often bringing a furious response from Beijing.Beijing punished Lithuania, which like France is a member of the European Union, after it agreed to allow Taiwan to set up a representative office in the capital Vilnius under the name “Taiwan” rather than “Chinese Taipei,” as Beijing prefers.Beijing slapped a trade embargo on the Baltic state and has threatened multinationals that do business with it. It also withdrew its ambassador to Vilnius and expelled the Lithuanian ambassador to Beijing.On Wednesday, Lithuania’s Foreign Ministry said it had closed its embassy in Beijing and pulled its last diplomat out of the Chinese capital. Lithuania was “ready to continue the dialogue with China and restore the functions of the embassy to their full extent once a mutually beneficial agreement is reached,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-president-tsai-calls-for-greater-unity-against-rising-authoritarianism-101639634178617.html

16-12-2021||World||Kim Jong Un's policy of a complete but isolated 10-yr-rule in North Korea||Since assuming power 10 years ago, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ruled the isolated country with absolute power, significantly expanded its nuclear arsenal and become the North’s first ruler to hold a summit with a sitting US president.But now, he’s hunkering down and struggling to revive a dilapidated economy battered hard by pandemic-related border shutdowns, toughened UN sanctions and mismanagement.When he inherited power upon the death of his father and longtime ruler Kim Jong Il, there were questions about the future of North Korea. Little was known about the then-27-year-old son who was taking his family’s dynastic rule into a third generation. But Kim Jong Un quickly consolidated his power by orchestrating a spate of brutal purges and executions that removed his potential rivals including his own powerful uncle.With a firm grip on power, Kim has carried on his family’s nuclear ambitions and diverted much of his country’s scarce resources toward programs to build nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the US mainland. His provocative run of nuclear and missile tests in 2016-17 placed North Korea a step closer to its goal of possessing such functioning intercontinental ballistic missiles, but they also led North Korea to face stricter UN sanctions and deepened international isolation.Entering 2018, Kim abruptly took conciliatory gestures by sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics held in rival South Korea and telling visiting South Korean envoys that he was willing to place his nuclear program on the negotiating table. Some critics accused Kim of just trying to weaken the sanctions, buy time and perfect his weapons program, but then- US President Donald Trump accepted Kim’s offers for unprecedented summit talks between the leaders of the two countries.In 2018-19, Kim met Trump three times and held summits with other world leaders including South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. These meetings gave Kim the diplomatic legitimacy that his government had long desired.The high-stakes nuclear diplomacy triggered a rare mood of rapprochement on the Korean Peninsula, such as athletes from the rival Koreas marching together during the Olympics’ opening ceremony and their singers performing in each other’s territory. North Korea also demolished its nuclear test site and released American detainees, while the US and South Korean militaries suspended or canceled some of their regular drills.But such moves were short-lived, as the Kim-Trump diplomacy eventually collapsed in 2019 due to wrangling over the sanctions.Since early last year, Kim has largely shut his country’s borders as part of draconian anti-virus measures that experts say are taking a heavy toll on his country’s already troubled economy. He called ongoing difficulties “the worst-ever” and compared them with a 1990s famine that killed hundreds of thousands.But there are no signs that Kim will return to talks with the United States anytime soon. Instead, he has repeatedly warned he will bolster his nuclear and missile arsenals unless Washington drops its hostility against Pyongyang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-policy-of-a-complete-but-isolated-10-yr-rule-in-north-korea-101639631299262.html
16-12-2021||World||'Show, don't tell': Image politics key strategy for Kim Jong Un||From the youthful party functionary to the leader riding a horse through mountain snows, North Korea has sought to portray Kim Jong Un as increasingly both authoritative and popular over his decade in power.North Korea is one of the most isolated and censored societies on the planet, with its state media tightly controlling what the people see and hear.Three generations of the Kim family have ruled the country with absolute authority since 1948, and analysts say the regime has used carefully crafted images to ensure their power.To outsiders, Kim is regarded as a ruthless tyrant with an undying obsession to develop the country's nuclear weapons, even at the cost of starving the population.But North Korea's tightly-controlled state media offers a softer side: Kim caressing weeping orphans, being mobbed by gushing female soldiers, or smiling broadly on a mound of potatoes."The images that the regime chooses to disseminate and weave into Kim's hagiography say a lot about how Kim envisions North Korea's future and his place in it," wrote Jung Pak, now US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, in a 2018 report before she took up her current post.In his frequent public appearances, Kim is seen giving guidance at various economic, military, and social venues, just as his father and grandfather did.In marked contrast, he is also shown pulling weeds, riding roller coasters, operating a tank, or galloping on a horse."Kim appears to want to reinforce the impression that he is young, vigorous, on the move -- qualities that he attributes to his country as well," Pak said in the Brookings Institution report.Carefully crafted photographs and films are "a universal part of politics" to win public support, said Michael Madden, fellow at the Stimson Center, but Pyongyang's propaganda had different motives."In North Korea, it is not a matter of being responsive to public opinion, but influencing how... citizens view or regard the leadership."White horseImage was "particularly important" to Kim when he was rushed into power after the death of his father Kim Jong Il on December 17, 2011, said Jean Lee, senior fellow at the Wilson Center."He inherited leadership at a time when he was young and a virtual unknown to his own people."Madden added the regime launched an "emulation campaign" early on, with the young leader adopting the clothing and haircut of his grandfather, North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung.The striking resemblance between the two even fuelled international speculation that the younger Kim intentionally put on weight to increase the likeness."The strategy was to cast him as a modern reincarnation of his much-beloved grandfather -- in looks, personality and policy -- to justify his right to rule," Lee told AFP.Kim's weight -- which rose significantly during his time in power before dropping sharply this year -- has regularly prompted questions about his health.But analysts say that images carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency or the Rodong Sinmun newspaper have a wider purpose beyond aesthetics.In October 2019, North Korean media published pictures of Kim riding a white horse through a winter landscape to the summit of the sacred Mount Paektu.The motif has been a recurrent theme in images of Kim's predecessors but some North Korea watchers saw them as a signal for a new policy direction.They came during stalled US-North Korea talks after a failed second summit between Kim and then US president Donald Trump, and Madden described them as "anti-imperialist imagery".The photos carried the message that "North Korea will not be pushed around or intimidated by 'big power countries'", he added.'Time of hardship'Impoverished North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, and has long suffered chronic food shortages.The country is facing its worst economic crisis for years, hit by both sanctions and its self-imposed coronavirus blockade.In recent months, pictures of the leader have shown his acute weight loss, "playing into Kim's image of being more accountable to the people" according to Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center.The official Korean Central Television aired a rare interview of an unnamed citizen saying the people were "heartbroken" over the change in his physique and that "everyone just started to cry" at the sight of Kim.The images were aimed at "showing that sacrifices are being made a time of hardship for the country", Town said -- but added that its effectiveness was unknown."The longer the hardships continue, the less compelling images of the leader will do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/show-don-t-tell-image-politics-key-strategy-for-kim-jong-un-101639626221934.html

It is also one of the strongest storms so far.• The authorities have warned of storm surges, flooding and landslides in coastal and mountainous areas in the typhoon's path.• The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) – which monitors typhoons locally – has warned of “heavy to intense and at times torrential” rain in most parts of the Philippines from Thursday to Friday.• Nearly 30,000 residents in Eastern Samar province, one of the hardest hit by super typhoon Haiyan in 2013, have been evacuated from their homes in the past two days.• "We are getting pounded already by strong wind and rain," Governor Ben Evardone of the Eastern Samar province told DZMM radio station.• The southern province of Surigao del Sur has already started to feel the force of the storm.• Several airlines have cancelled dozens of flights, while transport authorities banned sea and land travel in the central and southern Philippines, leaving thousands stranded at ports.• The Philippines has postponed the start of a mass vaccination drive in most parts of the country because of the storm.• The Southeast Asian nation, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, sees around 20 tropical storms annually, causing floods and landslides.• What makes the condition favourable for typhoons like Rai to form are very warm ocean waters and low wind shear. These conditions help strengthen a storm to a potentially catastrophic, high-end typhoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-nears-philippines-thousands-evacuated-storm-surge-expected-101639621713895.html
16-12-2021||World||Covid-19: Amid Omicron threat, Canadians urged not to travel abroad||The Canadian government on Wednesday urged citizens to avoid foreign travel over the Christmas holidays, saying the Covid-19 Omicron variant "makes us fear the worst," including soaring infections and travel disruptions.The travel advisory will be re-evaluated in four weeks, but public health restrictions could be imposed in the interim if the pandemic situation worsens, officials told a news conference."Our government is officially advising Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside Canada," health minister Jean-Yves Duclos told a news conference."Those who are planning to travel, I say very clearly: Now is not the time to travel. The rapid spread of the Covid variant on the global scale makes us fear the worst," he said."Traveling Canadians could contract the virus or get stranded abroad."At an emergency meeting late Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had proposed closing the border, but the measure was roundly rejected by provincial leaders, a source told AFP.Duclos said Covid-19 testing of travelers at Canadian airports would be increased and other public health measures would be rolled out in the coming days."There will certainly be other public health measures (coming), because the situation will continue to evolve," Duclos said."The epidemiological situation is changing rapidly. The information currently available suggests a significant resurgence of infections, even without taking into account the new Omicron variant," he said.Earlier, Trudeau told reporters that Canadians should "take careful decisions in regards to Christmas festivities.""I understand this sucks," he later added. "This is not what anyone wanted for our Christmas holidays."Last year around this time, all arriving travelers to Canada were required to quarantine for 14 days.The World Health Organization warned Tuesday that Omicron variant cases were multiplying at breakneck speeds and urged quick actions by countries to try to slow its spread.As of Wednesday, there were 40,000 active Covid-19 cases in Canada, and at least 4,500 new infections reported by public health authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-amid-omicron-threat-canadians-urged-not-to-travel-abroad-101639615160756.html

She was 69.The fourth of seven siblings, hooks was born in 1952 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.She published her first book of poems in 1978, and by the end of her life had written 40 books that have been translated into 15 languages, her sisters said.After studying and teaching at several universities, she returned to Kentucky, teaching at Berea College, which established the bell hooks center as an inclusive space for historically under-represented students.Her work on racism, feminism, gender and other issues drew particular attention during the 2020 protests."The family is honored that Gloria received numerous awards, honors and international fame for her works as poet, author, feminist, professor, cultural critic and social activist," her sisters wrote."We are proud to call her sister, friend, confidant and influencer."Tributes to hooks flooded social media."Devoured her work, taught her work and she taught me so much," Maya Harris, an activist, author and the sister of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on Twitter. "An immeasurable legacy and teachings that will live on forever."Melina Abdullah, professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, and one of the original Black Lives Matter organizers, said hooks' work had a profound impact on her."She changed my life. Shaped me into who I am in so many ways," Abdullah wrote. "Thank you, Sister, for your beautiful, powerful, life work and Spirit."The Washington Post reported that the cause of death was end stage renal failure, citing her family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-feminist-author-groundbreaking-thinker-bell-hooks-dies-at-69-101639609954872.html

16-12-2021||World||'Almost beyond belief': Biden on tornado-ravaged Kentucky||US President Joe Biden pledged increased federal assistance to Kentucky on Wednesday as he surveyed the damage in tornado-ravaged towns and consoled survivors of the twisters that took scores of lives."The scope and scale of this destruction is almost beyond belief," the 79-year-old president said after visiting the towns of Mayfield and Dawson Springs."These tornadoes devoured almost everything in their path," he said in Dawson Springs in western Kentucky. "Your homes, your businesses, your houses of worship, your dreams, your lives."Biden said the federal government would foot 100 percent of the bill for emergency relief for the next 30 days and will continue to do "whatever it takes, for as long as it takes."Biden, who has made empathy one of his trademarks, strolled down a ruined street in Mayfield, stopping to chat and shake the hand of a woman who was seated in the rubble of a collapsed building.Wearing a baseball cap and a dark blue suit with no tie, the president paused in the street at one point and bowed his head in prayer with the town's mayor and several other people.Before touring Mayfield, a town of some 10,000 people, and Dawson Springs, population 2,500, Biden received a briefing on the damage from last week's tornadoes, which killed at least 74 people in Kentucky and 14 in surrounding states."There's no red tornadoes, there's no blue tornadoes," the Democratic president said in a reference to the colors of the nation's two largest political parties -- the red of Republicans and the blue of Democrats.Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor, is a Democrat, but Kentuckians voted overwhelmingly for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.In addition to federal aid, more than 500 National Guard troops have been deployed to help with law enforcement, traffic control and recovery, along with volunteers and associations on the ground to support victims.- 'It does mean a lot' - "We appreciate the president coming down, coming to Mayfield," Bryan Wilson, a lawyer, told AFP, as he sifted through the rubble of his firm's flattened downtown building. "It does mean a lot."Wilson, speaking over the sounds of construction equipment removing debris, said he was trying to salvage legal files, client records, computers -- anything that would preserve the integrity of the business.He said Biden's visit signals that people in Washington "do care about rural America.""And hopefully that gives the incentive for people to stay, to build back," he said.Wilson said he hopes Biden's trip heals some of the bitter political and cultural rifts in the country."America has been divided for too long," he said. "This is not Republican, this is not Democrat, this is not independent. This is America."Brad Mills, a 63-year-old orthodontist in Mayfield, said his message to Biden was to expedite federal disaster assistance."Let's get the federal aid in here that we need," Mills said. "As divided as we are on so many issues, we've got common ground here."Mills spoke to AFP outside his office in downtown Mayfield that had been his father's and his grandfather's before him. His son Stuart, who is in dental school, was on the roof putting on a tarp.Asked if he was going to rebuild his practice, Mills said, "that's going to be the big question."It's so emotional right now, you can't make a rational decision."As Biden toured Kentucky, weather forecasters warned that parts of the midwestern United States were facing a potentially "historical weather day," with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour (160 kilometers per hour) and the possibility of tornadoes.mlm-aue/cl/swTwitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-beyond-belief-biden-on-tornado-ravaged-kentucky-101639608765192.html
16-12-2021||India||Indian security agencies effective in disrupting terror threats: US report||Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats, but gaps remain in interagency intelligence and information sharing, the US state department said in its annual report on terrorism published Thursday. Citing several arrests by India’s National Investigative Agency (NIA), the country-wise report said that Indian counterterrorism forces actively detected and disrupted transnational and regional terrorist groups in 2020.The ‘Country Reports on Terrorism 2020: India’ mentioned multiple arrests of alleged al-Qaeda-affiliated operatives from Kerala and West Bengal, and of Abdul Karim, the second-in-command of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, on suspected involvement in serial bombings in Bodh Gaya in 2013.It stated that India responds “in a timely manner” to the requests made by the United States for information related to terrorism investigations and “makes efforts to mitigate threats” in response to the information shared by the US. According to the report, the collaborative efforts of India and the United States have disrupted terrorist travel and alerted American authorities about possible threats posed to the United States.“Officials remain concerned about internet use for terrorist recruitment and radicalization to violence, as well as for fomenting interreligious tensions. In 2020 there were multiple reports in the media and from the NIA of suspected cases of online terrorist radicalization, particularly in southern Indian states,” the report said.It highlighted the major terrorist groups that are active in India, including Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.“The Indian government made significant efforts to detect, disrupt, and degrade the operations of terrorist organizations within its borders,” the report further noted, adding that counterterrorism and security cooperation with the United States expanded in 2020.The country-wise report on Pakistan said that India’s neighbour took steps to counter terror financing and to restrain India-focused militant groups but made limited progress on its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay or discrimination. It highlighted that Islamabad did not take steps under its domestic authorities to prosecute terrorist leaders residing in Pakistan, such as JeM founder Masood Azhar and LeT’s Sajid Mir, mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-says-india-effective-in-disrupting-terror-threats-highlights-pakistan-s-failure-101639676621600.html
16-12-2021||India||In rare move, Goa Congress 1st list of candidates is out before poll announcement||PANAJI: The Congress on Thursday released its first list of eight candidates including leader of opposition in Goa assembly and former chief minister Digambar Kamat.According to a Congress statement, Kamat will contest from Margao and MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenço from Curtorim. The list does not include Pratapsingh Rane, the 82-year-old sitting MLA from Poriem who has been a lawmaker for close to five decades. It is not clear if he has indicated his reluctance to contest but he recently rebutted the BJP claims that he could move out of the party.The list of eight candidates makes the Congress the first party to declare its list even before the elections have been formally announced by the Election Commission. This is in line with party senior observer P Chidambaram’s assurance to Goa party leaders that there will be no repeat of the practice of declaring candidates at the last minute leaving them with little time to campaign ahead of the polls. Besides the sitting MLAs, the list includes Sudhir Kandolkar, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Mapusa by election against incumbent BJP MLA Joshua de Souza after the passing of Joshua’s father and deputy chief minister Francisco de Souza, Sankalp Amonkar who narrowly lost to sitting MLA Milind Naik by 46 votes in 2017, and Yuri Alemao, the son of former minister Joaquim Alemao (who served in the Digambar Kamat cabinet between 2007 and 2012) for Cuncolim. Yuri is also the nephew of Churchill Alemao who recently joined the TMC. Yuri contested the 2012 assembly elections but lost to the BJP’s Subhash Phaldessai. The new faces include Rajesh Verenkar who is tasked with winning the Ponda seat for the Congress after its MLA Ravi Naik defected to the BJP, Altone D’Costa in Quepem who has a similar task of regaining the seat for the Congress from Chandrakant Kavlekar who moved to the BJP along with 10 MLAs and Tony Rodrigues who will take on the Monserrate family in their stronghold of Taleigao. Rodrigues is a former confidante of Atanasio “Babush” Monserrate but broke ranks with him a few years earlier.The party’s decision to declare its first list has taken political observers by surprise given that the party has a reputation for waiting until the last minute often in a bid to stem rebellions and ensure that potential rebels have very little time to plan a strategy and contest the election.On the other hand, the practice of declaring candidates early leaves the party vulnerable to rival parties poaching their ‘official’ candidates.The party, however, has in its first list declared largely ‘non contentious’ candidates who do not have any notable challengers and who are largely expected to be loyal to the party, said a Goa Congress leader, who were not willing to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rare-move-goa-congress-1st-list-of-candidates-is-out-before-poll-announcement-101639676208130.html

All of them have international travel history||Karnataka reported five more cases of the Omicron variant on Thursday, said state health minister Dr K Sudhakar. Announcing the new cases in a tweet, the minister said that the patients had travel history to New Delhi, the United Kingdom, Nigeria and South Africa. A statement from the department of health and family welfare said that so far eight people have tested positive for the new variant in the state. “Of the eight cases, four pertain to international arrivals from at risk countries, three have travelled from Delhi and the remaining one case is related to possible contact with a foreigner/international traveller,” read the statement. “Except for one case, where the international traveller went back to South Africa, the remaining confirmed cases were in institutional isolation (at the hospital) and were treated as per the Government of India protocol. The current health status of these Omicron affected patients is good and no one has serious symptoms,” it added. According to the health department, patient number four is a 19-year-old woman who had travelled from the United Kingdom on December 13. She arrived in Bengaluru with a Covid-19 negative test report but tested positive at the airport. “(She was) shifted in an ambulance from the airport to Bowring Hospital on the same day.

The statement said that despite testing positive, he was given permission to take a connecting flight to Belagavi two hours later.

NCM Chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura wrote to Punjab's chief secretary Anirudh Tewari directing him to advise all eateries to disclose the ‘category’ of the meat served by them.Lalpura noted that hotels and restaurants in Punjab are only serving halal meat which is prohibited in the Sikh religion. He said the mandatory disclosure would allow people to make an informed choice before they consume the meat."Accordingly, all hotels/restaurants may be advised to mandatorily disclose the category of the meat whether it is 'jhatka' butchering meat or 'halal' butchering meat at all eating joints to allow the public to make an informed choice before consumption," the letter read.“An early action in the matter shall be highly appreciated,” the NCM chief added.What is Kerala's 'halal' food controversy? ExplainedThe word ‘Halal’, in Arabic, literally means permissible and Halal food is that which adheres to Islamic law, as defined in the Koran.In the Halal form of slaughter, animals or poultry are killed by severing the major veins, arteries and windpipe without decapitation and are left till the blood drains out completely. According to the UK-based Halal Food Authority, an animal or poultry should be dead before slaughter and any flowing blood of the carcass should be completely drained.In the jhatka method, the animal is killed instantaneously.Earlier this year, a similar order was issued by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/halal-or-jhatka-punjab-govt-advised-to-make-eateries-disclose-meat-category-101639670248101.html

16-12-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear appeals for Tamil Nadu’s Vanniyar quota law on Feb 15-16||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Tamil Nadu government not to make any fresh appointments or admissions under the special law providing 10.5% reservation to Vanniyars, a most backward class (MBC) community, after the state law passed in February this year was struck down as unconstitutional by the Madras high court on November 1.For now, the court has, however, protected all appointments and admissions made by the government before the high court ruling.Nearly 75,000 students have been granted admission availing the benefit of this law.“Appointments already made shall not be disturbed. No appointments or admissions shall be made till February 15,” a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna said as it issued notice on a set of appeals challenging the high court decision filed by the Tamil Nadu government and Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) – a political outfit in the state representing the interests of the Vanniyakula Kshatriyas who benefit from this law.The Supreme Court posted the matter for hearing on February 15 and 16, and told the lawyers appearing in the case that no adjournment shall be granted considering the “importance” of the issue that has implications on the future of students admitted under this law. A host of lawyers appeared in favour of the law with the state government being led by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Tamil Nadu passed a law to grant 10.5% reservation for Vanniyars within the already available 20% quota for MBCs in February this year just before the state was hearing into state elections. This law was challenged before the top court and the Madras high court simultaneously. In July, the top court refused to stay the law while allowing the hearing before the high court to go on.The high court ruled that the 10.5% quota law passed by the previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led assembly the day state elections were announced, was illegal because of a lack of quantifiable data to measure the “extreme backwardness” of the Vanniyars.The petition filed by the Tamil Nadu government said that MBCs were identified in Tamil Nadu as early as 1957 as equivalent to scheduled castes but without the factor of untouchability. In 2012, much after the enactment of the 1994 law providing 20% reservation for MBCs, the Tamil Nadu backward classes commission was asked by the state government to grant internal reservation within the 20% quota.The commission chairman alone recommended for 10.5% quota for Vanniyar Kshatriya. Later this recommendation was revisited by the state backward classes commission in February 2021 which gave the go-ahead for implementing a 10.5% Vanniyar quota within the MBC quota, causing disgruntlement among other MBCs and de-notified communities, otherwise entitled to these benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-appeals-for-tamil-nadu-s-vanniyar-quota-law-on-feb-1516-101639668047377.html
16-12-2021||India||India in touch with Pakistan on modalities for shipping wheat as aid to Afghanistan||India said on Thursday it continues to be in touch with Pakistan on modalities for supplying 50,000 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing. New Delhi made the proposal for shipping wheat and medicines via Pakistani soil on October 7, and received a response from Islamabad only on November 24. On December 3, Pakistan said it would allow Indian relief materials to be shipped via the Wagah crossing only in Afghan trucks. India intends to hand over the wheat to the World Food Programme (WFP), the food assistance branch of the UN, since New Delhi doesn’t recognise the Taliban setup in Kabul. On December 11, India despatched 1.6 tonnes of life-saving medicines on a special charter flight to Kabul and the supplies were handed over to representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO). India continues to be “in touch with Pakistani authorities on the modalities for supplying the 50,000 tonnes of wheat and other medical supplies” as humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular media briefing. “It’s a complex operation and I would request you to be patient,” he said, without giving details. Bagchi reiterated India’s “special relationship” with the Afghan people, and said the approach of India and the world community to the situation in Afghanistan is guided by UN Security Council resolution 2593. India will continue providing humanitarian aid to the Afghan people and is committed to send more medicines, medical supplies and wheat, he said. People familiar with the matter said Pakistan has told the Indian side that the entire consignment of wheat should be transported within December. The wheat is to be carried from Wagah by trucks that bring Afghan products to the Indian side. The people said only 30 to 40 Afghan trucks currently make the daily trip to Wagah and it is unlikely that 50,000 tonnes of wheat can be sent via the land route by the end of this month, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-in-touch-with-pakistan-on-modalities-for-shipping-wheat-as-aid-to-afghanistan-101639667207268.html
16-12-2021||India||Online scammers target 'prominent' Indian women journalists with promises of jobs at Harvard: Report||Several prominent female journalists and media personalities in India including ex-NDTV anchor Nidhi Razdan have been targeted by online scammers with promises of prestigious jobs at Harvard, the New York Times reported on Thursday.While the identity of the scammers remains a mystery, the incidents have raised questions about why Harvard — despite its reputation for fiercely protecting its brand — "did not act to stop the scam, even after being explicitly warned about it" by one of the victims, the Times said.Another target was a spokeswoman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Nighat Abbass. When the scammers pushed for her passport details and other personal information, she checked directly with one of the Harvard administrators included on the emails.That administrator, Bailey Payne, a programme coordinator in the office of Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, responded, saying the official invitation that appeared to have been sent from her Harvard.edu email address was fake.When Payne asked Abbass if she would like to share more information, Abbass sent in a trove - the phone number from the U.A.E., the emails, screenshots of the fake Harvard documents and hotel booking records. But it’s not clear what action, if any, Harvard took, the Times said.Payne did not respond to requests for comment. Jason Newton, a Harvard spokesman, declined to comment on what the university did with the information Abbass provided, the paper said.The first known target was outspoken female journalist Rohini Singh, who received a Twitter message from someone calling himself Tauseef Ahmad in mid-August 2019.Ahmad invited her to participate in a high-powered media conference. Harvard would pick up all expenses. She, however, grew suspicious after Ahmad connected her to a colleague, introduced as Alex Hirschman, who wrote to her from a Gmail account rather than an official Harvard.edu email address. Singh ceased communication.The next target was another female journalist, Zainab Sikander, who too received a Twitter message on August 22, 2019 from Ahmad, inviting her to participate in a high-powered media conference at Harvard. It was the same message sent to Singh, the Times said.When she asked for a formal invite from a dean, it never came. Sikander then broke off contact as well.The next target was another female journalist working at a prominent Indian publication. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, she said she quickly broke off contact after getting suspicious about the scammer’s U.A.E. phone number.In late November 2019, the hackers were well practised when they reached out to Razdan, a news anchor at the apex of her career.She received the first email on November 14, 2019, from an earnest sounding student - Melissa Reeve - inviting her to a Harvard media seminar. She was then introduced, by email, to another student, Tauseef Ahmad. When he said there might be a journalism job available at Harvard, Razdan let her hopes soar.The next thing Razdan knew, she was interviewing with someone claiming to be Bharat Anand, the name of a real vice provost at Harvard. She never saw him, though. The interview was by phone."This is where I feel I really messed up,” she said. “I should have insisted it be a video call.”The scammers were taking bolder steps to impersonate Harvard. They bought a website from GoDaddy, HarvardCareer.com, in January 2020 and set up a Microsoft email server that would soon allow them to send messages stamped with Harvard’s name. Unlike earlier owners of the domain, they opted for privacy protection that obscured their names from public registries of website owners, the Times said.Razdan was then asked for references. Each of the people Razdan enlisted received an official looking email from HarvardCareer.com with a web link to upload a recommendation.Harvard says it fiercely protects its trademark, employing software to detect new websites that infringe on its brand, but Newton, the university spokesman, declined to say if it had detected HarvardCareer.com, the Times said.The scammers continued to use it to send emails, capitalising on Harvard’s reputation. They also copied employment documents from Harvard’s official website, using them as fodder as the scam advanced, the Times said.In February 2020, right before Covid-19 exploded across the world, Razdan was told the job was hers. She received a lengthy contract that included everything from arbitration clauses to details about dental insurance. In June 2020, she announced to the world, via Twitter, about her move to join Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences as an Associate Professor teaching journalism.Online classes were supposed to start in September. Right before classes were to begin, she received an email saying there was a delay because of Covid-19. The scammers would use the pandemic many times as an excuse for delays or slip-ups.They also asked her to install Team Viewer, which is software that enables computers to connect to each other. Team Viewer would allow the scammers to access files on her laptop, but Razdan didn’t know that. Trying to be helpful, she downloaded the software.The scammers played off Razdan’s eagerness to connect with faculty members. Several times they invited her to do a video call with Emma Densch, a real dean at Harvard. But the calls kept getting cancelled at the last minute.By December, Razdan began to get annoyed at what she thought was flakiness. She reached out to officials in Harvard’s human resources department. They didn’t write back. She then emailed Densch’s office directly, asking about the cancelled video calls.Densch’s assistant wrote back that Razdan was never on the dean’s schedule. The assistant then asked: Who were you talking to? Razdan sent in a flurry of correspondence, including her signed contract.That’s when she received the shocking email in the middle of the night.Just like Abbass, she urged Harvard to investigate, emailing the university that “Someone/group of people have been impersonating senior Harvard officials and forging their signatures, and must be brought to book.”She said Harvard never wrote back, the Times reported.She turned to Jiten Jain, the director of a cybersecurity firm in India called Voyager Infosec, to perform a forensic analysis of her laptop and devices. Jain, who shared his findings with The New York Times, said Razdan’s email account had likely been hacked. Worse, Jain found remnants of a suspicious installer file on her computer, a sign that malware may have been installed.Razdan has filed an FIR with the Delhi Police which is investigating the hoax. It is still uncertain why Razdan and the other women were targeted, according to the Times report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-scammers-target-prominent-indian-women-journalists-with-promises-of-jobs-at-harvard-report-101639666569807.html
16-12-2021||India||IAF chopper crash: Tri-service inquiry likely to be completed in 2 weeks||The tri-service inquiry into the crash of the helicopter leading to 14 deaths, including that of India's first Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, is likely to be completed within the next two weeks, news agency ANI reported citing government sources. The investigation is being headed by Air Marshal Manvendra Singh. A Brigadier-rank officer each from the Indian Army and the Indian Navy are also there in the investigation team. Work to find out what caused the copter crash began a day after the accident.The constitution of the tri-service inquiry was announced by defence minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament, a day after the tragic crash. The Indian Air Force urged people to not speculate over the reason for the crash based on misinformation.According to the information given out by the defence ministry, there was no SOS from the copter which flew from Sulur airbase at 11.48am on December 8. It was scheduled to reach its destination, the Wellington airbase, at 12.15pm. The ministry said the Sulur airbase lost contact with the helicopter at around 12.08pm, minutes before the copter was to land.Soon after the tragic crash, a video of apparently the final moment of the copter appeared on social media. The videographer, a local wedding photographer who went to that area to take photos, said the weather at that time was very bad. In the video too, the copter was seen vanishing amid the fog.Several people have been arrested in the aftermath of the incident for making objectionable comments regarding the death of the defence personnel. IAF Group Captain Varun Singh was the lone survivor of the crash until Wednesday when he succumbed to his injuries, after battling for a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chopper-crash-tri-service-inquiry-likely-to-be-completed-in-2-weeks-101639666004285.html

16-12-2021||India||CBI files charge sheet against Retd Justice Shri Narayan Shukla||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a charge sheet against retired Judge of the Allahabad high court - Justice Shri Narayan Shukla, and others in its judicial corruption probe involving Lucknow-based Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences, people familiar with the development said on Thursday. The charge sheet was filed earlier this week in the court of Special Judge Anil Kumar Sisodia at Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi under the prevention of corruption act and criminal conspiracy charges. The court had listed the matter for December 20. As first reported by HT on November 12, the central probe agency has sought prosecution sanction against Shukla upon completing the investigation. The government accorded the sanction in November last week, enabling the CBI to submit the charge sheet in court. Officials who didn’t want to be named said they have presented “sufficient evidence” against Justice (Retd) Shukla and others in the final report (charge sheet). Shukla, who retired from the service in July 2020, is accused of taking a bribe for passing an order that favoured the Lucknow-based medical college, which was debarred in May 2017 from admitting students by the Medical Council of India (MCI), the country’s medical education regulator.He was under investigation for criminal conspiracy, sections of the prevention of corruption act which deal with accepting bribes, and criminal misconduct along with retired Odisha high court judge IM Quddusi, Bhagwan Prasad Yadav, and Palash Yadav of Prasad Education Trust, an intermediary, Bhawana Pandey and another alleged middleman Sudhir Giri.In all, two First Information Reports (FIRs) were filed in the Prasad Education Trust matter - first in September 2017 naming Quddusi and middlemen and another in December 2019. In its first charge sheet filed in July 2019, the agency claimed that accused persons including Quddusi used code words such as ped (plant), gamla (pot), samaan (goods) and prasad (offering) while referring to bribes allegedly to be paid to a certain “captain” to get a favourable order for Prasad Institute. The agency had attached 80 telephone intercepts of Quddusi and other accused which revealed the whole conspiracy.According to CBI, the Lucknow-based medical college was debarred by MCI from admitting students for academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19 due to substandard facilities and non-fulfilment of required criteria along with 46 other medical colleges.The MCI decision was initially challenged by Prasad Institute before the Supreme Court. CBI’s FIR said a conspiracy was hatched and the petition was withdrawn from the top court, and a writ petition was filed before the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on August 24, 2017.It added that Quddusi and BP Yadav of Prasad Trust met justice Shukla on the morning of August 25, 2017, at his residence in Lucknow, which is when the bribe is believed to have been exchanged. CBI alleged the petition was heard the same day by the division bench of the high court comprising justice SN Shukla and a favourable order was passed.Former Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra ordered an investigation against Shukla on a complaint by Uttar Pradesh advocate general Raghvendra Singh alleging judicial malpractice. A three-member committee comprising then Madras high court chief justice Indira Banerjee, then Sikkim high court chief justice SK Agnihotri and Madhya Pradesh high court judge PK Jaiswal, found Shukla guilty of judicial irregularities in January 2018 after which his impeachment was recommended to the President of India.Shukla, who was a sitting judge at the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad HC at the time, was debarred from entering the court premises and all the judicial and administrative work was taken away from him.Later, in July 2019, former CJI Ranjan Gogoi gave permission to CBI to file a case in the matter. Gogoi also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi recommending Shukla’s removal. Shukla eventually retired in July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-retd-justice-shri-narayan-shukla-101639665527127.html
16-12-2021||India||Supreme Court revives bullock cart race in Maharashtra||The Supreme Court on Thursday permitted the Maharashtra government to conduct the bullock cart race, a traditional sport banned in the state by the Bombay high court in October 2017, which held such races inflict cruelty on animals as bulls were classified as ‘non-performing animals’ under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act of 1960.To overcome the legal hurdle posed by the PCA Act, the Maharashtra government came out with a state amendment along with rules for conducting the bullock-cart races under monitoring of the district collector along with a veterinary doctor. This law was stalled by the high court in October 2017 as the Court followed a Supreme Court judgment delivered in 2014 by which use of bulls for any sport or race was prohibited.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for Maharashtra showed the Court that bullock cart races, known by other names, is allowed in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, under similar state laws passed by the respective state governments which were not stayed by the Supreme Court when separate petitions challenging them were filed before the top court in November-December 2017. In February 2018, the laws passed by the three states permitting bullock cart races were referred to a Constitution bench of five judges to ascertain whether they fall foul of the 2014 SC judgment.Agreeing with the state, the bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar said, “It does not appeal to common sense that all across the country, bullock cart race is permitted but not in one state. This court had applied its mind to these laws while referring the matter to Constitution bench….We are on a limited issue whether to stop the race across the country or permit it for Maharashtra as well.”Maharashtra had filed an application through advocate Sachin Patil for vacating the stay imposed by the high court. It attached an expert committee report which said that a special breed of bulls which are anatomically slender can run and such bulls are trained and fed by families since time immemorial to participate in the race.The bench set aside the HC judgment and said, “Unless there are changed circumstances, we see no reason why similar treatment should not be extended to all states where the same dispensation applies with regard to the amended provisions of law.”The state’s application was objected to by NGOs and individuals opposed to bullock cart races. Senior advocate Anand Grover appearing for one such NGO said that the 2014 judgment by the top court held such races to be illegal and the state laws do not overcome the “unconstitutionality” imposed by that judgment. The Court said that this aspect would be gone into by the constitution bench and allowed parties to approach the chief justice of India (CJI) for urgent hearing of the matter listed before the larger bench.Grover said, “For four years, the state was not allowed to hold this race…the species they are claiming are meant for running form only 4% of the racing bulls.” The bench said, “For 400 years, they have been running. This has been a traditional sport and now you realize, it is a matter of cruelty.” The Court allowed the applications opposing the state plea to give suggestions on how best to regulate these races while having regard to the interest of animals.It was in July 2017, the Maharashtra PCA (Maharashtra amendment) Act and the Maharashtra PCA (conduct of bullock cart race) rules were introduced permitting bull to be a performing animal. The state had claimed that till the Supreme Court determines the validity of its laws, it should receive the same treatment as other states which passed similar laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-revives-bullock-cart-race-in-maharashtra-101639664507087.html
16-12-2021||India||Shouldn't dismiss Omicron as 'mild', warns WHO official as variant spreads rapidly||The cases of the Omicron strain should not be dismissed as mild as it appears to be spreading faster than any other variants of concern, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday. In an interview with news agency ANI, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia, cautioned about the virulence of the Omicron variant that is rapidly spreading across the world, causing concern for health authorities."Based on the current limited evidence, Omicron appears to be spreading faster at a rate not seen with any other previous variant. Emerging data from South Africa suggest an increased risk of re-infection with Omicron, but more data are needed to draw firmer conclusions,” ANI quoted Dr Singh as saying.The WHO official stressed that the overall threat posed by the new variant of concern depends on the transmissibility, immune escape ability and virulence of the strain. She said there are still limited data on the clinical severity associated with Omicron and more information is required to fully understand the clinical scenario of those infected with the variant of concern first detected in South Africa."We should not dismiss Omicron as mild. Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm health systems," the WHO official added.A similar concern was raised by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week when he confirmed the first death in the UK due to Omicron. Amid reports of the new variant of concern causing mild disease as compared to the Delta strain, Johnson said the “idea” of Omicron being the “milder version” should be set aside and focus should be on the transmissibility of the variant."So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus - I think that's something we need to set on one side - and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population," Johnson told reporters.Citing preliminary data, Dr Singh said the vaccines may have reduced effectiveness against Omicron, but added that it will take “a few more weeks” to fully assess the efficacy of Covid vaccines against the new variant of concern. She reminded that vaccines alone won’t help countries come out of the pandemic and other proven public health and social measures must be followed."The risk of Covid-19 remains high globally and the emergence of variants is a reminder that the pandemic is far from over,” she said, as quoted by ANI.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shouldnt-dismiss-omicron-as-mild-warns-who-official-as-variant-spreads-rapidly-101639662564235.html

Layak suffered a setback in October when she was disqualified for the national championship at the G V Mavalankar pre-national event on charges of tampering the target, her coach, former Olympian and Arjuna awardee Joydeep Karmakar, told HT. “Layak is the fourth Indian shooter to die by suicide in four months. Three shooters from Punjab shot themselves with their own firearms since September. This is definitely a bad time for the nation’s shooting sports fraternity. Maybe psychologists can throw more light on this,” Karmakar said. Finding training facilities in Jharkhand inadequate, Layak joined Karmakar’s training institute in Kolkata in July this year. She used to stay with other roommates at the women’s hostel in Bally and visit her family occasionally. “Layak apparently hanged herself after her roommates left for work. The body has been sent for post-mortem. Members of her family have come from Jharkhand,” said a police officer. “I got to know about Layak only after I read in the newspapers that Sood was moved by her troubles and got her a new rifle. We contacted her and asked her to come over for training. We reduced her training fees by 50%. Her skills were quite raw when we took her on board,” said Karmakar. “I cannot believe that she can die by suicide. Layak always wore a charming smile. She was neither an extrovert, nor an introvert. There are around 300 students in my institute. It is difficult to say what is going on inside their minds but Layak never appeared to be a person suffering from depression. The setback at Mavalankar was definitely a humiliation but that happened two months ago,” said Karmakar. “Around 20 years ago, a shooter was suspended for two years on a similar charge. I do not know if the national shooting sports authorities were planning a similar step in her case. After all, she represents Jharkhand,” said Karmakar. “Three shooters from Punjab have died by suicide since September. This is the fourth incident,” said Karmakar. In September, Namanveer Singh Brar, who won a bronze at the World University Games, killed himself in Mohali. In October, Hunardeep Singh Sohal, who was a state-level shooter, shot himself. Khushseerat Kaur Sandhu, who participated in the Junior World Championships, died by suicide on December 8. The police learnt from Layak’s parents that she went to Chittaranjan in West Burdwan district earlier this week to attend a friend’s wedding. 
16-12-2021||India||When AIIMS had confirmed Sheena Bora was strangled to death||The sensational claim of Indrani Mukerjea that her daughter Sheena Bora is alive and is in J&K has brought the six-year-old Sheena Bora murder case again in news. According to an ANI report, Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused of the murder which took place in 2012 and came to the surface in 2015, has written to the CBI asking the agency to look for Sheena Bora in J&K. CBI was investigating the case since 2015 and in 2021 it told the Bombay high court that it will not be investigating the case further as according to its investigation Indrani Mukerjea killed Sheena Bora as Sheena was threatening to reveal Indrani Mukerjea's identity that Indrani was her mother, not elder sister, as Indrani used to introduce her.Reports said investigators are not taking Indrani Mukerjea's claim seriously as this might be a ploy to buy some time in the case. In November, Indrani had applied for bail after the CBI said it won't investigate the case further. The bail plea was dismissed by the high court.In 2015, when the spine-chilling murder case came to the surface after Indrani Mukerjea's ex-driver was arrested by the Mumbai Police in another case, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences confirmed that Sheena Bora died of strangulation. The burnt skeleton was exhumed after three years and was tested by AIIMS experts. The expert team said the skeleton was burnt and there was not a single fracture.This matched with what Mukerjea's ex-driver Shyamvar Rai said that Sheena was strangled in a car and then her body was burnt and dumped in a forest in Raigad. The plan was hatched by Indrani Mukerjea, her second husband Sanjeev Khanna and her third husband Peter Mukerjea.The investigation has revealed Sheena Bora was in a relationship with Rahul Mukerjea, Peter Mukerjea's son from his first marriage, which Indrani did not approve. It was also reported that Rahul did not know that Sheena was Indrani's daughter as Indrani introduced Sheena as her sister. The disagreement over this issue led to the murder which was under wrap for three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-aiims-had-confirmed-sheena-bora-was-strangled-to-death-101639656675185.html
16-12-2021||India||Sheena Bora is alive, claims Indrani Mukerjea; urges CBI to probe the claim||MUMBAI: Jailed former media executive Indrani Mukerjea, who is being tried for allegedly killing her daughter Sheena Bora, has said that an inmate of Byculla jail recently informed her that Sheena was alive and residing in Jammu and Kashmir’s Srinagar. The 49-year-old has written to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) with a request to investigate the claim. Mukerjea, 49, claimed in the letter that on November 25 she met a woman police officer, who was recently lodged in Byculla women’s jail where Mujerjea is lodged, and the woman officer informed her that Sheena was alive and she was in Srinagar. On November 27, Indrani sent the letter to CBI Director in Delhi.Mukerjea’s lawyer, Sana Khan said the government official informed Indrani that when she was on vacation in Srinagar she had met Sheena, and Indrani wants the said aspect to be investigated. The lawyer added that if CBI does not investigate the matter, they will move the court for necessary directions to the agency.According to police, Indrani and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna strangled Sheena Bora, Indrani’s daughter from her previous relationship, on April 24, 2012 in a car in Mumbai. The following day, they disposed of the body in a forested area in Gagode village of Raigad district.The murder came to light after the Khar police arrested Shyamvar Rai, Indrani’s former driver, in another case in August 2015. Indrani was arrested on August 25, 2015 – immediately after the crime came to light, followed by Khanna’s arrest. Peter Mukerjea was arrested on November 19, 2015 after the case was transferred to CBI.A CBI official said the trial is at an advanced stage and several prosecution witnesses have already been examined. The forensic superimposition of the recovered skull has matched with the face of the deceased and the DNA analysis of recovered femur bones and cervical bones concluded that Indrani was the biological mother of the deceased.“So we have lot of evidence that Sheena was killed and so we won’t take cognisance of the application,” said a CBI officer, privy to the trial, which started on February 24, 2017. The case is next scheduled to be heard on December 28 by a special CBI Court, when the plea is likely to be pressed by Indrani’s lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheena-bora-is-alive-claims-indrani-mukerjea-urges-cbi-to-probe-the-claim-101639657066622.html
16-12-2021||India||India, Taiwan in talks on semiconductor hub, free trade and investment pacts||India and Taiwan have begun talks on a free trade pact and creating a semiconductor manufacturing hub in the country as part of efforts to meet the burgeoning demand for the chips needed for products ranging from cellphones to cars. The two sides set up four groups earlier this year that are focusing on creating a semiconductor manufacturing hub, education and training of highly specialised manpower needed for the industry, a bilateral investment agreement and a free trade agreement, two people familiar with the matter said. The contacts on these issues gathered momentum around the middle of this year and the group on semiconductors met twice virtually, in August and September, while there was one round of talks on the proposed trade pact, the people cited above said. Both sides are eyeing the possibility of one of Taiwan’s semiconductor giants, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), setting up a facility in India. The Indian side has proposed several sites for the hub though the two sides are yet to come to a final decision, the people said. “It is a very complicated process because a company like TSMC uses components from hundreds of other firms. Setting up a hub in India means convincing those firms to also set up a facility in India to ensure the supply of components,” one of the people cited above said. If the proposal is finalised, it will be only the second such manufacturing hub set up in a foreign country by a Taiwanese manufacturer. TSMC, which has a market value of more than $550 billion and accounts for about 54% of global revenues from semiconductors, has set up a $12-billion fabrication plant in the US that is expected to start production in 2024. TSMC is also eyeing possible facilities in Japan and Europe. For Taiwan, such investments are linked to strategic gains at a time when China has increased its pressure on the island, stepping up incursions into its air defence zone and taking tensions in the Taiwan Strait to a new high amid threatening talk of an invasion. The Taiwanese decision to create the semiconductor manufacturing hub in the US was seen as closely linked to military support extended by Washington to Taipei. Taiwan is also hoping such moves will translate into greater support for its efforts in other areas, such as a presence at the World Health Organization (WHO). As part of overall efforts to increase trade and investment, Taiwan is also eyeing the possibility of opening a representative office in Mumbai because of the potential for investments and manufacturing in Maharashtra and Gujarat. India and Taiwan established representative offices in each other’s capitals in 1995. A second Taipei Economic and Cultural Center was established in Chennai in 2012. As with most contacts with Taiwan, the Indian side has been proceeding cautiously, largely because of the tensions with China over the military standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). However, India’s rapidly growing need for semiconductors – expected to be around $100 billion by 2025, up from the current level of $2 billion – is the main reason for the government’s push in the field. On Wednesday, the Union cabinet approved a production-linked incentive scheme with an outlay of ₹76,000 crore ($10 billion) for development of a semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem. The government has also committed support of ₹2,30,000 crore ($30 billion) to position India as a global hub for electronics manufacturing, with semiconductors as the foundational block. Sana Hashmi, Taiwan fellow at the Institute of International Relations at the National Chengchi University in Taipei, said advancing economic ties falls in the framework of the unofficial relations between India and Taiwan. “One of the primary objectives of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Delhi and the India-Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei is to work towards strengthening commercial ties,” she said. Hashmi said though China objects to all contacts with Taiwan, there has been an understanding that cooperation on economic and cultural issues and science and technology doesn’t violate adherence to the “One China” policy by other nations. “Seemingly, it was fine for other countries as long as China was reaping the benefits of Taiwanese investments. Now with the growing cross-Strait tensions, Taiwan’s focus has been on pulling out investments from China and reducing its dependence. Cooperation in the semiconductor industry is one of India’s main interests vis-a-vis Taiwan,” she said. “Several agreements are already in place between India and Taiwan. So, another agreement in the economic field doesn’t violate the ‘One China’ policy,” she added.

A total of 45% respondents (parents) hailed from Tier-1 districts, 31% from Tier-2 while 24% of them belonged to Tier-3 and 4 districts as well as rural areas.The survey also revealed that a majority of the parents are worried about Omicron spreading even more rapidly among children in school once the variant of Covid-19 enters the community of a particular district. The parents raised concerns over “limited outdoor air ventilation in most classes and no access to air purifiers and high transmissibility of Omicron,” according to the Local Circles survey.After evaluation of the responses, the survey found that most parents want local authorities not to shut schools till Omicron comes to their district or nearby regions. Meanwhile, 30% of parents want authorities to wait till a non-travel related case of the Covid-19 variant is detected in their district or vicinity.Schools in over 20 states and Union territories (UTs) in India have resumed offline classes, including Mumbai and Pune where schools reopened yesterday and today, respectively.India has so far reported 77 cases of Omicron Covid-19 variant, following Delhi reporting four fresh cases earlier in the day. Notably, Maharashtra accounts for the most number of cases in the country with 32 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-want-schools-to-be-shut-if-multiple-omicron-cases-found-in-area-survey-101639651369195.html

Residents of Bhatoli village panchayat held an unusual auction three months before the Panchayat polls in Ashok Nagar district to choose a candidate for the post of sarpanch, who would win the election unopposed. Heads of all families attended the bidding process held on Tuesday at the Radha-Krishna temple in the village Saubhag Singh Yadav, a resident of Bhatoli made the highest bid of ₹44 lakh. The money, he claimed will be used for the renovation of a temple and also for developmental work needed in the village. Ramesh Lodhi, the outgoing sarpanch of the village said, “In 2009, the villagers had decided on the candidate on condition that he would initiate development work in the village. But in 2015, two candidates contested the polls when I won. A rift was created unnecessarily among villagers, so this time we decided to take an unanimous decision of choosing one candidate for the election so that he could win unopposed.” The villagers have estimated that renovation work of the temple and other small developmental work including construction of a community hall need at least ₹21 lakh so they asked the four candidates who were willing to contest to bid for the post. “Saubhag Singh made the highest bid of ₹44 lakh so we decided that only he would file his nomination for the election this year,” Lodhi said. Saubhag Singh said the candidates spend lakhs of rupees to feed people and distribute liquor to win the election. “The election also creates trouble as villagers begin fighting with each other to support their chosen candidates. To maintain peace in the village, the villagers have taken a unanimous decision. The money is a donation for the temple,” he added. When contacted, Ashok Nagar district collector Uma Maheshwari said she was not aware of the incident but would inquire about the matter.

BJP leader raises doubt after big Bollywood Covid outbreak||After several Bollywood personalities tested positive for Covid-19 in the past few days, after attending a party at director-producer Karan Johar's house, BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Thursday raised doubt over the list of guests who attended Karan Johar's party and asked whether there was any minister at the party. The minister said there is a discrepancy between the statements of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Seema Khan, Sohail Khan's wife. Is it an attempt to hide some names?" the BJP leader asked."As per the information shared by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation officials with me, Seema Khan did not reveal all the names of people who were present at the dinner at Johar's house. I think it was held on December 8. The names she omitted came to light when Kareena Kapoor was contacted by BMC officials for contact tracing.

The present attainments in literacy and numeracy and the variations among states should be the focus for remedial action," Dr Bibek Debroy, Chairman, EAC-PM said during a panel discussion on the report.Giving an example of Kerala, the report suggested that some states that serve as role models too need to learn from other states, including the low performing ones. It stated that Kerala has the best performance in the small state, but can learn from lower-scoring states like Andhra Pradesh (38.50), which outperforms Kerala (36.55) on access to education.The report pointed towards the particularly worse performance of the states on the Governance pillar, with half of the states scoring below the national average. The EAC-PM said in a statement that the pillar-wise analyses help states “assess the state of the budgetary measures and steps needed to improve the state of education and identify existing gaps that obstruct their growth.”The performance of larger states like Rajasthan (25.67), Gujarat (22.28), and Bihar (18.23) was below average while the North-eastern states performed better than the rest as a result of their superior performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-needs-to-learn-from-andhra-pradesh-on-access-to-education-economic-advisory-council-to-pm-101639652524854.html

Asked if he was leaving politics due to any regrets, Sreedharan said that when he joined the BJP in March, he felt the party had good prospects in Kerala but that situation has now changed. “The party will have to do enough to get a foothold in the state. I mentioned that in my report to the party president after the election debacle. I don’t want to discuss those things now,” he said. Also Read: Kerala high court rejects plea questioning re-appointment of Kannur VCAfter the party lost in the assembly polls, in which it even conceded its lone seat at Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram, the central leadership sought a report from Sreedharan, who himself had lost from Palakkad. He was beaten by sitting Congress legsislator Shafi Parambhil in a three-way contest. “My short stint in politics… I am leaving neither disgusted nor contended. You can call it a late entry and an early exit. I will serve the people for the rest of my life through the three bodies that I am associated with,” he said. The BJP’s state unit expressed surprise over his exit from active politics. “We heard about this in the media. He will be around, and we will seek his guidance and advice on key issues,” said BJP state president K Surendran.It was Surendran who had announced that Sreedharan was joining the BJP earlier this year. “He is our CM candidate. His entry has given the party fresh energy and vigour,” Surendran had said at that time.Apart from being fondly called “Metro Man”, Sreedharan also played a key role in establishing the Konkan Railway and rebuilding the Pamban rail bridge in Rameswaram, which was destroyed by a storm in 1964.

The top court was hearing a plea by the Maharashtra government urging a permit to conduct a bullock-cart race.“One country, one race, we need to have uniformity and there has to be one rule. If the races are going on in other states, why should it not be allowed by Maharashtra,” Justice Khanwilkar said, as quoted by Live Law.“It is a traditional sport going on for several years, judgment came — it was stopped, the amendment came — allowed in a regulated manner. If it is a traditional sport and going all across the country except Maharashtra, it does not appeal to common sense,” he observed.The apex court had, in 2014, banned traditional sports like ‘Jallikattu’, bull race and bullock-cart races across the country noting that they were dangerous and violated provisions of the PCA Act. Subsequently, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had amended the law to continue the tradition in a regulated manner, which are under challenge and pending before the Supreme Court since 2018.In February 2018, the top court had referred the pleas related to 'Jallikattu' to a five-judge Constitution Bench which would decide if the bull-taming sport fell under cultural rights or perpetuated cruelty to animals.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-maharashtra-to-resume-traditional-bullock-cart-race-101639650381207.html

According to reports, a jail inmate has told Indrani that Sheena is alive. Indrani has told a few people about this. Indrani's lawyer Sana Raees, however, refused to confirm anything about the content of the letter to ANI. She said she will file an application before the Bombay high court on December 28 and then only she will share the details of the letter that her client has written. Indrani Mukerjea is currently lodged in Byculla jail.Sheena Bora murder case remained the most bone-chilling crime for years after Mumbai Police arrested Shyamvar Rai, Indrani Mukerjea's drive in a different case. Rai confessed to have killed Sheena Bora, Indrani Mukerjea's daughter in 2012. He said Indrani and his ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna were involved in the murder.Indrani Mukerjea was arrested in 2015 and the case was transferred to CBI which thinks Indrani Mukerjea killed Sheena Bora because she disapproved of Sheena Borea's relationship with Rahul Mukerjea, son of Peter Mukerjea, the third husband of Indrani. Rahul is Peter's son from his first marriage. Indrani used to introduce Sheena Bora as her sister and not her daughter. Sheena Bora was Indrani's daughter from her first marriage with Siddartha Das. Indrani did not have any child in her second marriage with Sanjeev, who apparently helped her with Sheena Bora's murder. With Peter, Indrani has a daughter Vidhie Mukerjea, who has recently come up with a book 'Devil's Daughters' recounting her family tragedy.A recap of investigationThe trial in the case started in 2017 and the CBI filed multiple chargesheets in the case. Almost 60 witnesses have recorded their statements in the case. During the trial of the case, Indrani and Peter filed for divorce and was granted in October 2019. Indrani maintained that Sheena has not been murdered and is alive and had gone abroad for her education in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheena-bora-alive-and-in-j-k-what-indrani-mukherjea-writes-to-cbi-101639647790240.html

Congress said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was protecting the Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra, who’s son Ashish Mishra is one among those arrested in the case.Congress also pressed for the sacking of the senior Mishra from his position. Earlier in the day, the party along with other opposition parties demonstrated inside both Houses of Parliament demanding Mishra to step down. Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were initially adjourned till 2pm following continued protests and were later adjourned till Friday.“PM is not taking any action.

While the BJP alleged that the Congress is using Bipin Rawat as a "political tool" ahead of the election in the state, the Congress said that Rahul Gandhi's rally on Thursday was not a political one.

At the same time, the Prime Minister emphasised on the need to adopt natural farming techniques to ensure better produce and longevity of the soil.“There is no doubt that fertilisers led to green revolution. But this is also true that we have to keep working on alternatives. The main reason for this is we have to import fertilisers for other countries, which increases the cost of farming. Hence, there is a need to be aware (about natural farming),” PM Modi said while addressing the National Summit on Agro and Food Processing.He added that farming should be taken out of the chemistry lab and connected with nature’s own laboratory.“Whatever power the fertilisers have can also be found in nature. We just have to explore it,” said PM Modi.He also lauded the address of Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, who gave details about how natural farming has helped farmers increase their produce manifold in recent years. “Natural farming is based on science,” the Prime Minister added.He said that though the world has progressed technologically, it has also been connected to its roots and this should be adopted in farming too.“From seed to soil, you can treat everything in a natural way. Natural farming does not involve spending on fertilisers nor on pesticides. It also requires less irrigation and is capable of dealing with floods and droughts,” said PM Modi.He added that natural farming will help India's farmers become self-reliant.The Prime Minister, in an outreach to farmers, listed the steps being taken by the government.“Along with agriculture, farmers are constantly being connected with many alternative sources of income like animal husbandry, bee keeping, fisheries, solar energy and bio fuel. A provision of lakhs of crores has been made to strengthen storage, cold chain and food processing in villages,” said PM Modi.Addressing the conclave before PM Modi, Gujarat governor talked about how earthworms and natural resources like cattle dung, jaggery and others can lead to increase in the nutritional content of the soil and result in increased crop production. He also gave a glimpse about the process to make manure naturally.The national three-day summit on natural farming commenced on December 14 and is scheduled to conclude on December 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-to-take-agriculture-out-of-chemistry-lab-pm-modi-at-natural-farming-meet-101639639766263.html

What it tells us||DEHRADUN: A 5-km long unnamed glacier in one of the less explored regions in the upper Kali Ganga valley in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh abruptly changed its course and merged with an adjacent glacier named Sumzurkchanki in Kuthi Yankti valley, according to a study by scientists at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.This is the first time that such a change of course has been reported from a Himalayan glacier, said Manish Mehta, a scientist at the institute. The 2-km change in course by the glacier spread across 4km has been attributed to the accumulated influence of both climate and tectonics sometime between the Last Glacial Maxima (19-24,000 years ago) and Holocene (10,000 years ago).A department of science and technology note on the study’s findings on its website said the abnormal behaviour of the unnamed glacier suggests that not only is climate a controlling factor, but tectonics also plays an important role in glacial catchments. “It clearly suggests that the Himalaya is an active mountain range and highly fragile where tectonics and climate play a critical role,” the note said.Mehta, who co-authored a paper in Geosciences Journal on the findings with Rahul Devrani, Khayingshing Luirei, and Vinit Kumar, said sometime between 25000 to 10,000 years ago, the unnamed glacier couldn’t overcome the rocky debris that got collected at its snout. “So when this impediment in the form of rock debris collection stopped the advance of this glacier, it started advancing by taking another direction, offtrack its original path in the valley”, he said He said the unnamed glacier has been affected by the active fault and climate change. “Our studies found that tectonic activity and change in climatic conditions have changed the course and morphology of this glacier. We found that northeast moving glacier has been abruptly truncated and forced to move towards the southeast and ultimately merge with the adjacent glacier named Sumzurkchanki as a result of tectonic forcing”, added Mehta, who led the study based on satellite imagery and old maps. “It is one of the unique behaviours of the glacier, which is for the first time reported from the Himalayan glacier as no such observation has so far been reported on this type of glacier kinematics”.Kuthi Yankti is one of the major tributaries of the Kali Ganga river and has around 88 glaciers covering an area of 130 sq km in its valley. “The unnamed glacier is located in this valley… north of the Sumzurkchanki glacier. The glacier movement is affected by climatic conditions and studies suggest that the region has freeze and thaw cycles that severely affect the weathering of the rock mass and increase in fracture spacing”, he said Mehta said a cross-section and geological map of the valley shows that the glacier is bounded by two active thrusts and traversed by three active faults. “These active thrusts and faults have changed the landscape and have made the whole region more fragile and vulnerable to various surface processes. The rerouting of the secondary glacier is not merely because of surface processes but is due to an active fault that got reactivated in the recent past”, he said. In all, Uttarakhand has around 1,000 to 1,400 glaciers, which can lead to lake outbursts, or lake formation due to the rockfall or landslides in the valleys or on slopes.According to experts, only around 10 or so glaciers are being monitored. The ones that are being studied include the Gangotri glacier, Chorabari glacier, Dunagiri glacier, Dokriyani glacier and Pindari glaciers.Glaciers can lead to devastating flash floods downstream sine they can hold a large quantum of water in their crevices and cavities, and also due to blockage by debris or moraine formation at their snouts. On February 7 this year, breakage of a glacier in Chamoli district led to a flash flood and wreaked havoc downstream, killing 204 people.

16-12-2021||India||NHRC can intervene when rights are violated under AFSPA, says member||SHILLONG: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) can intervene if the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is seen to have been misused but can’t recommend repeal of the law, visiting member of the human rights body Justice (retired) Mahesh Mittal Kumar said on Wednesday. Kumar’s assertion at the end of a two-day camp hearing in Shillong comes against the backdrop of demands to repeal the controversial law following the Nagaland firing incident which claimed over 14 lives on December 4.“If something has been done under AFSPA which was absolutely unwarranted, we will interfere but if you say that we can make recommendations for repealing, that we are not competent,” Justice Kumar said.He, however, urged people to come forward with complaints whenever AFSPA has been misused.To be sure, NHRC has sought a report on the death of civilians in the botched army operation.AFSPA, which grants special powers to the forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas”, has been a contentious issue in the northeast for decades, with civil society members saying it gives security personnel impunity to carry out excesses, and defence forces saying that it helps them maintain order in restive areas.The special law is in force in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur (excluding seven assembly constituencies in Imphal) and parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Under the law, local police need prior approval of the central government to prosecute army or paramilitary forces in civilian courtsChief ministers of Nagaland, Neiphiu Rio, Conrad Sangma of Sikkim and N Biren Singh of Manipur have sought the removal of the law after 14 civilians were shot dead by security personnel during a botched ambush and a subsequent confrontation with local villagers on December 4.The NHRC member underlined that legislation can be challenged before the court of law on two counts – if it violates basic structure of the Constitution and that the legislature was not competent to frame the law.“So, on these two counts, legislation can be challenged before a court of law in the high court or the Supreme Court, so we as NHRC will not be able to tell legislation to repeal this Act,” he added.The camp sitting, or public open hearing of the NHRC, covered matters related to the states of Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura. The sitting is a platform to deliberate upon human rights issues pertinent to the three participating states, provide a platform for all stakeholders to voice their opinion and concerns, and thus help chart a way forward to address these human rights issues collectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-can-intervene-when-rights-are-violated-under-afspa-says-member-101639630063731.html

He also urged political parties to not use his photos or name in their posters. "I'm not going to contest any election and no political party should use my name or photo in their posters," news agency ANI quoted the farm leader as saying.Tikait is the national spokesperson of BKU, a farmers' outfit which is a part of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body under which the farmers had banded together to protest against the three legislations. The laws were enacted by the government in September last year, with an aim to open the agriculture sector to the private players.However, protesters feared that the laws would erode a longstanding mechanism that ensures farmers a minimum guaranteed price for their produce. After the farmers refused to budge from their stand for over a year, the government formally withdrew the laws on November 29. It also sent a letter to farmers promising to form a committee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and acceptance notice of their other demands.Following this, the farmers are now heading back to their respective states in large convoys of tractors and trucks, in the same way, they arrived at the Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri on the outskirts of the national capital a year ago.Tikait also returned to his home in Meerut on Wednesday. The 51-year-old has been leading BKU supporters at the Ghazipur border since November 28 last year.Over the course of the time, Tikait was accused of trying to fuel his political ambitions through the protests.In the past, Tikait served as head constable in Delhi police but quit in 1992-93.He also tried his hand at elections but lost both times. In 2007, Tikait contested the UP Assembly polls from Khatauli constituency in Muzaffarnagar as an independent candidate. In 2014, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Amroha district on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket.Meanwhile, farmers will now hold a review meeting on January 15. "If the government does not fulfill its promises, we could resume our agitation," the SKM had said in its statement.On Wednesday, Tikait expressed his gratitude to people who have been supporting the agitation. I am thankful to everyone who has been with us. I also extend my gratitude to the people who ran langars, villagers who brought essentials for us," he said, according to ANI.Tikait also asserted that the movement has been suspended and "not withdrawn." "Talks underway with the Center after withdrawal of 3 farm laws. Our movement is suspended, not withdrawn," the farmers' leader also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-contest-any-elections-says-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-as-farm-agitation-ends-101639627288085.html

Baidya sought to know about data on crimes against women from last year.The data shows that in 2020, 398,620 persons were arrested in connection with crimes against women, 488,143 were charge-sheeted, and 31,402 were convicted. Also, instances of crimes against women in the cities went down by 8.3% in 2020 over the previous year.Crimes against women include cases of rape, outraging modesty, dowry deaths, harassment, acid attacks, and kidnappings.Among states and Union territories, Uttar Pradesh saw the highest number of such cases, with 49,385, followed by West Bengal (36,439), Rajasthan (34,535), Maharashtra (31,954) and Madhya Pradesh (25,640).According to the NCRB report released in September and cited by the government on Wednesday, “Majority of cases under crimes against women were registered under [the category of] cruelty by husband or his relatives (30.2%), followed by assault on women with intent to outrage modesty (19.7%), kidnapping and abduction of women (19.0%), and rape (7.2%).”Asked about steps taken by the government to swiftly ensure justice to victims of such crimes, the ministry said, “The Central government gives highest priority to ensuring safety and security of women and has undertaken various legislative and schematic interventions in this regard.” It also pointed out that police and public order are state subjects.The ministry said the government has put in place what is called “Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences”, an online analytic tool for monitoring probes. Separately, a national database of sexual offenders has been created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-370-000-cases-of-crimes-against-women-reported-in-2020-says-govt-101639625323320.html

16-12-2021||India||Delhi Police allows traffic movement at Singhu border||After over a year, the Delhi Police on Wednesday allowed traffic movement as well as opened two carriageways at Singhu border after it dismantled all the barricades that were erected to prevent the protesting farmers from moving towards the national capital.“It has been decided that Singhu border be opened from Delhi side also. It has been opened for all vehicles,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer north) Brijesh Yadav said. The Singhu Border on Delhi-Chandigarh highway had been the epicentre of the farmers' movement against the three central farm laws.Farmers started leaving the protest site on the Delhi-Haryana border on Saturday after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) suspended the agitation following the repeal of the farm laws and the government conceding to its other demands.“Only one part of the road was opened. The traffic was opened only for smaller vehicles such as bikes as the road needs to be repaired at many parts which has been damaged due to the protest. It is high time the authorities repair the stretch soon and open the traffic properly,” Jitin Dabas, a resident of Singhu village said.A commuter, Ashwani Tiwari, however, said it was a welcome move for those travelling to Haryana and Punjab. “One had to make a detour to reach Haryana and Punjab. Even if one wanted to go to Murthal, one had to take peripheral highways. Opening of traffic on the stretch will now save time and money of commuters,” Tiwari, a resident of Azadpur, said.Besides the Singhu border, farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, had laid siege to Delhi's Tikri and Ghazipur borders on November 26 last year.The roads have already been cleared for commuters at the Tikri border and traffic is plying on the stretch, police said.However, the traffic is yet to be started at Ghazipur border. A senior police officer said that the road is still close for the traffic movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-allows-traffic-movement-at-singhu-border-101639618878770.html

There are nine lakh employees in public sector banks and all of them are expected to take part in the nationwide strike.The two-day strike on December 16 and 17 has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) to protest against the government's move to privatise two public sector lenders.UFBU is an umbrella body of nine unions, including AIBOC, All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW).Most of the banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), have already cautioned their customers about the strike's possible impact on banking operations like cheque clearance and fund transfer.A meeting was held between bank unions and the government on Wednesday, but no breakthrough could be reached after which the plan to go ahead with the strike was executed, All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC) General Secretary Soumya Datta said."We reiterated our stand that if the government would assure that the Bank Privatisation Bill (Banking Laws Amendment Bill, 2021) would not be tabled during this session of the Parliament, we would be inclined to reconsider the strike but the government could not give any such assurance to us," AIBEA General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.The government had in Budget 2021-22 announced its intent to take up privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) in this year.UFBU's Maharashtra unit convenor Devidas Tuljapurkar claimed that if public sector banks are privatised, then bank branches in rural and backward regions will be closed and implementation of all the government schemes meant for socially and economically weaker sections will get affected.In Maharashtra alone, around 60,000 bank staffers will go on strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-sector-banks-to-go-on-strike-from-today-know-what-services-will-be-hit-101639617734907.html

She had visited India in September last year primarily to attend a ceremony in Ambala that was held to induct the first batch of five Rafale jets into the Indian Air Force.In 2016, India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft for ₹59,000 crore.The ties between India and France are on an upswing in the last few years with cooperation witnessing a significant expansion in key areas.The areas of defence and security, civil nuclear cooperation and trade and investment constitute the principal pillars of the Indo-French strategic partnership.In addition, India and France are increasingly engaged in new areas of cooperation such as in the Indian Ocean region, climate change and sustainable growth and development.The two countries share a close degree of convergence on a range of regional and global issues as well including ways to deal with terrorism and extremism.It will be the first high-level visit from France to India after Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) announced a security partnership in September.The AUKUS security will facilitate Australia getting technology to build nuclear-powered submarines.France reacted angrily to the formation of the new alliance as it resulted in Paris effectively losing a multi-billion dollar deal to build 12 conventional submarines for Australia. France is also upset over its exclusion from the alliance.In October, India and France agreed to strengthen the defence and security partnership by enhancing intelligence and information sharing, bolstering mutual capabilities, and pursuing new initiatives in maritime, space and cyber domains.The two countries resolved to expand the defence ties at a meeting of India-France strategic dialogue in Paris that was co-chaired by NSA Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne, the Diplomatic Advisor to French President Emmanuel Macron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-defence-minister-florence-parly-to-arrive-in-india-today-101639616345520.html

16-12-2021||India||'Khela Hobe' in 2024; BJP will be defeated across India: Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed on Wednesday that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be defeated in the next Lok Sabha elections due in 2024. She talked about the Trinamool Congress’ win in West Bengal Assembly elections and asserted that the saffron party will receive similar drubbing at the national level."During the assembly polls, we have seen the campaign that the BJP had unleashed in the state. Everybody was afraid of it. But the people of the state defeated them. Bengal is a place of communal harmony. What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow. We will defeat the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. It will meet the same fate as it had faced in the last assembly polls," the Trinamool Congress chief said while campaigning for December 19 Kolkata Municipal election (KMC).Read HT Opinion: Is Mamata Banerjee punching above her weight?"I want to see the BJP lose across the country in the 2024 elections. It will be Khela Hobey (game on) again," she further said in the rally at Phoolbagan in Kolkata.This was Banerjee’s first public function after her return from two-day Goa visit. The chief minister said that her sole aim after returning to power for the third consecutive term in the state is to bring industry and generate jobs.Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is trying to expand its footprint nationally. Apart from Goa, the party is also focusing on Tripura, where it engaged in a bitter battle with the BJP in the recently-held municipal elections.Assembly elections in Goa and Tripura are due in 2022 and 2023 respectively.Also Read | ‘Don’t need character certificate from BJP', Mamata says in GoaThe BJP, however, dismissed the claims made by Banerjee about the next General Elections. “She had said similar things in 2014 and in 2019 and all of us have seen the results,” said BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar.The Trinamool Congress had swept the assembly elections held during the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) earlier this year. Banerjee’s party scored a hat-trick, bagging 213 of the 294 seats, and dented the BJP’s hopes of getting a foothold on India’s eastern coast.The BJP, however, recorded its best-ever performance in an assembly election by winning 77 seats and 38.1 per cent vote share. However, it suffered reverses compared to its 2019 Lok Sabha performance when it won 121 seats with a vote share of 40 per cent.In the by-polls held in October, the Trinamool Congress again gave jolt to the BJP by winning all the three seats - Bhabanipur, Jangipur and Samserganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khela-hobe-in-2024-bjp-will-be-defeated-across-india-mamata-banerjee-101639614289892.html

16-12-2021||India||SC asks states to publicise Covid ex gratia scheme||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked all states and Union territories (UTs) to give wide publicity to the Covid ex gratia payout scheme, observing that it is the duty of every welfare state to ascertain benefit reaches all eligible people.“We are here to only see people who have already suffered, don’t suffer anymore...as a welfare state, should worry if the number of applications and claims go up because of wide publicity on ex-gratia. Every welfare state should give benefit to a maximum number of people who have suffered,” a bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed.The bench was taking stock of claims received by states and UTs and distribution of the ex-gratia amount of ₹50,000 each to applicants who lost a family member to Covid-19.The one-time compensation is being disbursed according to the Supreme Court’s orders on June 30 and October 4, which detailed guidelines for disbursal of compensation. The norms are more accommodating than the stricter standards to determine Covid-19 deaths adopted by government-appointed death audit panels.On Wednesday, the bench expressed its displeasure at the slow disbursal of compensation by the Maharashtra government, which reported about 140,000 deaths. “Of 85,000 applications received as of December 9, approximately 1,658 claims have been allowed and payment made. It is very unfortunate,” stated the court, as it directed the state government to clear all claims within 10 days.The bench also asked the Uttar Pradesh government, represented through its additional advocate general Ardhendumauli K Prasad, to get the state to publish proper advertisements in the newspapers and on TV channels about the online portal for processing the ex gratia claims, besides publicising the helpline numbers.It expressed satisfaction at the publicity given by the Gujarat government, which advertised the scheme in almost all daily newspapers of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-states-to-publicise-covid-ex-gratia-scheme-101639600495735.html
16-12-2021||India||To strengthen its base in Andhra, BJP to host massive rally in Vijayawada on Dec 28||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to hold a massive public meeting at Vijayawada on December 28 as part of its efforts to strengthen its base in Andhra Pradesh, where it has hardly been a major force.A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of the recently formed 13-member core committee of the state BJP at the residence of Union minister of state for external affairs V Muralidharan in New Delhi late on Tuesday night. He is also the BJP in-charge of Andhra Pradesh affairs.A senior BJP leader familiar with the development said the four-hour-long meeting which went past midnight, decided that the party will go all out against the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh, expose its failures, mishandling of the state finances, alleged anarchy by the ruling YSR Congress party and blatant attacks on political rivals.“Hitherto, the party has been adopting some kind of nonchalant attitude towards Andhra Pradesh. But it is time the party takes up an aggressive stand against the government and gain the confidence of the people in the next two and a half years,” the party leader said.He said there had been an apprehension among the people that the BJP had been going soft towards the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh, as chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had been extending cooperation to the Narendra Modi government at the Centre on various issues.“But the core committee decided to put an end to this misinformation campaign. The public meeting at Vijayawada will set the tone for the party’s agenda in the coming days,” he said.The core committee decided to invite a big national BJP leader – Rajnath Singh, or Nitin Gadkari, or Amit Shah or JP Nadda – for the public meeting, which would galvanise the cadres and bring seriousness to the party’s action plan.“A sub-committee would be appointed to make arrangements for the public meeting on December 28 and take necessary permission from the authorities,” the party leader said.The core committee also decided to prepare a comprehensive report on the alleged police excesses against the political rivals of the ruling party and submit a report to the Union home ministry along with evidence.It was decided that the party should focus on attracting youth both in urban and rural areas and entrust them with key responsibilities. The party would also focus on strengthening its social media network in Andhra Pradesh to attract the new generation.The BJP, which had never taken up any major programme in the last two and half years, recently took up a big rally in Nellore district extending solidarity with the farmers of Amaravati who had been on their padayatra (foot march) against the formation of three capitals for Andhra Pradesh.For the first time, the BJP leaders openly extended their support for the retention of the capital city at Amaravati. “In the coming days, there will be more programmes from the party in the form of rallies, dharnas, rasta rokos and other forms of protest against the Jagan government,” the BJP leader quoted above said.
16-12-2021||India||Odisha seeks special dispensation from Centre to catch up with frontline states||Bhubaneswar: Stressing that Odisha was burdened with infrastructural gaps and vulnerability to recurring natural calamities, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday told a visiting team of NITI Aayog, the central government’s think tank, led by its vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar that it needs a special dispensation from the Centre to catch up with the frontline states.Patnaik said Odisha has made substantial improvement in the last two decades both in macroeconomic indicators and socio-economic indicators, and that the state’s development interventions have been successful in combating Left Wing Extremism, mobilisation and economic empowerment of nearly 70 lakh women through Self Help Groups.But he added that Odisha has faced 16 natural calamities in the past 11 years causing devastation to public and private properties worth more than ₹35,000 crore for which it needs special assistance. Though Odisha has been seeking special focus tag like for north eastern and Himalayan states citing the state’s vulnerability to calamities, it is the first time that he raised the demand for a special dispensation from the Centre.Wednesday’s demand for special dispensartion was a marked departure from earlier demands of special focus state in which the sharing pattern between Centre and Odisha would be 90:10 for three years in the aftermath of a natural calamity. During the interaction with the NITI Aayog vice-chairman, Patnaik said Odisha has its our own health scheme for cashless treatment in empanelled hospitals with wider coverage to reduce out of pocket health expenditure. “We are the third-largest contributor to PDS rice pool of the country. We have pioneered a conditional cash transfer system for pregnant women and lactating mothers. We have invested heavily for infrastructure development and has become an attractive investment destination in manufacturing and mining Industries,” he said.Kumar congratulated Patnaik for the increase in the state’s per capita income, improvement in agriculture and mining along with managing the fiscal deficit below five percent. He also advised the state to improve its mining production and proposed that Odisha sets up a Sustainable Development Goals Monitoring Unit. He also offered to partner with Odisha for developing a state-specific development blueprint for the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-seeks-special-dispensation-from-centre-to-catch-up-with-frontline-states-101639598018664.html
16-12-2021||India||Kerala’s ambitious unisex uniform plan in schools runs into rough weather||With the idea of gender neutral uniforms in schools gaining momentum in Kerala, a section of the Muslim community has begun opposing it accusing the Left Front government of forcing a modern dress concept on school children. Protests erupted when more than a dozen schools in the state shifted to the gender neutral uniform and the government pledged support to the new initiative. Many women’s outfits have also lauded the new initiative saying it will help bridge gender gap. A protest rally was held under the aegis of the Muslim Co-ordination Committee in Balussery in Kozhikode district on Wednesday. The government higher secondary school in Balussery had made a unisex dress, pant and shirt, for both boys and girls part of their uniform from Wednesday. The new uniform pattern was introduced in higher classes, class 10 onwards and state higher education minister R Bindu inaugurated the event. “It is a welcome move. At a time when the world is heralding an age of gender justice and equality such steps will give right direction to bridge the gender gap,” said the minister lauding students who welcomed the new initiative with open arms. She said people who love children will not oppose such a progressive step. “When we start a new move opposition is natural. But the government will whole-heartedly support such initiatives,” she said. But protestors said the new rule infringe upon girl students’ right to wear what they wish. Interestingly, not a single woman was there in the protest and many girl students came out to say that they are comfortable with the unisex dress. “It is a welcome initiative and will help boost confidence of girl children. Orthodox sections have no right to dictate terms,” said women’s rights activist Viji Palothodi who fought a valiant battle for the right to sit for sales girls while on duty. Protestors, however, insisted that the move was anti-democratic and an encroachment on women’s right to wear anything they wished. But many girl students said orthodox sections were wary that the new system will hinder the Arab dress culture of burqua (veil) which is quite prevalent in many Muslim-dominated areas in the state. “They are pushing us to use the veil and they fear their hold will vanish. This is a decent dress and girls can cover their head also,” said a Muslim student. School principal R Indu said a decision was taken after consulting parents and other stake holders. She said students who want to wear a shawl or muffler due to religious reasons are allowed and there is no compulsion on the part of the school and asked all to support the new initiative. “In higher classes there are around 200 girls and 60 boy students. Some of the girls are forced to wear pant and shirt. There was no discussion before introducing such a system. It is part of imposing liberal ideologies on students,” a spokesperson of the Muslim co-ordination committee said. An umbrella organization, many outfits including the Muslim Students Federation, youth wing of the Muslim League, is part of it. He said his organization will extend the protest to other parts of the state if the government insisted on the move. A school in Ernakulam district, Valayanchirangara government school, was a pioneer in unisex uniforms-- in 2017 it introduced three-fourths for all children and it is doing well till date. 
16-12-2021||India||Madras high court asks CBI to probe Koreans’ escape from Tamil Nadu police custody||The Madras high court has ordered a CBI investigation into the escape of two South Korean nationals from the custody of Tamil Nadu police, according to news agencies. A division bench consisting of justices PN Prakash and R Hemalatha issued the orders on Monday in an oral observation when the duo’s habeas corpus petition came up for hearing. Choe Jae Won (42) and Choi Yong Suk (47), the general manager and managing director, respectively, of Chowel India Private Limited and residents of Kancheepuram district were arrested in June 2019 on charges of GST fraud to the tune of ₹40 crore under Section 69 of CGST Act, 2017. They were lodged at the Puzhal Central Prison and in November they were sent to the Foreigners Detention Camp in Trichy district. In April 2020 the duo filed a petition in the high court to allow them to stay in their Oragadam residence in Kancheepuram due to the Covid-19 pandemic on the grounds that, the authorities in the Trichy camp had not taken proper measures of spraying any disinfectant and that social distancing was not properly maintained there. Though the high court rejected their petition, the Supreme Court allowed them to be detained in their own residence under police security for which they had to pay monthly costs as incurred by the state. The state government on Monday informed the court that the two have escaped house arrest and suspect that they used forged documents to flee to South Korea via Manipur last month. The court has directed the CBI to conduct an inquiry into the incidents and produce a preliminary investigation report by January 25, 2022, according to news agencies. The Chowel India Private Limited is engaged in the business of manufacturing Cowl bar, bumper and seat frames used in motor vehicles. The allegation against the Company is that it collected GST from their buyers, and has not remitted the same to the Government of India, since August 2017. 
16-12-2021||India||Kerala high court rejects plea against reappointment of V-C of Kannur varsity||The Kerala high court on Wednesday rejected a plea questioning the reappointment of Dr Gopinath Raveendran as the Kannur University vice-chancellor, bringing relief for the state government. His reappointment was one of the reasons for the recent tiff between the state government and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan. The governor had sent a strongly-worded letter to the CM, saying he was forced to make certain appointments including that of Kannur VC. Raveendran was reappointed as the VC on November 23, the day his first term ended. The plea challenging the reappointment was moved by university senate member Ramachandran Keezoth and two others. They pleaded that the reappointment was against the norms of the University Grants Commission and that Raveendran has crossed the permissible age of 60 years. They also contended that it was done in spite of some appointments made by the VC flouting norms. But Justice Amit Rawal dismissed the plea, observing that all records produced before the court show that norms were place. Though the petition was filed last month, the court refused to entertain the petitioner’s bid to file a fresh affidavit in view of the raging controversy between the government and the governor. Petitioners said they will move the division bench against the single-judge verdict. State higher education minister R Bindu welcomed the HC verdict. Her two letters to the governor were leaked out recently in which she asked Khan to reappoint Raveendran and do away with the search committee for the new VC. The Opposition has been demanding her resignation, saying she put pressure on the governor to reappoint Raveendran. The governor had sent a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on December 8 in which Khan said he was pained over “dipping standard” of the higher education sector and blamed “brazen political interference” as the reason for this. The governor also asked the government to take up the chancellor’s post if political interference continued, asserting that he can’t bend further. The chief minister on Sunday asked the governor not to take any action in a hurry, but Khan refused to budge. According to political observers, the real trigger for the governor-government tiff was the reappointment of Raveendran. He was reappointed for a period of four years after the government issued a notification and appointed a selection committee to select the new VC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-rejects-plea-against-reappointment-of-v-c-of-kannur-varsity-101639596698425.html

On Monday, the Lieutenant General facilitated the villagers and rescue personnel. Two villagers, Krishnasamy and Chandrakumar, who first witnessed the crash were handed over a cash award of ₹5,000 each. The villagers rushed with water in their pots to put out the fire from the chopper. Their blankets were used to carry the injured army personnel. They also informed the fire services and police immediately. General Arun on Sunday wrote to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin to thank him for the help rendered by the state government to the armed forces in handling the situation. “Such support will encourage youngsters to join the army in the future in the interests of the nation. Your actions have sent a message to soldiers that the Tamil Nadu government supports them,” the officer said in a letter which was released by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-treatment-for-villagers-who-helped-in-coonoor-rescue-operation-army-101639596641288.html
16-12-2021||India||Muslim outfits oppose Kerala’s unisex school uniform||A section of the Muslim community in Kozhikode district took out a protest rally on Wednesday against gender-neutral uniforms in schools, accusing the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government of “forcing modern dress concept on school children”. A protest rally was held under the aegis of the Muslim Co-ordination Committee in Balussery in Kozhikode after a government higher secondary school in the area began unisex uniform system (pants and shirts). The new uniform pattern was introduced in higher classes, class 10 onwards, and state higher education minister R Bindu inaugurated the event. “In higher classes, there are around 200 girls and 60 boy students. Some of the girls are forced to wear pants and shirts. There was no discussion before introducing such a system. It is part of imposing liberal ideologies on students,” a spokesperson of the Muslim coordination committee said. Many others outfits, including the Muslim Students Federation, the youth wing of the Muslim League, took part in the protest rally. No women took part in the protest. The spokesperson also said his organization would extend the protest to other parts of the state if the government insisted on continuing the new system. Protestors said the new rule infringes upon girl students’ right to wear what they wish. They also insisted that the move was anti-democratic and encroached on women’s right to wear anything they like. However, Muslim students said the orthodox sections of the community were varied that the new system will hinder the Arab dress culture of burqua (veil), prevalent in schools across many Muslim-dominated areas in the state. “They are pushing us to veil, and they fear their hold will vanish. This is a decent dress, and girls can cover their head also,” said a Muslim student who didn’t wish to be named.“It is a welcome initiative and will help boost the confidence of girl children. Orthodox sections have no right to dictate,” said women rights activist Viji Palothodi, who fought for the right to sit for sales girls while on duty. The government, on its party, has pledged all support to the initiative. Many women outfits have also lauded the move, saying it will help bridge the gender gap. “It is a welcome move. At a time when the world is heralding an age of gender justice and equality, such steps will give the right direction to bridge the gender gap,” said the higher education minister Bindu, lauding students who welcomed the new initiative with open arms. She said people who love children would not oppose such a progressive step. “When we start a new move opposition is natural. But the government will whole-heartedly support such initiatives,” she added. School principal R Indu said a decision was taken after consulting parents and other stakeholders. She said the students who want to wear a shawl or muffler due to religious reasons are allowed, and there is no compulsion on the part of the school and asked all to support the new initiative and dump narrow concern. A school in Ernakulam district, Valayanchirangara government school, started the unisex uniform system in the state in 2017. It introduced three-fourths for all children.People often call it the ‘three-fourth revolution’.
16-12-2021||India||BJP eyes Vijayawada to strengthen base in Andhra Pradesh||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to hold a massive public meeting at Vijayawada on December 28 as part of its efforts to strengthen its base in Andhra Pradesh, where it has hardly been a major force. A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of the recently formed 13-member core committee of the state BJP at the residence of union minister of state for external affairs V Muralidharan in New Delhi on Tuesday night. He is also the BJP Andhra Pradesh in charge. A senior BJP leader familiar with the development said the four-hour-long meeting which went past midnight, decided that the party has decided to go all out against the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh, expose its failures, mishandling of the state finances, alleged anarchy by the ruling YSR Congress and blatant attacks on political rivals. “Hitherto, the party has been adopting some kind of nonchalant attitude towards Andhra Pradesh. But it is time the party takes up an aggressive stand against the government and gain the confidence of the people in the next two and a half years,” the party leader said. He said there had been an apprehension among the people that the BJP had been going soft towards the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh as chief minister Reddy had been extending cooperation to the Narendra Modi government at the Centre on various issues. “But the core committee decided to put an end to this misinformation campaign. The public meeting at Vijayawada will set the tone for the party’s agenda in the coming days,” he said. The core committee decided to invite a top national BJP leader – Rajnath Singh or Nitin Gadkari or Amit Shah or JP Nadda – for the public meeting, which would galvanise the cadres and bring seriousness to the party’s action plan. “A sub-committee would be appointed to make arrangements for the public meeting on December 28 and take necessary permission from the authorities,” the party leader said. The core committee also decided to prepare a comprehensive report on the alleged police excesses against the political rivals of the ruling party and submit a report to the Union home ministry along with evidences. It was decided that the party should focus on attracting youth both in urban and rural areas and entrust them with key responsibilities. The party would also focus on strengthening its social media network in Andhra Pradesh to attract the new generation. The BJP, which had never taken up any major programme in the last two and half years, recently took up a big rally in Nellore district extending solidarity with the farmers of Amaravati who had been on their padayatra (foot march) against the formation of three capitals for Andhra Pradesh. For the first time, the BJP leaders openly extended their support for the retention of the capital city at Amaravati. “In the coming days, there would be more programmes from the party in the form of rallies, dharnas, rasta rokos and other forms of protest against the Jagan government,” the BJP leader quoted above said.
16-12-2021||India||Telangana reports 2 cases of Omicron variant||Telangana reported its first cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19 with samples of two African nationals, who came to Hyderabad on December 12, turning positive for the variant, state director of health G Srinivasa Rao announced on Wednesday.Rao told reporters that two passengers – one 24-year-old woman from Kenya and another 23-year-old man from Somalia tested positive for Covid-19 on their arrival on December 12.“Their samples were sent to the laboratory of Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology for genome sequencing and their results were announced on Tuesday night. Both of them were found to be positive for the Omicron variant,” the health director told reporters.The woman passenger, who was found to be staying at Tolichowki area, was immediately shifted to Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS). “We have also collected the swab samples of all her contacts, including family members and kept them in isolation,” he said.Similarly, the address of the 23-year-old man from Somalia was identified as Mehdipatnam and efforts were made to shift him to the TIMS soon, besides conducting tests on his contacts. “However, both the passengers have very mild symptoms and there is nothing to panic. They are safe,” Rao said.The health director said a seven-year-old boy who also landed in the Hyderabad airport in an international flight along with the family on the same day, was also tested positive for Omicron.“But the family did not enter the city. It took a connecting domestic flight to Kolkata immediately. Before leaving, the boy gave the throat swab samples for testing and it turned out to be positive for the Omicron variant. We informed the West Bengal government about the same. So at present, Telangana has only two Omicron cases,” he said.The director said it was decided to step up testing of people coming from even non-risk countries. “We are also increasing the vaccination programme on war footing. So far. 41.92 million vaccine doses were administered by Tuesday evening and 97 per cent of the people had received their first dose of vaccination,” he said.Stating that the Telangana government was fully prepared to tackle the third wave of Covid-19, Rao sounded a note of caution about the Omicron variant. “This variant spreads very fast and even through air and the cases are expected to double within a span of two days, unless people take enough precautions,” he said.However, there was no need for the people to panic, as the symptoms of Omicron are not dangerous. “Even those who have taken two doses of vaccination must be cautious and take all precautions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-reports-2-cases-of-omicron-variant-101639596581727.html
16-12-2021||India||Nigerian man is Tamil Nadu’s first Omicron patient||Tamil Nadu’s first patient with the Omicron variant was confirmed on Thursday night. A 47-year-old man, who had travelled from Nigeria via Doha to Chennai, was found positive for the Covid variant. “He was double vaccinated and he is stable,” health minister M Subramanian told a press conference. Seven of the patient’s family members, including a 16-year-old child and one co-passenger who travelled with the patient from Doha, have all tested positive for Covid-19. Their samples were sent for genome testing and results are awaited. “All eight of them have shown S Gene drop. All of them have a mild infection,” Subramanian said. The co-passenger is a resident of Chennai. They are being treated at Chennai’s King Institute. “There is fear that the eight of them could have Omicron.” Tamil Nadu has made elaborate arrangements for surveillance of the Omicron variant. On November 29, the state decided to use Thermo Fischer TaqPath Assay at 12 RT-PCR government labs to detect the S gene drop, which is a marker of probable Omicron as per the recommendations of the WHO. The four international airports in Tamil Nadu are conducting RT-PCR tests for passengers from high-risk countries on arrival. They cannot leave the airport until the results are released so airports have been asked to make arrangements for the comfort of passengers. If they are positive, they will be sent to government hospitals and if they test negative, they have to quarantine at home for a week and repeat and RT-PCR test on the eighth day. The samples are being sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for genome sequencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nigerian-man-is-tamil-nadu-s-first-omicron-patient-101639596578373.html
16-12-2021||India||DVAC raids 69 premises linked to ex-Tamil Nadu minister||The directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) has filed a case against former Tamil Nadu electricity minister and AIADMK legislator P Thangamani on charges of amassing wealth worth ₹48.5 crore, disproportionate to his income sources. DVAC sleuths raided 69 places across the three southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday. “Further, there is reliable information that they have invested huge amounts from the ill-gotten money in crypto assets,” the FIR says. After the DMK came to power in May, Thangamani became the fifth former AIADMK minister to be raided by the DVAC. Former ministers and heavyweight AIADMK leaders MR Vijayabhaskar, SP Velumani, KC Veeramani and C Vijayabaskar were earlier raided by the DVAC. The DMK, while in opposition, last year submitted a list of graft charges against half a dozen ministers. The party had also promised to constitute a special court to try all such cases in their election manifesto. Thangamani, 60, held various portfolios from 2011 to 2021 during the 10-year AIADMK rule. After Edappadi Palaniswami assumed office as chief minister in 2017 after J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, Thangamani became a powerful minister in his cabinet. In the FIR, DVAC said the case relates to amassing of wealth to the tune of ₹48572,019 during the period between May 2016 and March 2020. Thangamani is the MLA of Kumarapalayam assembly constituency in Namakkal district in western Tamil Nadu. During the course of the search, an amount of ₹2.37 crore, unaccounted cash of ₹2.16 crore, gold ornaments weighing about 1.13 kg, about 40 kg of silver and other incriminating documents were found. The officials also seized mobile phones, locker keys of several banks, computer hard discs and related documents. The FIR said Thangamani was in possession of movable and immovable assets in his name and in the names of his family members, relatives and others which are “disproportionate to his known sources of income and thereby intentionally enriched himself and his family members, relatives and others illicitly during the period of his office”. A case in Namakkal has been filed against Thangamani, his wife T Santhi and son T Dharanidharan under sections 13(2) read with 13(1) (e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and 109 IPC. It added that Dharanidharan showed business under the name of Murugan Eaarth movers and was used as a cover to the “illegal income” of the former minister and assets acquired by him as a “public servant”. “It is revealed that such a huge business in the name of Murugan Eaarth Movers was only on paper and no actual business was carried,” the FIR stated. It said since the likely savings of Thangamani was about ₹2.60 crore during the check period (May 23, 2016 to March 31, 2020) and hence, the pecuniary resources and properties acquired by him and in the names of his wife and his son should not have exceeded the same. AIADMK leaders condemned the DVAC raids describing it as political vendetta. “This is to divert the attention of people from the poor governance as well as due to the issues within the DMK relating to dynastic politics being adopted by the chief minister and his family,” former chief ministers O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami said in a joint statement. Number of places where searches were conducted across different locations is Namakkal 33, Chennai 14, Erode 8, Salem 4, Coimbatore 2, Karur 2, Krishnagiri 1, Vellore 1, Tiruppur 1, Bangalore 2 and Chittoor 1.
16-12-2021||India||Kerala reports four more Omicron cases||With detection of four more cases on Wednesday, the total number of Omicron-infected people in Kerala has risen to five, state health minister Veena George said. The minister said two of the infected are relatives of the first patient, a UK-returned doctor. Earlier his wife and mother were tested Covid positive and their samples were sent to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the state capital. The minister said two other infected also returned the country recently. Among two, one is a 26-year-old woman arrived from the middle-east and other from Congo in Africa. The minister said condition of all patients stable and there was no need to panic and the state government has taken all steps to curb the spread of the new variant. Struggling with heavy Covid-19 caseload the state was on high alert after new variant was detected in the country last month. For more than six months it has been reporting maximum virus cases in the country and in death rate it is on second spot after Maharashtra. Meanwhile, Kerala reported 4,006 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday after 65,704 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 6.09 per cent. It also reported 37 deaths, taking total fatalities to 43,626.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-four-more-omicron-cases-101639596518588.html
16-12-2021||India||Karnataka: Bill to stop forcible conversions may be tabled in winter session||The proposed bill by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to stop forcible conversions takes shape with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai holding a high-level meeting with his cabinet on Wednesday to help table the bill in the ongoing winter session of the Karnataka legislature. Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka’s minister for home affairs, told Hindustan Times that the proposed bill will be drafted after carefully studying similar legislations in other states to bring in a comprehensive law to stop religious conversions. “Under the Constitution there is a clause that restricts forcible conversions. But there was no penal clause if there were conversions done by force or inducements,” Jnanendra told Hindustan Times on Wednesday. The Bommai government is burning the midnight oil to introduce the bill that augurs well with demands by right-wing groups who consider religious conversions, purportedly by force or inducement, as a threat to its culture and way of life. Since the proposal to introduce the bill in September, civil rights and Christian groups have alleged that there have been targeted attacks on the community. In 11 months, Karnataka reported 39 incidents of hate crimes against the Christian community in Karnataka in 2021, said a report by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) on Tuesday, HT reported. The report listed several right-wing organisations, alleging their role in the attack and it went on to say that two MLAs of the ruling BJP, too, were involved in the attacks. “In two instances of hate crimes in Karwar (October 4) and Mandya (January 25), Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Sunil Kumar and 3-time BJP MLA Narayana Gowda (currently Minister of State for Youth Empowerment and Sports, Planning, Program monitoring, and Statistics) were also named as people who supported the police in targeting Christians,” the report said. The Karnataka government argues that a bill is required to equip the police to stop such conversions but is still unclear on the vigilantism it is likely to fuel. “Once an application to convert is submitted, it will be probed by DC (deputy commissioner) to see if it was done by force or by any promises and only then be given approval. Then the same is informed to all departments and they will lose their religious status and all benefits that come with it,” the home minister said. The bill is an extension of the efforts by the BJP and its ideological parent, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to bring in laws in line with the party’s core thinking, experts say. The BJP government in Karnataka has already implemented the anti-cattle slaughter law and is in the process to bring in amendments to the special marriages act which the Sangh Parivar refers to as ‘love jihad’. The anti-conversion bill also has longer jail terms and more penal provisions to restrict the activity. The proposed bill to stop forcible religious conversions is likely to have clauses of extended jail terms possibly ranging between 3-10 years, the minister said. It will also include stringent checks to ensure there was no use of force or rewards to convert the individual as well as effectively ruling out any possibility of double benefit in reservation categories. The Christian community and other rights activists have called it a tactic by Bommai to deflect attention away from the corruption charges the government currently faces including the Bitcoin scandal in which senior BJP leaders are alleged to have laundered ill-gotten money through cryptocurrencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakabill-to-stop-forcible-conversions-may-be-tabled-in-winter-session-101639596279474.html
16-12-2021||India||After MLC polls, JD(S) faces setback but Gowda kin gains clout||The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) continues to witness a rapid slide in its electoral fortunes, with less than a year-and-a-half left for assembly elections. On Tuesday, the party managed to win just two seats in the MLC elections, whereas its opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, bagged 11 seats each. However, former party members and political experts have pointed out that despite its poor show in the recent elections, the fortune of the first family of the JD(S), headed by former prime minister HD Deve Gowda, appears to be thriving, albeit at the cost of the party.Suraj Revanna, the third grandson of Gowda and son of the former minister, HD Revanna, emerged victorious in the December 10 MLC polls, making him the eighth member of the family to enter active politics.Suraj’s brother, Prajwal, is the lone JD(S) Lok Sabha member, while his mother is a former Zilla Panchayat president. Revanna’s brother and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy and his wife, Anita, are legislators from Channapatana and Ramanagara, respectively. Their only son, Nikhil, unsuccessfully contested the 2019 parliament elections from Mandya, which was earlier considered a stronghold of the regional outfit.DC Thamanna, the MLA from Maddur is the father-in-law of Gowda’s son HD Ramesh.Thamanna’s daughter, Soumya, has expressed to take her father’s place in the next elections.The constant backing of family over the party has cost the Gowda clan in recent years. Gowda himself faced defeat at the hands of a relatively unknown candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019 when the former prime minister decided to field Prajwal from his home constituency of Hassan and stand in neighbouring Tumakuru.“There is no parliamentary board, executive committee or working committee within the party. Even though Kumaraswamy is the state president of the JD(S), all decisions are taken by him. Earlier it was a family-ruled regional party but has now become just a family party,” Ramesh Babu, ex-MLC with the JD(S), and now a Congress spokesperson told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.Reacting to the decimation of the party in the MLC polls, Kumaraswamy said, “The statement they give about the JD(S), in their parties they are encouraging family politics. Both the BJP and Congress do not have the morality to speak on the JD(S).”There is no denying that the BJP and Congress have their family members in elected roles but which, some argue, has not caused an existential crisis for the party and has had an impact only on the individual leader.Siddaramaiah, the then chief minister in 2018, lost from Chamundeshwari constituency after he decided to vacate his earlier seat Varuna to placate his son Yatindra, who won.The alleged corruption and running of a parallel government by BS Yediyurappa’s son, BY Vijayendra, cost the 78-year-old leader his cherished chief minister seat.When it comes to the JD (S), several legislators like Gubbi Srinivas, GT Deve Gowda and Srinivas Gowda, among others, are looking for a way out. Siddaramaiah, too, was forced out of the JD(S) after he was denied the top post in favour of Kumaraswamy in 2006.Babu said that the JD(S) has no ideology left as Gowda is no longer in charge of party affairs. be sure, the growth of the family in politics has added to troubles within the Gowda household, which is a divided house, with Revanna on one side and Kumaraswamy on the other.Revanna has four members of his immediate family in elected roles, while Kumaraswamy and his wife, both legislators, are trying to bring their actor-son Nikhil into active politics to balance the scales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-mlc-polls-jd-s-faces-setback-but-gowda-kin-gains-clout-101639596278195.html
16-12-2021||India||Surge in Omicron cases likely in January warns Maharashtra govt||With Maharashtra continuing to record new Omicron cases for the fourth straight day, with four more cases of the variant being detected on Wednesday, the state government is expecting a “large” number of Omicron cases in January. The tally of the Omicron variant in the state climbed to 32 on Wednesday. Of the four new cases, two were detected in Osmanabad, while one case each was detected in Mumbai and Buldhana, the state health department said. However, 25 of the total patients have been discharged after negative RT-PCR test reports.Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), told the state cabinet that Maharashtra will see a large number of Omicron cases in January. “Omicron infections are increasing rapidly in the world and patients are also being detected in Maharashtra. These patients can be found not only in big cities but also in small towns. Next month, in January, a large number of people in the state will be infected with Omicron,” Vyas told the cabinet during a presentation on the Covid-19 situation in the state.According to the statement of the health department, all Omicron cases detected on Wednesday had history of foreign travel or were close contacts of ones with international travel history. “Based on preliminary information, patients from Osmanabad travelled to Sharjah, and another patient is his high-risk contact. The patient from Buldhana had travelled to Dubai while the Mumbai patient had travelled to Ireland,” the statement said.The new detections include a minor and at least one senior citizen. Among the four new cases, there are three men and one woman. The infected persons are isolated in a hospital and are asymptomatic. Three of the infected persons have been vaccinated, while one is not eligible for vaccination as the patient is 16-years-old.The state administration is concerned that the new variant has been detected in rural parts of Maharashtra, and not just in urban centres. So far, Omicron cases have been found in eight of the 36 districts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Nagpur, Pune, Latur, Buldhana, and Osmanabad.“So far, the cases are restricted to people with foreign travel or their close contacts. So did the first wave of infections. But soon it spread among other categories of people. Similarly, Omicron is expected to follow the same route, but with a faster pace given its high transmissibility. The bright side in this is that we now know what to do and have a protocol. Tight screenings at the airports and strict contact tracing will help us contain the spread of Omicron as much as possible,” an official from the health department said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed the district and civic administration to push for full vaccination of citizens in the shortest time possible. So far, 12,58,94,156 doses have been administered in the state, according to the CoWin dashboard – the central database of all vaccination information in India. Of them, 4,75,98,808 citizens are fully vaccinated.Even as the state is anticipating a large number of Omicron cases in January, the government is not looking at imposing any curbs or restrictions. However, Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh on Wednesday said that the Mumbai civic body will not give permissions for any major events around Christmas and the New Year. “Looking at the rise in the Omicron cases, no big events will be allowed,” Shaikh, who is the guardian minister of Mumbai City, said. He added that the state government has already issued orders on cap on attendees for indoor and outdoor events, which will be followed.Experts have said that the state government should look to stop all congregations to contain the spread. Subhash Salunkhe, a member of the national Covid task force, said, “Based on these early warning signals, my recommendations to the Government of India and the state governments would be to stop all congregations--political, cultural and social.” Salunkhe was the technical advisor to the state government before becoming a member of the national Covid task force.
16-12-2021||India||Modi urges BJP MPs of southern states to focus on outreach||At a breakfast meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ministers and lawmakers from the southern states on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged them to find simpler ways of improving outreach and connecting with the electorate, keeping in view the changes in the post-Covid world, according to people aware of the details. The PM during Parliament session holds interaction with MPs in batches. According to a party functionary, the PM said there is need to bring a paradigm shift in the way the lawmakers and public representatives build their own image and that of the party. “…For that he said one has to look for ways of identifying sahej sampark (simpler ways of communicating) with the people to improve ties between the party, the government and the people,” said the functionary. The PM also urged them to raise issues of national importance both in and outside Parliament. “The PM spoke to the lawmakers about the work that they do outside of politics. He asked the lawmakers about the social issues they engage in and any projects that they want the party and government to take note of,” said a second person aware of the details. He also told the party MPs and ministers to pay heed to complaints from people and organise free programmes, such as sporting events, for people in their constituencies. “He told them sports economy will emerge as a major focus area so they should encourage sports and fitness and create avenues for training of youth to become sportsmen and women,” said the first functionary. PM Modi had stressed on sports and fitness even at the meeting of the BJP’s parliamentary party meeting last week. 
16-12-2021||India||Opposition meet with Naidu on MPs’ suspension ends on stormy note||A meeting of Opposition leaders with Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday to resolve the impasse over suspension of 12 lawmakers turned into a stormy debate that ended on a bitter note with at least four leaders leaving his chamber abruptly, according to people aware of the matter.The discussions, the people said, entered a rough patch when Opposition leaders -- Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress deputy leader Anand Sharma, the party’s chief whip Jairam Ramesh, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Manoj Kumar Jha -- told Naidu how his predecessors, including Bhairon Singh Sekhawat and Hamid Ansari, used to call all-party meetings to take a collective call to end logjams.As the Opposition leaders appealed to Naidu to take inspiration from his predecessors, the chairman reminded them that there has been “no indication yet of any regret from the suspended MPs”. Government managers, too, have been consistent in their demand that the 12 MPs must express regret for their conduct in the last session that led to their suspension, which has led to the Upper House being in turmoil this session.The Opposition has ruled out any apology and has accused the government of suspending “vocal and important members” of the Opposition from speaking in the House.An official present in Naidu’s meeting, who asked not to be named, said: “The chairman observed that an all-party meeting will be called when it is appropriate. It implied that a meeting would serve no purpose when either the suspended MPs or leaders of their respective parties are not willing to reflect on their conduct and regret the same in an appropriate manner.” The Rajya Sabha chairman also cautioned the Opposition members to not to dictate terms to him.The Congress’s Jairam Ramesh maintained in the meeting that “the very least chairman should be doing is bring all parties on the discussion table”.As the talks were deadlocked, Kharge, Sharma, Jairam, Jha and Raut left the meeting to restart protests in the House. Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar is also expected to meet Naidu in a day or two.Congress leaders Anand Sharma and P Chidambaram served a notice in the House on Wednesday for the termination of the suspension of the 12 MPs, but it was rejected.In the meeting, Naidu told the Opposition leaders that the notice was not in order.“It was not accompanied by the text of the motion to be moved in the House. Naidu added that even if any notice served was in order, he would need time to examine it before deciding on its admission and he can’t be forced either inside or outside the House for a decision on the same,” the official cited above said. Rule 223(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the House requires that every notice in writing shall be addressed to the secretary general and shall be left at the council notice office so as to enable further consideration.“On the contrary, the notice of Sharma and Chidambaram, scribbled on a piece of paper, was given to chairman Naidu in the House when zero hour was in progress, and they demanded immediate action on it,” said a second official on condition of anonymity.Naidu also consulted House officials ahead of his meeting with the Opposition.“The officers pointed out that in the past too, suspensions have never been revoked before the completion of the suspension period without the suspended MPs or their party leaders regretting the conduct,” the second official said. Officials of the Secretariat have reiterated that since the suspension was a decision of the House, its revocation too has to be decided by the House.The meeting between Naidu and the Opposition leaders took place after Congress president Sonia Gandhi met four key Opposition leaders on Tuesday to discuss the impasse.

16-12-2021||India||12 fresh Omicron cases take national tally to 73||Mumbai/ Thiruvananthapuram/Hyderabad/Kolkata/Chennai: A total of 12 new cases of the Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2 were reported across India on Wednesday – four each in Maharashtra and Kerala, two in Telangana, and one each in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal – as the national tally of the heavily mutated variant continued to swell.The new infections detected on Wednesday in Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal were the first Omicron cases in these states, officials said.All the 12 cases detected in the country on Wednesday were all either international travellers or were close contacts of foreign returnees, which means that there does not, currently, seem to be any community transmission of the highly transmissible version of the virus that causes Covid-19.After Wednesday’s cases, the national tally now stands at 73, according to data compiled across states. With 32 confirmed Omicron cases, Maharashtra has the largest Omicron tally in the country. It is followed by Rajasthan with 17 cases of the new variant, Delhi with six such infections, Kerala with five, Gujarat with four, Karnataka three, Telangana two, and one each in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu.One of the new Omicron cases detected on Tuesday was a seven-year-old boy who landed in Hyderabad from Abu Dhabi on December 12, but subsequently took a connecting flight for West Bengal, officials said. He left for a relative’s place in Malda from Kolkata airport. The child’s parents have been placed under isolation and efforts are underway to trace those who came in contact with him, West Bengal health officials said.In Maharashtra, genome sequencing detected four new Omicron cases – one woman and three men – all of whom are asymptomatic, state officials said. According to preliminary information, one patient had travelled to Sharjah and another patient was his high-risk contact. The third case had travelled to Dubai, while the fourth patient had recently visited Ireland, it said. Maharashtra health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas, while making a presentation in the state cabinet, said on Wednesday that Omicron is spreading fast in the world and Maharashtra is likely to see a surge in cases by January.In Telangana, two international traveller – a 24-year-old woman from Kenya and a 23-year-old man from Somalia — tested positive on December 12 after they landed in Hyderabad, state director of health G Srinivasa Rao said. “Their samples were sent to the laboratory for genome sequencing ... Both of them were found to be positive for the Omicron variant,” the health director said. Both of them have mild symptoms, he added.Kerala health minister Veena George said that two of the four new cases in the state were the wife and mother-in-law of the state’s first Omicron case (that was detected on Sunday). Of the remaining two, one was a Thiruvananthapuram resident who had returned from the UK and the other was from Ernakulam who had just come back from Congo, the minister said.Tamil Nadu’s first Omicron patient was a 47-year-old man who had travelled from Nigeria via Doha to Chennai. “He was double vaccinated and he is stable,” health minister M Subramanian said. Seven of the patient’s family members, including a 16-year-old and one co-passenger who travelled with the patient from Doha have all tested positive for Covid-19. Their samples were sent for genome testing and results are awaited.India’s first batch of Omicron cases was reported from Bengaluru on December 2 when two people – a 66-year-old and a 46-year-old male — tested positive for the variant. Since then, 10 other regions have reported cases of the variant.The Union health ministry has issued an advisory to the states to vigorously screen and test all passengers coming in international flights and has extended all Covid restrictions till December 31. The ministry told states to do proper contract tracking of contacts of persons found to be having Omicron.The Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa, has spread to at least 63 countries with one death being reported in UK where the variant is fast spreading. According to World Health Organisation, the Omicron will soon surpass Delta and would become the dominant variant across the globe. Authorities worldwide are racing to determine how contagious the variant is and how effective existing vaccines are against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-fresh-omicron-cases-take-national-tally-to-73-101639594958099.html

All the seven plots are located in Jammu division,” minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai said in a written statement in response to a query by CPI(M) MP Jharna Das Baidya in Rajya Sabha. The government, however, did not provide any details of the purchase which was also sought by the CPI(M) lawmaker.Before repeal of Article 370 and Article 35-A, non-residents could not buy any immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir. However, in a gazette notification in October last year, the Centre omitted the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of the land in the Union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-plots-bought-in-j-k-by-outsiders-all-in-jammucentre-101639594839332.html

If you start using it as weapon against ₹1,000 (money laundering) case, ₹100 case, then what will happen? You cannot put all people behind bars,” it added.“Every case if you want to use, it doesn’t work. This is not the way it works...Such indiscriminate use will affect the value of Act,” the bench told additional solicitor general SV Raju, who represented ED in the two cases.Steel company Usha Martin Limited has moved the top court against an order of the Jharkhand high court in a case relating to export of iron ore fines (IOF). The firm challenged the ED summons issued to it in connection with the criminal proceedings pending against it before a CBI court. After the high court declined to stay the summons, the firm moved the top court.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court issued notice in the matter and granted protection from coercive action to the firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmla-will-lose-its-value-if-used-indiscriminately-says-supreme-court-101639594718000.html
16-12-2021||India||Parliament disrupted as Opposition raises SIT report on Lakhimpur Kheri||Opposition parties launched a massive protest in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, demanding the removal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ after investigators said his son Ashish Mishra and others mowed down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in a “deliberate, pre-planned conspiracy”. In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition continued to protest against the suspension of 12 lawmakers.The disruptions paused the debate on the Omicron variant in the Upper House and delayed the passage of supplementary demand for grants and debates on climate change and price rise in the Lok Sabha. An angry Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Shiv Pratap Shukla, compared protesting MPs with Omicron and called them a ”threat to democracy”.On Wednesday morning, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi along with several Opposition members moved an adjournment motion demanding the removal of Ajay Mishra and a discussion on the special investigation team (SIT) report on the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The Lower House of Parliament was adjourned twice as Opposition parties continued their massive protests.”They are not allowing us to speak, that’s why the House is being disrupted. Their minister is involved in it (Lakhimpur Kheri incident), at least there should be a discussion on the judgment. So, at least a discussion should be allowed, but they don’t want to discuss it,” Gandhi told reporters outside Parliament. Congress’s Lok Sabha chief whip K Suresh moved an adjournment motion demanding Mishra should “step down immediately so that a fair investigation is carried out and justice is served and culprits are brought to book and farmers are delivered justice”. Rashtriya Loktantrik Party MP Hanuman Beniwal, a former BJP ally, also demanded Mishra’s resignation.Opposition parties shouted slogans against the government and disrupted the functioning of the Lower House during Question Hour. Some members even entered the Well of the House and shouted slogans.Leader of the Rajya Sabha and Union minister Piyush Goyal hit out at the Opposition. “The government is willing to consider their request but they have to apologise for attacking lady marshals and the way they behaved with those who were protecting the security of this house,” he said, referring to unruly scenes in the last session of Parliament.“How can they expect that they will attack them and then expect to serve this House? People had given up their lives on December 13 (2001) for this sanctum sanctorum only for these Members of Parliament and they tried to strangulate them. It is a matter of shame that they are not willing to repent for their actions,” Goyal said. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, rejected the allegations. ”We (Opposition leaders) have not done anything like that…There were, in fact, no female marshal present in the house during the incident,” he said.Union minister of parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi said that discussion on Omicron was allowed following a request from Opposition leaders. “Even after that, they do not want to participate in the discussion. Even in the morning they did not allow Question Hour and Zero Hour. In spite of that, we are requesting them and appealing to them to participate in this important discussion,” he said.A UP court on Tuesday added stringent sections of IPC and Arms Act, including attempt to murder, to the FIR against 13 people accused of mowing down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people were killed.
16-12-2021||India||Incentive scheme for RuPay debit card, UPI payment gets approval||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an incentive scheme to promote the use of RuPay debit cards and low value (up to ₹2,000) BHIM-UPI transactions in the country -- in a move aimed at encouraging more people to adopt digital modes of payment.Union I&B minister Anurag Thakur, briefing the media on the Cabinet decision, said the scheme will cost the government ₹1,300 crore.IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who also briefed the media, added that the government will reimburse the transaction charges levied on payments made by people to merchants as part of the so-called merchant discount rate or MDR. The aim is to make more people “move towards digital payments,” he said.The incentive is only for person-to-merchant transactions and not P2P ones that also use the UPI route.Under this scheme, the government will incentivise the acquiring banks by paying a percentage of the value of transactions through RuPay and BHIM-UPI, according to a statement.Vaishnaw said November saw 4.23 billion digital transactions that were together worth almost $100 billion. The government statement added that India has become one of the world’s most efficient payments markets on the back of innovation and support from the government. “The scheme will further spur research and development and innovation in the fintech space and will help the government further deepen digital payments.”Interestingly, last month, Reuters reported, citing US government documents, that Visa executives complained to the US Trade Representative that the Indian government was supporting and promoting RuPay.RuPay is a product of the National Payments Corp of India or NPCI, in which shares are owned by 67 entities, including state-owned and private banks (both domestic and foreign), and payments services companies.This scheme, according to the government statement, will facilitate acquiring banks in building a robust digital payment ecosystem and promoting RuPay Debit card and BHIM-UPI digital transactions, across all sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incentive-scheme-for-rupay-debit-card-upi-transactions-get-cabinet-approval-101639594359422.html

They were brought back in an Indian Air Force plane which landed at Bir Tikendrajit International Airport, Imphal around 11 am on Wednesday.They were identified as Naredra Nongmaijing, 45, Loitongbam Rajkumar, 46, Thokchom Kalasana, 53, Salam Somendra, 34, and Chaoren Rohen, 45. Senior security officials in Imphal didn’t respond to requests for their comments on the reports.On November 13, the PLA and the Manipur Naga Peoples’ Front allegedly killed Assam Rifles Colonel Viplav Tripathi, his wife and son and four jawans of Assam Rifles in an ambush at Churachandpur district of Manipur.

The trial court and the high court were expected to exercise a greater degree of scrutiny, care and circumspection while directing the accused to be hanged till death,” rued the bench.The court acquitted Momin Khan, Jaikam Khan and Sajid. Those killed in the incident were Momin’s parents, his brother, his sister-in-law and her two children. The prosecution had claimed the murders were result of a property dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-exonerates-three-given-death-penalty-for-killing-6-family-members-in-uttar-pradesh-101639594297960.html
16-12-2021||India||SC directs Maha to conduct local body polls without OBC reservation||Local body elections in Maharashtra this year will be held without any reservation for other backward classes (OBCs), held the Supreme Court on Wednesday as it shot down the Maharashtra government’s plea to stay the entire poll process until the empirical data on OBC can be gathered.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar directed the state election commission (SEC) to issue a fresh notification, declaring 567 seats out of a total of 2,100 as general category seats instead of OBC seats. These 567 seats were identified by the SEC in its November 24 notification as OBC seats for election to Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis.In its order on Wednesday, the top court declared SEC’s November 24 notification “non est” (non-existent). “We direct that SEC notification with respect to OBC be treated as non est where elections have been notified, and renotify them as general category seats so that elections can take place as per the law... SEC must issue fresh notification for 27% seats reserved for OBC as general category and initiate election process for these seats along with the remaining seats,” said the court in its order.Noting that the election process for the remaining 73% seats is already underway, the court directed that the counting and declaration of results for all seats would, however, be done simultaneously and on the same day. This will also include bypolls, clarified the bench.On December 6, the court stayed till its further orders the local body poll in Maharashtra on seats reserved for the OBCs, while rebuking the state for introducing 27% reservation for OBCs through an ordinance two months ago without collecting data. Even as it made clear that the poll process for the other seats could continue, the bench restrained the SEC from notifying seats for OBCs for any election, either mid-term or any other general election. This interim order was passed in separate petitions filed by Kisanrao Kundalikrao Gawali, a former MLA, and Rahul Ramesh Wagh, a social worker.Appearing for the state, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi on Wednesday requested the bench to stay the entire poll process for three months during which the commission will complete the exercise of collecting data on OBC representation in local bodies. Senior counsel Dushyant Dave, representing OBC candidate Rahul Wagh, also pleaded that the election should not go on without reservation for OBCs.
16-12-2021||India||Calcutta high court rejects plea seeking stay on Kolkata municipal polls||The Calcutta high court on Wednesday refused to stay elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) due on December 19, but directed the West Bengal government and the state election commission (SEC) to take measures for holding polls in other civic bodies at the earliest and in the least possible number of phases.“...we are of the opinion that the prayer made by the counsel for the petitioner for staying the Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections cannot be accepted and is hereby declined,” said the division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj, while rejecting the plea filed by Bharatiya Janata Party state vice-president Pratap Banerjee. Banerjee’s plea also sought elections in state’s 120-odd municipal corporations and municipalities on a single day.The hearing on the petition ended on December 10, but the court had reserved its order. On December 6, the SEC told the court that municipal elections in the remaining 22 districts (which have 111 municipal bodies) will be held in six to eight phases by May 2022. The SEC and the state government also told the court that dates for the remaining municipal polls could be fixed later, taking into account the spread of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and school board examinations. The bench on Wednesday directed the SEC and the state government to inform the court on a tentative plan for holding the remaining civic elections on the next date of hearing on December 23. “Keeping in view the observations made above, respondent Nos. 2 and 3 (West Bengal government and SEC respectively) are directed to disclose to this court, without any further delay, minimum phases in which the elections for the remaining municipal corporations/municipalities in the state will be held and the tentative time schedule giving earliest dates for holding such elections. We expect that respondent Nos. 2 and 3 will take a decision in this regard keeping in mind their responsibility to uphold democratic principles and to carry out the mandate of the Constitution,” the bench said in its order. The BJP filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking the deployment of central forces during the elections but the apex court asked it to approach the high court. The legal sparring between the two parties bitterly fought state elections, which the TMC won, and violence that followed in which, the BJP claims, many of its supporters were targeted. During the last hearing on December 10, advocates for the petitioner cited Supreme Court judgments and argued that electronic voting machines (EVM) containing voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) are mandatory but these will not be used in the KMC election according to the affidavit earlier filed by the SEC. Senior advocate Jayanta Mitra, who represented the SEC said EVMs given to the state by the Election Commission of India for the municipal polls did not have the provision for VVPAT.“The Honourable Supreme Court had clearly observed that the existing system is not doubted by the court so far as fairness and integrity is concerned but had observed about increasing the machines which are subjected to verification of paper trail to reasonable number. These judgments are not relating to the local bodies elections and in none of these judgments it has been held that the elections should not be held if the VVPATs are not used,” the high court observed. The order further stated: “If the number of machines which are subjected to verification of paper trail can be increased to a reasonable number, it would lead to greater satisfaction amongst not only the political parties but the entire electorate of the country. This is what the court should endeavour and the exercise, therefore, should be to find a viable number of machines that should be subjected to the verification of VVPAT paper trails keeping in mind the infrastructure and the manpower difficulties pointed out by the deputy election commissioner. In this regard, the proximity to the election schedule announced by the ECI must be kept in mind.” Though the court rejected the BJP’s demands, the party’s national vice-president, Dilip Ghosh, said the legal exercise was necessary. “People of Bengal have to move the court for everything because they have no other option. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) never allows free and fair elections,” Ghosh said. TMC leader and state transport minister Firhad Hakim welcomed the court’s order. “The BJP moved the court because it knows it will not win a single seat in Kolkata.” With the polls barely four days away, the TMC announced that chief minister Mamata Banerjee would campaign for the candidates in east Kolkata on Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-high-court-rejects-plea-seeking-stay-on-kolkata-municipal-polls-101639594059937.html
16-12-2021||India||Kolkata’s Durga Puja gets UNESCO heritage tag||The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Wednesday inscribed “Durga Puja in Kolkata” on the “Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity”. “Durga Puja in Kolkata has just been inscribed on the #IntangibleHeritage list. Congratulations #India,” the UN agency tweeted along with a photograph of an idol of the goddess. According to UNESCO, the festival was the only Indian one to make it to its list of 20 events and traditional activities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the UN agency’s decision as a “matter of great pride and joy for every Indian”.“A matter of great pride and joy for every Indian! Durga Puja highlights the best of our traditions and ethos. And, Kolkata’s Durga Puja is an experience everyone must have,” Modi posted on Twitter.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said it was a proud moment for Bengal. “Proud moment for Bengal! To every #Bengali across the world, Durga Puja is much more than a festival, it is an emotion that unites everyone. And now, #DurgaPuja has been added to the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. We are all beaming with joy!” she tweeted. In its website, the UN agency said that the festival is “seen as the best instance of the public performance of religion and art, and as a thriving ground for collaborative artists and designers”. “The festival is characterized by large-scale installations and pavilions in urban areas, as well as by traditional Bengali drumming and veneration of the goddess. During the event, the divides of class, religion and ethnicities collapse as crowds of spectators walk around to admire the installations,” it said. As many as 36,946 community pujas are organised across the state every year. Of these, around 2,500 are held in Kolkata. In recent years, several organisations had urged UNESCO to recognise the festival. “Durga Puja occupies the heart of every Bengali. Mamata Banerjee has made the best efforts to promote the festival as a national event. She has given a grant of ₹50,000 to each of the clubs and also held the carnival. Her efforts and that of the puja organisers have succeeded,” senior Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said. State Bharatiya Janata Party vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said the UNESCO’s recognition was a gift for millions of Bengalis. “This is a recognition for a culture that has been inculcated and built over several centuries. The UNESCO has recognized the superlative emotion behind the celebrations,” he said. Yoga as an “ancient India practice” and the Kumbh Mela, considered the world’s largest congregation of religious pilgrims, were inscribed on the list in 2016 and 2017, respectively. India now has 14 intangible cultural heritage elements on the UNESCO list. 
16-12-2021||India||Time to review IPC section that says marital rape is not crime: Gujarat high court||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday agreed to consider the constitutional validity of the exception accorded to marital rape in the Indian Penal Code and issued notices to the Union and state governments on a public interest litigation challenging the controversial provision. Exception 2 to Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) says that sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife is not ‘rape’. “It is high time that a writ court undertakes the exercise of considering, whether the exception-2 to Section 375 of the IPC could be termed as manifestly arbitrary and makes a woman’s fundamental right to sexual autonomy subject to the whims of her husband,” observed a division bench of justices JB Pardiwala and Niral R Mehta.The bench issued notice to attorney general KK Venugopal, the state of Gujarat and additional solicitor general Devang Vyas.”Since the constitutional validity of exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC has been questioned, let notice be issued to the learned attorney general of India through the secretary, ministry of law and justice, New Delhi,” the bench said. The matter was posted for hearing on January 19, 2022.The order was passed on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Jaideep Bhanushankar Verma.The PIL argued that the provision was arbitrary, unreasonable, unconstitutional, violative of Articles 14 (equality before law), 15 (non-discrimination), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and liberty) of the Constitution, inherent human rights and constitutional morality.It also sought directions to the Gujarat Police to lodge FIRs in cases of marital rape.The petitioner’s advocate Salil M Thakore said by virtue of the exception to Section 375 of the IPC, “protections granted by law to a woman against forcible sexual intercourse is withdrawn and the wife forcibly surrenders her bodily integrity, sexual autonomy (the right to say no) and bodily privacy.”“It thus makes a woman’s fundamental right to sexual autonomy subject to the husband’s whims, as it treats women as subordinates of their husbands,” he argued.He argued that the said exception was “anachronistic to the Constitution, offensive to human dignity, manifestly arbitrary and incompatible with our constitutional morality by violating fundamental and inalienable rights which are otherwise inherent as recognised by the top court.”Thakore contended that the exception violated a woman’s “right to live with dignity, right to fair, dignified and humane treatment, right to personal liberty, right to sexual autonomy and bodily integrity, right to reproductive choices, right to privacy, right to not be subjected to confinement, right to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to protection against inhuman, violent and dangerous acts.”Thakore also pointed out that the exception effectively exempted the husband from punishment for even more grievous forms of rape otherwise punishable under Sections 376(2) and Section 376A (rape by public officials or separated husband).These exemptions against punishment thus include the acts of rape by a husband of his pregnant wife, a wife incapable of consenting or suffering from any disability, causing the wife bodily harm and endangering her life through it, and repeated rapes, it was argued.The advocate said the exception seemed to be based on the outdated and regressive colonial common law principle known as the doctrine of coverture.Under this doctrine, a married woman had no legal rights or autonomy of her own as these got subsumed by those of the husband. He submitted that coverture is incompatible with the Constitution which guarantees equality of man and woman.The exemption to marital rape under India’s criminal laws is controversial issue, and women’s groups have been demanding its scrapping for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-to-review-ipc-section-that-says-marital-rape-is-not-crime-gujarat-high-court-101639593822780.html
16-12-2021||India||Fluent, on front foot, Kohli blows lid off captaincy saga||Indian cricket has been in turmoil before: player vs player, player vs captain, captain vs coach, captain vs selector. But it plunged into a dramatic and unlikely crisis on Wednesday when Virat Kohli, the talisman of this generation, and until last month India’s sole captain across all three formats, stepped out of his crease determined to set the record straight. So what if his comments were in direct contradiction to those made by Sourav Ganguly, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).In a scheduled press interaction that started off in a frustratingly benign manner -- as pre-series media briefings often do -- Kohli, matter-of-factly but with the fluency usually seen in his batting, indicated that his version of events in the captaincy musical chairs between him and Rohit Sharma were in stark in contrast to those of Ganguly’s. And, perhaps more crucially, that he was treated by the Board in a manner that no one -- definitely not a player and captain with a record as impressive as his -- ought to be.Kohli made it clear that he was never persuaded to stay on at T20I skipper by anyone in the Board; that he did not say he was going to opt out of the ODI series in South Africa; and that his sacking as one-day captain was sudden and unceremonious -- during the fag end of a phone call with the selectors about 90 minutes before they were to pick the Indian team.“Whatever is said about the communication that happened when the decision (to quit T20I captainship) was made was inaccurate,” Kohli said, contradicting Ganguly’s claim on Sunday that he had personally reached out to Kohli and asked him to stay.“I told them that I wanted to continue leading in Tests and ODIs unless the office-bearers and selectors feel that I should not. My communication was clear to the BCCI and the decision was in their hands,” Kohli added. “I was contacted one-and-a-half hours before the selection meeting for the Test series on (December) 8th and there was no prior communication. The chief selector discussed with me the Test team to which we both agreed. And, before ending the call, I was told that the five selectors had decided that I would not be the ODI captain, to which I replied, ‘Okay fine’,” he then said about his being removed from the ODI captaincy.“And in the selection call afterwards, we chatted about it briefly. That is all that happened,” Kohli added, with an air of finality. This was very different from what Ganguly said on Sunday.“When Virat stepped down from T20I captainship, we had requested him not to step down. We had told him that we still consider him as captain and that he should not step down. But, obviously he was not very keen to continue,” the BCCI chief told several news channels and publications, including HT.When this was pointed to Kohli, though he did not name Ganguly, his reply was detailed and not devoid of irony: “I first approached the BCCI that these are my reasons why I want to quit T20I captainship and it was very well received,” he said. “There was no hesitation in the response and I was not told that you don’t give up T20 captainship. I was told it was a progressive step and in the right direction.” Ganguly, himself one of India’s most successful captains, and one who has been at the receiving end of opaqueness and intrigue by administrators, did not respond to queries from HT seeking comment. Kohli also stressed that he has no problem with Rohit Sharma, and made it a point to say that he values him as a team mate.“I have addressed this on many occasions that there is no problem between me and Rohit,” he said. “Honestly, I have got tired of clarifying this for the past two, two-and-half years. I can tell you that no action of mine or any of my communication will be to put the team down till I play.”Terming reports that he wanted to take a break from the ODIs in South Africa, ostensibly so that he would not have to play under Sharma as “lies”, Kohli said that he had never asked the BCCI for one. “My responsibility is to push the team in the right direction. Something that I have looked to do even before I became the captain. That mindset has never changed and will never change,” he said. The captaincy saga began on September 16, when Kohli announced the decision to step down as India’s T20 captain to manage his workload. Earlier this month, Rohit Sharma also replaced Kohli as ODI captain. The decision, according to the Indian board, was taken to ensure one captain in both white ball formats. Kohli said he did not have a problem with the decision. “We haven’t won ICC tournaments. I can understand the reasons. It was never a debate if the call was right or not,” he said. But it was the manner in which it was done, and the comments made after that to the media that he says were blatantly inaccurate, that had clearly perturbed him.Kohli has won 39 of 66 Tests as captain and scored 5,703 runs at an average of 55.36. In ODIs, he has racked up 5,449 runs at 72.65 in 95 matches as skipper with as many as 65 wins. In the shortest format, he registered 30 wins as captain from 50 games with a tally of 1,570 runs at 47.57. “It was handled very badly. We have seen in the past people learning of losing Indian captaincy on a flight. But for the way this issue was handled now, with a cricketer at the helm of affairs, is unfortunate,” Kirti Azad, former India selector and part of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, said. “Sourav should have remembered his own case; he was treated the same way. He should have made sure that the same should not happen to another captain. There have been icons before and there will be after Virat. But it should have been handled better. To tell Virat as an afterthought during a call that he is not the ODI captain is not done,” Azad added. Going forward, Azad had a word of caution for Kohli. “There was no media at our time. Now there is intense scrutiny. He will have to be careful now. If he doesn’t perform, they will sack him,” Azad said.
16-12-2021||India||Covid-19 and India’s youth workforce||Official data on India’s economy, such as the GDP, its consumption and sectoral component, and RBI’s Consumer Confidence Index suggest that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and recovery from it has been uneven. The first part of this series used data from the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey (CPHS) to show how the first two waves of Covid-19 affected household incomes. This second and final part uses the same survey to look at how the pandemic affected employment for different age groups. The analysis shows that the pandemic has worsened the employment situation for the young. This is worrying because higher rates of youth unemployment have plagued the Indian economy for the past few years. Even prior to the pandemic, unemployment was at 25% in the 15-23 years age group compared to 6% overall. Urgent measures are, therefore, needed to address a developing crisis that threatens the realisation of India’s demographic dividend.Young workers hardest hit during the lockdownData from CMIE-CPHS shows that young workers were the most affected in terms of a fall in employment rate during the 2020 lockdown. Relative to the pre-pandemic level (January 2020), the employment rate during the lockdown fell the sharpest for the 15-18 age group, followed by 19-20 age group, and 21-23 age group. This fall was relatively smaller for older workers.Not only were young workers the hardest hit in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, they have also been far slower in recovering from its shock. For workers aged 24 years and above, recovery was nearly complete by the end of 2020. They were also largely unscathed by the second wave in 2021. By August 2021, their employment rates were almost identical to pre-pandemic levels. For younger workers, by the end of 2020, the employment rate was less than three-quarters that of pre-pandemic level and a full recovery remained elusive even as of August .Almost all older workers back in employment, unaffected by the second waveAggregate employment rates disguise the flux in the labour market caused by the entry and exit of workers. The CMIE-CPHS data allows us to follow the same group of workers over time. The 2020 lockdown disproportionately impacted young workers, as documented in State of Working India 2021. Here, we track the trajectories of the pre-pandemic workers who lost work during the lockdown, and observe their employment during the month of April (at the onset of a second wave of the pandemic) and in August. This allows for four possible outcomes: sustained recovery, unstable recovery, delayed recovery, and no recovery. This categorisation is explained in Table 1.The age-biased recovery is apparent in the trajectories of workers of different age groups. The younger the worker, the less likely they were to recover from the loss of employment during the first lockdown. For instance, in the 27-30 age group, nine out of every 10 workers were back at work. In contrast, in the 21-23 years old age group, only five out of every 10 workers managed to recover employment. And, as reported earlier in the State of Working India 2021, young women workers were particularly vulnerable and unlikely to return to work.
16-12-2021||India||What we know about Omicron||Omicron appears to multiply 70 times faster than ancestral versions of the Sars-CoV-2 in a part of the human body known as the bronchus but less efficiently in the lungs, the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) said on Wednesday, citing work by its researchers that could explain why the new variant of concern (VOC) has an unprecedented transmission advantage.The new research, currently under peer review, was based on a lab study in which the scientists examined the way an isolated Omicron variant infected tissues taken from different parts of the respiratory tract, and compared it with similar experiments using other versions of the virus.Omicron replicated in the bronchus 70 times faster than the Delta and the ancestral variant, which may explain why it “transmits faster between humans”, HKUMed said in a statement. It also found that Omicron’s replication in the lungs was significantly less efficient – “more than 10 times lower” – which could explain the reduced disease severity being reported from some parts of the world, it added.The bronchus is a passageway in the lower respiratory tract that leads air into the lungs.One of the scientists involved cautioned against drawing premature conclusions about the variant being milder. ‘It is important to note that the severity of disease in humans is not determined only by virus replication but also by the host immune response to the infection, which may lead to dysregulation of the innate immune system, or “cytokine storm”,’ said Dr Michael Chan Chi-wai, associate professor of School of Public Health.He added that by being able to infect many more people, Omicron can lead to more cases of severe disease and death “even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic”.“Therefore, taken together with our recent studies showing that the Omicron variant can partially escape immunity from vaccines and past infection, the overall threat from Omicron variant is likely to be very significant.” The findings mirrored another study that found a significant difference in how the infection occurs at the cellular level, where Omicron is substantially more capable than its ancestors.Omicron (the researchers used an engineered version of the virus) was able to infect target cells containing what is known as the ACE-2 receptor substantially better than variants like Beta and Delta, found the second study, which was led by researchers from the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard.The newest VOC’s infectivity was two-fold higher than Delta’s and fourfold higher than the variant first seen in Wuhan.
16-12-2021||India||Officer battling for life after Rawat crash dies||Group Captain Varun Singh, the only man to have survived the December 8 Mi-17V5 chopper crash that killed 13 people including chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, breathed his last on Wednesday morning after putting up a brave, week-long fight against death.The 39-year-old died of burn injuries at the Air Force Command Hospital in Bengaluru, and is survived by his wife, Geetanjali Singh, and two children aged 11 and eight. The chances of his survival were grim from the beginning --- he suffered 95% burns --- but the entire country was hoping and praying for a miraculous recovery.He came from a military background.“IAF is deeply saddened to inform the passing away of braveheart Group Captain Varun Singh, who succumbed this morning to the injuries sustained in the helicopter accident. IAF offers sincere condolences and stands firmly with the bereaved family,” the Indian Air Force said in a statement.A top-notch pilot, Singh was flying in the ill-fated Russian-origin helicopter as a passenger. He had encountered a rare, life-threatening emergency aboard his fighter jet in October 2020, but his lightning reflexes and flying skills averted a crash. He was commissioned in the IAF as a fighter pilot in 2004.Tributes poured in for the group captain from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and several others.“Group Captain Varun Singh served the nation with pride, valour and utmost professionalism. I am extremely anguished by his passing away. His rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti,” the PM said.The defence minister, who was in touch with Singh’s family, said the untimely demise had pained him beyond words. “He was a true fighter who fought till his last breath. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and friends. We stand firmly with the family, in this hour of grief,” he added.Rawat was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) at Wellington to deliver a talk when the Mi-17V5 crashed near Coonoor. It took off from the Sulur air base at 11.48am, and was scheduled to land in Wellington at 12.15pm. But the air traffic control at Sulur lost contact with the helicopter at 12.08pm when it was just seven minutes from destination.Singh was directing staff (air) at DSSC and the CDS’s liaison officer for the visit.He was a test pilot and had flown several fighter aircraft in the IAF’s combat fleet. Just four months ago, on August 15, Singh was awarded Shaurya Chakra, India’s third-highest peacetime gallantry medal, for exceptional courage and remarkable presence of mind in handling a rare mid-air emergency involving the locally built Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA).The standard operating procedure required him to me to eject and abandon the aircraft. “However, I took a few calculated risks and managed to land without any damage to either the aircraft or civilians,” he later said.The award was a deserved recognition of his heroism in the cockpit of what then seemed to be a doomed fighter aircraft. If it were not for Singh’s brave efforts and his decision not to bail out, the aircraft would have become the first LCA to crash.On October 12, 2020, Singh , then a wing commander, was on an LCA test sortie when sudden loss of cockpit pressurisation at high altitude triggered some nerve-racking moments.It was a life-or-death situation but he prevailed and went on to land the plane. “There was rapid loss of altitude, with the aircraft pitching up and down viciously. Despite being in extreme physical and mental stress in a life-threatening situation, he maintained exemplary composure and regained control of the aircraft, thereby exhibiting exceptional flying skills,” the Shaurya Chakra citation said.“He displayed extraordinary courage and skill to safely land the fighter aircraft. The pilot went beyond the call of duty and landed the aircraft taking calculated risks. This allowed an accurate analysis of the fault on the indigenously designed fighter and further institution of preventive measures against recurrence,” the citation added.A month after he was awarded Shaurya Chakra, Singh wrote a warm letter to his school principal with a request that his message be shared with the students of Army Public School in Chandimandir.The message was deep.“It is okay to be mediocre…Whatever you work towards, be dedicated, do your best... Never lose hope, never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be,” he wrote.“If I am able to inspire even one child to believe in himself/herself, I would have achieved my objective of writing this letter.”He has inspired millions of Indians in life and death.

16-12-2021||India||Government reviews oxygen supply amid Omicron concerns||The central government on Wednesday reviewed the commissioning, installation and functional status of oxygen supply equipment supplied by it to states and Union territories, and asked them to conduct mock drills to ensure full functionality of all oxygen-related equipment, people familiar with the matter said.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Wednesday held a meeting with states and UTs to review the status and preparedness regarding medical oxygen devices and systems (pressure swing adsorption plants, liquid medical oxygen plants, oxygen concentrators, medical gas pipeline system), through a video conference. “Medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and its uninterrupted supply in sufficient quantity is of critical importance to tackle the pandemic,” Bhushan said, while addressing states and UTs.As part of the preparedness exercise to deal with any surge in cases due to the heavily mutated Omicron variant of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19, states were asked to review and monitor the status of equipment on a daily basis to ensure that the gap between the gadgets and systems delivered to the districts and installed at the healthcare facilities is reduced to zero.In the mock drill, states have been asked to ensure that the oxygen with the required quantity, pressure and purity reaches the patients at their bedside. The health ministry has directed states to complete these drills by the end of December. The report to this effect is to be submitted to the health ministry through designated portals.
16-12-2021||India||Gurugram namaz issue: Faith and public spaces, through the eyes of Indian courts||A controversy has been brewing in Gurugram over Friday namaz in public spaces. The last few weeks have seen aggressive protests by Hindu groups nearly every Friday; an administration that has been slow to respond; and a weekly law and order issue. The state government and district administration initially granted approval for namaz at certain designated sites, only to withdraw it later amid protests.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said last week that offering namaz in public places could not be “tolerated”. To be sure, this is not the first time Khattar has spoken in this vein. In 2018, the Haryana CM said that namaz should be offered at mosques, idgahs or other designated places, rather than public spaces.The Gurgaon Muslim Council on Monday responded that they are readying a petition to be filed in the Supreme Court later this week against the alleged vigilantism and the prohibition against namaz in public spaces. Before Gurugram, Noida in Uttar Pradesh, another state ruled by the BJP, prevented Muslims in December 2018 from offering namaz at public parks without prior permission.These developments make it pertinent to understand the legal intricacies involved in the debate and the approach of the constitutional courts.What is a public road and public space?In Saghir Ahmad vs State of Uttar Pradesh, 1955, the Supreme Court defined the characteristics of a public road: “The true position then is, that all public streets and roads vest in the State, but that the State holds them as trustees on behalf of the public. Members of the public are entitled as beneficiaries to use them as a matter of right and this right is limited only by the similar rights possessed by every other citizen to use the pathways. The State as trustees on behalf of the public is entitled to impose all such limitations on the character and extent of the user, as may be requisite for protecting the rights of the public generally.”In Sodan Singh Vs New Delhi Municipal Committee, 1989, the Supreme Court said the primary object of building roads is undoubtedly to facilitate people to travel from one point to another. Quoting Byron K Elliott and William F Elliott, the top court noted that a way over land set apart for public travel in a town or city is a street, no matter by what name it may be called. If a way is free to all people, it is a highway.Various state-specific legislations and municipal laws also define “public street”, “public road” and “public space” for the purposes of administration.One interesting example would be the liquor prohibition law in Bihar that includes a vehicle within the remit of a “public place”. Therefore, a person can be prosecuted for consuming alcohol inside a vehicle or even being found drunk in a car.The Supreme Court, in Satvinder Singh Saluja & Ors vs State of Bihar, 2019, affirmed the Bihar government’s excise law as it declined to quash charges against four Rotarians from Jharkhand, who while travelling from Giridih to Patna in 2016 in a vehicle were subjected to a breath analyser test and were found to have consumed alcohol.“When a private vehicle is passing through a public road it cannot be accepted that the public have no access. It is true that the public may not have access to private vehicles as a matter of right but definitely the public have the opportunity to approach the private vehicle while it is on the public road,” held the top court.In April this year, the Delhi high court took a cue from this SC judgment when it ruled that a vehicle is a “public place” and hence, the wearing of a mask is mandatory even while driving alone in a car.Constitutional rightsArticle 19 (1)(a) lays down that all citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression while subclause (b) gives the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. Article 19(1)(c) affirms the citizens’ right to form associations or unions.The Supreme Court in Babulal Parate vs State of Maharashtra, 1969, said that the right of citizens to take out processions or to hold public meetings flows from the right in Article 19(1) (b) and the right to move anywhere in the territory of India.In 1972, a Constitution bench, in Himat Lal K Shah vs Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad, ruled that the right that flows from Article 19(1) is not a right to hold a meeting at any place, at any time.In this verdict, the five-judge bench held, “We may make it clear that there is nothing wrong in requiring previous permission to be obtained before holding a public meeting on a public street, for the right which flows from Article 19 (1) (b) is not a right to hold a meeting at any place and time. It is a right which can be regulated in the interest of all so that all can enjoy the right.” The top court concluded in this ruling that “in India a citizen had, before the Constitution, a right to hold meetings on public streets subject to the control of the appropriate authority regarding the time and place of the meeting and subject to considerations of public order.”Article 25 of the Constitution maintains that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality and health. Apart from the caveats mentioned above, the provision adds that the State shall still be entitled to regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice.Similarly, Article 26 entitles every religious denomination to manage its own affairs in matters of religion but this right is also subject to public order, morality and health.Courts and use of public spacesA series of rulings starting from the Privy Council’s decisions may come handy to refer to the development of the law in India.In 1882, in Parthasaradiayyangar vs Chinnakrishna Ayyangar, it was held that people are “entitled to conduct religious processions through public streets so that they do not interfere with the ordinary use of such streets by the public and subject to such directions as the magistrate may lawfully give to prevent obstruction of the thoroughfare or breaches of the public peace”.In early 1950s, the Privy Council held in Manzur Hasan vs Muhammed Zaman: “In India, there is a right to conduct a religious procession with its appropriate observances through a public street so that it does not interfere with the ordinary use of the street by the public, and subject to lawful directions by the magistrates.”Later, in the Saghir Ahmad judgment of 1955, the Supreme Court maintained that people are entitled as beneficiaries to use public roads and streets as a matter of right but this right is limited by the similar rights possessed by every other citizen to use them. The top court added that the State is empowered to impose all reasonable limitations for protecting the rights of the public generally.In Railway Board vs Niranjan Singh, 1969, the Supreme Court described the fetters on the right to hold meetings or any other gathering in government premises. “The fact that the citizens of this country have freedom of speech, freedom to assemble peaceably and freedom to form associations or unions does not mean that they can exercise those freedoms in whatever place they please,” it asserted.In Himat Lal K Shah, the five-judge bench reiterated that the right that flows from Article 19(1) is not a right to hold a meeting at any place, at any time. The top court concluded in this ruling that “in India a citizen had, before the Constitution, a right to hold meetings on public streets subject to the control of the appropriate authority regarding the time and place of the meeting and subject to considerations of public order”.Similarly, the Supreme Court in Olga Tellis and Ors Vs Bombay Municipal Corporation, 1986, held, “Footpaths or pavements are public properties which are intended to serve the convenience of the general public. They are not laid for private use and indeed their use for a private purpose frustrates the very object for which they are carved out from portions of public streets.”On balancing the rights of those who wish to use a public space for a particular purpose against another group that complain of violation of their right to use it, the apex court said in the Sodan Singh case that the liberty of one individual comes to an end where the liberty of another begins. “What is required of him is that he should not create an unreasonable obstruction which may inconvenience other persons having similar right to pass and he should not make excessive use of the road to the prejudice of the others.”In M Ismail Faruqui Vs Union of India and Others, 1995, the apex court held that a mosque is not an essential part of the practice of the religion of Islam and namaz by Muslims can be offered anywhere, even in the open, as it ruled that the power of acquisition is available to the State for a mosque like any other place of worship of any religion. At the same time, the court said that the right to worship, guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution of India, does not extend to the right of worship at “any and every place”. “The right to worship is not at any and every place, so long as it can be practised effectively, unless the right to worship at a particular place is itself an integral part of that right,” it said.In 2009, the Supreme Court in Union of India vs State of Gujarat, cracked the whip on unauthorised religious structures. “No unauthorised construction shall be carried out or permitted in the name of temple, church, mosque or gurudwara etc on public streets, public parks or other public places etc,” it ordered.More recently, the Bombay High Court, in Mahesh Vijay Bedekar Vs State of Maharashtra, 2015, held that public streets are essentially provided for people to walk and ply vehicles and they have a right to use them. Circumscribing the powers of municipal bodies, the high court held that local authorities cannot grant permission for temporary erection of a booth and any other such structure on any street on occasions of ceremonies and festivals if it is likely to affect free movement of vehicular traffic or obstruct free movement of the pedestrians. Additionally, the high court said that municipal bodies of commissioners/district magistrates can give such permissions only after the police agree to such temporary structures after taking into account the law and order situation. The high court further directed the municipal corporations to frame a policy for dealing with grants of such permissions.In 2018, the apex court came across a question as to whether public premises and parks can be used for performing ‘Ram Leela’, ‘Mata Ki Chowki,’ and implicitly, other religious functions. The issue arose following a decision of the National Green Tribunal denying permission to hold a ‘jagran’ (overnight prayer meeting) and ‘Mata Ki Chowki’ at a park in Delhi. A two-judge bench referred the matter to a larger bench, noting: “The appeal raises a question of great constitutional importance as to whether such activities can be allowed in state owned premises in view of our Constitution being secular in nature.”While the case was referred to a three-judge bench, there has been no effective hearing of the case after July 2018.Three years on, the legal debate concerning legality of religious activities in state-owned properties, like a public park, is set to be revived again with the Gurgaon Muslim Council planning to approach the Supreme Court over namaz issue. Even as the 2018 case is yet to come up for its first hearing, a direct judgment by the apex court on a fresh legal challenge would go a long way in settling the law on the contentious issues, besides defining the ambit of executive’s powers in such matters.
16-12-2021||India||SC junks Maharashtra's plea to make 2011 caste census data public||The caste census conducted in 2011 will continue to remain under wraps. The Supreme Court on Wednesday accepted the Union government’s stand that it is “unusable” on account of inaccuracies in its data, and dismissed the Maharashtra government’s plea to make it public.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar rejected the Maharashtra government’s argument that it has a right to access the information collected in the 2011 caste census even if the Centre claimed the data could not be relied upon for any constitutional or statutory exercise such as reservations in admissions, promotions or local body elections.“The fact remains that the affidavit by the Union government says that the data collated is unusable. If that is the stand of the Union, we fail to understand how a mandamus can be issued to permit Maharashtra to use that data for any purpose. Such direction, if given, will lead to more confusion and uncertainty which cannot be countenanced,” the bench held in its order.It also took on record a statement made by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that the 2011 caste census was not carried out as per the Census Act, 1948 but was a one-time measure, and therefore, the Maharashtra government could not rely upon the provisions of the law to seek data.Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for the state government, sought to impress upon the bench that irrespective of the quality of data, the state had a right in a democracy to access the caste census and thereafter, it could decide on whether or not to use it for the purposes of making reservation.Naphade sought to point out that on the one hand, the state is bound by the Supreme Court judgment to first collect data before making reservations in local body elections for other backward classes (OBCs) but on the other, the Union government has been refusing to part with the information it has.Mehta, rebutting this submission, emphasised that the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, was not made public because it was found to be flawed, and was bound to mislead. “...This data is useless and it cannot help anyone. Please, don’t order us to furnish raw data to the state,” Mehta said. He added that the state could instead have appointed a commission to gather empirical data on castes and classes for making reservation suitably.Responding, Naphade reiterated the Maharashtra government’s demand for accessing the data under its right to know in a democracy, particularly since enumeration was done following a decision of the Union cabinet.The bench retorted: “We will not be a party to any order that will create more confusion especially when we are dealing with public representatives being elected. It is better to conduct polls without any reservation in such a case. You have set up a commission to collect data. Take that exercise forward and take it to a logical conclusion. And in the next election, you would be able to do something for the backward classes. But we cannot pass an order that is bound to create more uncertainty.”When Naphade said the state could vet the data for errors, the bench replied: “How can you decide? You haven’t done this enumeration. You better do your own enumeration. You are going into area which is impermissible. We don’t know which constitutional principle we can invoke to allow your request when the Union is saying this data is unusable.”The 2011 caste census, during the United Progressive Alliance government, was the first caste-based census since the 1931 census of India. It was conducted along with the 2011 census. The first census was conducted in 1881, and since then, the exercise has been conducted every 10 years. The 2021 census was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and it is now expected to take place in February 2022.The order came on a petition by the Maharashtra government, asking for the release of the 2011 caste census data for implementing 27% reservation for OBCs under the Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act.
16-12-2021||India||Cold wave to hit north in next two days, says IMD||Cold wave conditions are likely to set in over Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan and Chandigarh between December 18 and 20, the India Meteorological Department said. Light to moderate rainfall or snow is likely over the western Himalayan region for the next three days, it added.This, the Met said, is because a western disturbance seen as a cyclonic circulation is forming over Jammu & neighbourhood, while a fresh western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation is lying over Afghanistan and neighbouring areas. Under their influence, light to moderate rainfall or snowfall is likely at isolated places in Jammu, Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh during next three days, and in Uttarakhand on December 16-17, and isolated light rainfall is likely in northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh on December 16.“We are expecting light and scattered rainfall over parts of northwest India on December 16 and 17. Temperatures are likely to drop after December 17. As of today dense fog is expected only over Punjab but we are monitoring fog development over Delhi also,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the national weather forecasting centre.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree Celsius in the plains. According to IMD, light to moderate rainfall at isolated or scattered places is very likely in Tamilnadu-Puducherry-Karaikal, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and isolated rainfall is likely in Kerala-Mahe during next five days. Dry weather is very likely over remaining parts of the country over this period, and the minimum temperature in northwest and central India is likely to fall by 2-3 degrees in the coming days, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-to-hit-north-in-next-two-days-says-imd-101639593398016.html

Their samples were sent for genome testing and results are awaited. “All eight of them have shown S Gene drop. All of them have a mild infection,” Subramanian said. The co-passenger is a resident of Chennai. They are being treated at Chennai’s King Institute. “There is an apprehension that all eight of them could have Omicron,” said.Tamil Nadu has made elaborate arrangements for surveillance of the Omicron variant. On November 29, the state decided to use Thermo Fischer TaqPath Assay at 12 RT-PCR government labs to detect the S gene drop, which is a marker of probable Omicron infection as per the recommendations of the WHO. The four international airports in Tamil Nadu are conducting RT-PCR tests for passengers from high-risk countries on arrival. They cannot leave the airport until the results are released so airports have been asked to make arrangements for the comfort of passengers. If they are positive, they will be sent to government hospitals and if they test negative, they have to quarantine at home for a week and repeat the RT-PCR test on the eighth day. The samples will be sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for genome sequencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-from-nigeria-who-arrived-in-chennai-is-tn-s-first-omicron-patient-101639593217941.html

In the minute-long clip, which was widely circulated on social media, the minister is heard shouting at the journalist to stop recording him.“Don’t ask questions like a fool. Have you lost your mental balance (’Dimag kharab hai kya’)?” he was heard as purportedly saying in Hindi. “What do you want to know? You turned an innocent person into an accused. Aren’t you ashamed?” He was also heard calling the journalist “chor”, or thief, and angrily asking the reporter to switch off his mobile phone.The minister was in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday to inaugurate an oxygen plant at a child care centre. He visited his son in jail on Tuesday. He wasn’t available for comment. HT couldn’t independently verify the authenticity of the video clip.The video clip stirred a political row. “The video showcases desperation of both the Union minister as well as the party which is shielding him,” UP Congress spokesperson Zishan Haider said. A delegation of local journalists from print and electronic media called on district magistrate Mahendra Bahadur Singh and handed over a memorandum to be forwarded to the President of India. In their memorandum, they demanded action against the minister and sought the safety of journalists.“I can’t comment because I haven’t seen it. But as far as the case goes, the investigating agencies are on it,” UP BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajay-kumar-mishra-loses-temper-over-question-on-jailed-son-calls-journalist-thief-101639593099378.html
16-12-2021||India||1971 was Indira Gandhi’s finest year, says Sonia Gandhi||Addressing the closing ceremony of celebrations of Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who played a pivotal role in the war, would have wanted the party to celebrate “not in a boastful spirit or in a spirit of self-glorification, but in a spirit of reflection and resolve”, an apparent jibe at the Centre.Gandhi described 1971 as Indira’s “finest year” and urged the party to reaffirm “our steadfast commitment to the values she cherished, and the causes she fought for – and ultimately sacrificed her life for.”Gandhi lauded the armed forces, the people of Bangladesh and said, “It was this extraordinary convergence of a well-planned and perfectly-executed political, diplomatic and military strategy that gave 1971- a distinctive place in the history of the sub-continent. It was a history that reshaped geography as well.”In her speech, she described how Indira Gandhi mobilized international support, “remained supremely composed and confident drawing upon her immense reserve of inner strength” and reached out to all party leaders.In her speech, Sonia also mentioned the then patchy relationship between the US and India and said, “Indira ensured that the USSR was with India. She travelled tirelessly to Western capitals. She sensitized the entire world community to the cause of the people of Bangladesh with personal interviews, meetings and appeals. And how can we ever forget the manner in which she stood up with the greatest fortitude to the crass insensitivity and crude bullying of the then President of the United States and some of his advisers and did India proud.”The Congress president also described her late mother-in-law as “an inspiration to crores of Indians for her boldness and for her resilience” and narrated how Indira “continues to evoke admiration for her fierce determination to make India self-reliant, especially in agriculture, nuclear energy and space technology, for her commitment to the cause of ecological protection, and for her sensitivity to the concerns of far-flung areas of our country and for its disadvantaged sections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1971-was-indira-gandhi-s-finest-year-says-sonia-101639593097745.html
16-12-2021||India||Bilateral cooperation with Bangladesh focus of President Kovind’s talks||Measures to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from green technology to connectivity, enhanced border management and the status of Bangladesh’s Hindu minority figured in President Ram Nath Kovind’s discussions with the Bangladeshi leadership on Wednesday. Kovind is on a three-day visit to Bangladesh at the invitation of his counterpart Abdul Hamid to represent India at celebrations marking the neighbouring country’s 50th Victory Day on Thursday. This is also his first foreign visit since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Kovind met Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and foreign minister AK Abdul Momen hours after arriving in Dhaka. The two countries have achieved an “incredible amount of synergies” in areas such as connectivity and joint manufacturing and their close cooperation has helped resolve “intractable issues in the most amicable manner”, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla told a media briefing in Dhaka while talking about the president’s interactions with the Bangladeshi leadership. India and Bangladesh are now looking at ways to step up cooperation in new areas such as green technologies, renewables, and IT and digital platforms that can enhance employment for the youth, he said. “We are two countries that mutually reinforce each other...and that message was there,” he added. Responding to a question on whether the status of Bangladesh’s Hindu community and security concerns related to the border had figured in the meetings, Shringla indicated that both issues had been discussed. Without directly referring to the Hindu minority, Shringla said he couldn’t go into details because of the confidentiality attached to the meetings. “Obviously, those discussions did include issues that are important to both countries and it included questions that are topical for both countries. Needless to say, we are on the same page on most of these issues. “We do appreciate that certain issues are internal matters for Bangladesh but they are important for both countries, the handling of these issues has been, in many senses, very satisfactory. We do believe that whatever actions are being taken are those in the best interests of...both our countries,” he added. In October, India had expressed concern after Durga Puja pandals and temples at several places in Bangladesh were vandalised by mobs following posts on social media about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a pandal. Bangladeshi authorities acted swiftly by cracking down on those responsible for the violence. Shringla said the two sides had discussed the border issue briefly and more talks would be held when the head of India’s Border Security Force visits Dhaka on December 19. Both sides will work out the “best measures” to tackle any existing issues, he added. Bangladesh has expressed concern at the killing of some of its citizens in incidents of firing by Indian border guards, and the issue has figured in several meetings between the two sides in recent years. Shringla said economic cooperation had grown even amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with two-way trade increasing by 14% increase even as Bangladesh’s exports crossed the $1-billion mark. The two sides are discussing a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA), which needs to be finalised as quickly as possible to continue preferential access for goods he said. The protocol for duty-free access for Bangladeshi products under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) regime will no longer be in place after the country’s graduating from least developed country (LDC) status and there is a need for an alternative framework under a CEPA, he said. One-third of India’s total lines of credit has gone to Bangladesh, which has received some $10 billion under highly concessional terms, and the two sides are working on another package of assistance. The Indo-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, which will transport high-speed diesel from the Numaligarh refinery in Assam to Parbatipur in Bangladesh, is progressing well will be inaugurated next year. India’s new cross-border power trade policy allows the country to be used as a transit point for the exchange of power between its neighbours, and there are no regulatory issues that will come in the way of Bangladesh’s efforts to purchase power from Nepal or Bhutan, Shringla said. Several defence items have also been identified and are being fast-tracked under a $500-million line of credit extended to Bangladesh in the defence sector. “We will see the exports of certain defence items from India coming to Bangladesh,” Shringla said, adding India is keen on enhancing cooperation in areas such as training, military exchanges and joint manufacturing in defence. 
16-12-2021||India||Uncanny link between deaths of two heroes||An uncanny parallel between the passing away of Group Captain Varun Singh and Lance Naik Hanumanthappa Koppad, who was killed along with nine others on the Siachen glacier five years ago, emerged on Wednesday. Their brave fight against death lasted around a week as the country prayed for a miracle on both occasions. Both were sole survivors. Both were in their 30s. And both their families were hoping against hope that they would defeat death. Both will be remembered. Koppad survived six days buried under an avalanche in Siachen in February 2016 before he died at the Army Hospital (Research and Referral) in Delhi. Singh passed away on Wednesday at the Air Force Command Hospital in Bengaluru after a weeklong brave fight against death. Koppad was among 10 soldiers who were swept away by an ice wall on February 3, 2016, while guarding the Sonam post located at 20,500 feet. The 33-year-old was from 19 Madras. Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the nation in paying homage to both Koppad and Singh. “He leaves us sad and devastated. RIP Lance Naik Hanumanthappa. The soldier in you remains immortal. Proud that martyrs like you served India,” Modi then said in a tweet. Group Captain Singh was the only man to have survived the December 8 Mi-17V5 chopper crash that killed 13 people, including the chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat. He was 39. “Group Captain Varun Singh served the nation with pride, valour and utmost professionalism. I am extremely anguished by his passing away. His rich service to the nation will never be forgotten. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti,” the PM wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The chopper crash sent shock waves through the Indian military establishment, has been dubbed a devastating setback for the ongoing military reforms and raised questions about succession in the armed forces.
16-12-2021||India||Average student to ace pilot: Group Captain who broke all barriers||Group Captain Varun Singh, fondly called Vroom, was mediocre in class, lacked self-confidence in school, and never excelled in sports and extracurricular activities. Singh later became one of the Indian Air Force’s finest test pilots, he was shortlisted for the country’s first crewed spaceflight, won a Shaurya Chakra, and was a top-notch flying instructor. He was clearly a late bloomer. Singh grew up loving all things aviation but discovered that his life’s true passion was flying only after landing up at the Air Force Academy near Hyderabad in 2003, three years after undergoing gruelling military training at the National Defence Academy. He was commissioned as a fighter pilot in 2004. There was no looking back after that for Singh, who was from a tri-service family --- his father, Colonel KP Singh, retired from the Corps of Army Air Defence, his brother, Commander Tanuj Singh, is in the Indian Navy, and his uncle, Colonel RP Singh, was from 5 Rajput. “In IAF, Varun excelled in whatever he did. I am not exaggerating when I say he had the Midas touch. He was a down-to-earth man and a hell of a fighter pilot. It’s hard to believe he’s gone,” said an IAF pilot who grew up with the officer. Singh was on the first list of 12 candidates shortlisted in 2019 for India’s first crewed spaceflight, Gaganyaan. He could not make it to the final list due to a medical requirement. He encountered a rare, life-threatening emergency aboard his Tejas light combat aircraft in October 2020, but his lightning reflexes and flying skills averted a crash. Just four months ago, on August 15, Singh was awarded Shaurya Chakra, India’s third-highest peacetime gallantry medal, for exceptional courage and remarkable presence of mind in handling the unprecedented emergency and safely landing the plane. Earlier in his career, he volunteered for the prestigious experimental test pilot course and came out on top after a rigourous four-tier selection process that eliminates even the best of pilots. Only seven of the 59 fighter aces made the final cut. At the time of his untimely demise, he was holding the coveted post of directing staff (air) at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington. “Varun was a fighter pilot with the heart of a fighter. He fought death for a week. He was valiant in life and death,” said another IAF officer. Among the tributes that poured in, the one from the Supreme Commander of India’s armed forces aptly summed up his last days. “Sad to learn that Group Captain Varun Singh breathed his last after putting up a valiant fight for life. Though badly injured in the chopper crash, he displayed the soldierly spirit of valour and indomitable courage. The nation is grateful to him. My condolences to his family,” President Ram Nath Kovind wrote on Twitter. Perhaps nothing reveals more about Varun’s personality and character than a warm letter he wrote to his school principal from his office desk at Wellington on September 18, 2021, a month after being awarded Shaurya Chakra. The four-page letter, which went viral after the December 8 Mi-17V5 crash, was replete with gratitude and inspiration. It was in praise of his teachers who guided him to achieve greater heights. “The honour I have been bestowed is the result of my grooming over the years starting from school. I still hold my teachers in the highest esteem and thank them for where I am in my life and career,” wrote Singh, who finished schooling from Army Public School in Chandimandir in 2000. His message to the students struck a chord. “Not everyone will excel at school and not everyone will be able to score in the 90s. If you do, it’s an amazing achievement and must be applauded. However, if you don’t, do not think you are meant to be mediocre…Find your calling, it could be art, music, graphic design, literature etc,” he wrote. The words in that letter may now inspire them to don the fighter overalls. Like their old boy, Group Captain Varun Singh.
16-12-2021||India||Govt working fast on new CDS appointment to keep reforms on track||The government is working fast on appointing a new chief of defence staff (CDS) after the untimely demise of General Bipin Rawat in a Mi-17V5 chopper crash last week to ensure that the ongoing military reforms are not slowed down, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The first indication of this priority came from defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday.The minister said integration of the armed forces to enhance their effectiveness and reshape the conduct of future operations would progress seamlessly, and achieving the target of jointness will be a top priority for the government.Leadership vacuum is never good, said one of the officials cited above.Rawat, who was killed in the crash along with 13 others, was spearheading the theaterisation drive to best utilise the military’s resources for future wars. Singh’s comments indicated that the current vacuum created by Rawat’s passing will not hit India’s theaterisation plans.Such appointments should never be left vacant as ambiguity is the biggest enemy of the governing mechanism in any set up, said military affairs expert Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd), who headed a committee that presented its report on enhancing the military’s combat potential to the government in 2016.“I was not only hoping but reasonably confident that the government would immediately appoint an officiating CDS to steer the ongoing reforms and look into emerging security challenges,” he said.According to a key recommendation made by the 11-member Shekatkar panel, the government should choose the CDS from among the three service chiefs.The defence minister said the process of “integration and modernisation of tri-services” was initiated with the creation of the post of CDS and the department of military affairs (DMA), and it will be carried forward to achieve the goals as early as possible.Rawat took over as CDS on December 31, 2019, after serving as army chief for a full three-year term. As CDS, he wore multiple hats --- he was the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), headed DMA, and was the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.All eyes are now on who will be appointed as Rawat’s successor at a time when the theaterisation plan is at a critical juncture and needs a man with matching vision to carry it forward.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane became the senior-most military officer in the country after Rawat’s demise. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari and navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar are both around two years junior to him.There is a strong possibility of Naravane being named as the new CDS if the government follows the seniority principle, as previously reported. Army vice chief Lieutenant General CP Mohanty and Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi, who are both course mates, are the senior-most officers in the army after Naravane.Naravane is due for retirement next April but that may not happen in the changed circumstances. Many in the security establishment believe that the first two or three CDS appointments should be from the army as the security challenges the country faces are along the borders with China and Pakistan.However, making top appointments is the government’s prerogative. The possibility of deep selection cannot be ruled out as was done when Rawat was appointed army chief almost five years back. He superseded two top generals — Lieutenant Generals Praveen Bakshi and PM Hariz.The Indian Air Force has already begun a probe into the CDS chopper crash, and plans to complete it swiftly. Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, who is the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the IAF’s Bengaluru-based Training Command, is heading the tri-service probe. He has defied death multiple times in his 39-year long military career, including once during one of the gravest emergencies in IAF history involving a Russian-origin Mi-17V5 helicopter.At this point, it is not clear what went wrong with the helicopter in the final moments of the crash though the weather in the area where it went down did not have good visibility.Search crews last week recovered the helicopter’s black box that could give vital clues about what went wrong.

The matter was posted for hearing on January 19, 2022.The order was passed on a PIL filed by Jaideep Bhanushankar Verma, arguing the provision was arbitrary, unreasonable, unconstitutional, violative of Articles 14 (equality before law), 15 (non-discrimination), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 21 (protection of life and liberty) of the Constitution, inherent human rights and constitutional morality||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-time-gujarat-high-court-to-review-law-that-says-marital-rape-isn-t-crime-101639584756183.html
